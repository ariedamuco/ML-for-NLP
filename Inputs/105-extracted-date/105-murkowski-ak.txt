Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with my colleagues. Implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments is creating a real need to develop clean alternative fuels. 
For example, of the 64 remaining U.S. coke batteries, 58 are subject to closure as a result of the Clean Air Act. The steel industry can either use limited capital to build new clean coking facilities or they can choose to import coke from China, which uses 50 year old highly pollutant technologies. Restoring the Section 29 credit to encourage cleaner coker technologies will greatly reduce emissions and will slow our increasing dependence on foreign coke, at the same time creating jobs in the United States in both the steel and coal mining industries. 
In addition, the United States has rich deposits of lignite and sub-bituminous coals. There are new technologies that can upgrade these coals to make them burn efficiently and economically, while at the same time significantly reducing air pollution. 
This is proven technology, but to make the development of this technology throughout the nation feasible, the Congress needs to provide tax incentives.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to further clarify that the language in the legislative report that accompanied S. 2237 with respect to energy efficiency codes and standards was not intended to conflict with existing laws. This issue was debated thoroughly when the Congress passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in 1975, and again in the debate over the 1992 Energy Policy Act. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from seven of my colleagues expressing concern over this language.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. During past consideration of this issue, the majority of Congress determined that energy consumed at the point of use can be measured, projected and extrapolated with greater accuracy than data based on subjective estimates of externalities, such as emissions, and `source energy.' This determination is clearly reflected in the authorizing statute, 42 USCS Section 6291, which defines `energy use' as `the quantity of energy directly consumed by a consumer product at point of use, determined in accordance with test procedures under section 323 (42USCS Sec. 6293).' Any substantive change in existing law and policy should only be undertaken after careful consideration by the authorizing committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
With respect to the Federal Energy Management Program, another program potentially affected by this language, 42 USCS 8253 and Executive Orders 12759 and 12902, which relate to improvement in energy efficiency in federal buildings, stating that `each agency shall apply energy conservation measures to, and shall improve the design for the construction of, its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year 1995 is at least 10 percent less that the energy consumption per gross square foot of its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year 1985. . . .' 
The June 1996 policy statement of the Federal Intergency Energy Policy Committee interprets these authorities as encouraging cost-effective energy projects that results in `operational cost savings,' regardless of whether that consumption is measured on a site basis or a source basis. While this allows the goal of reduced energy consumption to be demonstrated by source or site analysis, saving taxpayer dollars is retained as its primary criteria for projects. A change to consideration of externalities and `source energy efficiency' over direct cost savings would be a major change that should also be undertaken only after thorough analysis of its impact by the authorizing committee. 
I understand the concern that the Department could improve the analytical methods that are used to calculate `source' energy efficiency, which would give consideration to the full panoply of costs involved in using various appliances and making other energy efficiency decisions. Under the authorizing statute, the Department may make an effort to reduce the subjectivity involved in making the estimates necessary to make `source energy' calculations. 
This work can be taken into account as the appropriate authorizing committees consider changes in our existing national policy. Until that time, the existing statutes are the law of the land.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my good friend from New York, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator D'Amato, is correct. I have introduced a bill, S. 2537, to amend the Export-Import Bank's environmental provisions. The bill does two things. First, it directs the Ex-Im Bank to negotiate a multi-lateral agreement with the export financing agencies of all G-7 countries to address environmentally sensitive development overseas. Second, until such agreement is reached, my legislation would ensure that U.S. companies have access to Ex-Im Bank financing of overseas projects where other G-7 countries are providing or have indicated an intent to provide financing to the project in question without conditioning such assistance on environmental policies or procedures. The net effect of this law is to impose unilateral sanctions on U.S. companies in the name of the environment. 
I had intended to discuss this legislation as part of Senate action on trade issues, because the issue here is trade and competition. This year, however, trade legislation may only be adopted as part of the omnibus spending bill, or not at all.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today is a historic day for the Congress, the National Park Service and the American people. After two years of intense negotiations, hearings from coast to coast, and a great deal of hard work I am pleased to inform my colleagues that we have National Park Service Reform. 
More importantly, after eight years of disagreement, and as part of the National Park Service reform package, we have achieved victory; we have come together in true bi-partisan fashion, and we have reformed the management and administration of concession operations in the National Park Service System. 
Under this legislation, and in addition to concession reform, we have provided the National Park Service with increased opportunities, in cooperation with colleges and universities, to conduct scientific research in our parks so that in future years resource management decisions can be based more on sound science as opposed to emotion and guess work. 
We direct the Secretary of the Interior to develop a comprehensive training program for employees in all professional careers in the work force of the National Park Service to ensure that personnel have the best, up-to-date knowledge, skills and abilities with which to manage, interpret and protect the resources of the National Park System. 
As we all know the management and administration of parks is becoming more complex. We require managers who are fully prepared to take on the challenges that the next century will offer. The Secretary is directed to develop a training program which will ensure that future park managers will come from the cream of the crop and will be fully prepared to assume the responsibilities that management and administration of multiple park programs will demand. 
We have established procedures for the establishment of new units of the National Park System to ensure that only those areas of truly national significance are authorized. 
Mr. President, the original bill passed by the Senate contained new fee authorities which would have allowed the actual users of the System to shoulder more of the responsibility to decrease the $8 billion dollar back-log in maintenance and infrastructure repair needed in our parks. Unfortunately, the other Body decided to delete these provisions from this legislative package. I regret this decision; however, I want you to know that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is going to address the fee systems for all of the agencies under our jurisdiction early in the next Congress. There are needs to be met and problems to be resolved in this specific arena. 
Senator Thomas came up with a park passport and stamp as an entrance pass to our National Parks. The winning design of the stamp will be through a competitive process each year, a similar process to the popular Duck Stamp that we are all familiar with. It's a great marketing tool and should increase revenues. Along that same line we are directing the National Park Foundation to assist other park friends groups. The Foundation possesses a great deal of expertise in fund raising and philanthropic activities. Sharing that expertise will benefit hundreds of parks across this Nation. 
We also direct the Secretary and provide him the authority to lease unused Park Service buildings and enter into expanded cooperative agreements in the hope that the private sector will take advantage of occupying and maintaining some of these unused structures, thereby off-setting expenditures by the Service. 
Mr. President, Senator Thomas, Senator Bumpers, Senator Bennett, and Secretary Babbitt entered into negotiations on concession reform. The end result is before you today. All of these gentlemen deserve our congratulations and thanks for the time and energy each put into the effort. 
This bill is a direct result of discussions amongst the House and Senate Committees, representatives of the concession industry, and other interest groups. It reflects, I believe, a fair and just resolution of some issues about which there is legitimate disagreement. The recent amendment offered by Representative Miller alters the terms of that agreement to some degree, but it remains a piece of legislation I can still support and endorse. However, I do think the amendment does give rise to a need for some clarification. 
Protection of the existing possessory interests of concessioners is an important element of this legislation. Possessory interest is a significant and valuable right. It reflects the capital investment of the concessioner. It was one of the foundations on which the 1965 Concessions Act was built and it can not be simply eliminated. The concessioners are entitled to the protections which the 1965 Act promised. 
For those reasons I think we must make clear what the Miller amendment does not do. In authorizing the Secretary to, in the future, alter the treatment of possessory interests, it does not empower him to do what Congress has specifically chosen not to do, by which I mean deny those concessioners the value of their existing possessory interest. Regardless of what the Secretary may ultimately decide, those existing possessory interest will remain a valuable and legally protected right for which concessioners must be compensated. They will remain entitled to see their investment protected and to receive the benefit of their bargain. 
Mr. President, on another point, we have just received a GAO study that tells us that many of our existing concession facilities are below standard and deteriorating. Visitors to our parks should not expect to stay in a facility that cannot pass the minimum requirements that apply to those hotels and motels on the borders of our parks. On that note, and as I have previously stated the negotiations that lead to this compromise were difficult to say the least. Each had to come across the table, no one got everything they wanted except the American people, and they got a lot. 
The provisions of this compromise mean that we will have the expertise of the private sector to assist and advise the National Park Service in the management and administration of concession operations. I am confident that under this scenario concession operations have no where to go but to produce better quality services. 
The private sector will be more than glad to provide major investments in new and existing facilities because they are able to maintain a financial interest in the properties. There is a great incentive for the operators to maintain their facilities and infrastructure to the highest standards possible. If they don't, the provisions provide for a decrease in the dollar amount of interest they are entitled to receive. 
Finally, concession operators will be paying more in fees which go back to the parks. 
Mr. President, I personally want to thank Senator Thomas for the extreme effort that he has put forth in this endeavor. In my years in the Senate I have never seen a Senator work harder on this contentious issue. He has done the impossible. 
And, last but not least, I want to say thank you to the Committee staff, for the hard work, the lost weekends, the evenings and for the great work.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise to speak in support of the passage of H.R. 2000, a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to make certain clarifications to the land bank protection provisions, and for other purposes, and I hope it will be sent on its way to the President for his signature. 
A measure similar to H.R. 2000 was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on September 24, of last year. S. 967 contained the majority of the provisions in H.R. 2000. 
One of the most important provisions in H.R. 2000 is section 6 which implements a land exchange with the Calista Corporation, an Alaska Native regional corporation organized under the authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This exchange, originally authorized in 1991, by P.L. 102-172, would provide for the United States to acquire more than 200,000 acres of Calista and village corporation lands and interests in lands within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Alaska. 
The Refuge serves as an important habitat and as a breeding and nesting ground for a variety of fish and wildlife, including numerous species of migratory birds and waterfowl. As a result, the Calista exchange will enhance the conservation and protection of these vital habitats and thereby further the purpose of ANCSA and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. 
In addition to conservation benefits, this exchange will also render much needed economic benefit to the Yupik Eskimo people of southwestern Alaska. The Calista region is burdened by some of the harshest economic and social conditions in the Nation. As a result of this exchange, the Calista Corporation will be better able to make the kind of investments that will improve the region's economy and the lives of the Yupik people. In this regard, this provision furthers and carries out the underlying purposes of ANCSA. 
This provision is, in part, the result of discussions by the various interested parties. As a result of those discussions, a number of modifications were made to the original package of lands offered for exchange. 
Mr. President, it is past time to move forward with this exchange. 
Another section of this bill I wanted to comment on is a provision that was not included in the technical amendments I introduced but that was added in the House. 
Section 12 of this bill expressly authorizes and confirms the original intent of ANCSA in 1971: that ANCSA corporations could provide health, education and welfare benefits for Alaska Natives, including those persons who were their shareholders. 
This provision is necessary because one recent Alaska Supreme Court case has concluded that an ANCSA corporation had liability to its shareholders under Alaska state law for a cash payment benefits program. The program at issue in that case was limited to the persons reached a certain age. Given the narrowness of this program, it was not consistent with the intent of ANCSA. Section 12 of this bill is not intended to alter the result in that case, or otherwise, with regard to that specific benefit program. 
However, in reaching its decision under Alaska state law, the court used language which suggests that any ANCSA corporate benefits program which does not provide equal pro rata benefits to all shareholders simultaneously is invalid. Such a conclusion goes too far and is inconsistent with the intent behind ANCSA. 
Thus, section 12 of this bill is intended to make clear that in evaluating the legality of health, education and welfare programs maintained by ANCSA corporations, federal law (ANCSA) is to preempt Alaska state law. Such programs have been established in good faith to provide health, education and/or welfare benefits for the ANCSA corporations' shareholders or their family members. 
To be valid under ANCSA, it is not necessary that benefits be provided on an equal pro rata basis simultaneously to all shareholders, or even that the program recipients be shareholders as long as they are family members of shareholders. 
Examples of the type of programs authorized include: scholarships, cultural activities, shareholder employment opportunities and related financial assistance, funeral benefits, meals for the elderly and other elders benefits including cash payments, and medical programs. 
I believe these programs represent an important part of the ANCSA corporations, and I hope they will continue long into the future.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as Americans prepare to celebrate Columbus Day, I notice that there are other celebrations going on around Washington, including `National Day' celebrations in Chinatown. October 10, 1998 marks the 87th anniversary of the founding of modern China. This is a very special day for Chinese people around the world, and especially in Taiwan where October 10 is celebrated as National Day in the Republic of China on Taiwan. 
Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the father of modern China, and is widely regarded and revered both in mainland China and in Taiwan. On October 10, 1911, Dr. Sun's Revolutionary Alliance succeeded in putting an end to imperial rule in China, a date which also marked the formal planting of the seeds of democracy which continue to flourish in Taiwan today. 
People often speculate as to the real reasons for the `Taiwan Miracle' and how Taiwan continues to defy the odds today; how this island nation continues to expand economically when nations all around her are at an economic standstill or contracting; and they speculate as to how Taiwan not only survives politically, but how she has evolved into such a strong democracy despite the pressures by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to isolate her from the international community. 
While there is no easy answer to this question, Taiwan is a flourishing and successful society in every sense of the word, and is a source of optimism in an increasingly uncertain world. In this light, it gives me particularly great pleasure to wish everyone on Taiwan, and Chinese people around the world, a very special October 10 National Day. And so to all of you, congratulations.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. 
Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced today will require the Secretary of the Interior to report on what he has done, or not done, to implement the requirements of sections 1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Those provisions sought to mitigate the effect of the designation of over 100 million acres of land in Alaska for permanent preservation on the Alaska Natives who have lived in the areas for centuries. Those provisions required the Secretary to allow those who were already providing visitor services to continue to provide such services and also provided a preference in hiring at those conservation units for local residents. 
Those provisions were intended to accomplish several objectives. First and foremost, they were designed to ensure that local residents who would assume the costs attendant to the establishment of these conservation units as a result of future limitations on economic opportunities received some of the benefits from whatever jobs were created. The provisions also ensured that the rich history and knowledge of the area that the local native population possessed was made available to visitors. For a change, Washington could learn from those in the surrounding communities. There would also be an incidental benefit from hiring local residents to the budget of the National Park Service since they would not have to pay employees to relocate to Alaska. 
Mr. President, while speaking to the issue of benefits, I have been told by several of the residents of Kotzebue that they have assisted in the rescue of Park Service personnel on a number of occasions. It makes little sense to me to bring someone to the Northwest parks from the lower forty-eight who is unfamiliar with the rugged terrain and treacherous weather. It makes better sense to hire an individual who stands little chance of getting lost or stranded. 
This is not a new concept. In various other units of the National Park System we have made provisions to take advantage of local communities, especially where the resource has particular historic or religious significance. At Zuni-Cibola Historical Park, for example, section 4 of Public Law 100-567 specifically authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Zuni Tribe and individual tribal members to provide training for the interpretation, management, protection, and preservation of archaeological and historical properties and in the provision of public services on the Zuni Indian Reservation to accomplish the purposes for which that unit of the Park System was established. 
At the National Park of American Samoa, the Secretary has been directed to establish a program to train native American Samoan personnel to function as professional park service employees and to provide services to visitors and operate and maintain park facilities. The law establishing the park also provided a preference for the hiring of local Samoans both as employees and under any contract. The general management plan for the park is to be developed in cooperation with the Governor of American Samoa. It is also conceivable, under the legislation, that after fifty years, sole authority to administer the park could be turned over to the Governor of American Samoa from the Secretary. 
There are other examples, but I think the time is long overdue for this philosophy to be realized at conservation units in Alaska. The Department of the Interior, in my view, has been 
dragging its feet and has failed to take advantage of the rich human resources present in the Alaska Native communities that lie in proximity to National Parks and Refuges. These units are remarkable and this Nation is not well served when the Secretary fails to take advantage of the local population. 
In particular, the four northwest Alaska units of the National Park System would be a good place for the Secretary to begin complying with section 1307 and 1308 of ANILCA and start contracting with the local people for the management of these park units. 
Bering Land Bridge National Preserve is a remnant of the land bridge that connected Asia with North America more than 13,000 years ago. The land bridge itself is now overlain by the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Sea. During the glacial epoch, this area was part of a migration route for people, animals, and plants whenever ocean levels fell enough to expose the land bridge. Scientists find it one of the most likely regions where prehistoric Asian hunters entered the New World. 
Today Eskimos from neighboring villages pursue subsistence lifestyles and manage their reindeer herds in and around the preserve. Some 112 migratory bird species may be seen in the Preserve, along with occasional seals, walrus, and whales. Grizzly bears, fox, wolf, and moose also inhabit the Preserve. Other interesting features are rimless volcanoes called Maar craters, Serpentine Hot Springs, and seabird colonies at Sullivan Bluffs. 
Cape Krusenstern National Monument is comprised of 659,807 acres of land and water--a coastal plain dotted with sizable lagoons and backed by gently rolling, limestone hills. The Cape Krusenstern area has been designated an Archeological District in the National Register of Historic Places, and a National Historic Landmark. The core of the archeologic district is made up of approximately 114 marine beach ridges. These beach ridges, formed of gravel deposited by major storms and regular wind and wave action, record in horizontal succession the major cultural periods of the last 4,500 years. The prehistoric inhabitants of northwest Alaska occupied the cape seasonally to hunt marine mammals, especially seals. As new beach ridges were formed, camps were made on the ridges closest to the water. Thus, over centuries, a chronological horizontal stratigraphy was laid down in which the oldest cultural remains were found on the beach ridges farthest from the ocean. The discoveries made at Cape Krusenstern National Monument provided a definite, datable outline of cultural succession and development in northwest Alaska. 
The park contains approximately 1,726,500 acres of federal lands and encompasses a nearly enclosed mountain basin in the middle section of the Kobuk River in the Northwest Alaska Areas. Trees approach their northern limit in the Kobuk Valley, where forest and tundra meet. Today's dry, cold climate of the Kobuk Valley still approximates that of late Pleistocene times, supporting a remnant flora once covering the vast Arctic steppe tundra bridging Alaska and Asia. Sand created by the grinding of glaciers has been carried to the Kobuk Valley by winds and water. The great Kobuk Sand Dunes--25 square miles of shifting dunes--is the largest active dune field in the arctic latitudes. 
Native people have lived in the Kobuk Valley for at least 12,500 years. This human use is best recorded at the extensive archeological sites at Onion Portage. The Kobuk Valley remains an important area for traditional subsistence harvest of caribou, moose, bears, fish, waterfowl, and many edible and medicinal plants. The slow-moving, gentle Kobuk River is tremendous for fishing and canoeing or kayaking. 
Noatak National Preserve lies in northwestern Alaska, in the western Brooks Range, and encompasses more than 250 miles of the Noatak River. The preserve protects the largest untouched mountain-ringed river basin in the United States. The river basin provides an outstanding resource for scientific research, environmental education, and subsistence and recreational opportunities. 
Above the Arctic Circle, the Noatak River flows from glacial melt atop Mount Igikpak in the Brooks Range out to Kotzebue Sound. Along its 425-mile course, the river has carved out the Grand Canyon of the Noatak. The preserve is in a transition zone between the northern coniferous forests and tundra biomes. The river basin contains most types of arctic habitat, as well as one of the finest arrays of flora and fauna. Among the Preserve's large mammals are brown bears, moose, caribou, wolves, lynx, and Dall sheep. Birdlife also is plentiful in the area because of the migrations from Asia and the tip of South America. The Noatak River supports arctic char, whitefish, grayling, and salmon and is an important resource for fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. 
Mr. President, these are the human and natural resources of Northwest Alaska. This legislation will direct the Secretary to finally bring the two together for the benefit of both Alaska Natives and the nation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am both throwing down a gauntlet and laying down a marker on this subject of fishing in Glacier Bay. 
Native Alaskans have used Glacier Bay to obtain fish and other foodstuffs essential to them for many thousands of years, and not long after the United States acquired Alaska, commercial fishing started there also. In all the time since, fishing has caused absolutely no harm to the values that make this area one of America's premier national parks. 
Parts of Glacier Bay were declared as a national monument in 1925, to promote the study of flora, fauna and geology of post-glacial terrain. Glacier Bay was ideal for this purpose. When visited by Capt. George Vancouver in the late 18th century it was closed by a geologically recent glacial advance, but by the time John Muir visited in the 1880's, Native fishermen had resumed their age-old practice of fishing here every summer. 
In 1939, the national monument was expanded. In 1980, it was expanded again, and most of it was redesignated as a national park. 
Mr. President, just as the Federal Government spoke with a `forked tongue' to Native Americans throughout much of our history, so it has spoken to the Tlingits and to the other local residents who rely on Glacier Bay for their livelihoods and for their sustenance. Throughout the history of government proclamations, local Natives and commercial fishermen have been promised that their activities would be respected--yet a few years ago, the government decided to ignore its promises and began a concerted effort to banish both commercial and subsistence fishing. 
It has been aided and abetted by some of the sleaziest tactics I have ever seen--a network of half-truths and outright lies about the fisheries, the fishermen, and about our efforts to save them. 
Mr. President, this is just plain wrong. It is an affront to every American who believes the government's promises should be worth something, and there are still a few of us left, despite everything. 
I had hopes that reasonable people could work this issue out. Indeed, earlier this year I delayed further action on my own efforts to craft compromise legislation in order to allow additional time to the fishermen, State of Alaska representatives and others who have been trying to develop a consensus. 
Unfotunately, these efforts have been stymied by the refusal of the national environmental organizations to agree to fair treatment of these historical users. For that reason, I supported putting a one-year regulatory moratorium into the Interior appropriation, so as to allow additional time to work on this issue at the local level. 
Regrettably, the Department of the Interior and its allies are not willing to continue working toward a consensus. Instead, they refused to accept the moratorium language, and insisted on going forward with regulations to put the fishermen out of business. 
There is a real inconsistency here; in the same bays and inlets where they insist fishing is an unacceptable commercial activity, they are only too happy to allow tour vessels with thousands of visitors. 
Soon, perhaps within hours, perhaps within a few days, we will pass an omnibus appropriation measure that makes one of Washington's insider `deals' on this issue. Under the deal, a minimum payment will be made to get some fishermen to disappear altogether, and a handful of others will be told that they will be allowed to fish, but that their current right to sell or bequeath their fishing permits to their children has just evaporated forever. 
I repeat, Mr. President, what is happening here is just plain wrong. 
For that reason, I am today offering an amendment to my earlier bill. I will introduce another such a bill in January of next year, and In intend to introduce such a bill every January hereafter until justice is done. I will also welcome the assistance of the State of Alaska in asserting its right of jurisdiction over the management of these fisheries. 
Come what may, I will not stand by and allow these existing small fishing operators to be lost in Glacier Bay.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to ensure that when Congress looks at ways to reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil, it does so with the best science available. 
The legislation I introduce today would require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct 3-dimensional (3-D) seismic testing on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. 
This testing leaves no footprint. In fact, just last year the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allowed such testing to be done in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, declaring such testing would have no significant impact. 
It would have even less impact on the frozen tundra in ANWR. 
It is also a possibility that the oil industry would be willing to share in the cost of such testing. Let's at least find out what kind of resource we are talking about. 
Mr. President, I think it is important that we look at some of the history of his area and the testing that has occurred there. 
In May of this year, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that a mean of 7.7 billion barrels of producible oil may reside in the 1002 Area of the Arctic Oil Reserve. 
This estimate was in stark contrast to a declaration by Secretary Babbitt in 1995 when he pronounced the Arctic Oil Reserve's oil possibilities to be about 898 million barrels. 
In the interest of looking at this amazing leap in the estimate of the AOR's producible oil, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week, and invited the U.S. Geological Survey to participate. 
Three things rang clear at that hearing: 
First, while these estimates were the highest ever and proved the 1002 area of the AOR has the greatest potential of securing our Nation's energy needs--they were extremely conservative. 
For instance, these estimates were based on a minimum economic field size of 512 million barrels. When in practice the minimum economic field size in Alaska is much lower than that. Consider the following examples of current economic fields in Alaska: 
Northstar: 145 mm/bb (With a sub-sea pipeline) is deemed economic. Badami: 120 mm/bb is deemed economic. Liberty: 120 mm/bb is deemed economic. Sourdough: 100+ mm/bb (adjacent to Aor) is deemed economic. 
The second fact that rang clear is while these new estimates show a clearer picture of the Western portion of the AOR, much remains unclear about the oil and gas potential of the massive structures present in the Eastern portion. 
The USGS has slightly downgraded the potential of the Eastern portion because they do not have similar data that was available to them on the Western portion. 
Third, technology has increased so dramatically that we can now extract greater amounts of oil from wells with far less impact on the environment at a cost of 30 percent less than 10 years ago. 
Consider this, Mr. President: In June of 1994, Amerada Hess concluded the Northstar field in Alaska was uneconomic because development would exceed $1.2 billion and eventually sold the field to BP. 
Today, BP expects to begin production of that field's 145 million barrels of reserves in 2000. Estimated development costs: $350 million--a 70 percent reduction from just 4 years ago! 
Mr. President, all these factors point toward the logical conclusion that underlying the 1.5 million-acre oil reserve in Alaska lies greater reserves than recently estimated, and we need to confirm them with better science. 
Dr. Thomas J. Casadevall, acting director of the USGS, was very clear in his explanation that if the newer three dimensional (3-D) seismic data were available from the Arctic Oil Reserve, their high May estimates of producible oil could increase significantly. 
Casadevall explained that their new estimates, while supported by sound science and peer review, were still based on 2-D seismic tests done more than a decade ago. 
Kenneth A. Boyd, director, Division of Oil and Gas of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, likened the advance of the new testing to the difference between an x-ray and a CAT-scan. 
He said the available information from 2-D seismic as opposed to 3-D seismic is that the former produces a line of data while the latter produces a cube of data. The cube can be turned and examined from all sides and the geologic information proves invaluable for exploration. 
This data has revolutionized exploration and development of the North Slope of Alaska. Modern 3-D data provides enhanced and incredibly accurate imaging of potential subsurface reservoirs. 
This in turn reduces exploration and development risk, reduces the number of drilled wells, and in turn reduces both overall costs and environmental impacts. 
Of course there is little pressure to allow testing or exploration of the Coastal Plain with gas prices at a 30-year low. However, the Department of Energy's Information Administration predicts, in 10 years, America will be at least 64 percent dependent on foreign oil. It would take that same 10-year period to develop any oil production in AOR. 
It seems prudent to plan ahead to protect our future energy security. 
If the Nation were to be crunched in an energy crisis--like the Gulf war that would require the speedup of development; that development could impact the environment negatively because it would not have the benefit of thoughtful planning. 
I believe it is as criminal as stealing gold to refuse to acknowledge the potential for producible oil in the Coastal Plain of the AOR. If we don't know what the resource is, how can we protect it or make an informed decision about the use of the area? 
And how can those in this administration or the environmental community argue it is a bad idea to seek a greater understanding of these public lands? Particularly, when the Congress set aside the area under a special designation for future Congresses to determine whether it contains the quantities of oil that, if produced, would significantly enhance our national energy security. 
Mr. President, this legislation will also better enable the Secretary of the Interior to protect the Federal petroleum resources underlying the Coastal Plain. However, without knowing what those Federal resources are however, there is no way to protect them. 
Just last year a major oil discovery was announced on State lands immediately adjacent to the federal border. Production from this well could drain portions of the federal reserve without adequate compensation to the federal treasury. 
The Secretary has an obligation to protect the Federal resource underlying ANWR and this legislation will provide him the tools to do so. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to make it perfectly clear that this bill is being pushed by those of us in Congress who believe that if you are to make a decision about the best use of our public lands that you should do so with the benefit of the best available science. 
It is not, as Secretary Babbitt has suggested, an effort being pushed by the petroleum industry.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered to grandfather existing taxes on Internet services. 
This amendment undermines the fundamental integrity of the underlying bill because all state and local taxing jurisdictions would not be under the exact same moratorium. It rewards those states and municipalities that raced to set up discriminatory taxes on Internet services and places them in a better position to raise revenue than those states that have chosen not to act. 
More importantly, it sets the precedent that some states, but not all states, can levy taxes that harm interstate commerce. This amendment makes the Internet Tax Moratorium a piece-meal moratorium, not a real moratorium. 
I ask my colleagues to consider why we are considering this Internet tax moratorium. As all of us recognize, the Internet is a massive global network that spans not only every state in the Union, but international borders. As the Commerce committee found, Internet access services are inherently a matter of interstate and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of the United States Congress. In fact, it has been estimated that if the Congress does not make a policy decision regarding taxation of Internet services, more than 30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions within the United States could establish their own taxes on Internet transactions. 
Because of the chaos that would ensue, we have decided to place a halt on Internet taxes and allow a commission to study this issue and make recommendations to the Congress. Yet the amendment that the Senator from Oregon proposes would reward those jurisdictions that have already decided to tax Internet services. Why should we grandfather those jurisdictions? 
If it is appropriate for states and localities to impose taxes on Internet services than all states should be permitted to adopt such taxes. Alaska should be given that opportunity just as much as North Dakota and South Dakota. But under the Internet Tax Moratorium legislation, my state does not have that option but the Dakotas can continue their taxes because they adopted those taxes prior to this moratorium. 
And if it is not appropriate for states and localities to impose taxes on Internet services, than not states nor localities should be permitted to adopt these taxes. 
I believe this amendment is not only discriminatory but undermines the fundamental idea underlying this bill. As I noted earlier, the Internet is inherently about Interstate Commerce and we in Congress are about to make a decision that no local taxes should be imposed on Internet services until Congress receives the Commission's recommendations. I believe we should make this moratorium uniform, not piece-meal as the Senator from Oregon proposes. 
Otherwise, we are encouraging every state in the union to rush to the state legislature every time a new technology comes along and adopt a taxing scheme on the new technology, secure in the knowledge that should Congress decide to impose a moratorium on such a new tax, that state's taxes will be grandfathered. 
Moreover, there is no rational basis to grandfather these state and local taxes on what everyone agrees is interstate commerce. We have asked a Commission of experts to make recommendations regarding Internet taxes. Although I cannot pre-judge what the Commission will recommend, it is probable that the Commission will make three recommendations. It will make a decision that state and local taxation of Internet services are appropriate or inappropriate. It may decide that some taxes, such as taxes on `pipeline' services like Erols or value-added online services like America Online are appropriate but that taxes on interstate product sales on the Internet are inappropriate. 
What is certain is that the Commission will not recommend that the only Internet taxes that are appropriate are those that are levied by the states that are proposed to be grandfathered. That would make no sense and would probably be unconstitutional. For that reason alone, we should not permit this grandfather. 
Mr. President, one of the most important reasons I believe we should not grandfather any of the Internet taxes is because a decision we make on grandfathering will send a signal to our trading partners that if they adopt taxes on Internet commerce today, those taxes will likely be grandfathered if and when an international agreement on taxation of Internet commerce is reached in the future. 
Why shouldn't Brazil or Germany or Canada establish taxes today on Internet commerce and then claim that since these taxes were adopted prior to an international agreement, they should be grandfathered just like the United States grandfathered similar taxes? 
Mr. President, there is ample precedent for such a scenario. Many of the tariff and non-tariff barriers that the United States has confronted in the past 50 years have covered practices that were insulated by the original GATT grandfathering rules that were adopted more than 50 years ago. In fact, there have been a number of instances where our foreign trading partners have used the GATT grandfather clause to defend measures that would otherwise violate our GATT rights. A number of those involved foreign tax regimes. 
For example, the European Union relied on the GATT grandfather clause to defend their system of territorial taxation and income shifting rules that clearly constituted an illegal export subsidy. Similarly, Brazil used the grandfather clause to defend internal taxes of general application (i.e., sales taxes) that discriminated against goods imported from other GATT members. And Canada relied on the grandfather clause to defend its interprovincial restrictions on the sale of beer and other malt beverages, which included discriminatory charges on imports of competing products from the United States. 
Mr. President, the Internet as a means of communication and commerce is in its infancy. Commerce on the Internet is projected to grow by several thousand percent in the next five years. And who stands to benefit the most from that growth? Companies based in the United States will be the largest beneficiaries. I think there can be no doubt about that. 
We in the United States invented the Internet. We have been the first country to begin to exploit its benefits. We are leading the world in Internet commerce and the world is watching everything we do and trying to figure out how to prevent American domination of this new medium. 
One way to slow American domination of the Internet is for foreign countries to begin to establish taxing regimes on products and information generated from the United States. It is not hard to imagine our foreign trading partners developing taxing schemes designed to protect their domestic manufacturers from competition from more efficient American competitors selling in their country via the Internet. Nor is it difficult to imagine that some of the more repressive regimes in the world might want to come up with punitive access taxes that functionally prevent their citizens from reading American on-line newspapers and magazines. In the name of `cultural sovereignty,' I can imagine that some countries will adopt special taxing regimes to restrict access to Internet web pages that are in English. 
Mr. President, the precedent we set by grandfathering Internet taxes currently in place will be closely watched by our trading partners. They will follow our model because the United States has established all of the standards and protocols for the Internet. 
We should send a message to our trading partners that we will not grandfather any taxes on Internet commerce. Unless we do that, I fear that when our negotiators sit down and attempt to negotiate away discriminatory foreign taxes on Internet services, our foreign trading partners will use the grandfather model in this bill as a reason their taxing regime should be maintained in place. That is surely not the precedent we want to set. 
Finally, Mr. President, if we table this amendment we will ultimately not be voting on whether the moratorium should be three years or four years. The Senate has already spoken on this issue and if the grandfathering amendment is tabled, the Chairman of the Committee will certainly offer another amendment that we can accept that will extend the moratorium for four years. 
I move to table the amendment on grandfathering state Internet taxes.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Landrieu and Lott, to introduce the Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act of 1998. 
This important piece of legislation remedies a tremendous inequity in the distribution of revenues generated by offshore oil and gas production by directing that a portion of those moneys be allocated to coastal States and communities who shoulder the responsibility for energy development activity off their coastlines. It also provides a secure funding source for state recreation and wildlife conservation programs. 
The OCS Impact Assistance portion of this bill is similar to legislation I have introduced in prior Congresses and is an issue I have worked on for my entire Senate career. 
Title 1 of the bill directs that a portion of the revenues generated from oil and natural gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf--or OCS--be returned to coastal States and communities that share the burdens of exploration and production off their coastlines. 
Offshore oil and gas production generates $3 to $4 billion in revenues annually for the U.S. Treasury. Yet, unlike mineral receipts from onshore Federal lands, OCS oil and gas revenues are not directly returned to the States in which production occurs. 
This legislation remedies this disparity. States and communities that bear the responsibilities for offshore oil and gas production will share in its benefits. 
This legislation would, for the first time, share revenues generated by OCS oil and gas activities with counties, parishes and boroughs--the local governmental entities most directly affected--and State governments. 
The bill also acknowledges that all coastal States, including those States bordering the Great Lakes, have unique needs and directs that a portion of OCS revenues be shared with these States, even if no OCS production occurs off their coasts. 
Coastal States and communities can use OCS Impact Assistance funds on everything from environmental programs, to coastal and marine conservation efforts, to new infrastructure requirements. 
In Alaska, local communities could use OCS funds to participate in the environmental planning process required by Federal laws before OCS development occurs. 
Other rural coastal communities in Alaska will use the money for sanitation improvements. While still others, like Unalakleet, will use the money to construct sea walls and breakwaters or beach rehabilitation--efforts which will combat the impacts of coastal erosion. 
This is money that will be used, day-in and day-out, to improve the quality of life on coastal State residents--money which comes from oil and gas production. 
Further, as the Federal OCS program expands in Alaska, this legislation will mean even more revenues to the State, boroughs and local communities. 
This is a true investment in the future. 
As Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I know all too well that offshore oil and gas production is a lightning rod for environmental groups who will go to great lengths to disparage an activity that is vital to the long-term energy and economic security of this country. 
These groups will likely say that this bill creates incentives for offshore oil and gas production because a factor in the distribution formula is a State's proximity to OCS production. 
Let us remember, this is an impact assistance bill--revenue sharing, if you will. 
States only will have impacts if they have production. The States with production, obviously, have greater needs and are most deserving of a larger share of OCS revenues. 
Mr. President, let me also remind everyone, that OCS production only occurs off the coasts of 6 States--yet the bill shares OCS revenues with 34 States. 
There are 28 coastal States that will get a share of OCS revenues which have no OCS production. In fact, in all areas except the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska there is a moratorium prohibiting any new OCS production. 
It is in the long-term best interest of this country to support responsible and sustainable development of nonrenewable resources. 
We now import more than 50 percent of our domestic petroleum requirements and the Department of Energy's Information Administration predicts, in ten years, America will be at least 64 percent dependent on foreign oil. 
OCS development will play an important role in offsetting even greater dependence on foreign energy. 
The OCS accounts for 24 percent of this Nation's natural gas production and 14 percent of its oil production. We need to ensure that the OCS continues to meet our future domestic energy needs. 
I firmly believe that the Federal Government needs to do all it can to pursue and encourage further technological advances in OCS exploration and production. 
These technological achievements have and will continue to result in new OCS production having an unparalleled record of excellence on environmental and safety issues. 
Additional technological advances with appropriate incentives will further improve new resource recovery and therefore increase revenues to the Treasury for the benefit of all Americans who enjoy programs funded by OCS money. 
I will do all I can to ensure a healthy OCS program, including new OCS development in the Arctic. 
A number of challenges face new developments in this area--I am confident that we can work through them all. 
History has shown us that in the Arctic, and in other OCS areas, development and the environmental protection are compatible. 
This bill also takes a portion of the revenues received by the Federal Government from OCS development and invests it in conservation and wildlife programs. 
Thus, Titles II and III of the bill share OCS revenues with all States for such purposes. 
Title II of this bill provides a secure source of funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF was established over three decades ago to provide Federal money for State and Federal land acquisition and help meet Americans' recreation needs. 
Over thirty years ago, Congress had the foresight to recognize the ever growing need of the American public for parks and recreation facilities with the passage of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. 
That landmark piece of legislation was premised on the belief that revenues earned from the depletion of a nonrenewable resource need to be reinvested in a renewable resource for the benefit of future generations. 
This rationale is as valid today as it was in the mid-1960's. 
To accomplish this goal, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act directs that revenues earned from offshore oil and gas production should be spent on the acquisition of Federal recreation lands by the land management agencies. 
The act also creates a state-side matching grant program. 
The state-side matching grant program provides 50-50 matching grants to States and local communities for the acquisition and construction of park and recreation facilities. 
The state-side program has a truly unique legacy in the history of American conservation by providing the States with a leadership role in the provision of recreation opportunities. 
Through the 1995 fiscal year, over 3.2 billion in Federal dollars have been leveraged to fund over 37,000 State and local park and recreation projects. 
Yet, despite these successes, the President had not requested any money for the state-side program for the last 4 years. 
This is a program supported by this Nation's mayors, Governors, and the recreation community. 
The state-side matching grant should not have to justify annually its existence with congressional appropriators. 
Title II makes this program self-sufficient and provides secure funding from OCS revenues. 
Title III of this bill provides funding for State fish and wildlife conservation programs. 
In Alaska, with its unparalleled natural beauty, fishing and hunting are two of the most popular forms of outdoor recreation. 
The bill directs that a portion of OCS revenues should go to the States for wildlife purposes. 
The money would be distributed through the Pittman-Robertson program administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Services. 
With the inclusion of OCS revenues, the amount of money available for State fish and game programs would nearly double. 
This is a no-tax alternative to the Teaming with Wildlife proposal. 
States will be able to use these monies to increase fish and wildlife populations and improve fish and wildlife habitat. 
States also could use the money for wildlife education programs. 
I am proud of this proposal which is a win-win for the oil and gas industry, the States, environmental and conservation groups, and all Americans. 
This bill will ensure not only that Coastal States have money to address the effects of OCS-activities but that all States have funds necessary to provide outdoor recreation and conservation resources for all of us today to enjoy. 
As we end the 105th Congress, I can pledge, as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that the enactment of this bill will be one of my highest priorities next year.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me commend the senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, and Senator Levin for having completed work on this important conference report on the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I particularly want to express my appreciation to Senator Thurmond and Senator Warner and their staff for working with me and my staff to address the provision that the House of Representatives had attempted to include (section 1216) which would have negatively impacted the export capabilities of U.S. vendors of civilian nuclear power equipment. I am pleased to say that the Senate conferees were able to replace the House language regarding nuclear exports with an acceptable notification requirement in Section 1523. 
Mr. President, as some of my colleagues are aware, the House of Representatives had added language that would have changed the reporting requirements for nuclear exports and added a congressional disapproval process. The change in the export law contemplated by the House of Representatives was unwise and unnecessary. 
A change in the reporting requirements was unnecessary because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission closely regulates the export activities of U.S. nuclear vendors. The nuclear export licensing process by law requires not only public notice of export license applications as soon as they are received by the N.R.C., but also the opportunity for public intervention with the N.R.C. prior to issuance of a license. Moreover, the N.R.C. is not allowed to issue an export license for any nuclear equipment and technology unless the government of the recipient nation has negotiated, signed and implemented a bilateral agreement for nuclear cooperation with the United States. Such agreements provide the United States with a broad array of inspection rights and control over the fuel cycle. I am unaware of any allegations that, under this regime, the United States has exported any nuclear material or technology which has been diverted for military or proliferation purposes. Since our export control system appears to be working, it is difficult to see why it should be altered or supplemented. 
A change in the reporting requirements was unwise because it would negatively impact U.S. exporters of civilian nuclear power equipment without advancing any national security goal. Although the author of the provision made clear that his proposal was designed to add restrictions to trade in civilian nuclear power equipment and technology with China, it would have impacted many other countries, including Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Taiwan who purchase U.S. nuclear goods. I am convinced that, faced with new restrictions, all these countries would be extremely reluctant to deal with U.S. suppliers. Certainly, European and Canadian suppliers would use such new restrictions as part of their commercial armory to argue that, for these countries, dealing with U.S. suppliers is complex, time absorbing, and subject to political whims, while their procedures are simple and straightforward. 
Some members may want to block trade with China in civilian nuclear goods and technology. But, my colleagues should recall that President Clinton sent to Congress the certifications necessary to implement the Reagan Administration's 1985 Agreement for U.S.-China Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation on January 27, 1998. The Congress considered those certifications for 30 legislative days, as provided by law. Existing law provided the opponents of the certifications with every opportunity to challenge the Administration's determination. However, no attempt was made to pass a resolution of disapproval of those certifications, and consequently, the 1985 Agreement went into effect on March 19, 1998. Any changes made after the fact would be seen as aimed at impeding or delaying such cooperation and, as such, could seriously undercut the non-proliferation assurances China provided as a condition of implementing the nuclear cooperation agreement. Moreover, as a matter of principle, moving the goalposts regarding certification after the fact is unfair. 
Mr. President, again, I want to thank the managers for their assistance on this important matter.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will proceed under the theory that one picture is worth 1,000 words, although I am not suggesting that you are not going to get 1,000 words, as well. In any event, in order to set the stage for the debate on King Cove, I think it necessary to educate and familiarize the Members of this body as to what this issue is, where it is, and why it is so important to the residents of the small community of King Cove, on the Aleutian Islands, population 700, who have no availability of surface transportation for medical care. As a consequence of the lack of surface transportation for this community, 11 of the residents of that small community have perished in medevac flights out of the area over the last decade. 
I think I should also identify Senate bill 1092 that is before this body, specifically, the substitute that I have offered, which exchanges surface estate. 
The substitute that I offer exchanges the surface estate of some of the higher value wetlands privately owned by one of the Native village corporations in King Cove within the refuge in exchange for a simple grant of right-of-way across Federal lands that would allow the residents of King Cove reliable access to the Cold Bay Airport; hence, medical care when emergencies exist. 
Further, we are not asking for an appropriation. I think it is fair to note that there are no funds requested. This is simply an authorization for land exchange, something that is ordinarily done within the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources, which I chair, on a daily basis. 
The real concern here is the people of King Cove. Now, many of the Members of this body have had an opportunity to meet with the Aleut residents of King Cove as they visited Washington, DC, as they visited Members' offices and made a unique appeal, an appeal based on the rigors of living in a wilderness area with a harsh environment, and the experiences they have had in not being able to avail themselves of the transportation system that ensures that they can safely get to hospitals for medical assistance when there is an emergency. 
As I said, 11 residents of my State have already died flying into or out of the area. Many of them were seeking to get badly needed medical attention in an emergency. Still others died while waiting on the ground for weather to clear enough to attempt to make these potential life-saving flights. 
Let me show Members what part of Alaska we are talking about. Alaska is a pretty big chunk of real estate. We have 33,000 miles of coastline. Of course, Juneau, our capital, sits here. Anchorage, our largest city, is at the head of Cook Inlet, roughly in this area. Fairbanks, where my home is, is in the interior. Point Barrow is adjacent to the Arctic Ocean. Prudhoe Bay is on the Beaufort Sea. But we have another area on the Aleutian Islands and this area extends almost to Japan. This area includes the community of King Cove which is on the Pacific Ocean side. Across a small base is the area where we have a large airport that was left over from World War II. To identify the specific area on a scale map, we can see Cold Bay here, and then King Cove here. 
We have unique weather patterns spawned as a consequence of the Japanese current moving along the Aleutian Islands and clashing with the cold, interior Bering Sea, creating some of the worst weather in the world. No question it has been documented as such. 
We have the village of King Cove, 700 people year-round, and a small industry associated with fish packing, freezing and processing. Then we have a large complex built during World War II, consisting of crosswind runways. I will show pictures of runways in Cold Bay and King Cove. 
Let me show the first picture which shows a gravel strip, about 3,700 feet, which is the access for the residents of King Cove. There is a road that goes along the side of the mountain. That is the road that comes in from the village. The interesting thing about this and the location is this is the best they could do for an airfield because of the topography and the realization that the winds are extraordinary in this area. There are numerous cases of pilots landing in small single or twin-engines with the wind sock at one end blowing one way and the wind sock at the other end blowing the other way. That is the harsh reality because the wind from the Bering Sea comes one way, the winds from the Pacific Ocean come the other. They simply clash over this area and create this extraordinary complexity of winds. It is not necessarily fog, it is not necessarily heavy snowfall, it is tremendous turbulence in wind. 
Here is another airfield located at Cold Bay. This was part of the effort during the Second World War in preparation for the invasion of Japan, to build this large facility, over 11,000 feet, the main runway. The population here is about 130 people. Most are Government employees with the FAA, operating this runway. This is also a backup for an emergency, should any of the space shuttles have to land in this particular area based on their orbits. 
The point is, there is daily jet service into Anchorage from here. I think there was only 1 day last year where the winds were such that they couldn't bring in aircraft. 
This is how you go from King Cove to Cold Bay to start your visit to Anchorage to visit with friends or to get out, if you will, of King Cove to go virtually anywhere. You have to go over here. The only way to get there is to fly. If you are in an emergency situation, you have another set of facts. The point is this runway represents reliability in transport. You see these little roads here around Cold Bay that have been in existence since the Second World War. 
It is interesting to note that there are some 32 to 47 miles of roads that are in the wilderness. Make no mistake. I have driven the roads. They are there. They are not maintained because there is little maintenance necessary for them. But they are drivable. They are drivable by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and others. 
Let me proceed with some more pictures because I promised to give you an opportunity for a feeling for this area relative to pictures that have been taken over an extended period of time. 
Now, I want to show the land area and the proposed road so we can get an idea of what we are talking about here in relationship to the issue. The colors in solid brown are the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. That is this area here. Then we have the wilderness areas in the checkered brown with the white in it. You can see it is extensive, but it is not conclusive in that it connects. There is the major portion here, and then over toward Cold Bay there is another area, and there has been an area that has been left aside down here. So the wilderness areas don't connect together. 
The existing roads are worth evaluating a little bit, Mr. President, because they cover roads not only in the wilderness up here, which are drivable, but they go into the wildlife range where you can go and photograph and you can hunt geese. They go into the wilderness area here. 
The proposal now is to have a road from King Cove to Cold Bay. That is the issue. In order to bring that road around, you have to go into that area of wilderness because you can't cross the bay because of the water depth and the costs associated with the bridge, and we are really dealing with 700 people now. 
So what are the alternatives? I am prepared to discuss those later. It is important to know what the quid pro quo is here, because we think it is a win for the environment, with the recognition that the Native association is prepared to give their land, which is colored here in the basic green areas and the yellow areas, in exchange for access through this area. The quid pro quo is they are proposing that about 580 acres to be added to the wilderness in return for this 7 miles of road, which would be through this wilderness area. The only difference is that we are not putting it into wilderness. I have a difficult time trying to communicate this to some of the other Members and the public because we are proposing a land exchange. 
By this 580 acres entering into the wilderness in the exchange, as a consequence of that, we would have a situation where there would be the road in a refuge but not a wilderness. By adding to the wilderness, we have done just that, taken land that the Native corporations have--and that is private land--and added that to the wilderness, and then exchanged with these specific areas designated in white--a land exchange--putting this in a refuge. So the road will not go through a wilderness; it would go through a refuge. 
We have numerous occasions where there have been similar land exchanges and roads are going in refuges. This is not unique or a precedent. If you look at this area and you are concerned about waterfowl, note these two peninsulas that are privately owned by the Native corporation. They are proposing to give those and add to the wilderness. These are integral points inasmuch as they represent peninsulas and, as a consequence, the waterfowl primarily dominate through those particular areas. So this is the route of the proposed road. 
We are not asking for funding. No appropriation here. This is a land exchange only to benefit the people of King Cove. And, hopefully, the question is, how many more lives do we have to lose before we get some relief? 
I want to go through some of the other charts, in general, to give you an idea of why some of the alternatives suggested by others simply don't work. 
This is a photo of Izembek when there is a storm. I don't know if you have ever been terrified, but I have. I have been out in boats in some of these storms. This is how you get from King Cove to Cold Bay across Izembek when there is a storm. And these are real storms. We have cases where a pregnant woman is put aboard a fishing boat in a storm like this. She gives birth to the child in the galley, and they have to open the oven and make an incubator out of tin foil and the child survives. I will show other pictures of just what kind of bodies of water we are talking about. 
Mind you, the uniqueness here is that you have Bristol Bay and the Bering Sea on one side and the Pacific Ocean, and this is the area where all the storms basically are initiated on the west coast and down to California. This photo shows Izembek Bay in a storm. How would you like to subject yourself to that? You and I are accustomed to taking a road to the hospital and having access to some reasonable way, without having to subject yourself to conditions likes this. 
Somebody said, `Well, what happens on a clear day?' That depends on what season you are in. This photo happens to depict the wintertime when the bay is frozen over. That is factual. There is your ambulance in the wintertime. How would you like to try that? That is the harsh reality that happens at certain times in the winter. You are not going to move a Hovercraft over that, and you are certainly not going to move a boat. What happens sometimes is that they do have a vessel in, and they try to move people from a small boat up to the dock, and they move them in a cargo net. How would you like to get off your boat and into a cargo net under those conditions? 
That is living in rural Alaska today. It is the harsh reality. We have some other pictures that I want to show you relative to the harsh reality of living in Alaska. 
These are people who have died because there was no access out of King Cove. This is Tom Phillips, who lost a leg in a boating accident. He died in a plane crash in a medevac airplane trying to fly into Cold Bay. Christine Dushkin suffered a heart attack and died of exertion while climbing onto a Cold Bay dock from a small boat. Mary Dobson suffered from frequent seizures but could not get timely medical care during bad weather. Darien Gorsinger, a community leader, died in a plane crash while evacuating an injured Seattle fisherman. Walter Samuelson waited 3 days after a heart attack to get out of King Cove. Sarina Bear, who was born prematurely on a fishing boat, lost half of her body weight on a 3-hour fishing boat trip to Cold Bay. Earnest Mack died in Anchorage after 4 days of delay while trying to get out of King Cove. Kathy Hoff, a King Cove nurse, died in a plane crash on a Medicare mission out of King Cove. John Datolli, a bush pilot, died in a plane on a medical mission to King Cove. 
This is the harsh reality and the situation as it exists. Some suggest, let's do another study, let's look for another alternative. In the meantime, my constituents are dying. I know how you would feel if they were your constituents. 
Here are some headlines from some of our Anchorage newspapers, the Anchorage Daily News and the Anchorage Times: `Six Killed in a Plane Crash,' `Plane on Mercy Mission Crashes; 4 Believed Dead,' `Four Die in Cold Bay Crash,' `Plane Hits Hillside at King Cove; 6 Die,' `Pilot Dies In Crash.' 
This happens because it is really tough out there. It is so tough, as a matter of fact, that the people are saying, let us have the opportunity that other Americans enjoy, which is access by road. This is the road in this photo, Mr. President. That is what they look like. These were roads that were built during the Second World War. There is so little traffic that there is very little maintenance. This sign over here is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife sign. That goes over to Outer Point. I go out there virtually every Columbus Day, 
unlike my good friend, whom I have the utmost respect for, who has never been there. He has never experienced it. I have. This is what we are talking about. These are the roads that are out there. 
Here is another picture. This is the topography of the area, what the country looks like. It is flat. It is barren. There are no trees. There is grass. There are lots of ponds. There are lots of birds that come through in the fall. They move on. 
You can go on these roads. You can take an old 4X4 and wander around and see the country. Mind you, these roads are in the wilderness, 47 miles of them. 
When you say we are driving through the heart of the Izembeck Wilderness with this road connection, you are not facing reality. These roads are already there. They are not all of the wilderness. 
I will show you where these roads are, because we have a detailed map which shows the road in and out of the wilderness. It gives you an idea. 
These aren't highways we are building. They are not superhighways. They are just an adequate road that you can take a 4X4 over, recognizing that when you put a little gravel around and maybe have four or five cars a week, it is not very much traffic. But depending on the circumstances, at least somebody can get out. 
This is an aerial picture of the topography of the general area and what we are looking at. I think it is important that you reflect on what the area looks like today. This is a little difficult to see, but I am going to do the best I can, because it is in black and white. It is an aerial photograph. It is an official photograph. It is not something that has been doctored up or lines have been drawn in. 
But this general area down here is the edge of the Cove Bay runway, and these are the roads in black that go through the general area. These are the roads that wander in through the wilderness designation. This is the line right here, the boundary. The wilderness is on this side. All of these roads are in the wilderness. They are already there. 
What we are proposing is simply an extension of this road of 7 miles to go in with a land exchange--taking the area out of the wilderness, putting it in the refuge, and putting a road extension in. We are not asking for any money, we are simply asking for an exchange and an authorization; that is it. 
Here are the existing roads that wander over here. Here is another wilderness boundary over here, a little chunk over here. There are roads to the west of that. When I go out there goose hunting, we usually wander out here, or wander up through here in the wilderness, and go out over here--any number of places that are there. To suggest that we are creating something that is not there is totally unrealistic and unfounded. 
Again, I want to go through the remainder of the charts, because I think you are beginning to get a feel for what the country looks like and what we are up against. Hopefully the staff, who has not practiced this, will make sure that we show all the other charts before we get into some of the things that the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Arkansas take for granted that are unavailable in Alaska. 
While they are going through some more of the visuals, let me make a couple more points. 
What has happened to our Native people when wilderness boundaries and refuges have been designated is that the concerns of the people have basically been overlooked. The Aleut people have lived in King Cove for over 5,000 years. The substitute that I offer today would provide relief for access. That is really all we are talking about. We are talking about appealing to real people who have a need that others in the United States enjoy. 
We are somewhat isolated in Alaska. We have four time zones down here. We have three. I think we are about 5,000 miles from Washington, DC, to Alaska. The area of King Cove is about 1,700 miles from Seattle, 632 miles west of Anchorage. In fact, it is interesting to note that it is twice as far from here to King Cove as it is from Tokyo to King Cove. That gives you some idea of the isolation. 
I have indicated that the weather conditions out there are such that we have the uniqueness of wind sheer turbulence and what we call venturi wind conditions, which makes flying a real experience. When you add this to the fact that it is a mountainous area with sharp valleys, you find conditions for what we have had in a series of disasters. As I have indicated, on that 3,300-foot runway you have wind blowing at either side. 
You might say, `Well, the Senator from Alaska is exaggerating. That can't occur all the time.' It occurs almost every day, Mr. President. It can occur for days on end. It can occur for weeks on end. Sometimes a week or 10 days will go by before they can get a flight in and out of King Cove, if one can wait. This is simply an inconvenience which Alaskans accept, however, since the main livelihood of the Aleutian people is derived from fishing in the treacherous seas of Bristol Bay. 
Medical evacuations are a common occurrence. Surprisingly enough, they happen twice as much in this community as any other place in Alaska. With only the help of midlevel practitioners, help in an emergency must be sought in other locations. This is not a concept that many in this body are familiar with. We take for granted health care. It is only a few steps away. Certainly this is the case where we are right now in most of our hometowns. But out in the Aleutian Chain, it is not that simple. 
Let me interrupt for a moment to comment on a few things. 
This is a sign that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife puts out as an advisory. This is our Government speaking, not me. It says:  
Visitors [to the area] should bring extra food and rain gear should weather close in. 
This is in the refuge advisory: 
The refuge is famous for inclement weather, usually in the form of wind, rain, and fog. Fog, drizzle, and overcast skies are often succeeded by violent storms and bitter cold snaps that slow down all activity. It is not unusual for an entire year to go by with only a few days of clear skies. 
I don't know what that means to anybody. But it puts you on notice. 
Let's see how residents of Arkansas and Montana access health care. I readily admit I do not know all the specifics of health care in these states, but I do know how to make up a chart. I do know how to make a point. 
Here are the major hospitals in Montana and their accessibility by State and Federal highways. The green lines are the U.S. interstate highways, the red lines are the U.S. highways, and the black are the Montana State routes. Every place you see an `H,' you see a major hospital. Hopefully, I haven't missed any. But I am sure my friend from Montana would be happy to correct me if I have. 
But the point is, the people of Montana have access to health care in an emergency. 
Let's wander over to a Southern State. My friend from Arkansas and I have had conversations about this. I know how he feels about equity. 
Here are the major hospitals in Arkansas accessible by Federal highway. I would be happy to show this a little closer if there is any difficulty in seeing it. These are the hospitals in the State of Arkansas on the road systems. There are 10 hospitals, I am told, in Little Rock. The point is the residents in the State of Arkansas have access by road to health care. Now, these are hospitals that have facilities to take care of emergencies. 
Let's look at Alaska when we talk about cases of dire emergencies. We have Anchorage. Here is health care in Alaska. These are hospitals with critical care units. We have one in Anchorage, AK, an area one-fifth the size of the United States, and an area that has 33,000 miles of coastline--a big hunk of real estate. The Senator from Texas is not here so I won't comment that it is two-and-a-half times the size of Texas. I might lose his support. 
This is our road system--a little bit on the Seward Peninsula around Nome, Teller, a road from Prudhoe Bay down through Fairbanks, down to Valdez, Anchorage, Homer, Kenai, a little bit of road in southeastern Alaska. Anchorage is our area of primary critical care. So when you have a situation in a village out here at King Cove in the Aleutian Islands, you need access to it. You need access to an airport where you can get an airplane, a jet airplane into Anchorage which is 600 miles away. 
So things are not that simple in Alaska. They are tough. We have a first-rate Alaska Native hospital available to the Aleut residents of King Cove in Anchorage, but it might as well be on the dark side of the Moon if you can't get there. 
As I have indicated, we have had 11 air crash fatalities flying residents out of King Cove, trying to get some of them to lifesaving medical attention. 
We talk a lot about telemedicine, and I am an avid supporter of telemedicine. But the realities of telemedicine are that it depends on whether you have adequate personnel where you need it to communicate the symptoms and take action, and then if it is too bad you need more than telemedicine. If it is bad, you need access. 
How are you going to cross a bay that is uncrossable by boat in the wintertime because it is frozen or the storms are so great you can't cross it because of the high winds? 
Well, let's talk about helicopters. I have nothing but the highest admiration for our Coast Guard, National Guard and those courageous people who are out there providing rescues, but there is some uniqueness associated with the Cold Bay area, and that is something that the helicopters have a problem with, and that is extreme turbulence. The helicopters do very well in heavy winds, but it is the turbulence that creates problems. And it is important to note that threatening conditions in King Cove arise at unknown times. Pregnant women in King Cove often leave the village 6 weeks before they are due in order to make sure they are able to be near medical facilities in case complications arise. 
A woman by the name of Carol Kenezuroff went into premature labor. She was unable to fly out of King Cove due to weather conditions. She decided to make the treacherous trip by boat. It took 2 1/2 hours in an 80-foot crab boat. One hour into the trip Carol gave birth to a 2-pound-3-ounce girl on the galley table of that crab boat in a 10-foot sea. The baby's name was Sirena. She lived only because someone on the crab boat had presence of mind to make a makeshift incubator out of aluminum foil and put it near the oil stove. 
The story isn't over yet, Mr. President, because the mother had to be offloaded twice from the boat in a sling because her IV tubes had got caught in the dock pilings of the unprotected harbor of Cold Bay. Do you know of anybody who had that kind of situation? 
Well, it happened in the State of Alaska. By the time the baby made it to Anchorage, it had already lost half its body weight and barely survived the ordeal. 
This is the harsh reality of life in King Cove, but it does not have to be that harsh. There is a solution to assure safe travel and a solution that is opposed by some of the special interest groups. I really question their justification because you cannot say that this is a road through the heart of the wilderness. This isn't a road through the wilderness. We are doing a land exchange. It is a road through a refuge, isn't it? It is a plus for the wilderness, isn't it, because we are adding 580 acres. This is a win-win-win, but the special interest groups on the other side can't see it that way because they have gone off, in my opinion, the deep end and simply said, no, we are not going to allow this exchange--not because it is not good for the environment by adding 580 acres to the wilderness. I can only assume for one selfish reason, they have a cause that generates money and membership. But I am not going to spend a lot of time on that. 
The point is 30 miles as the crow flies from King Cove is the all-weather runway at Cold Bay, and all these people want is access to that 10,400-foot runway where a Reeve Aleutian Island Jet 727-100 comes in every day, except once last year when it could not get in because of weather conditions. And I might add, in deference, the only day they don't fly is Sunday. But medevac aircraft from Anchorage can get in there. 
This road would total only about 29 miles. Now, remember, where would the road be? Whose land would it be on? Well, here it is, the green area. It is on land owned by the King Cove Native Village Corporation. Just roughly 7 to 8 miles of the road would be in the massive 300,000 acre--there it is, 300,000 acres. Only if this bill passes, it is not 300,000. It is 300,580 because we are adding to the wilderness. That is what makes this thing a win-win-win for the wilderness--only 7 miles--this portion here--would not be in wilderness, but the refuge. 
Again, I want to make it clear because those who don't want to understand it refuse to acknowledge we are not putting a road in a wilderness. We are doing what we have done hundreds of times before, a land exchange--allowing a road in the refuge where we have numerous roads in this country. 
Now, because the 7 or 8 miles of the proposed right-of-way are currently located in the wilderness, I think it is pretty clear that is why some of the groups have opposed it. But what they fail to tell you again--and I would emphasize, and I hate to be repetitive--this area already has 42 miles of existing road. 
Of that 42 miles of existing road--and I want to bring that chart back up again, because I want to make this point--of the 42 miles of existing roads, we already have 12 or 14 that are already in the wilderness. You can drive on them. Take a 4x4--that is a 4-wheel-drive vehicle, all-terrain--and wander out in them anytime you want. Mr. President, 13.7 miles, to be exact, of road, are already in the wilderness. You can go out and drive on it, and I am going to be driving on it over Columbus Day. 
What they fail to tell you is that this is a 60-foot, if that--a gravel road, not a highway. Let us show the picture again of what we are talking about. The Senator from Montana showed a highway the other day when he brought this matter up. `This is what we are going to build. We are going to build a highway.' Come on, let's quit kidding each other and the American public. And I might add, we are not asking a red cent from the taxpayer. 
This is the kind of road it is. That is what it is. That is all it is. There is no McDonald's on it, no supermarkets. A plain old road. We still have those in Alaska--plain old roads, nothing fancy. A grader might go over it once a year. To suggest that somehow the snow is going to stop a 4-wheel drive from going on a bad day? Let me tell you, when it is turbulent, the airplanes don't fly but the cars creep along the little old road very nicely. 
You say there are going to be avalanches. Does it look like avalanche country to you? There are a few areas on the other side where there are some hills, but there is not going to be an avalanche. `You will have snowdrifts.' You do not have a lot of snow out there. You have blowing snow and winds, but the roads that are there now, the 47 miles of road, are open virtually all winter. You do not have a situation where you have, like Valdez, AK, where you have 25 or 30 feet of snow. That does not occur. This is a maritime climate but it is tough on wind. So to suggest a road will not work is unrealistic, because the roads that are there do work. Mr. President, 130 people in Cold Bay traverse on them, as they keep the airport open year around in Cold Bay. 
I was using 580 acres, and I was wrong. This exchange adds 664 acres to the wilderness. The Native people are giving up their private land in return for access through a refuge. It is a win-win-win for the wilderness and the environmentalists, if they can just figure it out. Again, this substitute that I offer would adjust the boundary to include 664 acres of the private King Cove Native lands, and it would remove 85 acres from the wilderness in the exchange for the 7 miles of road. 
One other thing here, lest we forget--the `great white father.' The `great white father' of public lands, in our State, is the Secretary of the Interior. He controls utilization. And we propose that for this section, this section specifically, if it is authorized and someday built, that the Secretary would have the ability to regulate the use of the road during migratory periods. How much more authority? If the concern is migration, OK, there is a concern. If you have concern about migration, don't allow hunting in the area. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allows hunting. We obey the rules and they allow it out there. 
One of the most significant areas in Alaska is Cordova. You have the flats of Cordova; you have a road that runs out to the Cordova River, right through the flats. It is a huge nesting area with many endangered species and an airport in the middle of it, and there is no problem at all. Do you ever see any geese on the golf courses around here? They even allow hunting on the golf course, they have so many geese. To suggest this is going to be detrimental to the migratory bird pattern is absolutely ridiculous. There is no justification for that at all, because the roads are already there. There is so little traffic on them. There is not likely to be a mass movement from Washington, DC, to King Cove or Cold Bay. Believe me. 
This is a Native area, and the Native population have had the ability to generate a little activity with their little cannery and their little cold storage plant. But what they have not been able to do is to generate any interest in the Congress of the United States supporting a little land exchange so they can enjoy access to a road. They are prepared to take care of themselves, if they can simply have access to their airport. 
Let's talk about precedent one more time, because I am sure the opponents will say, `Oh, you are setting a precedent. You are setting a precedent.' 
First of all, I thank those Members who were willing to see the people of King Cove during their visits here in Washington, DC, the Aleut people themselves, because they can express their desires and positions much better than I can. 
I would like to recognize here an old friend who just snuck into the Chamber, who shall remain nameless; is that fair enough? Thanks, Bob. 
Speaking of precedents, rather than Presidents--which we almost had here, but I am getting off the subject so I better get back to the business at hand--I think many of my colleagues have been wrongfully led to believe this provision which we propose would set a precedent in setting or allowing roads to be built through wilderness areas. 
As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I can assure you, this is absolutely false. There is no precedent to be set by this provision. First, plainly and simply, this provision does not authorize construction of a road or authorize construction of a road in a wilderness. One more time: It simply adjusts the wilderness boundary, and that adds 664 acres of private land, private Native land, in exchange for withdrawing 85 acres that will be used for a road corridor and a refuge. None of the corridor will be in a refuge portion. It will be in the wilderness portion of the refuge. 
I want to get to the point. Wilderness boundary adjustments are commonplace. They are done for numerous reasons. Last year I was instrumental in passing the Presidio legislation, which included, among other things, wilderness boundary adjustments. In one wilderness area we withdrew 73,000 acres of wilderness and added back 56,000 acres, for a net loss to the wilderness of 17,000 acres. That was in the Anaktuvuk Pass. 
Prior to that, Congress--and I think my colleague from Montana will note--deleted 28 acres from the U.L. Bend Wilderness Area in the State of Montana to allow for access, to allow for access through a wildlife refuge wilderness area. What for? To a fishing area near Fort Peck Reservoir. In other words, to a fishing hole. 
I am not complaining. I figure the folks in Montana know what is best for them and the Senators from Montana know what is best for their citizens. That is why I am kind of amused that this body has denigrated itself, if you will, to a situation where--you know, it used to be the Senators from the State knew what was good for their State and they were going to be judged by their constituents and held accountable. But we have moved away from that now because of the special interest groups, and we have Members who have never been to my State dictating the terms and conditions under which my people have to live. They resent that, and so do I, because they do not know what the people who are living there are really experiencing because they have not experienced it. The constituents in Arkansas and Montana have not experienced it, but I have. I can tell you, it is real. 
We have had examples where Congress has created roads in wilderness areas. In fact, when the Izembek Refuge Wilderness Area was created in 1980, it was created with existing roads in the wilderness. 
I don't raise these examples to advocate that wilderness boundaries should be subjected to change at whim. I am not doing that. What we are proposing is a net increase of nearly 600 acres of wilderness. If we have changed wilderness boundaries for such things as access to a recreation area or, in the case of Montana, to a fishing hole, then I can't understand why in the world it is not appropriate to change a wilderness boundary into a refuge to save lives. It is pretty basic, Mr. President. There is no truth to the claim that this is precedent setting. 
Some people question why this right-of-way needs to be granted now when the State is currently undergoing a process to determine a preferred alternative between improved air safety, ground transportation, whatever. Why is the right-of-way needed if it is not yet known that this will be the State's preferred alternative? These are valid questions. They deserve a valid response. 
First, one has to understand this issue is not new. A road connecting King Cove and Cold Bay was recommended in the preferred alternative of the 1985 Bristol Bay management plan done cooperatively with the State and Federal Government. 
Second, in 1995, ground transportation between these two communities was listed as the State's third highest priority project for rural Alaska by the current Governor. 
If you look at the map that shows the health care areas in the State--I want you to look at that a little bit more because it shows the road system in the State. We don't have roads in the State. We are the new kid on the block. We have been a State since 1959--39 years ago. That is what we have. Look at Arkansas and look at Montana. We are not asking for an awful lot here. In fact, it is a bit embarrassing for me to have to come and plead for the lives of the people in this village. 
That is our road system, Mr. President, an area one-fifth the size of the United States, an area that, if superimposed on a map of the United States, superimposed in a comparative dimension, goes from Mexico, to Canada, to Florida, to California, with the extension of these Aleutian Islands. It is a big piece of real estate. I find it difficult to have to beg, if you will, for consideration here, but I guess that is what I am doing. For a people who have occupied this area for 5,000 years and have looked at every option, it makes sense to have a ground link. These people have lived, have survived a lot longer than you and I. They fish the waters and hunt the land. Sometimes they fly the skies, and sometimes they die. 
It is interesting to note, too--I will point out on one of the maps of the Cold Bay area--that they have traversed this area through this so-called wilderness on foot trapping in the wintertime and hunting. This is nothing new, and they are still doing it. But these are the people who have the most at stake in protecting the region's resources. Think about that. These are the residents--they are subsistence people, to a degree. They know how to protect the fish, the game, the geese, the endangered species. 
The problem with the bureaucracy is this thing can crawl on --do more studies. But the people want some assurance at the end of this process. Without the legislation before us, there is no end in sight, because what this legislation does is it simply authorizes a land exchange. That is all it does. 
In testimony before Congress, the Fish and Wildlife Service was asked the question: If through this comprehensive study that is underway the preferred alternative is, indeed, a road link, would they support it? They simply said no. They didn't give a reason; they just said no. They didn't acknowledge there were roads already in the wilderness. 
By granting the right-of-way now, a road link will remain a viable alternative. It will give the State the option. Why shouldn't the State have the option for Heaven's sake? It is our State. By granting this right-of-way now, a road to safety, what we are doing is appropriate and timely, and I guess tardy in some respects, and providing an opportunity for the people of King Cove to have access. 
I promised to comment, since we are not limited to time currently, on a couple of other options because I know these are going to come up in the debate. I know that others will insist there be other ways to resolve the problems of King Cove without granting ground access. We have already talked about telemedicine. I know that the people of King Cove welcome the technology and the advancements telemedicine is going to add, but it is not the solution. Telemedicine is a diagnostic tool. We may be in a better position to diagnose a heart attack or a partial amputation, but we will be no better off to treat it without the ability to safely transport people to modern medical facilities. 
Our largest hospital, Providence Hospital, in Anchorage stated it best recently when referring to telemedicine:  
It will be especially helpful in providing better consultations to enhance a provider's knowledge and help her or him make a better decision about transport. However, it will never, ever eliminate the need for emergency transport to an acute care facility, and that is what the road between King Cove and Cold Bay is all about.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, some others argue that the building of a health clinic is the answer. Incidentally, I understand my good friend, Dr. Frist, will advise us later on the aspects of telemedicine, what you can and can't do. I am most appreciative of that. Still, others argue building a health care center is the answer. The answer, again, is it helps; we have a little bit of it there, but without a proper cardiac unit or prenatal unit, the people will still need transportation to other locations outside of King Cove in times of emergency. 
We are going to hear a lot of talk about helicopters. You are going to hear a lot of talk about helicopters from people who have never been in a helicopter when the wind is blowing 60 miles an hour, or have never been in a helicopter in severe turbulence. But I have, but not as much as the people I am going to talk about. 
The Secretary of the Interior says, `Well, just use a helicopter.' Let me show the map of Alaska, again, because the nearest helicopter is in Kodiak. There is nothing wrong with the aspects of that, other than Kodiak is 300 miles away. Here is Kodiak Island right here. We are 300 miles away in King Cove. This would be like telling the residents of Washington, DC, that their trip to safety will be provided by a helicopter that comes from Waterbury, CT. How is that? Or any other area that you care to pick. 
Even if a Coast Guard helicopter was stationed nearer to King Cove, where are you going to put it? There is not much out there in the Aleutian Islands. It is kind of tough to place the lives of Coast Guard personnel in danger when there are other alternatives. 
Let's flip this around. They say that there are alternatives and the helicopter is another alternative. The helicopter folks say, a helicopter is fine, but there are other alternatives and one is a road. 
Helicopters do not always work, for several reasons. First and foremost, they are not designed to handle severe turbulence. That is part of the daily life in King Cove. And any good helicopter pilot will tell you that the wind is not the issue, the turbulence is. The wind did not cause 11 deaths. It was the turbulence that caused the deaths. That is what brought the aircraft down. 
Second, we have done a little investigation working with the Coast Guard, who have been very responsive. The Coast Guard pilots are trained for maritime missions flying over water, not flying over mountainous terrain--not that they cannot do it, that is just not part of their training. 
Third, do we really want to change the mission of the Coast Guard to handle land-side medevacs when other alternatives such as one simple gravel road exists? I can assure you, Mr. President, the Coast Guard does not support such a change. Recently the admiral told me so. And I will quote his letter.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is a quote: 
The Coast Guard is a sea going service. Our personnel are trained and equipped to operate in the maritime environment, which poses very different challenges from those faced by shore-side responders. For the Coast Guard to take on the additional responsibility of responding to shore-side medical evacuation would require a fundamental change in the way we do business, a substantial increase in funding, and a complete reevaluation of our asset siting. 
Mr. President, on a more somber moment of reflection, the men and women of the Coast Guard are brave souls. I served in the U.S. Coast Guard. I am very proud of that body and proud of the time that I served our country. 
Men like Kevin M. McKracken from Springfield, OR, 25 years old; William Gregory Kemp, 27, of Docena, AL; David Rockmore, 52, of Cambridge, PA; Ralph King, 24, of Arden, NC; Michael C. Dollahite, 38, of El Paso, TX; and Robert L. Carson, Jr., 38, of Bostic, NC, all of whom perished, they all died, Mr. President, in a Coast Guard helicopter crash during an attempted medevac rescue on Ugak Island in Alaska. They crashed, Mr. President. 
That is the harsh reality of the danger of those who are prepared to give so much for the benefit of others. You are not just talking about sending a helicopter willy-nilly 300 miles, you are talking about a tough set of facts here, Mr. President. 
I have had discussions with the Secretary of the Interior. He may be willing to generalize on the issue of danger and the fact that the helicopter is an answer. But, you know, where do you get the appropriations for a helicopter--you have to have two crews, you have to have hangars; you have a population of 700 people here--when you have an alternative, a simple gravel road? That is all we are asking for. And you can debate whether we are wrong or right; we will take our chances. 
Let's talk about a sea link. That is interesting. You still have a population of 700 people. It would require a tremendous infrastructure. For example, you would need a 150-foot-long vessel to operate in the rough seas, probably have to have some kind of an ice-breaking capability, have to have dock facilities constructed at both King Cove and Cold Bay, breakwaters requiring more than--well, it is estimated it would take more than 67,000 feet of fill that would have to be constructed in King Cove and Cold Bay. Roads would have to be constructed to access boat docks. 
And even if all this were done, sick and injured people would have a minimum of a 2-and-a-half-hour, maybe 3-hour, trip in the treacherous seas. Let me show you a few pictures of what these seas look like. And it would still not be as reliable or as fast as a simple alternative of a one-lane gravel road. How many cars do you think you are going to have out of a population of 700 people in an isolated area going over that road a day? Three? Four? I do not know. Hardly enough. That is what you are looking at. 
How would you like to take a ride on that? I can tell you, 90 percent of the people in this body would be hanging over the side, deathly seasick. They would hope the boat would roll over and sink. But that is the access that we have. And this is what is proposed to be some kind of a sea link at a cost--who knows what it costs. 
We have had long debates in this body over the years about access to health care, haven't we? Nowhere does this take on a more dramatic meaning than King Cove. And when I say `access,' this means the actual physical ability to get to a hospital in a hurry, whether it be Anchorage or Seattle, WA, to get specialized health care needed in the event of a serious emergency or sickness. Right now, the residents of King Cove simply do not have that access. 
We have had other debates about access across public lands. And I always go back to a conversation I had with the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt. He said, `If you folks have a need, show me an area where you need access across Federal lands, and I'll work with you.' I cannot think of a greater need or an area that is more easily identifiable where we need access across Federal lands. And I would encourage him to reconsider. 
I believe that we have shown in this case we have a need. For some reason or other, those in the administration do not seem to support our plea that this is a matter of life and death to our constituents as well as American citizens. I find it terribly disturbing that where human life and safety issues are at stake, we see such an orchestrated effort to distort the facts by well-meaning people fronting for special interest groups, most of which do not give a darn about the people in King Cove or their plight, that through some idealistic interpretation they have taken this on as a cause. They fail to recognize what a gravel road is, fail to recognize we are not setting a precedent, fail to recognize we are not putting a road through a wilderness. 
It is amazing, when you think about it. Here is the health and safety of my constituents. And I am not going to stand by, and let some of these special interest groups control the agenda, and ignore the viability of what we are proposing--no Federal funding, simply a land exchange. I do not believe any Member of this body would stand by and let their constituents face such conditions. 
When we think about it, what does wilderness connote? Safety. Wilderness connotes refuge. So in making every effort to protect the environment and the surrounding ecosystem in King Cove, Congress unintentionally endangered the lives of those living in King Cove when it created the wilderness area. 
So, what we are doing in Senate bill 1092, with my amendment, is righting a wrong by authorizing the one thing that we all take for granted when we are injured or when we want access, and that is a road. We do not want a paved highway, we want a little gravel road--that is it--a road to safety, Mr. President, a road to life. 
Fourteen people have died. You know why they have died? Because there has not been a road. Fourteen people in the community of 700, 710 people. These are Aleuts. They have been there for 5,000 years. How many more lives are we going to be sacrificing for the bureaucracy to study alternatives until they can be provided with the access they so rightly deserve? 
They have paid for this access, Mr. President, in blood. And this is an access that you and I take for granted daily. The designation of `wilderness' was never meant to prevent people from safe access to medical care, and I think we would all agree it would be absurd to argue otherwise. 
My constituents, your friends, some of the people that you have all met with, the Aleut people who visited in Washington, DC, I think deserve an opportunity to save their lives in times of emergencies. They should not be held hostage to fear for life and limb by an administration or a Congress that somehow is carrying the water for some of the righteous self-interest groups. This is the situation we have. 
In the end, those who vote with the people of King Cove may or may not be on the winning side of this issue but they will certainly be on the right side of the issue. 
Mr. President, how much time have I used?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I want to make one more point, and then I will yield to my colleagues who are in opposition. 
I noted an article in The Hill, one of Capitol Hill's weekly papers, on September 30. It amazes me because this is part of the problem we have, the failure of those who are in opposition--in this case, a letter from a senior vice president of public policy of the National Audubon Society. 
It is entitled `Murkowski's Bond Proposal is a $30 Million Boondoggle.' It is to the editor. He says that the proposed solution of `a road to life,' as this Senator suggests: 
There is not a shred of evidence [in the writer's opinion] that a road will provide reliable, safe, medical evacuation in areas prone to avalanches, blizzards, white outs, dense fog, and extreme air turbulence. 
I answer, very simply, that the roads are there now. The roads are passable. You might have to slow down. This is not tremendous areas of concentrated snowfall. The problem is extreme turbulence associated with moving an aircraft through the skies during those terrible storms. So the roads are there now. 
He goes on to say: 
In fact, this single lane, 30-mile, $30 million gravel road is a taxpayer and environmental boondoggle. 
That is an outright lie. That is an outright lie. We are not asking for $30 million. We are not asking for a red cent. This is how this issue is portrayed to the American public--`30-mile, $30 million gravel road is a taxpayer and environmental boondoggle.' A cool $1 million per mile. 
That road isn't costing $1 million per mile, and we are not asking for Federal funds. They mischaracterize it. Why, Mr. President, can't we have a debate on the merits without misleading the people? 
Talk about the bird habitat--I appreciate and am sensitive to it. This road is not going to interfere with that anymore than we have seen roads in Cordovo or roads in Juneau interfere. The fact is that we are only talking about a population of 700, and the roads already exist in the wilderness. 
He suggests an all-weather boat ambulance could effectively back up this facility. I think you have seen the picture. You have seen, also, the people who have perished. He talks about a `life-saving boat' plan as a solution. He doesn't mention the bay freezes. 
Again, it is a case of somebody who has never been there, never experienced the isolation, what it means to be without access. Clearly, there is an alternative. We suggested it in this legislation. 
Again, I encourage my colleagues to reflect on the appeal of the people from King Cove who have come to their offices, to recognize, indeed, how they would respond if it were their constituents, and recognize that there is a viable alternative here, and that is a simple road which is a win-win-win--the environmental communities and the wilderness--because we are adding 580 acres to the wilderness and we are not putting a road through the wilderness. We are doing a land exchange and putting that road through a refuge. 
It will be my intent to talk a bit more a little later, because I am sure some of my friends may have some questions or I may have a rebuttal. With that, I thank the Chair for the attention. In deference to my colleague, I recognize we had conversations relative to the merits of this and I know, obviously, there is pressure by the administration on this particular issue. I take that in the spirit under which it is going to be communicated. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to point out again, relative to the snow, that the question was brought up by the Senator from Montana, suggesting that because of his opinion on the amount of snowfall that occurs in Montana, we must have that same condition. But isn't it rather unusual, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in their notice of extreme weather, notes `wind, rain, and fog, drizzle, overcast skies.' Isn't it unusual that it would omit `snow'? And in fact the reality is, there is very little snowfall in that area. I can't tell you how many times--I am sure you have gone to the airport by car and found out that the airport is closed and you had to drive someplace else.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see my good friend is on the floor, the Senator from Tennessee. I note that he is the only physician in the Senate and is certainly eminently qualified with his wealth of knowledge on health issues. We have discussed issues today relative to health care. He has expressed opinions on everything from tobacco to children's health care. But I think it is important to recognize that he is an experienced and qualified trauma surgeon. 
I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee would care to discuss the certain medical issues that are relevant to this debate and relevant to the timing of the debate and those who experience severe accidents to get to a trained trauma center with adequate personnel.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, one of the reasons the people from King Cove are, of course, pushing for access is that when a serious injury occurs, they understand that treatment has to be obtained in a relatively short period of time, in some cases immediately. Many of the health care providers in the area refer to the first hour after an injury as the crucial `golden hour,' so to speak, meaning that this is the most critical time after an injury. 
I wonder if the Senator could shed some light on what that time is. What does that `golden hour' really mean?

According to the draft study by our State of Alaska, Mr. President, the average flight delay from King Cove--I think it was cited by the senior Senator, Senator Stevens--is approximately 8 hours. If a patient has a heart attack, stroke, or perhaps some other trauma, what are the chances for survival after such a delay?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughts of the Senator from Tennessee on this. 
Another subject that we discussed at some length in this debate is concerning safe access to the residents of King Cove. The argument is that telemedicine is the solution to the dilemma of the people of King Cove and the access. I ask the Senator from Tennessee if he would agree with the following quote from one of the largest health providers in our State, and that is: 
The Aleutian Chain is without a doubt one of the most difficult places on Earth to provide quality health care for several reasons. Weather is a primary factor. Transportation in an emergency can be terrifying. It can also be deadly, and it can also be delayed. Many lives have been lost in the attempt of both patient and provider in working on evacuation teams. The Aleutians represent a unique opportunity to develop telemedicine. However, it will never eliminate the need for emergency transport to an acute care facility. That is, of course, what the access road is all about between King Cove and Cold Bay. The system will not carry a human body that needs advanced medical care. It will not remove the need for treacherous evacuations that so often take place from King Cove. 
Talking specifically now about the technology of the advancement in this area of telemedicine, I wonder if the Senator could comment on the telemedicine technology benefits limitations. What kind of people do you have to have at the rural end to communicate this advanced technology that we are seeing in medical care today?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I thank my colleague from Tennessee for coming over and sharing his knowledge and experience in the area of not only telemedicine but as a trauma surgeon, and we have seen the Senator's performance when called upon here in this body in an emergency. We all commend the Senator for his extraordinary expertise and express our appreciation to the Senator for his many good works. 
I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I know the hour is late and the Senator may wish to continue to speak. I am personally just about to wind up here. I would like to make a couple of points relative again to the allegation that somehow a road--and again I would point to one of the charts--faces significant closures because of snow. As we have indicated on numerous occasions, even the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their warning do not address snow as a difficulty in transit on these roads. This is the type of road you see. 
Again, I would remind my colleagues that we are not looking for any funding here, we are looking for an authorization for a land exchange. We are not putting a road through a wilderness, we are putting it through a refuge. It is a net-net gain for the environmental community because it adds approximately 580 acres to the wilderness. 
I also would like to point out that while my friend from Montana suggests we study it some more, we have been studying this thing since 1984. That is 14 years, Mr. President. We have had the Aleutians East Transportation Improvement Plan, we have had the Alaska Intermodel Transportation Plan, we have had the King Cove Bay Road Feasibility Study in 1995; the King Cove Briefing Report; the King Cove Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment draft report, 1997; the King Cove-Cold Bay Transportation Study of 1998. 
My point is that this issue has been pretty well studied, and for the people who have lived there for 5,000 years in King Cove, there is only one possible option that makes any sense. And they are pretty savvy people, because they have to be, they live in a harsh environment. 
We don't need another study. It is not going to save one more life. It will just delay the ultimate confirmation of what we already know--that the road is the most practical, it is the least expensive, it is the most reliable alternative. That is why everybody else has them. And why shouldn't the people of King Cove? That is the real issue. 
Now, my friend brought up a point that I feel a little uncomfortable with because it questions our motivation. He suggested that the real reason behind this road was the commercial use. 
Well, first of all, I want to tell him and I want to tell the rest of my colleagues that I have never, never been approached by the fish processing firms that are over there that this, indeed, would be a significant benefit, nor have they lobbied me. 
If you understand the commerce of the North Pacific and the fisheries markets, you will know that most of the products that are produced in the small facility at King Cove are frozen fish products. Now, frozen fish products primarily are halibut and bottom fish, and they just don't demand, if you will, the market price to afford to fly them out to the markets. So as a consequence, what is produced here is carried by small freezer vessels and is marketed primarily in Japan and, to an extent, Korea. 
If you look at the map of Alaska, you can see the unique location of King Cove and the great circle route, and that is the route of transportation. Most of these ships sail out of Vancouver, BC, or Seattle, WA. These are freighters; they are American President Lines and various others. They go from the Seattle area and they stop by some of these areas on the Pacific Ocean side and pick up the frozen product in freezer vans and take them on to the Orient, whether it be the area of King Cove or whether it is Unalaska. 
To suggest that we have enough value in our fish products to warrant moving them out by truck or van is totally unrealistic because the price simply won't support that. You can't get that much for the product. You can talk about all the studies you want. There may be a half dozen individuals who will suggest that this is a potential market, but if the reality of the price isn't there--and it isn't there--you are not going to ship this out. 
I would ask my friend from Montana one other thing. Since we are giving the Secretary of the Interior the authority to control all the traffic on the road, would he vote for this--if, indeed, the Secretary said there will be no commercial activity? We assure him of that. Would that satisfy the Senator from Montana? I would certainly think it should, because this is the point. He questions our motive.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I can tell you right now, there is no way that the value of this product would allow it to be shipped out by aircraft. The only thing that we have that would closely approximate that value is the king crab fresh, but it is very, very difficult. It is a very short season, and this isn't the predominant area necessarily for that.

<DOCNO>105-murkowski-ak-26-19981001</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. The point is, Mr. President, to question the motivation of the Senators from Alaska on the question of commercialization is without any foundation and without any feasibility regardless of what some study or report suggests as a potential alternative. It is simply not real. 
Now, the other issue relative to the points that have been made by my friend from Montana, who clearly doesn't speak from experience or having visited the area, is the issue of the road and connecting, if you will, the roads that are in the area with this proposed extension. 
I would call attention to the fact that we have in this area almost 15 miles of road in the wilderness now. And if my friend, when he has an opportunity, would care to visit the area, I would be happy to take him and drive over these roads that exist in the wilderness today. 
What we are proposing is, not to address those roads, we are proposing simply to put another road extension, if you will, outside the wilderness in a refuge, and I think we have made that point again and again and again. To suggest there would be 400 people a day who would travel this road is ludicrous. There are 700 people in King Cove. There are 110 or 120 in Cold Bay. Now, I don't know where you get 400 people, or hundreds of trucks. This is make-believe simply to address an issue that--well, there is little local knowledge certainly in this body relative to the factual account. 
Believe me, if we could ship our products out by 747 and get the price that we would have to get for them, why, it would be a different matter. You talk about the issue of the sanctity of the wildlife sanctuaries, and that is a very real issue. But be assured that we have, as Senator Stevens indicated, in the Cold Bay airport a world-class airport. Prior to the advent of the long-range 747, many of the aircraft that traversed the North Pacific route had to land there for fuel. It was a big fueling base. Flying Tigers went in there for years and years and years. And to suggest that had a detrimental effect on the wildlife patterns is clearly without any merit. 
Furthermore, I would refer one more time to the fact that we have attempted to meet more than halfway every objection brought by the environmental community, even to the point of giving the Secretary of the Interior the authority to direct the type of traffic on this road. Mr. President, I think we have pretty well covered all the concerns, except some of the irrelevant and impractical considerations that have no bearing on reality. 
So, I ask my colleagues, and the floor manager on the other side, how much time? Can we get an agreement on a vote? I could go on all day, but I defer to the floor manager on the other side to see if we can get some idea and certainty about how much more time they would like on their side.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, let me point out a few things that are germane to the debate. 
The Committee on Natural Resources held hearings on October 15 on the issue of Cold Bay and reported the bill out of the committee. So to suggest that somehow this particular issue has not seen the light of day or committee action is inappropriate. 
We have heard in the discussion comments relative to the environmental impact of the road. If my assistant will help me, again I will show you pictures of the roads that are there. These aren't ghost roads, they are real roads. We have shown them to you before. That is the reality. These are the roads that are there. OK. Some of these roads are there and they are in the wilderness. 
Here is the map that shows where the roads break off and go into the wilderness, as opposed to those that are not in the wilderness. Few of the Members who have commented really want to reflect on this harsh reality. I will point out the roads in the wilderness that are there today. They are in the dark area here, as you can see with the pointer. This distinguishes the marking line that establishes the wilderness, so it is everything on the top of the picture that is wilderness. 
So the point is, there are roads in the wilderness. As we look at the environmental impact of those roads, they are what they are. They are dependent on about 100 people who live in Cold Bay and have access to those roads. Again, there are about 700 people in King Cove. So the impact is pretty small. 
Now, there was a mention by my friend from Montana that the reason the migratory waterfowl stopped in this area, you can recognize that it is a flat, tundra-like expanse with no trees. But the Senator from Montana knows the real reason that the black brants stopped there is for the eel grass; that is where the eel grass is, and they come and feed. He is quite correct. 
It is a unique day when, sometime in October, mid-October, and the wind currents are right, the brants take off, and their next point of landing is Cabo San Lucas in the Baja peninsula of Mexico. They actually go from this particular point, Izembek Bay, and they lose nearly a third of their body weight. The flight of these geese is really one of the wonders of the world. Hunting season is open by the U.S. Wildlife Service, and people hunt. I hunt, if I am able, with my friends, and we hunt geese. The lives of these geese are dependent on a number of factors. One is a recognition that hunting is allowed. This just isn't a plain wetlands, it is a unique wetlands. But the question is, Is it threatened by this activity? There is no evidence to suggest that it is threatened. 
Again, I emphasize this, and I think my friend from Massachusetts, in his comments a few minutes ago, missed the point. We are not talking about a road in the wilderness. He made the point that this would be the first road in the wilderness. This isn't a road in the wilderness, as I have said time and time again on the floor today. This is a land exchange. We are proposing to take the area in exchange by providing about 580 acres of additional wilderness in exchange for about 78 or 87 acres, if you will. 
What we are going to do is do a refuge with the exchange. We are going to put this area into a refuge, and then we are going to add to the wilderness the yellow areas, which is a substantial increase of 580 acres. It is a net, net, net gain. 
How can anybody who is interested in acquiring more wilderness be against this when there are 580 acres of additional wilderness being offered? We are doing a land exchange and putting the proposed road through the refuge. It is a big difference. We are not setting a precedent. I wish the staffs listening to this would recognize that there is no road going through a wilderness. There is a wilderness exchange. We are putting it in a refuge and it is a net, net increase. 
Hovercraft is an interesting mode of transportation. I wish it were a viable alternative. We have had lots of experience with Hovercraft in Alaska. They require a tremendous amount of maintenance. They are very expensive to operate. Mind you, we are talking about, again, 700 people in King Cove--a very small population. Who is going to underwrite the cost of the Hovercraft? You have to have it available year-round, and maintenance, and you have to have operating personnel. 
If you have ever been in a Hovercraft--and I have--they are a unique mode of transportation. They skid, because you have a lift from a fan that lifts the vehicle up over whatever it is, whether it is water, ice, or tundra. Then you have another fan that gives you movement ahead. But as you turn, you have no rudders. The Hovercraft has a tendency to skid because there is no rudder, in a sense, that basically digs in and gives immediate direction. You have to be careful when you are moving a Hovercraft and you come up on any cut banks. They will make a corner, but they skid as they go around the corner and you can bang into a cut bank where the edge of the river is and you could find yourself in trouble. It takes a good deal of experience to operate these, and the cost of operation is extremely high. 
We have roads all over the United States, and, sure, they cost money. People use them and they facilitate the lifestyle of the people. Somebody said $30 million could build the road. Well, you are pulling that out of some kind of a study, or whatever. These roads that are in these pictures certainly don't cost $30 million a mile. We have estimates that the type of road we are talking about is substantially less--somewhere less than $5 million or $6 million. You are not talking about anything substantial here, as the occupant of the Chair knows. There is no drainage on either side, and they are not ditched. 
There is another thing I am confounded about in this debate. They talk about avalanches. I defy anybody looking at this picture to tell me where the avalanche is going to come from. This is tundra. This is where you are talking about putting a road in the refuge. They are not talking about any avalanches in the refuge. 
Whether it is refuge, or, as my friend from Massachusetts indicates, wilderness, there are no cliffs. Where is the snow going to hang from to avalanche? There is near King Cove some hilly area, but that is in a different area than we are proposing a land exchange. That is really not part of the argument over whether you are going to have an avalanche potential. And, obviously, you have the potential of avalanches in areas where you have deep snow. 
King Cove isn't one of them, I might add. You have them in areas where you have heavy concentrations of snow, like Valdez, and other areas. That is not a legitimate concern. But to lump this in the arguments that we have a wilderness, a bird sanctuary, that we have avalanches and mountains, and we can duck hunt. You don't duck hunt from the mountains. It is a composite of the areas that we are talking about. But the land exchange is just what it is. It is in this tundra area, and you are not subjected, as indicated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to any extreme elements such as snow that would be put in their advisory, which they make available to all visitors. 
The state-of-the-art ferry we have discussed. Who is going to pay for it? A ferry suggests a crew, and several millions of dollars. We just built a new ferry. What was it, a couple hundred million dollars? Obviously, we are talking about a different type of ferry. It costs a lot of money. 
They talk about Penn Air. They do a fine job. We are talking about two trips a day. Do you know how many passengers that airplane carries in two trips a day? It is not a 747. It is not even a DC-3. It is a Piper Navajo. It carries six people. That is what you are looking at. They say, `Wow. Two trips a day, 1100 in a year.' That is a six-passenger airplane. 
Another thing that I think is important to note as we debate this--and the other side throws figures around--is the Congressional Budget Office has determined that this bill is revenue neutral. The point was made, `Well, you know. If the State decides to build this road someday, it can use its share of Federal funds that the State receives.' Who are any of you to criticize what our State determines are its priorities with its share of the Federal funds? The suggestion was made here on the floor a few minutes ago that you shouldn't. If you do, that is on this road in the refuge. That is nobody's business but Alaska's, thank you very much. 
We talk about, `Well, let's put this off a little longer.' We have been doing it for 14 years. We have 10 studies. We have a book of them. I don't know. 
Mr. President, these aren't very well dusted off. But here are just about eight of the studies over the last 14 years. And some of you recommend that we continue to do what? Do nothing; do studies. I am sure that the people who do these studies are glad to hear that. 
There has been some talk about a causeway. What is a causeway, Mr. President? I know the occupant of the Chair knows what it is. It is kind of a road, isn't it? It is an access over an area called a causeway. It carries a road. This was the proposed study by the Corps of Engineers. Somebody suggested that $700,000 is in the bank. Well, I would be willing to make a small wager to any Member that we don't see that money. That $700,000, if it exists at all, in my opinion is pie in the sky at this time. 
The point is that while we look at alternatives, we have been looking at them for 14 years. We can look at them again. But the constituents that I have are saying enough is enough. We can study options until the cows come home. 
I noted that the Senator from Arkansas indicated that he had a letter from one Myron Naneng who is associated with the Association of Village Council Presidents. What my friend does not know about the AVCP is that their major concern is the spring bird hunt. The Senator from Montana knows. People, for their subsistence, are allowed to take migratory birds in the spring. 
What we have here is a little bitterness, if you will, which occurs sometimes between he, I, and others, differences of opinion. This particular AVCP individual has taken it upon himself to express his opinion, which he certainly has every right to do, but his interest is to protect the rights of the village council president to proceed with their spring bird hunts. I have supported that position as a subsistence use. 
There is also a criticism. They have a little infighting between the groups. There is a lack of support for a curtailment of the interception of the fisheries issue as far as fall trapping. There is a little dispute between the residents of King Cove and the village council presidents. 
So do not take this with a grain of salt, Mr. President, because the more appropriate reference is the attitude of the collective voice of the Native people of Alaska. That is expressed by the Alaska Federation of Natives. 
I have a letter here dated April 29 addressed to me.  
Dear Chairman Murkowski: 
Attached, please find a copy of the 1997 AFN Convention resolution. This resolution is entitled `A Resolution of the Alaska Federation of Natives Supporting the Ability to Obtain Right-of-Way Through National Wildlife Refuges for the Necessity of Improving Health and Safety Issues in Alaska.' The Delegates to the 1997 Annual Convention of Alaska Federation of Natives unanimously passed this resolution. 
I hope the resolution will assist you in passing legislation involving King Cove for the purposes of obtaining a right-of-way for that community through a land exchange. 
That is the voice of the Native people of Alaska.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
I might add that from April 3rd to August 28th, there were 16 specific medevacs. The first one on April 3rd, there was a 2-hour delay; 14th, 1-hour delay; May 5, an hour delay; no delays in the two in May; there were no delays in June; on July 5, there was a 1-day delay. Not an hour, Mr. President, a 1-day delay; July 8, 3-hour delay; July 28, 1-day delay; July 28, 1-day delay; August 9, a miscarriage, no delay; August 20, pneumonia, 1-day delay. 
These are the official records that indicate what is really happening. The only difference is this is summertime. This is the good weather. 
Try it on October, November, December, or January. 
To give you some idea, this is from the National Weather Service, Marine Desk, lower south side Alaska peninsula, including waters near Cold Bay and King Cove. On the following days in March, small craft advisory warnings; winds between 25 and 34 knots were issued, not only on the 7th, 8th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, 20th, and 21st, but on the following days in March of the same year, gale warnings of 35 to 50 knots were issued on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 22nd, 25th, 26th, 31st. 
There is more air around there than there certainly is around here. 
And the following days in March wind advisories greater than 50 knots were issued, on the 23d, 24th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th. Only 5 days during the month were there no marine advisories in this area. That is what we are talking about in Cold Bay and King Cove. It is not just once in a while. 
Now, what is hypocrisy? Well, let's try this on for consideration. It might be the Clinton administration and the Washington green lobby opposing a small, one-lane gravel road in an Alaska wildlife refuge to allow a few Aleut Native people to reach emergency medical care while at the same time allowing an international airport to expand a runway--a runway, Mr. President--into a wildlife refuge which is the home to endangered species and provides essential habitat for waterfowl and migratory birds. Where is the Senator from Arkansas? Where is the Senator from Montana? Where is the Senator from Massachusetts? Where is the righteousness as to what is happening? 
Well, I see a look of concern. On September 21, 1998, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that they had reached an agreement with the Metropolitan Airport Commission to allow a new runway at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport which would severely impact the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Bloomington, MN. The Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge currently consists of 9,429 acres of land. This agreement will require the replacement of 4,000 acres of refuge land which will be impacted by what? Well, let's try aircraft noise. I quote. Here it comes, gentlemen. 
`We would have preferred to keep our refuge and our programs intact,' says Rich Schultz, refuge manager. `But we certainly recognize the need for safe, reliable air transportation so I am glad we were able to come to an agreement at least in principle. It will take a lot of effort to relocate our facility's programs, but this should be done to allow us to provide additional opportunities for our growing Metro population.' 
Well, what is hypocrisy, Mr. President? Perhaps there is no comparison between the minimal potential impact on wildlife from a small gravel road with an occasional--an occasional--car passing in a 300,000 acre wildlife refuge in an area that is excluded from the wilderness and the hundreds of jets--hundreds? Come on, let's talk about thousands of jets--taking off each week from an international airport over a smaller, 9,000 acre refuge in Minnesota. 
Well, we have heard the Senator from Arkansas say the President is going to veto this. We have heard that before. Well, charity starts at home, Mr. President. The Clinton administration has made a purely political decision, and I think it is a cruel one at that. It takes into consideration not the people of King Cove or their dreams of access. It would deny medical care for Alaska Natives while giving the population of Minneapolis a jetway with enormous impacts on the environment with regard to noise and air pollution. 
Well, I guess that is the way it goes around here. But nevertheless, I think everyone would recognize there is certainly an injustice. Imagine that. The excuse is the refuge manager recognizes the need for safe, reliable transportation. But here again we are proceeding to allow a new runway that would impact on the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Bloomington, MN, consisting of 9,429 acres of land and the agreement will require the replacement of 4,000 acres of refuge land. 
So there we have it, Mr. President. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, somebody once said. Now, I don't know if there is a value, commercial value in expanding that runway, but I would let the example speak for itself. 
There are a couple more things I want to say in conclusion. Staff did a good job of preparing to respond to some of the statements that have been made in the debate, and I would be remiss not to address them at this time. We have done a little research here, and I hope that our comments are an accurate reflection because they are taken from the Record. 
Back on Tuesday, September 29, the statement by the Senator from Montana states: 
Mr. President, the rider establishes a very troubling precedent. Congress has never authorized the construction of a road through a wilderness area. 
The fact is the proposal does not authorize construction of a road through a wilderness. I think I made that point time and time again. The language authorizes a boundary adjustment which Congress routinely has used to provide access through wilderness areas, most notably, the Lee Metcalf Act of 1983, which withdrew several acres in Montana for a road to a fishing hole. I know my colleague already addressed that. 
Later the Senator from Montana said: 
The bill would cut the refuge in half. 
Well, the refuge is 300,000 acres. The proposed road corridor skirts the very edge of the refuge impacting only less than 0.3 percent of the refuge land. The proposed road corridor is 3 miles south, south mind you, of the Izembek lagoon complex and is separated by 3 miles of terrain. The reason you move it back is an obvious one. You want to get away from the immediate tidal wetlands area and put it in a little higher area of elevation. 
Further, the Senator from Montana indicated: 
Mr. President, this is a road that now exists in part of the wilderness area. This is what is there now. This is what would be contemplated. As you can tell, it is a pretty good size road. It is no small, little cow path. 
And that was the picture the Senator had. The facts are the road would be, well, not more than 60 feet wide taking up only 85 acres through 7 miles of the refuge. In return, the Natives would return 664 acres--664 acres of privately owned lands to the refuge. The road would be constructed of gravel, like many of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife roads that are already present in the refuge. So I think that is a factual rebuttal. 
And if I may continue. Furthermore, on September 29, the Senator from Montana indicated: 
There are many ways to address the legitimate transportation problems at King Cove without violating the Izembek refuge: Coast Guard air evacuation is one; better port facilities and special marine ambulances are another; as well as telemedicine and other medical advances. 
We have been studying it for 14 years. The fact is the Coast Guard does not, will not, and cannot handle the dangerous conditions associated with the numerous land-based evacuations. It is a policy matter. To do so would put lives at risk and would fundamentally alter the Coast Guard's mission, which is a sea mission. You have 20-foot seas, and 50-knot winds are not uncommon in the area. Portions of Cold Bay can freeze in the winter. Telemedicine, of course, as we have heard from Senator Frist, while of benefit, will not reattach limbs and certainly cannot alter the care of premature births. 
There was a reference further by the Senator from Montana: 
The fact of the matter is when you look a lot deeper into this, the real impetus behind the road may not be emergency medical evacuation. That is not the real driving force here. Really, it is that the folks there have an economic interest in having a road. 
Mr. President, this road is about saving lives. The economics is not part of the equation. Marine transportation is the manner in which the products in cold storage, in the canning operation, in fish processing, move. They move traditionally that way because the value of the product simply does not support moving it by air, and anybody in the business will tell you so, including the residents there. 
But last, no one on the other side has addressed this: We provide the authority for the Secretary of the Interior to close the road for nonemergency use. What more could we do? If he sees this road is being inappropriately used, he can close it, he can limit it--whatever. This is about lives. 
What has happened here is extremely unfortunate. The leaders in the environmental community, some of whom may be listening--I hope they are--somehow have decided to dig in on this. `Break your pick on this one. This is the issue.' 
It is the issue at whose expense? The Aleut people in King Cove. They are too far away to be heard from. It is too expensive to go out and see them. So we will just stand on this one. Let me tell you what our health care providers say when they speak up, and these are people who are treating people in rural Alaska. It is an issue of access. It is an issue of life. There it is. I quote:  
The greatest limiting factor to air ambulance is weather and the condition of the airport [at King Cove]. Being able to use the Cold Bay facility will enhance our ability to get in and continue care of patients . . . if the road saves one life, it's worth it. 
This is from Dean C. Dow, MICP, Lifeflight Emergency Evacuation Service, Alaska Regional Hospital, Anchorage. 
They are out there, taking care of the people who use the medivac. 
The next one: 
Distance between communities in Alaska dwarfs many states in the Lower 48 and telecommunications are often sketchy. A wise person once said, `If a successful fax transmission is a blessing, then successful telemedicine transmissions could be a miracle . . . the telehealth system will not carry a human body that needs advanced medical care . . . it will only enhance medical care. It will not remove the need for treacherous evacuations that so often take place from King Cove.' 
Kathy Boucha-Roberts, director of alliances and telemedicine, Providence Health System, Anchorage. 
Next one: 
All we want is safe access for our people. We see the road as our only hope. 
Della Trumble, King Cove Native Corporation: 
The King Cove Medical Clinic (a small, four-room building) [that is all they have] is forced to take drastic measures and lose critical time in attempting to complete a medivac--travel by boat in dangerous sea conditions . . . a road between King Cove and Cold Bay would bring us to our Medivac flight and into the 20th Century in emergency response. 
Let's see the picture. This is the facility at King Cove. It has the Red Cross on it. That is it. If you get your leg broken, have a baby--whatever--that is all you have. It is a lot better than nothing. But when you are in need of something--look at cloud cover here. You might see that in the picture. This is a good day in King Cove, believe me. 
The last one: 
Inclement weather severely impacts prompt medical air evacuations. Medivac by fishing vessel is directly affected by wind, ice and poor visibility, making offloading the patient on a dock extremely stressful and hazardous . . . the King Cove Rescue Squad believes that the road to Cold Bay is a necessary alternative to existing air and boat medivac. 
Marilyn Mack, emergency medical technician, King Cove. 
Mind you, this is an effort by 700 people, a very small village, to be heard in the Congress of the United States. Let us see what our Members have said about access to health care. Some have said access to health care is a right. I agree. 
It is absolutely essential that Montanans have access to quality health care without having to cover massive distances. Sometimes getting to a hospital can be the difference between life and death. 
That is my good friend, the Senator from Montana. 
We have the best health care in the world in many respects, but it is available to people only if they are able to access the kind of doctors they need . . . people ought to be able to seek emergency room care if they need emergency room care. 
That is my friend, Senator Dorgan. I agree. 
Denying our citizens an opportunity to participate in the greatest advances that are taking place in the medical profession is effectively a death sentence . . . it is really an issue of lifesaving protections. 
Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts. 
We must ensure that quality health care is there for people when they need it . . . we must protect patients from decisions made by accountants and bureaucrats in insurance companies and have their health care decisions made by physicians. 
Senator Barbara Boxer. 
Patients should have access to health care professionals who are qualified to treat their conditions and not forced to accept people without the proper professional credentials . . . if a doctor believes a certain treatment is necessary, as a matter of right, that doctor's judgment should prevail. 
Senator Robert Torricelli, New Jersey. 
That is what some of our colleagues are saying about the right to have access to health care. That is what I am saying, what our senior Senator is saying--the right to have access, the best access, the most practical access. It is the access that would be brought about by this exchange which we are proposing, an exchange in the wilderness for an additional area of wilderness of about 580 acres. 
Mr. President, I inquire of the time remaining on both sides.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation regarding the Export-Import Bank. This legislation is both pro-trade and pro-environment. 
Let me start by saying that I support U.S. international finance institutions like Ex-Im Bank, OPIC and TDA because they are necessary to level the playing field for American companies seeking to compete abroad. In a perfect world, such government assistance would be unnecessary, but we know that the other industrialized countries are using government financing to sweeten the pot for their companies' participation in international projects. 
My legislation addresses the well-meaning environmental policies of the Bank that are actually harming the environment while undermining American competitiveness. Specifically, my legislation does two things: First, it directs the Ex-Im Bank to negotiate a mulitlateral agreement with the export financing agencies of all G-7 countries to address environmentally sensitive development overseas. Second, until such agreement is reached, my legislation would allow U.S. companies to compete on equal footing with other international companies bidding on international projects. In other words, my legislation would ensure that American companies have access to Ex-Im Bank financing for overseas projects where other G-7 countries are providing or have indicated an intent to provide financing to the project in question without conditioning such assistance on environmental policies or procedures. 
Mr. President, under current law, the Ex-Im Bank can deny financing to U.S. companies seeking to participate in international projects when the Bank's environmental concerns have not been adequately addressed by foreign countries. But there is no mechanism in place to ensure that all G-7 countries abide by the same set of rules or environmental standards in competing for such projects. The net effect of this law is to impose unilateral sanctions on U.S. companies in the name of the environment. 
The lack of American participation in the largest hydroelectric project in the World, the $24.5 billion Three Gorges Dam Project in China, illustrates why this change in law is necessary. The mission of the Ex-Im Bank is to promote U.S. exports and U.S. jobs. Yet, the Bank refused to provide financial guarantees for this project because the Bank's environmental concerns had not been satisfactorily addressed by the Chinese government. 
There were two perverse outcomes from the Bank's decision. First, the project is going ahead anyway without the environmental technologies and practices our companies' participation would bring. And second, the only American participation is by companies that are large enough to use their foreign subsidiaries with another government's financing, and consequently the jobs are going to the Japanese, the Canadians and the Europeans. 
A letter that I received from the President of Rotec Industries, located in Elmhurst, Illinois, explains the detrimental effects of the Ex-Im Banks decision. Rotec submitted a bid to the Chinese government for $130 million of U.S.-made concrete placing and transporting equipment. Following the Ex-Im Bank's negative decision they received an order for only a fraction of their proposal. A Japanese-French consortium received an order for `Rotec-equivalent' equipment. But it gets worse. As Rotec's president explained: 
No Ex-Im financing meant no made-in-the-USA requirements and no made-in-the-USA price premium . . . For the first time in our 32-year history, Rotec subcontracted manufacturing to companies in South Korea. The effect on U.S. jobs is easy to quantify . . . Rotec will have spent over $13,000,000 in South Korea. With Ex-Im's support, this work--and probably more--would have stayed in the United States. 
But this was not the only bad news for Rotec. Before Ex-Im's decision, Rotec was the world's only manufacturer of this specialized equipment. But the Japanese-French consortium selected by the Chinese have now copied Rotec's product. As Rotec's president described it, Ex-Im's decision helped open the door and they [the consortium] walked right in. Rotec will likely face foreign competition wherever this product is needed.' 
Other U.S. companies who sought to participate in the Three Gorges Dam project tell a similar story. Caterpillar estimates that it lost $200 million in sales. GE routed its bid through its Canadian subsidiary. Voight Hydro of Pennsylvania had to withdraw its bid in favor of its German parent, which won $85 million of contracts. 
Although my legislation cannot retroactively change the effect of the Ex-Im Bank's decision on U.S. participation in the Three Gorges Dam project, we will face this issue again. A recent New York Times story quoted Chinese officials who pledge to spend $1.2 trillion on a vast program of new infrastructure projects over the next three years. Included in those projects are plans to build five large hydroelectric power stations over the next 12 years, at a cost exceeding $7 billion. Although this is small compared to Three Gorges, it presents excellent opportunities for U.S. companies. In addition, the Chinese have plans to order a new nuclear plant each year for the next 20 years. This emerging Chinese market is estimated to be worth $1.65 billion per year in U.S. nuclear exports, supporting an equivalent of 25,400 full time American jobs. 
I am told that the environmental lobbyists are out in full force against this legislation. Environmental groups have circulated a letter stating that my legislation would mean that `[t]he United States Government will likely support dangerous nuclear power plants, unsustainable logging of primary forests, and huge hydroelectric dams resettling millions of people in developing countries with no environmental safeguards allowed.' 
Mr. President, let me just respond to their claim that nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams should not be funded on environmental grounds. China is a case in point. By 2015 China will surpass the United States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. According to the World Health Organization, 6 of the 10 most polluted cities in the world are in China. Coal supplies three-quarters of China's energy and is choking its cities. Already, hundreds of thousands of Chinese die premature deaths each year from chronic respiratory illness. Thousands more died this year from flooding of the Yangtze River and millions more were displaced. 
Mr. President, how can the environmentalists ignore the benefits to China's environment, indeed to the World's environment, of helping China turn to cleaner forms of energy such as hydro and nuclear? The 18,200 megawatt Three Gorges Dam will replace the equivalent of thirty-six 500 megawatt coal fossil plants. In a country suffocating on dirty air, how can any rational environmental policy promote coal and penalize clean burning hydro and nuclear power? Of course, hydro and nuclear plants have environmental consequences. Every form of energy production does. Even windmills become cuisinarts for birds. But countries such as China have the right to determine which consequences she can accept. 
Let's make sure that Ex-Im does not unilaterally rule out American participation in future projects. Support my legislation and vote to help American companies compete.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that was brought up on this floor yesterday by my friend, the senior Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, who proceeded to give us certain views on a number of amendments to the Interior appropriations bill that he proposed be stripped from that particular package. 
Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that this body have an opportunity to view the arguments on the other side of the issues, and I think it is fair to perhaps provide a little history on what these amendments are and the rationale associated with the arguments for or against their merits. 
There were originally nine proposed amendments in the Baucus package. Two of them have been removed. So we are addressing amendments to strip the Glacier Bay language, King Cove language, and the Tongass language, road decommissioning, section 321 of the forest planning, the issue of the reintroduction of grizzlies in Idaho and Montana, and the Columbia and Snake River Dams, and the likely removal. I am going to enunciate a little further on these as I go along, but I wanted to give you a view of the issues in their entirety so that we can, first of all, recognize that these have certain environmental overtones. 
I think it is appropriate that we recognize the extent to which the environmental community has gone to encourage these be stricken. Approximately 2 weeks ago, there was a press conference downtown in one of the restaurants where the media was invited. There was a presentation condemning these issues, and obviously an effort to try to generate a one-sided view from the media. 
As chairman of the Energy Committee, and representing the State of Alaska, to which three of these particular amendments to strike are associated, and not having an opportunity to have an invitation extended to me, we felt it necessary to balance the process at that point. So we proceeded with a small press conference in the Energy Library. We invited basically the same media. We had a good attendance. I also invited my friend from Montana to attend in the hopes that we could respond to some questions from the media on these individual points. Unfortunately, he was unable to be there. As a consequence, we have each had an opportunity to express our views to the media. 
I think it is also appropriate to recognize that there used to be, more or less, a gentleman's agreement in this body relative to resource issues and issues that affected a particular State. When Senators from the State made specific recommendations with regard to what was in the best interests of their State, it usually stood. But that has changed over the years. I recognize that. Now we have the input of the special interest groups relative to issues. That is kind of where we are today. 
What I have done here is attempted to set the stage a little bit. I think it is fair to recognize that there are other influences. I noted today a statement of our Vice President in the White House Briefing Room from yesterday. It is relatively brief, but it does criticize the Republican Congress, the Republican leadership, and I think the third paragraph bears some attention. It suggests that there is a sneak attack being perpetrated by the Republicans and by their special interests riders in the budget bills where they hope no one will find them. He further indicates that the proposals are to carve roads through the wilderness, force overcutting in the national forests, sell the taxpayers short, and keep us from addressing global warming, and that these issues cannot stand the light of day. 
I think it is appropriate to recognize that there are other influences. I was checking with my staff before I was recognized this morning. Mr. President, I am advised that the Congressional Budget Office has scored all of these particular riders as revenue neutral. 
Since we are in the interest of full disclosure, I think it also is important to recognize another fact; that is, the accusation of putting anti-environmental riders on the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. It seems to be a pretty one-sided argument, because I am sure the Senator from Montana would not object to the process of riders, recognizing that there are 150--150--riders on the Interior bill. 
From the standpoint of the special interest groups, maybe the Vice President, and others, we could remove all such riders, including the moratorium of offshore oil drilling off the coast of California, and items on mining. I think it is fair to point out that the National Forest System--at least the first 21 million acres of the Forest System--was created by riders and amendments to the 1897 appropriations bill. 
So, indeed, we have a history of riders. I think if you look at the issues from the standpoint of the environmental groups, they would say, well, the riders that I have mentioned are good riders. So I think it is fair that we recognize we have a time-honored tradition of riders. And if riders are under attack, so be it. But it is clearly not a reality because many of these riders could be perceived as antienvironment suggests that somehow there is a sleight of hand here. 
I think it is appropriate to note that my friend from Montana did not care to go into that, to recognize that all the riders in question here have had hearings. Hearings have been held, which suggests that this was not done in the dark of night, somehow by subterfuge. 
So again I would like to examine this a little bit more so that we can get, I think, a better understanding of just what is going on here, and the question of merit: Do these particular seven issues have merit? I am not going to go into detail on all of them because a few of them are not necessarily related to my State, but I think it fair to highlight certainly a few. I am going to start with the issue of Glacier Bay. 
The issue of Glacier Bay started a long, long time ago. Back in 1885, long before Glacier Bay was declared a national monument, commercial fishing was recognized as a way of life by the residents around the area. 
I should point out, Glacier Bay is in southeastern Alaska. It is west of Juneau. Juneau is over here. I was a little chagrined yesterday in the debate when my friend from Montana could not find Juneau, which is our State capital. I made a point to make sure I knew where Helena is before this morning, before I started the debate. 
But in any event, it is in the area across icy straits. It is an extraordinary area of great beauty. As you move out of Glacier Bay and go out west, you run into the Gulf of Alaska or the Pacific Ocean. On a map of Alaska, it would be the northernmost point of southeastern Alaska. But the significance of it is that it is a national monument. As such, it is under special consideration relative to the regulations of the Park Service, which manages Glacier Bay. 
Over the years, local residents in the area--and I am suggesting to you there are very few local residents. There is no population in Glacier Bay. There is a lodge there but no year-round population, with the exception of those who are associated with the lodge and a few people in Gustavus, which is out on the edge of Glacier Bay. The general feeling in Alaska was that there would be a compatibility between the Park Service, the management of Glacier Bay, and the traditional uses, and there was no prohibition, no anticipated prohibition, on commercial fishing in the marine waters of Glacier Bay. 
I have a small picture here, Mr. President, that shows one of the fishing vessels in Glacier Bay. It gives you an idea that these are small one- and usually two-person operations. This is a small boat, with probably a skipper, a deckhand, maybe the skipper's wife, and this is the kind of fishing that is done there. It is relatively insignificant in the overall magnitude of fishing in southeastern Alaska. The fishery consists of a few vessels fishing salmon, halibut, crab, a few bottom fish; and these fisheries pose no threat--there is no danger to these resources. All are carefully managed for a sustainable harvest by the State of Alaska and most are under a limited entry, which means that you can't expand the fishery, or particularly a fishery associated with that type of vessel. 
Arguments that this fishing is somehow incompatible with the use of kayaking or some other activity by the concession operators who favor a prohibition is a little hard to justify in real terms. Commercial fishing is important to the smaller communities of Gustavus and Hoonah. Fishing provides a few jobs and local employment. All the communities urge continuation of commercial and sports fishing in Glacier Bay. 
We have had our local environmental groups working with us, and we have reached a consensus that management of commercial fishing under the State regulation is entirely appropriate and entirely adequate and the fisheries can be managed on a sustained basis. The interest of the Department of Interior's insistence on an administrative rulemaking instead of legislation has really been a roadblock, and it has had a detrimental effect, if you will, on working together within the local groups. There is a lot of criticism and fear in the communities that both commercial fishing and subsistence fishing will be terminated as a consequence of the pressure by the environmental community. 
When we look at the communities we are talking about--I mentioned Gustavus; it has about 346 residents, 55 of whom are engaged in fishing; Elfin Cove, 54 people--that is total residents--47 engaged in fishing; Hoonah, which is a Tlingit Indian village, has 900 people, about 228 in fishing; Pelican has 187 residents, 86 in fisheries. 
That might not sound like much, but in reality, if you are one of those people and you are dependent on fishing--that is the livelihood you know--it is recognizable that these communities cannot survive without fishing. And what this appropriation language does as to Glacier Bay is to allow discussions to proceed at the local level and reserve the right of the Congress to make a decision on fisheries in Glacier Bay. 
Now, what the Park Service is attempting to do is to phase it out over a 7-year period. Well, to phase it out is to ultimately do away with it, and the rationale behind that is that the Park Service wants to regulate the area. These are inland waters in the State of Alaska, and to suggest the Park Service should initiate another level of regulation I think is without any justification. 
We talk about how a fishing boat or a small amount of activity in Glacier Bay would somehow detract from a visitor's experience. Let's talk a little bit about the visitor's experience, because between Memorial Day and Labor Day cruise ships go into Glacier Bay--as I indicated, a very large body of water. The cruise ships pick up at Inlet Bay a Park Service lecturer and proceed up the bay and may go into Tarring or may go up Muir Inlet, depending on whatever the particular direction is that day. 
But it is important to note that these are commercial passenger ships. There is a commercial activity associated with this. These are paying passengers. These ships carry 2,500, 3,000, 3,200 passengers. It is a commercial activity that is going on in a national park. It is taking place, if you will, in this general area of the so-called wilderness. 
Now, the wilderness, of course, is on the land, and we have yet to have a determination of just what `wilderness waters' means. I am not going to go into that in this debate today. But the point I want to make is, the small amount of commercial fishing that takes place there and the residents in the surrounding area who depend on access into Glacier Bay is what we are talking about. 
Now, the Senator from Montana would suggest that somehow this commercial activity is foreign or inappropriate to take place in a national monument. We have nowhere in the United States any body of water as unique as Glacier Bay. It is open to the ocean. Commercial vessels can come in. It is State of Alaska waters. But within the area, of course, is the national park of Glacier Bay. 
The point I want to make is that the Park Service is attempting to eliminate the small amount of commercial fishing and, equally important, the small amount of subsistence fishing that takes place in the park by the Native residents of Hoonah and some of the other communities nearby. There is no justification for this in the sense of any detrimental effects on the fisheries resources which are basically overseen by the State of Alaska. 
I might point out that in this area there are no major anadromous streams, that being streams that will support salmon fry. The salmon don't go into these areas because this is all glacial types of water. 
As a consequence, they simply cannot survive in the runoff from the glaciers. As a consequence, this is not considered an area that supports significant salmon runs. There is some halibut in here, some salmon, some crab. Again, it is a relatively small area, but the point is, what we are seeing here is more big government, more takeover from the local people who have had access to commercial fishing, who have had access to sport fishing, as well as access to subsistence. 
In summary, the objection that I have is here is Big Brother encroaching more and more upon authority that has been vested within the State of Alaska to manage the fisheries in this area. It just simply makes no sense, and there is no justification for it. 
I want to turn now to another issue that is on the list of my friend from Montana, and that is the issue of King Cove, Cold Bay. Many people, of course, are not aware of just where this area is. 
Roughly, it is about halfway out in the Aleutian Islands, about 700 miles west of Anchorage. We have a small village of about 700 residents in King Cove. The area is on the Pacific Ocean, and it is surrounded by mountains. It lends itself to a situation where if you want to get out of King Cove, you have to fly over to Cold Bay or go by boat. It doesn't look like much on the map, but the problems we have are extraordinary weather conditions associated in the King Cove/Cold Bay area. 
There is a small gravel strip at King Cove. Sometimes we have a windsock blowing one way at one end of the runway and a windsock at the other end blowing the opposite way because of the various types of winds that come over the mountains. The people of the area have suggested it would be appropriate to have a road come over to Cold Bay. 
There is going to be an extended debate on this issue tomorrow, so I am not going to go into great detail other than to say that we have had 11 lives lost in the last 10 years in plane crashes half of which involved medivacs. This chart shows pictures of some of the individuals who have passed away in aircraft accidents trying to get over to Cold Bay to get a medivac to Anchorage, AK. 
What these people are asking for is simply access out by road. What would this consist of, Mr. President? It would consist of extending the road in an area that is currently a wilderness. The proposed legislation which we are going to be offering tomorrow suggests that we would take the area in the wilderness and do a land exchange. We would take the area out of the wilderness, approximately 85 acres, and put it into a refuge. That will add about 580 acres additional into the wilderness. It would be a net gain into the wilderness of some 580 acres. This road would be about 7 miles long and would allow the residents of King Cove to have access for medical evacuations and transportation when the weather is so severe that the airplanes cannot fly. 
Let me show you a picture of the current method by which the medivacs take place, and you can get some idea of the extremes we are up against. Here is what a small boat trying to get across water in that area in the wintertime looks like. You don't get very far doing that. We have other pictures that will make you seasick. This is one of the vessels going across. That is a schooner going across in the wintertime. 
You cannot appreciate the terror associated with making one of those trips. Not only do most people get deathly seasick, but there is a fear the storm is going to progress and damage the vessel or sink the vessel. I have been on some of those trips, and I could not begin to describe the terror of the situation where you are trying to get people out so that they can get medical care in an emergency and are subjected to this type of exposure when 7 miles of road circumventing a wilderness area would be adequate. 
This airport at Cold Bay was built during the Second World War. It has crosswind runways and is operational virtually year-round. What we have is a small village, less than 700 people, simply trying to have the same right of access for medical evacuation that you and I take for granted, and it is being denied them by objections from some in the environmental community that say that this is striking in the heart of the wilderness. 
It is not in the wilderness, Mr. President. We are taking this area out of the wilderness, putting it in the refuge and proposing a right of way that could be used for a road going through and actually adding 580 acres to the wilderness. That, to me, seems like a fair and justifiable proposal. 
I will also add that we do not require any funding for this. This is simply a land exchange. The road would be under the control and jurisdiction of the refuge manager and, basically, under the control of the Secretary of the Interior. 
The weather in the King Cove area is something that is pretty hard to imagine. It is the third windiest city in the United States. It is the cloudiest city in the United States. It has the third highest number of days of rain, and one can argue it has the worst weather in the Nation. To take a boat or small plane out of King Cove when winds are 60 to 70 miles an hour, with a 10-to-20 foot sea is a tough situation. 
We have had babies born in fishing boat galleys on a table, and we have had people who have had to be taken up off the boats in slings. This land exchange will allow a one-lane gravel road to be built. It will be at the option of the State. The State is evaluating the merits of this. We are simply proposing that the State has the ability to consider this option through the land exchange. We see no justification for those who object to what is really a win, win, win for the environment. 
I also think it fair to point out that we have seen and have a long history in this body of changes in boundaries. To suggest somehow this is a precedent is, again, unrealistic and is unfounded by fact. We have had boundary adjustments on many existing wilderness areas. In the State of Montana alone, we had 67 acres of land that was deleted from Absaroka Bear Tooth Wilderness; 28 acres have been deleted from the U.L. Bend Wilderness. The boundary changes were made to exclude private lands, portions of existing roads, parking areas and public facilities that were inadvertently included when the wilderness area was established in 1978.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
So, Mr. President, where we are today is we are fighting a battle to maintain an industry on a substantially reduced basis. As I have indicated, that industry has declined dramatically over the last 10 years. And the Forest Service clearly has not been acting in good faith to get out the timber that they promised. And the fact that the Forest Service has seen fit to initiate over a 10-year period this extraordinary evaluation of what the TLUMP would provide and the assurance of whatever figure they set they would be committed to is what this issue is all about. 
So, again, in conclusion, on the Tongass issue, it is not a question by any means, Mr. President, of doubling the cut. And that is what some of our friends on the other side would like to make this issue seem like. If we were going to double the cut, we would go back to 450 million board feet. That is not what we are talking about today. 
Finally, a couple of other issues that I think need some clarification very briefly, and that is the requirement of decommissioning our unauthorized roads. It is not an issue that is unique to my State by any means, but under this provision the Forest Service is prohibited from using funds for decommissioning National Forest System roads until the regional forester certifies that unauthorized or so-called ghost roads have either been decommissioned or reconstructed to standard. 
Funding is appropriated for decommissioned roads including roads which are not part of the transportation Forest Service, and it is not prevented from addressing or pursuing stabilization of these roads. So what we have here is a recognition that the administration says that they have a backlog over the last 5 to 10 years of over $10 million. 
They have said in reported stories they have discovered 60,000 miles of ghost road that they did not even know they had. What we propose is that they go ahead and address the ghost roads and get rid of them before they start proceeding on decommissioning their so-called map roads. If you have a situation where you have so-called unauthorized roads, then you should take care of those first before you start decommissioning map roads. 
The other issue revolving around the Forest Service, and not necessarily addressing the needs of my State, is the prohibition of forest plans until the administration publishes new regulations. 
Late in 1995, the Secretary of Agriculture promised a revised forest plan. He promised cost-effective changes. Well, these plans are not completed today. And as a consequence, we see no justification for proceeding in publishing new regulations until you get your current Forest Service revision plan done. 
The last issue I want to talk about, and again it is not unique to my State, but it is to some of the areas involved, and that is the reintroduction of the grizzly bear into Idaho and Montana. I think that is a matter that should be addressed by the individuals from these States. But I know the ranchers and others have certain views about reintroduction of the grizzlies. 
And one thing about the bears, the moose, and the elk, and so forth, there are no boundaries or State lines that prohibit their crossing. They move in ranges depending on a lot of factors, including regulations on hunting. So to suggest that somehow reintroduction of the grizzly bears in the Sellway-Bitterroot areas of Idaho and Montana should be proceeded by the Department of Interior over the objection of the residents is something that is best left up to those in Idaho and Montana. 
What we are proposing to do is to refrain from reintroducing those bears at this time pending an evaluation and input from the local people. 
In the Columbia/Snake River Dams--remove language that requires congressional approval for changes in the dam system to the Columbia and Snake River and tributaries. We are saying the disposition of dams should come before the Congress. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior should not have the authority to arbitrarily proceed. After all, these dams were built with public funds. The merits and contributions of these dams have provided an extraordinary level of standard of living for many in these areas, and have created agricultural areas of prosperity. As a consequence of the water and power, we have the aluminum industry. 
To suggest that somehow Congress should not be a part of any decision to eliminate these dams is unrealistic. What we would propose here is that there would be a requirement that any change in the dam system must be approved by the Congress of the United States. 
I appreciate the additional time allotted to me. I see several colleagues on the floor are looking for recognition. I do want to advise my colleagues, I think late tomorrow morning, that we will be proceeding with the disposition of the King Cove Road. We have 6 hours proposed for debate on the issue. It is my understanding that we anticipate about 3 hours, 1 1/2 hours equally divided. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I want to commend the managers of the bill, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, for their thoughtful work. I particularly want to thank the managers for their inclusion of a requirement in the conference report for a Department of Defense report on the troublesome security situation in the Taiwan Strait. I know that both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye share my concern about stability in the Taiwan Strait. 
This report, requested on or before February 1, 1999, is very timely. The twentieth anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act is in April 1999. Does the senior Senator from Alaska agree that one of the principal purposes of this study should be to compare the security situation as it exists now in 1998 with that which existed in 1979, when Congress originally enacted the Taiwan Relations Act, P.L. 96-8?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I would like to thank my friend from Alaska. I also wanted to note that it is important that the report provide a comprehensive analysis of the security balance in the Taiwan Strait. In addition to the traditional force-on-force analysis, I understand that it is the conferees intent that the report evaluate the capability of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to conduct command and control warfare against Taiwan, including the PLA's capability for information dominance, air superiority, naval blockage, and amphibious invasion. This is an area that has not received enough attention in terms of evaluating Taiwan's defensive capabilities. 
It is also my understanding that the conferees intend that this report evaluate the degree to which the PLA's modernization programs in the areas of submarine development, ballistic and cruise missile development, special operation forces, electronic warfare and computer virus attack capabilities have altered, or may in the future alter, the security and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to address two matters that are of importance to me. The first is the issue of national cancer awareness. 
Mr. President, for the next 3 days, hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors, families, care givers, and friends, whose lives have been affected by cancer will join together in this city for an event called `The March: Coming Together to Conquer Cancer.' 
Yesterday, other Members of this body and I had an opportunity to place a large star on our respective States to represent special persons in our lives who have been touched by cancer. 
I had the pleasure and honor on behalf of my wife, Nancy, to place a star on my State of Alaska for the late Judge Lester Gore, my wife's father. He was a remarkable pioneer in our State. In 1912, Judge Gore moved to Juneau after graduating from law school and established an impressive record as a young deputy district attorney. He was recognized in that effort in 1932 by President Hoover's appointment to serve as a Federal judge for the Territory of Alaska, serving the first judicial district in Nome. 
In serving as a Federal judge in the far reaches of western Alaska in the aftermath of the gold rush, Judge Gore traveled from village to village hearing various cases and judging on the merits. He used every mode of transportation from dog team to the former cutter Bear, bringing justice to rural Alaska. He was instrumental in both creating legal precedent and shaping the legal history of our State. 
Later in his career he worked as an attorney in Ketchikan, and died in 1965 of cancer. He had many accomplishments but none more important to me than fathering a daughter, Nancy, who later was good enough to accept my proposal of marriage. 
In addition, I was pleased in my own personal case to recognize my mother, who died of cancer, leukemia, in Alaska in 1956, having spent her entire career in the area of education. She was the longest standing sixth grade teacher in Ketchikan, Alaska. 
To move on, for more than 20 years now, my wife, Nancy, has worked with Alaskan women to encourage the establishment of a breast cancer center starting in Fairbanks, Alaska. She and a group of women initiated the Breast Cancer Detection Center for the purpose of offering free mammograms to women in the remote areas of Alaska, regardless of their ability to pay. I am proud to say that the center now serves about 2,500 women a year and provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska women in 81 villages throughout the State. 
To help fund these efforts of the Fairbanks center, each year my wife has sponsored a fishing tournament to raise money for the operation of the facility and to purchase units. Interestingly enough, over the last 5 years they have raised over $1 million in this effort. They now operate a permanent facility in Fairbanks, as well as a mobile mammogram unit that travels the highways of Alaska providing free breast cancer examinations for the women along the highway system. It looks like a big armored car. More recently, they have purchased a smaller unit called Molly. Molly is designed to go in aircraft to fly out to the villages that are not connected by any road, and by river barge down the rivers of the interior. 
So I commend those who are responsible for this effort in my State, a group of women who have taken it upon themselves to do something about this disease, this killer disease which affects all of us. It is anticipated that 40 percent of us will get some form of cancer during our lifetimes. We have had a figure of about 1.5 million Americans being diagnosed this year. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in taking part in the activities here in Washington, D.C., with The march, thereby demonstrating our commitment to end cancer forever.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address one more issue, with the agreement of my colleagues. I see a number of them on the floor--Senator Byrd--so I will try to be very brief. But I want to talk a little bit about our national security interests and what is occurring in North Korea. It does not just affect my State of Alaska, although this recent three-stage rocket did generate a little interest in my State because on August 31, 1998, the North Koreans fired a rocket which we now believe is a three-stage rocket carrying a satellite over the sovereign territory of Japan and it evidently came down very close to my home State of Alaska. 
Although initial reports indicated that this was a two-stage rocket with a range of approximately 1,200 miles, now there is acknowledgment in the U.S. intelligence community that it was likely a three-stage rocket carrying a satellite. The third stage malfunctioned, consequently the satellite was not launched. But the point is that it has been identified that, indeed, the North Koreans have the rocket capability to carry some type of armament to the shores of the United States. 
The Asian press reported that the rocket traveled 3,700 miles, or 6,000 kilometers, and landed in the ocean near Alaska. On September 17, the U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kenneth Bacon responded to this report by saying:  
The only way to track this is by radar tapes and there's considerable disagreement among experts on how to interpret this. 
Let's think about what this really means. The only way we have to track this is by radar tapes; in other words, after the fact. But intelligence sources have been quoted as acknowledging that a three-stage rocket could have a range three times that of the two-stage Taepo Dong I rocket. Particularly concerned about this latest missile test, a number of us have recognized that there seems to be a breakdown on whether the administration was either caught off guard by the sophistication of the North Korean technology, or was reluctant to share this information with lawmakers. 
I am reminded of President Clinton's comments last year, when he said `[t]he possibility of a long-range missile attack on U.S. soil by a rogue state is more than a decade away.' 
That does not appear to be the case--as a consequence of the occurrence in August, the last day of August, relative to the North Korean missile which did land within shouting distance of my State of Alaska. 
This would ignore the testimony in 1994 by John Deutch, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense: 
If North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk. 
It appears the North Koreans have gone beyond even what Mr. Deutch envisioned by launching a three-stage rocket carrying a satellite. 
There is truly an immediate need for missile defense, Mr. President. MIT professor Daniel Fine has an interesting take on why we need immediate action on a National Missile Defense System which protects all of the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska and our territories. He conclusion is that: 
If the $32 billion infrastructure [associated with oil production in my State] in Prudhoe Bay--which produces 1.6 million barrels of oil . . . is subjected to a credible missile threat . . . then the cost to the American economy of a missile threat as economic blackmail would reach $4 billion--$6 billion in the first ten days. 
Well Mr. President, I for one do not think it is far fetched to think of Prudhoe Bay as a potential target. After all, it accounts for approximately 20 percent of the total domestic production of crude oil in the United States. While I have not reviewed how the professor reaches the $4 to 6 billion figure, I think it should serve as a wake-up call to those who continue to oppose a National Missile Defense System. It is not just Alaskans, Hawaiians and those in Guam who should be concerned about the launch. Monday's test was the first of a multistage missile. According to experts, the ability to build rockets in stages opens the doors to intercontinental missiles that would have virtually unlimited range and which would carry payloads capable of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Such missiles, and the threat of them, certainly puts U.S. citizens at risk as a consequence of any attack coming from North Korea or any other area with a missile that carries weapons of mass destruction. 
I think we have to reflect a little bit on the North Koreans. Some would dismiss the threat from North Korea because that country is on the verge of an economic collapse. But I remind my colleagues that North Korea has a history. 
Mr. President, we have seen in the past, irrational actions by the North Koreans. You recall this is a country that in 1950 launched an invasion on South Korea, resulting in the deaths of 3 million of her countrymen and 54,000 American troops. 
Recall the detonation of a bomb in Rangoon killing 16 South Korean officials; a country whose agents blew up a Korean Airlines flight killing 115 passengers and crew; and a country whose military hacked U.S. personnel to death in the DMZ. 
I think we have to recognize there is still a great deal of uncertainty relative to the objectives of North Korea. 
Furthermore, as we look at the crisis on the Korean peninsula, the United States has given over $250 million in combined food aid and support for KEDO. The North Koreans have received 1.3 million metric tons of heavy fuel oil. 
While the United States has provided humanitarian assistance from time to time, as well as technical assistance, we have also promised large contributions to the $5 billion light water reactor program and also have given food and aid and contributed over $50 million to KEDO. 
What have the North Koreans done in return for this assistance? They launched a missile in August. Intelligence photos show work on vast underground construction complexes. 
In July of 1998, GAO reported that North Korea has taken actions to hinder work of international inspectors sent to monitor North Korea's nuclear program. 
It goes on and on. 
As a consequence, I think it is fair to say the administration has treated each of these incidents as if North Korea is merely an innocent child throwing a harmless tantrum, not a terrorist nation home to the world's fourth largest army, just miles away from the 37,000 American troops. 
Incident after incident is dismissed by this administration as `not intentional' or not `serious' enough to derail U.S. assistance under the Agreed Framework. 
The administration called latest missile launch ` a matter of deep concern to the U.S. because of its destabilizing impact in Northeast Asia and beyond,' but reiterated its commitment to provide funds under the Agreed Framework. 
The administration refuses to say that newly disclosed evidence of underground facility would violate the 1994 accord because `concrete has not been poured.' 
When a sub full of North Korean commandos landed in South Korea, the administration asked both sides to `show restraint'--as if South Korea was in the wrong. 
The administration responded to violations of the Military Armistice Agreement by asking that the issue not be `blown out of proportion.' 
Issuing polite reprimands from the State Department, while the Administration continues to seek increased funds for activities that benefit North Korea, only encourages bad behavior. 
Mr. President, enough is enough. Congress should block further funding for KEDO until the President can certify that North Korea's nuclear program is, indeed, frozen and not simply an ongoing clandestine operation. The United States is a global power with vested interests both politically and commercially all over the world. We simply cannot allow policy to be determined by those who practice missile blackmail. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and wish the President a good day and a good weekend. 
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Section 1110(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act provides an express and affirmative right to air access to federal lands in Alaska. Section 1110(a) provides as follows: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or other law, the Secretary shall permit, on conservation system units, national recreation areas, and national conservation areas, and those public lands designated as wilderness study, the use of snowmachines (during periods of adequate snow cover, or frozen river conditions in the case of wild and scenic rivers), motorboats, airplanes, and nonmotorized surface transportation methods for traditional activities (where such activities are permitted by this Act or other law) and for travel to and from villages and homesites. Such use shall be subject to reasonable regulations by the Secretary to protect the natural and other values of the conservation system units, national recreation areas, and national conservation areas, and shall not be prohibited unless, after notice and hearing in the vicinity of the affected unit or area, the Secretary finds that such use would be detrimental to the resource values of the unit or area. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the use of other methods of transportation for such travel and activities on conservation system lands where such use is permitted by this Act or other law. 
Overflights, including those conducted for profit, are a `traditional activity' in Alaska, and as such currently may be subject to `reasonable regulation' by the Secretary of the Interior under section 1110(a). This policy works for Alaska. Although section 1110(a) applies notwithstanding any other law, section 702(b) clarifies that Congress is not changing its policy toward Alaska in any way.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, once again, we are on the floor debating this very difficult issue. I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his perseverance in the realities of protecting the rights of women to control their own bodies and our obligation to protect the rights of those unborn. That is something that we will be discussing an extended period of time--probably without any degree of finality. 
Nevertheless, Mr. President, we must vote yes or no on this. As a consequence, it is my fervent hope that enough votes will be cast to put an end to this tragic procedure. It is a tragic procedure in its very nature--partial-birth abortion. 
The President defended his veto by stating that a partial-birth abortion is a procedure that is medically necessary in certain `compelling cases' to protect the mother from `serious injury to her health.' 
Unfortunately, the President, in my opinion, was badly misinformed. According to reputable medical testimony and evidence given before this Congress by partial-birth abortion practitioners, partial-birth abortions are, one, more widespread than its defenders admit; two, used predominantly for elective purposes; and three, are never medically necessary to safeguard the mother's health. That is a pretty broad statement, but that is what we are told. 
The former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, whom we all admired when he functioned in that position, stated he `believed that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisers on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term abortions.' 
Dr. Koop went on to say, `In no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described as . . . partial birth . . . is a medical necessity for the mother.' 
In a New York Times editorial, C. Everett Koop added, `Recent reports have concluded that a majority of partial-birth abortions are elective, involving a healthy woman and a normal fetus.' 
Other physicians agree: In a September 1996 Wall Street Journal editorial, three physicians who treat pregnant women declared that `Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility.' 
Mr. President, a partial-birth abortion is not only tragic, it is violent. The procedure is one in which four-fifths of the child is delivered before the process of killing the child begins. Sadly, throughout this procedure, the majority of babies are alive and able to move and may actually feel pain during this ordeal. 
Dr. Pamela Smith, in a House hearing on the issue, succinctly stated why Congress must act:  
The baby is literally inches from being declared a legal person by every State in the Union. The urgency and seriousness of these matters therefore require appropriate legislative action. 
Mr. President, it's not easy for any here to discuss this topic, but unfortunately, there are stark and brutal realities of a partial-birth abortion. 
I, and others who support this Act, sympathize with a woman who is in a difficult and extreme circumstance, but no circumstance can justify the killing of an infant who is four-fifths born. My good friend and colleague Senator Moynihan, has said the practice of partial-birth abortions is `just too close to infanticide.' 
Mr. President, this procedure cannot be defended medically and cannot be defended morally. That is why I hope that this is the one issue that can unite pro-life and pro-choice individuals. I strenuously urge my colleagues to vote in favor of overriding President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first of all, in the concluding minutes that we have before our vote, let me recognize from the House of Representatives our good friend, Carlos Romero-Barcelo, who is with us watching this historic action of the U.S. Senate. It is a pleasure to have you with us, my friend. Your contribution to these moments have been immeasurable, and your people of Puerto Rico can be very proud of your contribution in bringing this matter from the House of Representatives to the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight. 
Mr. President, let me acknowledge my good friends and colleagues who have had such a significant role in moving this to where we are today. Of course, that would include Senator Torricelli and Senator D'Amato. 
I think it is important to recognize the constituency associated with many of the Members who have come forth as initial sponsors. Senator Lautenberg referred to Senator Hatch; my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Akaka; Senator Daschle; Senator Landrieu; Senator Lieberman; Senator Graham of Florida; and Senator Domenici, and there are many, many more. 
But the significance of the commitment, particularly of Senator D'Amato and Senator Torricelli, I think represent an extraordinary sensitivity as brought out in the statements not necessarily individually of their feeling towards what America is all about but perhaps better in the comments that were made by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, who indicated, as you look at the names of sponsors on this legislation, that you have a potpourri, if you will, of the mixture of Americans committed to democracy. 
I must acknowledge in my thanks to my colleagues that this Senator from Alaska does not have a large Puerto Rican constituency. But I do have a long memory. 
Alaska has been a State since 1959. I grew up in a territory. We had taxation without representation. My father used to say he felt good about being able to write on his income tax form in a red pen `filed under protest, taxation without representation.' But that is the extent of what made him feel good. 
I can recall seeing neighbors when I was too young to go into the draft being drafted. We were second-class citizens, Mr. President. We had special identification cards to leave the territory of Alaska to visit the State of Washington. It was quite a blow to the sensitivity of American citizens, and as a consequence we have a situation with regard to Puerto Rico today. 
Mr. President, I would like to have the clerk reserve at least 2 minutes of my time remaining for one of my colleagues who is here with me.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may, I want to specifically cite the fact that I support this resolution. 
I fully support the objective of this resolution in reaffirming the right of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico to express their desires on political status through popular referenda and to communicate those desires to the federal government. I also agree that the federal government should carefully review and consider any such communication. This resolution is fully consistent with the objective of the draft chairman's mark that I circulated immediately prior to the recess. 
I want to thank my colleagues who reviewed the draft chairman's mark and who provided me with comments and suggestions. As I stated in my press release last week, I do not think that there will be time to fully consider the legislation this session, but I think we have made considerable progress. This resolution is fully consistent with the philosophy of my draft that the initiative for any political status change lies exclusively with Puerto Rico. 
During this Congress, the House of Representatives has passed legislation requiring a referendum in Puerto Rico. Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate. I stated at the outset of this Congress, that I consider the matter of political status one of the most important constitutional responsibilities of the Congress and of my committee. 
I cautioned when those measures were introduced that as much as some would like to see legislation enacted in this centennial year of Puerto Rico coming under United States sovereignty, this was an extraordinarily complex and important issue and deserved full and fair consideration because I recall what happened in my own State of Alaska. It took a long time. Although the committee conducted a series of meetings in Puerto Rico at the beginning of the Congress, I made the decision that we would wait for the House to pass legislation before we began the formal committee process. I made that decision so that our committee would have all the various proposals before us. 
By the time the House passed its legislation, it was already clear that it would be very difficult to resolve the many questions presented by the legislation this year. I want to emphasize the words `this year,' because I think there has been too much emphasis on timing and not enough on substance. 
I am committed to the enactment of responsible legislation and not simply to the enactment of legislation this year. 
Nonetheless, and despite the limitations of the Senate schedule and the importance of the other measures pending before the committee, we held a series of workshops, oversight hearing, and legislative hearings. 
I circulated a draft chairman's mark prior to the August recess to my colleagues on the committee. I asked for a review and comments. Several Members submitted very thoughtful amendments to the draft chairman's mark. While I have directed the staff to continue to work on these amendments, I do not see that attempting to force the legislative process would either be wise or helpful in view of the remaining time left in this session. 
The initial workshop heard from the Governor and the leadership of the three recognized political parties in Puerto Rico. The Governor expressed the desire of the government of Puerto Rico to obtain an expression from the federal government of status alternatives. The parties agreed that so long as each political party is able to craft its own definition, those definition, those definitions would be political statements and as a result, no referendum would provide the clarity that Congress would want. 
The first oversight hearing considered the fiscal and economic implications of any change in status. Those proceedings shed considerable light on some of the difficulties involved in any transition to prepare Puerto Rico for either consideration of an Admissions Act or for the withdrawal of United States sovereignty. 
The second oversight hearing focused on the individual issues involved in separate sovereignty, either as full independence or in some form of free association. In addition to a consideration of the issues, especially that of citizenship, the hearing also served to focus on sovereignty as the test for consideration of those issues. 
Those hearings and the legislative hearing that followed demonstrated how unique the present circumstances of Puerto Rico is and how difficult any change in status will be. The hearings also demonstrate that the federal government is responsible for the present situation and the creation of the obstacles that must be overcome prior to any change in status. 
A major defect, in my mind, in the measures pending before the committee and in the definitions used in past referenda in Puerto Rico, is the failure of the definitions for Statehood or Independence to acknowledge that Puerto Rico is not presently prepared for federal consideration of either option. 
There is a very complex and difficult process involved before either option could be implemented, as our hearings demonstrated. 
For Statehood, that process would entail, at a minimum, significant consideration of several entitlement programs as well as the extension of the Internal Revenue laws in concert with a complete overhaul of Puerto Rico's local tax code. This is not a simple matter and I do not expect that it can be done rapidly. Only after that transition is complete should Congress consider fully extending the Constitution to Puerto Rico. 
As my colleagues know, the Constitution does not fully apply to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has never been `incorporated' into the United States. Alaska and Hawaii were fully incorporated well before the first Admissions Act was even introduced. Only after the debate on incorporation has concluded and when the Constitution is fully applicable in Puerto Rico can the political debate on admissions begin. 
The point that I tried to achieve in my draft chairman's mark, is that Congress has created a series of obstacles to the achievement of any change in political status. I think we owe our fellow citizens an explanation of what the process is likely to be to overcome those obstacles so that they can express their desires with a clear understanding of the process that lies before them. 
A second major defect in the legislation was that it required Puerto Rico to vote on federally defined options. How and whether Puerto Rico seeks to petition the Congress should not be dictated by the federal government. If we are serious about local self-government, then we should be willing to allow the local government to determine how to respond to the desires of its constituents. Not all territories conducted referenda on future political status and none were ever required to hold one by the federal government. As part of the Enabling or Admissions Act, some territories were required to agree to the terms of a particular Statehood proposal, but that came after Congress had enacted the legislation to provide for their admission. 
We should not constrain Puerto Rico in how it seeks to approach a request to the federal government. Perhaps they will continue to use referenda, perhaps they will use resolutions of the legislature, perhaps they will use petitions. Each territory has approached the process from its own political perspective and we should not dictate to our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico what process they must use. 
As a result of our workshops and hearings, I circulated a draft chairman's mark prior to the August recess to my colleagues on the committee. I asked for their review and comments. Several Members have submitted very thoughtful amendments to my draft chairman's mark. While I have directed staff to work on those amendments, I do not see that attempting to force the legislative process would be either wise or helpful. 
I support the objectives of this resolution and they are fully consistent with the framework of my draft chairman's mark. There is no question that Puerto Rico, either through popular referenda or resolution of the legislature or simple petition, has the right to express its desire on political status. There should also be no question that the federal government should respond to any such expression seriously and with due consideration. 
The government of Puerto Rico has now enacted legislation calling for a referendum on December 13 of this year. In developing the definitions that will be placed before the voters, the draftsmen had before them the language contained in the House-passed measure, the Senate-introduced measure, and my draft chairman's mark. They also had the testimony of the administration. 
They chose to adopt definitions based on their own judgement. I want to make absolutely clear that even had the draft chairman's mark been enacted, Puerto Rico would not have been obliged to adopt the definitions contained in it. My draft mark was strictly advisory as will be the results of any referendum. That is as it should be. All we could hope to do would be to provide some guidance as to what this Congress thinks the process would likely be. Just as we can not bind a future Congress, neither can an advisory referendum bind us. 
I believe that we still owe our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico a fair statement of the alternatives and process involved in future political status so that they can express their desires in a meaningful way. Passage of this resolution does not in any sense diminish the importance of providing that information. This resolution does reaffirm that the initial step for any political status change rests with out fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Only they can decide whether and when to petition the Congress for consideration of a change in status. Only Congress can consider the legislation necessary to remove the obstacles to such a status and, in the philosophy of the Northwest Ordinance, prepare Puerto Rico for consideration of that status. 
I think that ultimately we need to clarify that process in legislation. Time is running out for this session of Congress, but I intend to resume where we are now at the beginning of the 106th Congress. In the interim, I think we have made considerable progress in clarifying the issues through our hearings and in the reactions to the draft chairman's mark. This resolution is completely consistent with that progress. 
My best wishes go to the Governor and the people of Puerto Rico as they prepare to express their preference on the December 13 referendum vote. 
I yield the time I have remaining to the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I would like to advise my colleagues that we had an oversight hearing in June on the MMS oil valuation issue. The results of that hearing indicated that we should initiate a dialogue with the principals. That dialogue was entered into. I felt gratified that we were making progress relative to this complex issue and was chagrined to find at a later date that the advances we thought we were making simply had been overturned by the policymakers of the Department of the Interior and the administration. 
As a consequence, this conversation about corporate welfare, big oil, and big business is incorrect because we are talking about small companies in many cases. The oil and gas industry has lost a quarter of a million jobs. This is an industry that now finds itself moving overseas where there is a favorable climate for exploration and production. 
As evidence of that, Mr. President, in 1973 and 1974, we were 37-percent dependent on imported oil; today, we are 52-percent dependent. The Department of Energy suggests we are going to be 66-percent dependent in the year 2004 or 2005. 
The amendment offered by Senator Domenici and Senator Hutchison during committee markup would delay the implementation of the final rules on Federal oil valuation until October 1999, or until a negotiated rule can be achieved. 
The oil and gas industry is struggling in a declining market. This is an industry where we have lost a quarter of a million jobs. We are talking about implementation of regulations that would drive this industry out of the United States and make us more dependent on imported oil. It is unconscionable. The taxes paid by this industry and mortgage payments made by industry employees in their communities are contributions being overlooked in this general climate of `well, throw it out--because somehow big business is cheating,' if you will. And that is simply unconscionable, Mr. President. 
As Senator Domenici and Senator Hutchison indicated, they personally met twice with Interior Department officials and industry executives to resolve what amounts to a handful of issues concerning the rulemaking. It is rather interesting, because if you look at the MMS proposal, it attempts to set the oil royalty away from the lease; that is, downstream, almost near the burner, not as required by law, and set it on the value added by the companies through their extraordinary efforts to market the product. And by denying the companies an allowance for reasonable marketing costs, MMS unnecessarily and artificially raises the price of oil on which the royalty is based. That is what they are doing here. 
So, Mr. President, do not be misled by these generalities that somehow this is corporate welfare. This is an effort to help an industry be competitive. The policy of the Department of the Interior to mandate royalty valuation, through rulemaking, would be detrimental and not resolve the issue, and would leave many unanswered questions relative to the industry's ability to be internationally competitive. It is beyond me, Mr. President. 
I thought when the Interior officials met, they were going to meet in good faith. It appears that Interior did little more than pay lipservice to that effort. The rule is just as unfair now as it was when discussions of it took place. Only now, Interior is trying to put its spin on the issue by saying, `We gave the industry its meeting. We addressed their concerns. Why do we need to have any further delay?' 
Mr. President, it appears the Interior Department is going to continue to base its oil royalty on market factors away from the lease. Any attempts to strip the Domenici amendment away should be opposed. And there are three specific reasons. Then I will conclude. 
First, contrary to what Interior claims, the amendment was scored by CBO as having zero effect on the current baseline. Interior's claim that it will save $65 million a year is simply puffery and nothing more. 
Second, with world oil prices depressed, we do not need to add what amounts to a new tax on this industry, particularly the independents, the small oil companies. Do not talk to me about big business. 
Third, delaying oil valuation rules is nothing new. Congress did it in 1987. Delay will allow better public policy to be formulated. 
So I urge my colleagues to join in opposing the removal of the oil valuation amendment from the Interior appropriations bill. 
I yield the floor to Senator Thomas.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I stand in strong opposition to Senator Bumpers' amendment to strike the National Academy of Sciences study. 
Before they cast their vote, I want my colleagues to consider these points: 
We put the National Academy of Sciences study language into the appropriations bill because the Interior Department has decided that they can no longer wait for Congress to act on mining law. Apparently these unelected officials know what's better for this country than the United States Congress. 
We are doing it because the Department of the Interior has decided that they are not interested in the opinions or concerns of the public land Governors and the constituents they represent. 
Let me quote the Western Governors Association letter from February of this year: 
States already have effective environmental and reclamation programs in place and operating. These programs ensure that national criteria, where they exist in current law, are met and allow state and site-specific flexibility for the remaining issues. 
We put the Academy study into the appropriations bill at the specific request of the Governors of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah. 
They all echo Nevada Governor Miller's concerns when he said: 
Interior is moving the responsibility for environmental oversight of mining operations in my State and other States to here in Washington, DC. This attempt at seizure and control by Interior is particularly perplexing in view of the fact that many States, expecially Nevada [and my state--Alaska] have moved aggressively to address the environmental concerns of mining operations. To date, there has been no real justification offered by the department regarding the need to make changes. * * * 
He goes on to say that in his opinion the Department of the Interior has a solution looking for a problem. 
A solution looking for a problem. 
It is simply unacceptable for an agency to launch off on a major rulemaking effort that affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the entire environmental foundation of mining in the United States. 
Let me close by quoting one of the modern environmental leaders, former Secretary of the Interior Andrus: 
In 20 years, I admit, the 3809 regulations have stood the test of time * * * those regulations revolutionized mining on the public lands. Bruce Babbitt--who should know better--is trying to fix things that are not broken, and I suspect accomplish some mining law reform through the back door. 
Secretary Babbitt is trying to fix things that are not broken. 
I couldn't have said it better if I tried. 
The amendment that Senator Bumpers proposes to strike is as simple--it does `nothing' more than direct the National Academy of Sciences to review existing State and Federal environmental regulations dealing with hardrock mining to determine the adequacy of these laws and regulations to prevent unnecessary and undue degradation and how to better coordinate Federal and State regulatory programs to ensure environmental protection. 
The Department of the Interior has so completely lost its objectivity and has become so biased against this industry that they appear completely incapable of making sound decisions in this arena. 
The citizens of this country are entitled to a Department of the Interior that determines need before it acts, that doesn't waste money that is sorely needed in other places; a Department that doesn't `unnecessarily' disrupt a system of State and Federal regulations laboriously constructed over decades to complement and enhance environmental protection at the lowest cost possible. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me in a vote to table Senator Bumpers' amendment, and in doing so, we will be sending a clear message to the administration that `good' Government is still important, that States play a critical role in environmental protection and that their partnerships and input are still important. 
Mr. President, as you know, we have before us a vote, and I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be requested--Mr. President, I am told that I should make that request after time has expired.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me wish you a good morning as we proceed with the Interior appropriations process. I would like my colleagues to note that I stand in strong opposition to Senator Bumpers' amendment to strike the National Academy of Science study. What we have here is an organization of scientists that are objective. They have a reputation of making decisions based on sound science and not rhetoric. We have a good deal of rhetoric here in this body. 
The language that Senator Bumpers would propose to strike is as simple and straightforward as any legislative language can be. In spite of all words to the contrary, it does nothing more than direct the National Academy of Sciences to review existing State and Federal environmental regulations dealing with the hard rock mining industry to determine the adequacy of these laws and those regulations to prevent unnecessary and undue degradation, and how to better coordinate Federal and State regulatory programs to ensure environmental protection. It is short, it is sweet, and it is to the point. 
The Senator from Arkansas has a long history in opposition to mining. It is interesting to note that the State of Arkansas has a relatively small amount of mining activity, most of which is either on private or patented land, unlike the western part of the United States, Nevada, California, Idaho, my State of Alaska. I do not have a constituency in the poultry industry. I could, perhaps, claim `fowl,' relative to the constant objection from my good friend from Arkansas who clearly has no constituency in the mining industry. But the point is, the mining industry in the United States has been able to survive in an international marketplace, unlike the poultry industry which has a domestic market and domestic concerns. My point is that the economy of a good portion of the Western United States is dependent on the mining industry. 
It needs fixing, but it is not broke. It is rather interesting to note that the reason we are here today, to a large degree, is that we have yet to pass a mining law reform package in the U.S. Senate. It is fair to ask why. Let me tell you why, Madam President. 
The Senator from Arkansas specifically asked the Senator from Alaska, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, not to mark up the mining legislation because he was working diligently with me and others to try to put together a compromise that he could support. 
But the point is, he asked and I put off Senator Craig's and my mining bill while he negotiated with industry on a comprehensive reform package. I hope that effort is not over. But we would not be here today or have to go through this debate if our reform bill had come to this floor for a vote, which I hope within the timeframe remaining it still might. It was an effort to provide a balanced package that contained a host of surface management protections along with royalty, but it was because he asked us to put off the mining law package that we are here today debating only a portion of the reforms envisioned in my mining bill. 
Let me remind you, Madam President, the reform of mining law is complex. There are different minerals. It is not like the coal industry where you are dealing with one particular mine product. You are dealing with gold, you are dealing with silver, you are dealing with copper, all of which have different complexities in the mining and, more so, the refining process, different costs, and the realization that you may be mining rich gold in one mine and much lower grade gold in another, yet the costs are significant. When you try to have uniformity in application of mining law, it becomes very complex and often an impossible task. 
What we are proposing in our mining bill, as the Senator from Arkansas knows, is a pattern similar to what is working in the State of Nevada. My colleagues from Nevada will be addressing that. But that is basically the application of a net royalty. 
Madam President, hard as it is to believe that we agree on anything, I do agree with Senator Bumpers that it is an absolute shame that the Congress has been forced to intercede in what should be the Department of Interior's routine rulemaking process. This has been addressed by my friend from Arkansas, but if we look back historically, we have been able to count on administration agencies to do an evaluation of needs that is objective and straightforward before launching off and writing new regulations. Sadly, under the current Office of the Secretary of the Interior, this has not been the case. Let me tell you why. 
The entire rulemaking effort for mining is rooted in a Secretarial directive to the Bureau of Land Management in which he concludes that since the Congress has not acted on mining reform, it is his intention to do so through the regulatory process. So here is the Secretary of the Interior circumventing the will of Congress. 
Why don't we have a bill here? We accommodated the Senator from Arkansas in withholding on the markup so we could negotiate. Yet, he wants to move in and strike the involvement on a portion--a portion, Madam President--of the reform from having the independent study done by the National Academy of Sciences. 
I am sure my colleagues understand what we have going on here. As we look at giving the Secretary of the Interior the right to initiate rulemaking, circumventing the role of Congress, I think on most issues, my friend will agree with me, there is no justification for it. There is a mining bill before this Congress. We would like to have it passed, but we are waiting for a resolve by the Senator from Arkansas to negotiate something that is satisfactory to him, as well as us. We have a bill before this body, as I promised many of my colleagues after the last vote on this issue that we would. 
Let's go back to the proposed rulemaking, which the Senator from Arkansas has referred to, at the Department of Interior. It is interesting to note that no assessment of existing Federal laws and regulations, no assessment of existing State laws and regulations--simply put, the result so far from the Department of Interior is, no determination of need whatsoever has come out of this process. 
Governor Miller of Nevada perhaps put it best when he said the current Department of Interior mining regulation effort is a solution looking for a problem, and my good friend from Arkansas is here with his continuation of his objection to this particular industry. 
During the last appropriations cycle, we attempted to temper the Secretary's driving impulse to regulate with an amendment which would have forced--forced--the Department of Interior to at least coordinate its efforts with the Governors of the affected States. My friend from Arkansas said they met that obligation. The only difference is, the Governors of the affected States didn't agree with the Department of Interior. 
It was our hope through this coordinated effort the new regulations would not drop a monkey wrench into the existing State-Federal regulatory network. Anyone, Madam President, with even a rudimentary understanding of how the mining industry is regulated understands that the State governments play by far the largest role in oversight and enforcement of environmental regulations on the industry. 
What is wrong with that? The Senator from Arkansas seems to put little credence in the oversight capability of the States. What is wrong with the States, the most concerned group with regard to their responsibility concerning environmental oversight on the mining industry? Is it better to have a faceless bureaucrat in Washington, DC, dictating what goes on in Nevada, California, Idaho, dictating to the people of Idaho, the people of Alaska who live with the mining industry, who take pride in their State, who take pride in the reclamation process to meet their obligations? 
The reason for this is simple. Over time, the States have been delegated Federal responsibilities for water quality, air quality, solid waste management, and mine reclamation. These laws are the 800-pound gorillas when it comes to mining. 
Over time, these Federal programs have been fully integrated into State environmental protection laws. These interwoven laws form a complete and balanced net of environmental regulations that cover almost every aspect of mining activity. And if they don't cover some, they will, without so much as a thought given to the impact their rulemaking efforts would have upon existing Federal and State programs that the Department of Interior took upon itself to launch into a major rewrite effort. 
What is their agenda? Is it to run the domestic mining industry offshore? We have learned from what happened in Mexico and Canada when the industry basically ceased to exist at its previous level because of restrictions. And, remember, unlike the poultry industry, which is a domestic industry and with which my colleague from Arkansas is familiar, the mining industry has to operate internationally. It either competes on an international basis or it doesn't. It is much more complex. 
Last year, at the request of Governor Miller of Nevada, Senator Reid put on an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill which would have made it mandatory that the Interior Department at least coordinate efforts with the States--at least coordinate them. He did this only after the Governor made it clear that coordination was not taking place. 
So I take issue with the general statement of my friend from Arkansas. We were prepared last year to make Interior Department coordination with the States mandatory. Senator Bumpers, however, saw fit to intercede on behalf of the Department of Interior with an amendment which removed mandatory coordination with States and put in place a requirement that the Secretary certify to the Congress that the coordination had occurred, and the Secretary has done that. But the States didn't agree. They didn't agree, Madam President. 
While I have had doubts about this, I supported the approach. I was hopeful that the amendment would be received in good faith by the Interior Department and that they would make sure that the States interested were factored into their mining regulation effort. What followed was the most, I think, disrespectful, in-your-face response I have ever seen from the Department of Interior and any other agency of the Federal Government. 
In the Interior appropriations bill, when it was signed by the President November 11, 1997, a letter certifying that coordination with the Governors had taken place was signed on Monday, November 14. Well, they didn't agree. The cavalier attitude of the Interior Department is the sole reason we are back here again this year. At this time, I urge my colleagues not to be taken in by the rhetoric. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, why, shame on me. 
It is obvious to me that we have seen examples that the Department of Interior is simply unwilling and incapable of following good government practice when it comes to regulating the industry. They have so completely lost their objectivity and become so biased against this industry that they appear completely incapable of making objective and fair decisions. 
It is just not the mining industry. Grazing on public land falls into the same category; oil and gas exploration, same category; access to public land; the administration talks about global warming and that gas is the answer--where are you going to get the gas if they won't allow exploration on public lands; timbering, Forest Service lands, and, of course, mining on western public land. 
Our amendment does not make a finding one way or the other regarding the ultimate needs for new regulations. It does direct an `unbaised' assessment of the need for new regulations be completed before--and that is the whole purpose of the National Academy of Sciences--before the Interior Department can finalize mining regulations. 
With diminished budgets, increased need and the growing complexity of State, Federal and environmental protection laws, why on Earth would any responsible government manager propose a large-scale rulemaking effort without first establishing a solid and specific need? 
Since it has become obvious that the Interior Department is either unwilling or incapable of accomplishing this assessment, then it is imperative that the Congress now step in and assume the responsibility. They leave us with no other choice. Once the National Academy of Sciences completes its assessment, the Interior Department will be free to proceed with its regulatory efforts. At that point, they will have the information they need to rewrite the regulations in a way that fixes problems, if there are any, but not create problems. 
The citizens of this Nation are entitled to a Department of Interior that determines need before it acts, that doesn't waste money that it sorely needs in other places, a department that doesn't unnecessarily disrupt a system of State and Federal regulations laboriously constructed over decades to complement and enhance environmental protection at the lowest possible cost. 
The time has come to draw a line in the sand with this administration. It is simply not in their purview to regulate an industry out of existence without first establishing a need for that regulation. It cannot simply dismiss input from the affected States, which they have done. These States truly are our partners, not our enemies. 
I have communications from the Governors of Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico, asking Congress to protect their interests, asking us to support retention of the National Academy of Sciences' objective study. Like us, they simply want the Interior Department to demonstrate a need for regulation before they step up on the effort. 
By voting to table Senator Bumpers' amendment we will certainly set in motion this study. It is my understanding it will be Senator Bumpers' motion to strike. 
Now, I am sure all of you will hear a great deal of verbiage about this issue, but when the dust settles and the smoke has blown away, you only have to ask yourself one question: Do we want to start a massive, potentially disruptive rulemaking effort before the need for the effort has been established? 
There you have it--short, simple and to the point. I urge my colleagues to join me in a vote against Senator Bumpers' amendment. In so doing, we will be sending a clear message to the administration that good government is still important government, and the government that is best is the government that is close to the people. The State's voice should be heard. The States play a critical role in environmental protection. Their partnership and input is important. Let's have a fair, objective, qualified, scientific group, the National Academy of Sciences, make the call.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, following the current debate, let me point out a couple of things that I think the Senator from Arkansas may have overlooked with regard to his general statement that we have 557,000 sites in the abandoned mine category. 
I think it is important to recognize what we have done. We have a system. The system is working. Fewer than 3 percent of those 557,000 are considered to be of a significant environmental concern. Surface water contamination, ground water contamination, and Superfund make up less than 3 percent of these sites. The others--it is interesting to note--34 percent, or 194,000, have been reclaimed and are considered benign; 231,000, or 41 percent, have a surface disturbance. Obviously, if you are going to mine an area in an open pit, you are going to have a surface disturbance. But that can be taken care of in the reclamation process. The trees can grow back. 
I ask anybody who has visited the interior of Alaska to recognize the techniques used with the gold dredges where they basically built this dredge in a pond and it dug ahead of itself and deposited the tailings, the pond was not any bigger than the dredge, it simply moved, and yes, the tailings were evident at the time, but now the trees have grown back into the tailings piles. That is what is happening in these areas where appropriate reclamation takes place, and the technology today is much more advanced than previously. So there is significant advancement in the process. 
The system of reclamation is working, and the States take pride in their obligation to address reclamation associated with mining activity. You can't create wealth, you can't create jobs, and you can't create prosperity without some kind of a footprint. Mining is no exception. But with the technology we have, we are addressing it and doing a better job. 
The problem with the proposal of my friend from Arkansas is that he simply wants to have the Department of the Interior come in and dictate terms and conditions--a nameless, faceless bureaucracy, accountable not to the people within the States, not to the people who work in the mining industry, not to the people who have jobs, families, mortgages, but to an indifferent Department of the Interior coming down with regulations that would basically strangle the mining industry as we know it today and force it overseas. 
We have had a discussion about the poultry industry. I am sorry that my friend from Arkansas stepped out briefly, but I have done a little investigation in the last few minutes relative to the poultry industry in Arkansas, which I know very little about. Clearly, the Senator from Arkansas is on record opposing any State regulation of mining that is evident today. But he doesn't oppose State regulation of his State's biggest industry, and that is poultry. Small poultry farmers are not subject to Federal law, clean water regulation, even when large corporations actually own the chickens. It is left up to State law, even though it is a major water quality issue in those States with high populations of poultry. In Virginia alone, over 1,300 poultry operations produce 4.4 billion pounds of manure a year. A so-called small poultry operation can produce 540 tons of litter per year. I haven't heard the Senator from Arkansas arguing in favor of Federal regulation, but perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves and we don't need to spread the issue around any more than we have, relatively speaking. 
Let me just highlight a few more points that I think are appropriate. Let's look at the gold industry in the United States today. The layoffs total approximately 3,500 workers--not because the gold isn't there, but the world price of gold has declined. As a consequence, these mines, such as the HomeStake Mine in Lead, SD, a small community of fewer than 1,000 people, where there are over 466 people that are out of work--that issue is not as a consequence of the issue before us today, but it is a consequence of the mining industry's ability to operate internationally based on cost, based on the value of the gold in the ground, and a number of other considerations. 
The point is, when you go into the mining industry, you go in for the long haul. You are going to have good years and bad years. But I think it is appropriate that we take a look at the industry as it exists in the Western States. There are 5,000 people employed in my State of Alaska. In California, there are 115,000 people with jobs directly or indirectly affected by the mining industry; Colorado has 19,000; Idaho has 7,000; Montana, 9,000; Nevada has 11,000; South Dakota, 8,000; the State of Washington has 26,000. 
So I remind the Senators from those States that are directly affected, with a significant payroll, a number of jobs are dependent directly or indirectly on the mining industry, and it is very important that we have a mining industry that has regulations that are responsive to the legitimate environmental demands, but at the same time recognize that this industry fluctuates with market price, world prices, unlike many other items that we might not have a fair comparison with. 
Finally, let me in the remaining moments again refer to the effort that has been made that is pending before the U.S. Senate. It is ready for markup. That is the mining bill that Senator Craig and I have offered. It was a solid foundation upon which to build mining reform. We made an accommodation to the Senator from Arkansas not to mark it up in order for him to initiate an effort to reach a compromise with the mining industry to resolve long standing issues. Evidently, this has not yet happened, although I still have hopes. 
Let me remind my colleagues that the mining bill before us would have pleased, I think, reasonable voices on both sides of the issue. It seeks reform, which brings a fair return to the Treasury. It protects the environment and preserves our ability to produce strategic minerals in an international marketplace. I think the bill, when it eventually reaches the floor of this body, will receive support and pass. The legislation protects the small miners, it maintains traditional location and discovery practices, and it is reform. It is an effort to do the job right. Bad decisions are going to harm a $5 billion U.S. industry whose products are the muscle and sinew of our Nation's industrial output. 
The future of some 120,000 American miners and their families and their communities is at stake here. So is the well-being of thousands of other Americans whose income is linked to manufacturing goods and services which support this critical industry. 
In summary, Mr. President, I am going to be offering a motion to table Senator Bumpers amendment to strike at 2:15 when the Senate reconvenes 
I want my colleagues to know ahead of time what my intentions are relative to the disposition of the Bumpers amendment. 
Finally, let me, for the record, indicate the position of the Western Governors' Association, which wrote in a letter:  
States already have effective environmental and reclamation programs in place and operating. These programs ensure that national criteria where they exist in current law are met and allow the States site-specific flexibility for the remaining issue. 
We have letters from the Governors of Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah--written letters in support of having the National Academy of Sciences conduct a review of the existing State and Federal regulations governing mining to determine their deficiencies. 
One other point, Mr. President. I think it is noteworthy, to my colleagues who have perhaps been following some of our Nation's environmental leaders, the comment that was made in December 1997 by former Secretary of the Interior, Governor Cecil Andrus. When the 3809 regulations were promulgated back in 1980, Governor Andrus was Secretary of the Interior. So this gentleman knows of what he speaks. 
In December, Governor Andrus stated: 
For over 20 years, I submit, the 3809 regulations have stood the test of time. These are the regulations that we are talking about today, the ones the Secretary of the Interior proposes to change. 
Further, I quote: 
Those regulations revolutionized mining on the public lands. Bruce Babbitt, who should know better, is trying to fix things that are not broken and accomplish some mining reform laws through the back door. 
Mr. President, that is just what this issue is about. I don't know what is good for the goose or the chicken, but I do know what is good for the mining industry in the United States today; that is, to defeat and prevail on the motion to table the Bumpers amendment to strike. 
Mr. President, I ask that the remainder of my time be indicated.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Arkansas for his input and his consistent effort to bring this issue before this Congress, and certainly the U.S. Senate. 
I must differ with him on his interpretation. It is not unmitigated disaster. I think every Member of the Western States, and those States that have mining, recognize that there are certainly ills. But there is also an obligation and a pride to correct them, and those corrections are underway. But the suggestion that the Department of the Interior should have the broad authority to come in with sweeping new regulations that would in many cases have an adverse effect on the industry's ability to be internationally competitive is the threat proposed by the Department of the Interior. As a consequence, I would again expect to offer a motion to strike the amendment, and a tabling motion. 
I yield the remainder of my time. I thank my good friend for the spirited debate. We will keep him informed of the progress and the eventual resolve of this issue, if we don't get it done today.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last Friday, Congress and the American people were finally able to read the 445-page report on the investigation of the independent counsel, Judge Kenneth Starr. It is now, of course, the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to review that report and determine whether the articles of impeachment, censure, or whatever action, are indeed warranted against the President. 
I rise today not to discuss that specific issue of impeachment or censure, but I rise today to discuss the issue of equity. For the last 7 months, due to the actions of the President--and I might add, the President alone--substantial costs have accumulated as a result of the President's intentional strategy. And that strategy is to delay and thwart the investigations of Judge Kenneth Starr. 
Mr. President, I think it is the duty of this body to discuss and reflect on the cost that has been borne by the American public as a result of the calculated deception that has gone on for the last 7 months. Certainly, it has been evidenced by the report that it was a deception, a deception to cover up and delay. It is clear that after the President testified on January 17 in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit that the President began a calculated plan to mislead and basically deceive the independent counsel and the American public with his `legally accurate' testimony in the Jones case. 
Indeed, when the President's attorney, David Kendall, was asked yesterday if the President was purposely attempting to mislead the attorneys for Paula Jones during his sworn deposition, he replied `absolutely.' 
Mr. President, it has been 7 months now, 7 months since President Clinton sought to prevent the independent counsel from determining the veracity of his statements. Despite the fact that the Clinton administration issued a statement in 1994 that the administration would not invoke executive privilege for any personal wrongdoings, the President withdrew and reasserted claims of executive privilege on five specific occasions. These claims were warrantless and served as nothing more than a delay tactic. In fact, not one of the claims of executive privilege was found by a court of law to be justified. 
As a result of the President's plan for public deception--I hate to use that word, but I can't put it in any other term--and certainly delay, the investigation of independent counsel Starr was unnecessarily prolonged for approximately 7 months, despite the fact that the President, in January of 1998, promised, promised, the Congress and the American public to cooperate fully with the investigation. 
Lastly, the President refused six invitations to voluntarily testify before the independent counsel's grand jury. It was only when he was faced with the subpoena and the result of the DNA test and the reality that the tests would soon be completed that the President finally appeared before the grand jury. 
Where are we? What does all this really mean? It means that for more than 7 months, President Clinton has pursued a strategy of deceiving the American people and the Congress and purposely delayed and impeded the independent counsel's investigation. The cost of the President's campaign of delay and deception totals nearly $4.4 million.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. That letter that has just been made part of the Record is highlighted here relative to the detailed expense associated with the Monica Lewinsky incident, expenses from January 15 to August 31, 1998, including categories of expenses relative to personal compensation, travel costs, contractual services, supplies, capital equipment, administrative services. The total is $4.3 million, roughly $4.4 million. That is the cost to the American taxpayer. 
The question that I brought up earlier was one of equity. Equity demands the costs of the delays should be borne by the President and not the taxpayers of this country. 
I ask that my colleagues support me in the resolution that I have submitted which would require the President to reimburse the American taxpayers for the expenses that resulted from the delays of the investigation, the delays that were initiated and caused directly by the President. 
My colleagues should note that this resolution is not unprecedented. We, in Congress, have required Members under investigation by the Ethics Committee to reimburse the committee for the costs of the investigation. The same standard should apply in the case of the President of the United States.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky, who has labored in the area of campaign finance for an extended period of time, whose expertise many of us depend upon because once again this Senate is being called upon to reform our campaign finance laws. 
As with many issues, the issue of so-called reforming the laws is somewhat in the eyes of the beholder. As a consequence, I ask my colleagues to consider this legislation in perhaps a different context. The issue before this body, in my opinion, is simply: To what extent, if any, should the Federal Government regulate political free speech in America? The campaign finance debate is not just about politicians and their campaigns. At the core of this debate are the values and freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment. As a consequence, I suggest when Government attempts to place limitations on speech, it has an overwhelming burden to demonstrate why such restrictions to our fundamental freedoms are necessary. Surely the Government can no more dictate how many words a newspaper can print than it can limit a political candidate's ability to communicate with his or her constituents, yet that is precisely what the sponsors of this legislation are proposing for candidates for office. 
The McCain-Feingold legislation bristles with over a dozen different restrictions on speech, provisions that I believe flagrantly violate the first amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. I cannot overemphasize the point that was made by George F. Will in a Washington Post editorial. He stated, commenting on the McCain-Feingold bill: 
Nothing in American history--not the left's recent `campus speech codes,' nor the right's depredations during the 1950s McCarthyism or the 1920 `red scare,' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by campaign `reforms' advancing under the protective coloration of political hygiene. 
One of the most serious problems with this bill is that it contains restrictions on `express advocacy' within 60 days of an election by independent groups. And what is `express advocacy'? 
Mr. President, if this proposal ever becomes law, we can change the name of the Federal Election Commission to the Federal Campaign Speech Police. Every single issue advertisement would be taped, reviewed, analyzed, and perhaps litigated. The speech police will set up their offices in all of the 50 States to ensure the integrity of political advertising. Is that what we in this Chamber really want? I don't think so. But that is what will eventually happen if we adopt McCain-Feingold. 
I assure my colleagues, and hope they understand, that this wholesale encroachment on the first amendment would be immediately struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
Moreover, if a group of citizens decide to pool their money and advocate their political position in newspaper advertisements and television ads, what right does the Federal Government have to restrict their right of speech? Indeed, do we want to turn over the debate on political issues to the owners of the broadcast stations, the owners of the newspapers, and the editorialists during the 60-day period leading up to an election? Would my colleagues who are supporting this bill be ready to stand up and vote to ban election editorials in newspapers and on television in the last 60 days of a campaign? 
Many members of the public think we need fundamental changes to our election financial laws because in the 1996 Presidential election they witnessed the most abusive campaign finance strategy ever conceived in this country. 
There is an answer to those who abuse power. And the answer does not mean you have to shred the first amendment. The answer is a very simple one. It is that our current election finance laws must be strictly enforced, something that this administration has been extremely reluctant to do for obvious reasons. 
Mr. President, as grand jury indictments amass with regard to Democratic fundraising violations in the 1996 Presidential election, we learn more and more about President Clinton's use of the prerequisite of the Presidency as a fundraising tool. It is important to recall some of those abuses as we consider this debate. 
You recall, Mr. President, the Lincoln bedroom. During the 5 years that President Clinton has resided in the White House, an astonishing 938 guests have spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom and generated at least $6 million for the Democratic National Committee. 
Presidential historian Richard Norton Smith stated there has `never been anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of the White House for fundraising purposes * * * it's the selling of the White House.' 
The Presidential coffees: President Clinton hosted 103 `Presidential coffees.' Guests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon and a Chinese businessman who heads an arms trading company, donated $27 million to the Democratic National Committee. 
President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, gave the President weekly memorandums which included projected moneys he expected at each of the `Clinton coffees' and what they would raise. He projected each would raise no less than $400,000. 
In the area of foreign contributions, investigations by both the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Department of Justice into campaign abuses into the 1996 Presidential campaign have revealed that the Democrats recklessly accepted illegal foreign donations in exchange for Presidential access and other favors. 
A few examples: We recall John Huang. John Huang raised millions of dollars in illegal foreign contributions for the Democratic National Committee which the DNC has already returned. 
John Huang, despite being wholly unqualified according to his immediate boss, received an appointment to the Department of Commerce where he improperly accessed numerous classified documents pertaining to China. 
John Huang made at least 67 visits to the White House, often meeting with senior officials on U.S. trade policy. The committee had deemed that this was unusual because Huang's position in Commerce was at a very low level. 
Senator Specter stated that the activities of Mr. Huang at the Commerce Department had `all the earmarks of * * * espionage.' 
Charlie Trie, a long-time friend of President Clinton, raised and contributed at least $640,000 in contributions to the Clinton, Gore Campaign and for the Democratic National Committee. 
Shortly thereafter, President Clinton signed an Executive Order that increased the size of the U.S. Commission on Pacific Trade and then appointed Mr. Trie to the Commission. 
On January 29th of this year, the Department of Justice indicted Trie on charges that he funneled illegal foreign contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to buy access to top Democratic Party and Clinton administration officials. 
Vice President Gore was present at an event in a Buddhist temple where $80,000 in contributions to the Democratic National Committee were laundered through penniless nuns and monks. 
Vice President Gore offered differing characterizations of the Buddhist temple event. First, the Vice President described the event as a `community outreach.' He later characterized it as a `donor-maintenance' event where `no money was offered or collected or raised at the event.' 
However, the Department of Justice determined otherwise. So on February 18, veteran Democratic fundraiser Maria Hsia was 
charged in a six-count indictment by the Department of Justice for her part in raising the illegal contributions for the Democratic National Committee at the Buddhist temple event. 
Mr. President, just the day before yesterday, our Attorney General ordered a 90-day inquiry into whether President Clinton circumvented Federal election laws in 1996. This investigation could lead to yet another independent counsel investigation. This 90-day inquiry is in addition to an inquiry focusing on Vice President Gore's statements about his 1996 telephone fundraising calls in the White House. 
Mr. President, our current campaign finance system has many flaws, but the point I want to make to my colleagues is that these flaws do not justify shredding the first amendment, especially because the current occupant of the White House pushed the envelope of legality in his search to finance his reelection campaign. 
Mr. President, as Floyd Abrams, a noted first amendment lawyer, has stated:  
First amendment principles should guide whatever legislative solution we choose. The first principle is that it is not for Congress to decide that political speech is some sort of disease that we must quarantine. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this unconstitutional infringement on free speech. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act. This bill is simple, but extremely important. It makes it clear that it is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a national missile defense system which is capable of defending the entire territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack. 
We voted on cloture earlier this year--the motion fell one vote shy. Well, as is common in this business, we are dealing with changed circumstances. North Korea continues to defy rational behavior. As we all know, it recently fired a multi-stage missile over Japan! Starvation in North Korea is rampant, and many North Korea watchers have long predicted that government's imminent collapse. Well, Mr. President, the North Korean Government continues to defy the odds--but, what concerns me is the old adage that `desperate times often call for desperate measures.' If North Korea is truly desperate, to what extent will it go to try to hold on to its grasp of power? 
We have almost 80,000 American troops in the Asia/Pacific Theater. Most of these troops are already in the range of current North Korean missile technology. As their missile development program advances, we can expect more American lives and territory to be at risk. We cannot stand idly by and wait! We need to be prepared so that we can protect our citizens and our territory from such a reckless or accidental strike by North Korea or some other nation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Last year North Korean defectors indicated that the North Korean missile development program already poses a verifiable threat to American forces in Okinawa and seems on track to threaten parts of Alaska by the turn of the Century. The Taepodong missile, which is under development, would have a range of about 3,100 miles. From certain parts of North Korea, this weapon could easily target many of the Aleutian islands in western Alaska, including the former Adak Naval Air Base. 
The Washington Times reported earlier this year that the Chinese have 13 of 18 long-range strategic missiles armed with nuclear warheads aimed at American cities. This is incredible, Mr. President. Opponents to the motion to invoke cloture somehow fail to understand that this threat is real and that we have a responsibility to protect the United States from attack, be it deliberate or accidental. Without question, the threat of an attack on the United States is increasingly real, and we must act now to make certain that it is the policy of the United States to construct a national missile defense system with the capability of intercepting and deterring an aggressive strike against American soil from all parts of the United States--as soon as possible. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would mention for a moment that S. 1873 is not, and I repeat not, in any way a strike at Russia. The ABM treaty was crafted and agreed to when the United States and the Soviet Union were the only nuclear powers. The mutually assured destruction system was agreed to under the understanding that we were dealing with the Soviet Union, and not third parties. Times have changed; there are countless more players that have complicated the issues. We have a responsibility to protect ourselves, and we must act now to do so. 
Mr. President, I support the motion to proceed to the bill and hope that my colleagues will vote overwhelmingly in favor of this legislation this morning and pass it in the near future.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I rise today in support of Senator McCain's amendment restricting the transfer of funds to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (`KEDO') until the President certifies that North Korea is not actively pursuing the acquisition or development of a nuclear capability and is fully meeting its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
Mr. President, it is unfortunate that such language is necessary. For almost four years, the United States has provided funding to KEDO under an `Agreed Framework' negotiated by this administration with the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
Although this framework agreement was never submitted to the Congress for ratification, the Administration has come to Congress each year to ask for more and more money to carry out the Framework provisions to supply the North Koreans with heavy fuel oil and to run KEDO. Each year, the Administration has said that this is money well spent because the Agreed Framework has frozen and stopped the North Korean nuclear program. 
I have been skeptical of the Agreed Framework since its inception. I have never understood how United States negotiators agreed to a deal that did not allow international inspectors immediate and complete access to North Korea's nuclear program, including the two suspected but undeclared nuclear waste sites. Not only did this failure to demand complete access mean that we might never know how much plutonium the North Koreans diverted prior to the 1994 crisis, but it has also led to this situation where the much heralded `freeze' may have provided convenient cover for North Korea's more sinister plans. 
In the year following the signing of the Agreed Framework, former Majority Leader Bob Dole and I successfully added amendments to prohibit North Korea from receiving foreign assistance until the President certified to Congress that North Korea's nuclear threat had been eliminated. Both times the amendments were dropped in conference at the insistence of the Clinton Administration. Senator McCain and I have come to the floor countless times since then to try and correct loopholes in the Agreed Framework. I felt then, as I feel today, that the Agreed Framework did nothing to eliminate the nuclear threat from North Korea. 
In the last several weeks, disturbing intelligence information has surfaced that North Korea is constructing a vast underground complex that may be the site of another nuclear facility. This development alarms, but does not surprise, the Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. President, the United States must demand immediate access to this site before another penny of taxpayer dollars goes to subsidize this terrorist regime. 
If the North Korean regime is ready to put aside its drive for nuclear arms and to move toward the family of nations, then I believe the United States should rightfully welcome such a move and offer `rewards.' However, I strongly believe that North Korea must offer the concessions, and not the other way around. 
For too long, I believe we have let the North Korean government dictate the terms of negotiations, while they gained valuable time to push the suspected nuclear program ahead. From the track record, it is hard to tell which country is a tiny, isolated, terrorist regime violating international agreements and which country is a superpower pulling the weight for the international community. This must change. 
Mr. President, Senator McCain's amendment is a step in the right direction, and I urge its immediate adoption.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on July 22, exactly one week after receiving the nomination of Ambassador Bill Richardson to be Secretary of Energy, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on his nomination. Two days ago, exactly one week after the hearing, the Committee ordered his nomination reported. Now, two days later, the nomination is before this body for final passage at 2:00 p.m. I describe this to make it clear that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and its Chairman, have made every effort to go beyond simple good faith and work cooperatively with the White House and Department of Energy to fill this vital cabinet position. 
I believe that Ambassador Richardson is personally well-qualified to be Secretary of Energy. However, I, along with other members of the Energy Committee, have had serious reservations about this nomination. I have supported the demand of Senators Craig and Grams, and others, that this Administration show that it intends to live up to its responsibility to solve this Nation's nuclear waste problem. 
The Federal government is in breach of its contractual obligation to remove nuclear waste from more than 80 sites in 40 states by last January, making the American taxpayer liable for as much as $80 billion in damages. The Administration's failure to address this pressing environmental problem threatens to eliminate our single largest source of emissions-free power, and is already resulting in dirtier air. 
The Administration not only failed to propose a solution for this problem, they threatened to veto a Congressional solution that has overwhelming bipartisan support in both Houses. This issue was raised when the previous Secretary was nominated and confirmed, and we received assurances that he would work with us to address this problem. However, all we received from the Department of Energy was silence and a threat to veto Congress' proposed solution. 
All during this time, my request, echoed by many others on both sides of the aisle, to the Administration has been simple: live up to your obligation. The problem is real, and getting worse every day. If you do not like the solution Congress has proposed, you have an obligation to propose an alternative. I have made it clear that, while I can accept and support Ambassador Richardson as Secretary of Energy, I cannot accept any Secretary of Energy that would attempt to undertake all of this responsibility with no real authority. If the President does not trust, or expect, his nominee to undertake a resolution of one of the most important problems facing the Department of Energy, then he should not nominate him. If the Secretary of Energy cannot work with Congress to resolve such problems, then there is no point in having a Secretary of Energy.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. The letter does make it clear that Congress should not expect to hear anything substantive from the new Secretary of Energy on this matter until the end of the year, well after the election. This concerns me, as a signal that the Administration plans to continue to hold nuclear waste hostage for political posturing, while the physical and economic health of American citizens is held in abeyance. 
However, the President also assures me of his faith in Ambassador Richardson's ability to deal with this complex matter in a competent, straight-forward professional manner. I have faith in his ability, as well, as long as he is given the authority to exercise it. As I now have a promise that he will have such authority, I will take this commitment in good faith, the spirit in which I have conducted this entire process, and will expect no less from President and Ambassador Richardson. 
Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of Ambassador Richardson to be Secretary of Energy.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is a picture of a gentleman, Walter Samuelson. Walter Samuelson was 60 years old when he died February 1, 1992, as a consequence of a heart attack from complications he suffered in February of that year. Because of the weather in King Cove, AK, Samuelson waited 3 days after his heart attack before he could be removed out of King Cove to a hospital in Anchorage. By that time, his heart had been so severely damaged he eventually had to have a heart transplant. The Samuelson family believes that had Walter been able to get out of the village of King Cove a little earlier, he would not have had the major complications that led to his heart transplant. 
Mr. Samuelson was born and raised in King Cove, AK. He served in the military in the Korean war. He was a fisherman all his life, fishing with his father and brothers while growing up. And after serving in the military, he moved to Sitka and married. He and his wife, Freda, had four boys. During the summer, he would fly his plane 1,000 miles back to King Cove where his boat was and where he could continue his livelihood, fishing for salmon. He later moved back to King Cove to live and later remarried. He and his second wife, Tanna, had two more children. 
Mr. Samuelson was a dedicated patron of the school in King Cove and devoted much of his time and effort there, so much so that he was honored in the dedication of the school's yearbook to him as `a great friend of King Cove schools,' an honor which he certainly cherished. 
He is survived by his wife Tanna and children: Carl, Walter, Jr., Charles, John, Axel, and Tanna. His surviving brothers and sisters are: Anna Poe, Marion Walker, Thelma Hutton, Christine Christiansen, and Alex, Eugene, John, Frank, and Eric Samuelson. 
Mr. Samuelson required a heart transplant and died because there is no road between King Cove and Cold Bay. 
We wonder how many more people have to die before we do something about it. Eleven residents have perished in aircraft accidents being medevaced out of King Cove a short distance to Cold Bay, where there is a year-round crosswind runway, as opposed to the gravel strip in the village of King Cove, 
where sometimes the windsock is blowing at opposite ends of the runway in opposite directions because of the severe turbulence in what is classified as one of the three worst weather areas identified in the world. 
The point is the people of King Cove have an alternative, and that is a short, 7-mile road connection which would necessitate a gravel road of 7 miles on the edge of a wilderness area. The people of King Cove are willing to give approximately 700 acres of their land to enlarge the wilderness for access through 7 miles of wilderness. This is being objected to by the Department of Interior and by many of the environmental community. 
I hope, as we return from our recess, we can reflect on the human merits, so we do not have to address additional obituaries of people who died because of their inability to get medical care and have simple access that every American enjoys with the exception of people in the village of King Cove, AK. 
Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to wish you a very pleasant recess, and the other officials who are here in the Senate Chamber. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to advise my colleagues that today, as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I submitted to both the Democratic and Republican members of that committee, a chairman's mark specifically on the issue of self-determination for Puerto Rico. It is certainly a responsibility of my committee to provide and address the eventual disposition of the status of the American citizens in Puerto Rico, and the purpose of the draft is to provide them with an opportunity to express their dispositions on future political aspirations of the choice among commonwealth, independence, or statehood. 
Also, I advise my colleagues, this is the centennial anniversary of Puerto Rico under U.S. sovereignty--100 years that Puerto Rico has been under the U.S. flag. The people of Puerto Rico, as U.S. citizens, have been in a process of transcending to something that would focus in on certainty. There is a growing effort to try to bring some finality to the disposition of the status of Puerto Rican Americans because they do not participate as other U.S. citizens in the election of representation in the House and Senate. As a consequence, many of them are looking towards a definitive alternative. 
We have had hearings. We have listened to individuals from all sides of the debate. We have reviewed all testimony. We have had input from three political parties, certainly, as well as the Governor. I have directed the chairman's mark in the hopes that it will provide a brief, accurate and neutral definition of the status of the options. The mark is drafted to advance the process of self-determination for our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico. It is strictly advisory in its legislation. It does not mandate introduction of future legislation. It does not require any fast track. 
I grew up living in a territory--my State of Alaska. We had taxation without representation. Many people in the State of Alaska, filing their income tax returns, used to write in red, `filed in protest.' It made them feel a little better. It didn't do any good. But the point is these people living in Puerto Rico are entitled to certainty, and it is an obligation of the Congress to address a final resolution. 
I think our committee has a moral and constitutional responsibility to address the situation in Puerto Rico, but we don't want to get involved in the politics of Puerto Rico. That is not our business. I know the Governor intends to call a plebiscite this December. He may or may not choose to use the definitions that we provide him. Whether or not the Senate acts is another story. We have a short time left, but in my view this is an ongoing effort of the committee, a systematic progression. The definitions we have come up with and the structure in the previous bills, either the House bill or the Senate bill, have not been as neutral as we would have liked and would have involved, I think, more activity in local politics. We have attempted to be more objective. 
It is my hope the measure that eventually comes out of our committee will provide the Governor language that is accurate and neutral. The draft chairman's mark clarifies citizenship under each option. That was very important, in our conversations with all groups. The classification and clarification of citizenship was very important. Under commonwealth, citizenship provided by statute will continue to do so. Under separate sovereignty, citizenship would end. Under Statehood, citizenship is, of course, provided under the Constitution, so there is no question about that. 
Finally, I want to make it clear so long as Puerto Rico remains under U.S. sovereignty its residents, of course, will be U.S. citizens. If Puerto Rico wants separate sovereignty then, of course, U.S. citizenship would end. 
I provided members of the Energy Committee a copy of this mark for their review over the recess. After receiving members' comments, members of the committee, again, will discuss this matter in September. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Nation's gold repository at Fort Knox, Kentucky is an acknowledged asset--cuddled, counted and cared for. 
But the Nation has a potential `black gold' repository under the Arctic Oil Reserve (AOR) that is largely ignored by the Administration--denied, discounted and disputed. 
Should someone try to tunnel under Fort Knox to borrow a few tons of gold from the vaults, retribution would be swift--remember `Goldfinger'? 
Yet safe, environmentally sound development at the edge of ANWR at the Sourdough site could potentially siphon off barrels of oil belonging to the U.S. Government. Where is James Bond when we need him? 
Certainly not in the person of Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, the purported watchdog of the Nation's natural resources. 
To the contrary, Secretary Babbitt put his head in the tundra back in 1995 and pronounced the Arctic Oil Reserve's oil possibilities to be very low at about 898 million barrels. 
In May 1998, the Secretary's own scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey begged to differ. Their estimate based on three years of work by more than 40 geologists and other professionals is that a mean of 7.7 billion barrels of producible oil may reside in the 1002 Area of the AOR. 
In the interest of looking at this amazing leap in the estimate of ANWR's producible oil, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week, and invited the U.S. Geological Survey to participate. 
Three things rang clear at that hearing. 
First, while these estimates were the highest ever and proved the 1002 area of the AOR has the greatest potential of securing our Nation's energy needs--they were extremely conservative. 
For instance, these estimates were based on a minimum economic field size of 512 million barrels. When in practice the minimum economic field size in Alaska is much lower than that. 
Northstar: 145 mm/bb (With a sub-sea pipeline) is deemed economic; Badami: 120 mm/bb is deemed economic; Liberty: 120 mm/bb is deemed economic Sourdough: 100+ mm/bb (adjacent to AOR) is deemed economic. 
The Second fact that rang clear is while these new estimates show a clearer picture of the Western portion of the AOR, much remains unclear about the oil and gas potential of the massive structures present in the Eastern portion. 
While the USGS has slightly downgraded the potential of that specific area, they do not have the data that industry has from actually drilling a well. 
And I can assure you that those with knowledge of what that well contained--the select few--remain very optimistic about the potential oil and gas reserves of the Eastern portion. 
Third, technology has increased so dramatically that we can now extract greater amounts of oil from wells with far less impact on the environment at a cost 30% less than 10 years ago. 
Consider this, Mr. President. In June of 1994, Amerada Hess concluded the Northstar field in Alaska was uneconomic because development would exceed $1.2 billion and eventually sold the field to BP. 
Today, BP expects to begin production of that field's 145 million barrels of reserves in 2000. Estimated development costs: $350 million--a 70% reduction from just 4 years ago. 
Mr. President, all these factors point toward the logical conclusion that underlying the 1.5 million-acre oil reserve in Alaska lies greater reserves than recently estimated, and we need to confirm them with better science. 
Dr. Thomas J. Casadevall, acting director of the USGS, was very clear in his explanation that if the newer three dimensional (3D) seismic data were available from the Arctic Oil Reserve, their high May estimates of producible oil could soar even higher. 
Casadevall explained that their new estimates, while supported by sound science and peer review, were still based on 2D seismic tests done more than a decade ago. 
Kenneth A. Boyd, director, division of Oil and Gas of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, likened the advance of the new testing to the difference between an x-ray and a CAT-scan. 
He said the available information from 2D seismic as opposed to 3D seismic is that the former produces a line of data while the latter produces a cube of data. The cube can be turned and examined from all sides and the geologic information proves invaluable for exploration. 
This data has revolutionized exploration and development of the North Slope of Alaska. Modern 3-D data provides enhanced and incredibly accurate imaging of potential subsurface reservoirs. 
This in turn reduces exploration and development risk, reduces the number of drilled wells, and in turn reduces both overall costs and environmental impacts. 
Of course the Administration is under little pressure to allow testing or exploration of the Coastal Plain with gas prices at a 30-year low. However, the Department of Energy's Information Administration predicts, in ten years, America will be at least 64 percent dependent on foreign oil. It would take that same ten-year period to develop any oil production in AOR. 
Therefore, it seems prudent to plan ahead to protect our future energy security. 
I intend to introduce legislation that would allow 3D seismic testing on the Coastal Plain. This testing leaves no footprint. In fact, just last year the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allowed such testing to be done in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, declaring such testing would have `no significant impact.' 
It would have even less impact on the frozen tundra in ANWR. It is also a possibility that the oil industry would be willing to share in the cost of such testing. Let's at least find out what kind of resource we are talking about. 
It the Nation were to be crunched in an energy crisis--like the Gulf War--that would require the speedup of development; that development could impact the environment negatively because it would not have the benefit of thoughtful planning. 
I believe it is as criminal as stealing gold to refuse to acknowledge the potential for producible oil in the Coastal Plain of the AOR. If we don't know what the resource is, how can we protect it or make an informed decision about its use? 
And how can those in this Administration or the environmental community argue it is a bad idea to seek a greater understanding of our public lands? 
If we are just guessing that the Sourdough drillers may have tapped an underground AOR vein then we deserve to lose the resource. It is time to get rid of the guesswork and 3D testing will help to do that.

If I can question the floor manager relative to his intent, if we are in tomorrow and votes start at 1 o'clock, might it be possible to stack the votes in the event that actuality should be determined, because the last plane that I can catch is 2:20; otherwise, I have to leave the next day. And I don't request special consideration. On the other hand, it just means another day's delay. So if we did go into tomorrow and we start voting, the 2:20 plane is the last one I can catch.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee knows, we have been working for some time with the Natives of the Aleut Corporation, the Navy and the Department of the Interior on an effective plan for the reuse of Adak Naval Base, and I thank the Chairman for the inclusion of funding to help resolve remaining environmental problems with the facilities at Adak. 
The Aleut Corporation, one of Alaska's 12 Native regional corporations, is the only entity that has expressed an interest in assuming the closed base, and has proposed a land exchange involving the Navy and the Department of the Interior. The Senate Energy committee, as you know, is considering and has held a hearing on S. 1488, which would authorize an exchange of property that would promote the reuse of Adak and improve the Aleutian refuge through incorporation of Aleut Corporation inholdings. This legislation is designed to ratify an agreement that will very shortly be executed by the Aleut Corporation and the Departments of the Navy and the Interior.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act of 1998. This Act will lead to a brighter future for rural and remote communities by establishing two new grant programs that will address the unique economic and environmental challenges faced by small communities in rural and remote areas across this country. I am pleased that this legislation is co-sponsored by the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle. 
The bill authorizes up to $100 million a year in grant aid from 1999 through 2005 for any commuunities across the nation with populations of less than 10,000 which face electric rates in excess of 150 percent of the national average retail price. The money can go for electricity system improvements, energy efficiency and weatherization efforts, water and sanitation improvements or work to solve leaking fuel storage tanks. 
The bill also amends the Rural Electrification Act to authorize Rural and Remote Electrification Grants of an additional $20 million a year to the same communities. The grants can be used to increase energy efficiency, lower electricity rates or provide for the modernization of electric facilities. 
This nation has well-established programs for community development grants. The majority of these programs were established to help resolve the very real problems found in this Nation's urban areas. However, our most rural and remote communities experience different, but equally real, problems that are not addressed by existing law. Not only are these communities generally ineligible for the existing programs, their unique challenges, while sometimes similar to those experienced by urban areas, require a different focus and approach. 
The biggest single economic problem facing small communities is the expense of establishing a modern infrastructure. These costs, which are always substantial, are exacerbated in remote and rural areas. The existence of this infrastructure, including efficient housing, electricity, bulk fuel storage, waste water and water service, is a necessity for the health and welfare of our children, the development of a prosperous economy and minimizing environmental problems. 
There is a real cost in human misery and to the health and welfare of everyone, especially our children and our elderly from poor or polluted water or bad housing or an inefficient power system. Hepatitis B infections in rural Alaska are five times more common than in urban Alaska. We just have to do better if we are to bring our rural communities into the 21st Century. 
The experience of many Alaskans is a perfect example. Most small communities or villages in Alaska are not interconnected to an electricity grid, and rely upon diesel generators for their electricity. Often, the fuel can only be delivered by barge or airplane, and is stored in tanks. These tanks are expensive to maintain, and in many cases, must be completely replaced to prevent leakage of fuel into the environment. While economic and environmental savings clearly justify the construction of new facilities, these communities simply don't have the ability to raise enough capital to make the necessary investments. 
As a result, these communities are forced to bear an oppressive economic and environmental burden that can be eased with a relatively small investment on the part of the Federal government. I can give you some examples: in Manley Hot Springs, Alaska, the citizens pay almost 70 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. In Igiugig, Kokhanok, Akiachak Native Community, and Middle Kuskokwim, consumers all pay over 50 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. The national average is around 7 cents per kilowatt hour. 
Further, in Alaska, for example, many rural villages still lack modern water and sewer sanitation systems taken for granted in all other areas of America. According to a Federal Field Working Group, 190 of the state's villages have `unsafe' sanitation systems, 135 villages still using `honey buckets' for waste disposal. Only 31 villages have a fully safe, piped water system; 71 villages having only one central watering source. 
Concerning leaking storage tanks, the Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs estimates that there are more than 2,000 leaking above-ground fuel storage tanks in Alaska. There are several hundred other below-ground tanks that need repair, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. 
These are not only an Alaskan problem. The highest electricity rates in America are paid by a small community in Missouri, and communities in Maine, as well as islands in Rhode Island and New York will likely qualify for this program. Providing safe drinking water and adequate waste treatment facilities is a problem for very small communities all across this land. 
What will this Act do to address these problems? First, the Act authorizes $100 million per year for the years 1999-2005 for block grants to communities of under 
10,000 inhabitants who pay more than 150 percent of the national average retail price for electricity. 
The grants will be allocated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development among eligible communities proportionate to cost of electricity in the community, as compared to the national average. The communities may use the grants only for the following eligible activities: 
Low-cost weatherization of homes and other buildings; 
Construction and repair of electrical generation, transmission, distribution, and related facilities; 
Construction, remediation and repair of bulk fuel storage facilities; 
Facilities and training to reduce costs of maintaining and operating electrical generation, distribution, transmission, and related facilities; 
Professional management and maintenance for electrical generation, distribution and transmission, and related facilities; 
Investigation of the feasibility of alternate energy services; 
Construction, operation, maintenance and repair of water and waste water services; 
Acquisition and disposition of real property for eligible activities and facilities; and 
Development of an implementation plan, including administrative costs for eligible activities and facilities. 
In addition, this bill will amend the rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize Rural and Remote Electrification Grants for $20 million per year for years 1999-2005 for grants to qualified borrowers under the Act that are in rural and remote communities who pay more than 150 percent of the national average retail price for electricity. These grants can be used to increase energy efficiency, lower electricity rates, or provide or modernize electric facilities. 
This Act makes a significant step toward resolving the critical social, economic, and environmental problems faced by our Nation's rural and remote communities. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is legislation regarding the State of Alaska's sovereign right to manage its fish and game resources. 
The legislation will extend a current moratorium on the federal government from assuming control of Alaska's fisheries for two years until December 1, 2000. 
The language is similar to past moratoriums on this issue and is similar to language Congressman young added to the Interior Appropriations bill in the House, except that it is not conditioned upon action by the Alaska State Legislature. 
To every one of my colleagues their respective state's right to manage fish and game is absolute--every other state manages its own fish and game. 
In Alaska, this is not the case, and therefore, action must be taken to maintain the sovereign right of our state. 
Mr. President, Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) requires the State of Alaska to provide a rural subsistence hunting and fishing preference on federal `public lands' or run the risk of losing its management authority over fish and game resources. 
If the State fails to provide the required preference by state statute, the federal government can step in to manage federal lands. 
The Alaska State Legislature passed such a subsistence preference law in 1978 which was upheld by referendum in 1982. 
The law was slightly revised in 1986, and remained on the books until it was struck down by the Alaska Supreme Court in 1989 as unconstitutional because of the Alaska Constitution's common use of fish and game clause. 
At that time, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture took over management of fish and game resources on federal public lands in Alaska. 
In 1995 a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Katie John v. United States extended the law far beyond its original scope to apply not just to `federal lands,' but to navigable waters owned by the State of Alaska. Hence State and private lands were impacted too. 
The theory espoused by the Court was that the `public lands' includes navigable waters in which the United States has reserved water rights. 
If implemented, the court's decision would mean all fisheries in Alaska would effectively be managed by the federal government. 
Indeed in April of 1996, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture published an `advance notice of proposed rulemaking' which identified about half of the state as subject to federal authority to regulate fishing activities. 
These regulations were so broad they could have affected not only fishing activities, but virtually all activities on state and federal lands that may have an impact on subsistence uses. 
There is no precedent in any other state in the union for this kind of overreaching into state management prerogatives. 
For that reason Congress acted in 1996 to place a moratorium on the federal government from assuming control of Alaska fisheries. 
That moratorium has twice been extended and is set to expire December 1, 1998. 
The State's elected leaders have worked courageously to try and resolve this issue by placing an amendment to the state constitution that would allow them to come into compliance with the federal law and provide a subsistence priority. 
Unfortunately, the State of Alaska's constitution is not easily amended and these efforts have fallen short of the necessary votes needed to be placed before the Alaska voters. 
In fact, the legislature--the elected representatives of the people--in the most recent special session indicated that they were not supportive of amending the State Constitution and putting the issue to a vote of the people. 
Therefore we once again are in a position where we have no other alternative than to extend the moratorium prohibiting a federal takeover of Alaska's fisheries. 
The bill I am introducing today will accomplish this. It extends the current moratorium through December 1, 2000. 
I believe this will provide the State's elected leaders the needed time to work through this dilemma as they cannot finally resolve the matter of amending the State Constitution until November 2000. 
Mr. President, I do not take this moratorium lightly. 
I, along with most Alaskans, believe that subsistence uses of fish and game should have a priority over other uses in the state. 
We have provided for such uses in the past, I hunted and fished under those regulations and I respected and supported them and continue to do so now. I believe the State can again provide for such uses without significant interruption to the sport or commercial fisherman. 
I also believe that Alaska's rural residents should play a greater role in the management and enforcement of fish and game laws in Alaska. 
They understand and live with the resources in rural Alaska. They see and experience the fish and game resources day in and day out. And, they are most directly impacted by the decisions made about use of those resources. 
They should bear their share of the responsibility for formulating fish and game laws as well enforcing fish and game laws. 
It is my hope that the State will soon provide for Alaska's rural residents to have this greater role while at the same time resolving the subsistence dilemma once and for all. 
But until that happens, I cannot stand by and watch the federal government move into the State and assume control of the Alaska fish and game resources. 
I have lived under territorial status and it does not work. In 1959 Alaskan's caught just 25.1 million salmon. Under State management we caught 218 million salmon in 1995. 
Federal control would again be a disaster for the resources and those that depend on it.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from New Mexico. 
I rise in support of the amendment authorizing the purchase of 420 million dollars worth of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. First of all, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it is my responsibility to protect the energy security interests of this country. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created for emergency purposes. 
This amendment today would accomplish several goals: one, replace the oil that has been sold over the past several years for budgetary purposes. Now is a most opportune time to buy oil, when prices are at a 30-year low. 
In this context, it is interesting to reflect on the fact that the average price of the oil in the SPR is about $33 a barrel. Over the past several years, the average price we have gotten in selling it is about $19 a barrel. So far, the Government has not done very well. I do not know whether they figured they would make it up in volume, but it is certainly poor business to buy high and sell low. 
By taking action earlier this year, we stopped a proposed sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that was ordered in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill. We saved the American taxpayers over $ 1/2 billion by that action, and our energy security insurance policy remained intact. We did this, Mr. President, on an emergency appropriations bill. 
Over the past 3 years, we have steadily drained our Nation's energy security insurance policy. The drain started in 1996 when the Department of Energy proposed the sale of $96 million worth of oil to pay for the decommissioning of the Weeks Island facility. In other words, we had a piggy bank. We broke into it. We did it in order to meet some budgetary requirements. We have had a hard time staying out of that piggy bank ever since. 
In addition to the sale we canceled last year, there have been three additional sales. In January of 1996, the Balanced Budget Downpayment Act authorized the sale of $5.1 million barrels from Weeks Island. The oil cost a total of $40.33 a barrel. We sold it for $18.82. We lost $110 million. 
In the 1996 budget agreement, we required the sale of 12.8 million barrels for $227 million. Based upon the average cost of oil in the SPR, the American taxpayer lost approximately $200 million. 
The fiscal year 1997 appropriations required the sale of 10 million barrels for $220 million. Oil prices were up that winter, so the American taxpayer lost only $110 million. 
So far we have lost the American taxpayer $ 1/2 billion by selling oil that we put in the SPR by buying it high and selling it low. And, of course, two years ago the President proposed to balance the budget in the year 2002 by selling $1.5 billion worth of SPR oil at $10 a barrel, which would be 150,000 barrels of oil. I am grateful that wiser heads have prevailed. 
However, we did not stop the drip, drip, drip of small sales, the appropriations process. As I indicated, we paid an average of $33 per barrel. With three sales so far, it has cost the taxpayers a great deal of money--$ 1/2 billion. But now we have an opportunity to stop that by pursuing the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Mexico, who is also a member of the Energy Committee, because we are able to at an all-time low. 
It is a great investment for our national energy security interests. I am told that what we are doing now is replacing, in this 28 million barrels, the amount that we have sold over the past several years for budgetary purposes. So while we are still short of our objective of a 90-day supply of net imports, we will be somewhere in the area of a 64-day supply. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Let me congratulate my friend from New Mexico for offering it. I yield the floor and yield back whatever time I have.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the memory of the two Capitol Hill Police officers who gave their lives in the line of duty Friday afternoon. 
Jacob J. Chestnut and John Gibson were dedicated officers whose deaths are mourned by all of us on Capitol Hill, and by many across America. 
A sense of genuine grief grips us as we come to terms with the tragedy that unfolded in our midst on Friday. At the same time, we stand in awe of the heroism they and other officers displayed in ending a gunman's rampage and saving the lives of innocent citizens. 
Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson were committed to the United States, having sworn to protect lawmakers, citizens, and the peace as Capitol Police Officers. While I did not have the honor of knowing them personally, I am truly grateful for their dedication and service--as well as the dedication and service of all who serve as police officers. 
As a father of six and grandfather of eleven, I know how important family is. The loss of a son, father, husband, and friend is devastating. My thoughts and prayers and those of my wife Nancy are with those who knew and loved these two quiet heroes. 
Officer Gibson has left behind his wife, Evelyn, and three children. While the loss of Officer Gibson as a father and husband is immeasurable, I know his memory will be a source of strength for his family. 
Officer Chestnut is survived by his wife, Wen-Ling, and five children: Joseph Chestnut, William Chestnut, Janet Netherly, Janece Graham, and Karen Chestnut. Grief has surely stricken this family and the death of their cornerstone can never be as deeply felt by others, but Officer Chestnut died a hero, protecting his country as he had sworn to do both during his years in the Air Force and as a Capitol Police Officer. 
Mrs. Chestnut, Mrs. Gibson--please accept our condolences are prayers. We are all indebted to both your husbands for their dedication and their selfless, heroic acts. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about another very tragic incident which took place this last weekend. Yesterday, Lieutenant General David J. McCloud, commander of all the military forces in Alaska, was killed when his YAK-54 stunt plane went down over Fort Richardson. Lewis Cathrow, of Alexandria, Virginia, was also killed in this tragic crash. 
I had the pleasure of knowing David McCloud; although not nearly as well as I would have liked. He and his wife Anna came to Alaska this past December, when he took over as commander of the Alaskan command. As some of my colleagues may be aware, this post carries the distinction of being responsible for all of the more than 21,000 active duty and reserve personnel from all branches of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and National Guard in Alaska. But it also means that he is a key member of our community. And, Mr. President, this is how David should be remembered, as a member of our community. 
David McCloud died doing what he loved--flying. Before he took the post in Alaska, he told me of his plan to purchase a stunt plane, and how he had flown virtually every type of plane in our Air Force fleet, including the B1-B bomber and most of the fighter models used by our Air Force during the last 30 years. 
General McCloud will be sadly missed by many. My deepest condolences go out to his wife, Anna, and to his family and friends. They will be in my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank the Chair. 
I rise to share some of my concerns regarding H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act. 
First, let me state that I support the concept of H.R. 1151; that is, to prevent a current credit union member from being forced to disaffiliate, and also to allow a credit union an opportunity to reasonably expand its membership to help ensure the safety and soundness of the institution. 
I will support passage of H.R. 1151. However, in light of the realization of the tax-exempt status that Congress affords credit unions, I think it would be irresponsible for this body to not fully debate a serious problem that exists with this legislation; and it is the Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 
Madam President, we can talk about interpretation. We can talk about administering the act. But the realization is that the act calls for specific action by community banks. And the consequences of that are not only costly, but in some instances rather--well, they are rather amusing. Let us put it that way. 
I know of one bank in Los Angeles with numerous branches throughout the city. And those banks are primarily located in areas of high concentration of Chinese residents, both from the mainland previously, or their families, and Taiwan. So a good portion of the banks' customers clearly are Chinese. 
The Community Reinvestment Act mandates that these particular branches advertise in Hispanic areas of Los Angeles, advertise in areas where there are large concentrations of black residents, and move beyond, if you will, the traditional area that they serve with their branch system. 
This particular institution has been cited as being in violation of the Community Reinvestment Act because it did not have a certain percentage of Hispanic depositors and borrowers. So they were forced to go out and advertise in those particular areas, which they did. They still did not generate any business. 
If you go into this Chinese bank, so to speak, the tellers can speak English and Chinese. They are meeting, if you will, a minority service, but they are in violation, technically, of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
I could go on and on with numerous examples, but here, clearly, is an example where the Community Reinvestment Act is out of sync with reality. 
Community banks, for the most part, are small. Many of them are locally owned. Over half of the banks have only one or two branches. And they have excellent records of serving their communities because they are different than the money center banks. They are there to serve the community. They have to be there, and they have to do that or they would not survive. They have to serve the community. 
It is interesting to note that of the 8,970 small community banks, there are only 9--only 9--that have a substantial noncompliance CRA rating. Let me repeat that. Of the 8,970 small community banks in America, only 9 have received a substantial noncompliance rating. In other words, almost 9,000 small banks must spend hundreds of millions of dollars to comply with a Federal mandate simply because a bare 9 community banks had records that the regulators in Washington, DC, deemed bad. Well, that makes no sense, Madam President. It is just totally unrealistic. 
Because community banks by their very nature serve the needs of their community, community banks do not need a burdensome Government mandate to order them to do what they have already been doing a good job of for decades. 
The difference is the large banks don't have a difficulty in meeting the CRA requirements. The large banks have personnel. They have resources and they can easily absorb the costs of these additional CRA mandates. The small banks don't have these resources. It is very difficult for them to absorb the high cost of the Community Reinvestment Act, and even the credit unions express concern over additional costs, additional Federal mandates. 
How costly are the CRA requirements? Let's just take a look at this chart, because I think it shows adequately that this is a very meaningful cost. If we look at the chart, we see the financial burden of the CRAs to small community banks is costly, costly in both dollars as well as man-hours. If we look at compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, what it costs the community banks--14.4 million employee hours; 6,900 full-time employees; $1,256 per $1 million in assets--the total cost of the CRA to community banks is over $1 billion a year. 
One of the curious things about the manner in which this debate is going on, it is my understanding that Senator Gramm has put in an amendment to exempt the credit unions from the CRA requirements. The CRA requirements are in the Banking Committee bill to exempt the credit unions from CRA requirements. 
Senator Shelby's amendment is simply to exempt small banks from the same CRA requirements. Now, is that not an equitable situation? I am surprised that the President has come down and suggested that if this passes, the Shelby amendment, it is grounds for vetoing the bill. What is the logic in that? What is the equity? What is the fairness? What we are trying to do here is to serve America's consumers. The way to do that is lower costs. 
If it costs the small community banks $1 billion a year, that cost has to be passed on. What many in this body don't recognize is the difficulty that the small community bank has in meeting these requirements as compared to its competitor, whether a Bank of America or Citicorp or any of the major institutions. This is just another cost of doing business that they can assimilate. But the small country banker on the corner has a real problem with this in spite of what some of the debate has suggested here today. 
The regulatory costs of the CRA impairs the ability of small banks to serve the needs to their local community. As this chart shows, it costs real money--$1 billion--to comply with the CRA. Banks must comply with the Truth in Lending Act. That requirement, which everyone supports, takes less than half the man-hours of the CRA and costs nearly half of what CRA costs. The banks must also meet the important Equal Credit Opportunity Act which prevents discrimination in lending, a worthy goal. Yet the cost of complying with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is barely one-fifth of the onerous costs of the CRA. 
I am a cosponsor of the Shelby amendment which exempts small banks, exempts small banks with $250 million in assets from CRA. Personally, I don't feel that goes far enough. I believe a $500 million threshold is a more appropriate figure. 
Why is an exemption for small banks with $500 million in assets more appropriate? Well, there is a good reason. That is the threshold we established 12 years ago to distinguish small banks from large banks in the 1986 reform of the Tax Code. We recognized back then that the small banks, banks with less than $500 million, should be allowed a deduction for reserve for bad debts but denied a similar reserve deduction for large banks. It only makes sense to use a definition already so well established. Obviously, by the attitude prevailing here with regard to the equity, I am not going to pursue that, but I think that is an appropriate threshold as you look at where you cut off a small bank from a large bank. 
I believe the Shelby amendment is a modest amendment that all of our colleagues should support. It is equitable. To have the threat of the White House come down, that they will veto this if it prevails, is absolutely unrealistic, and it is certainly unfair. 
I think it is time we sent a message to the White House with regard to the merits of the debate on issues of equity and fairness. To suggest that the White House simply comes down with a threat--this Senator from Alaska is not buying. If there are any financial institutions in America that do not need to have a Federal community reinvestment mandate imposed upon them, it is America's small community bankers. They are not making loans in Indonesia. They are not making loans in South Korea. Their loans are in their communities. That is how they survive. Why exempt the credit unions and penalize small banks, small banks who pay taxes? 
Make it fair. Make it equitable. Exempt both. That is the correct action that should be taken by this body. I hope there are enough Members who will stand up for what is right and equitable.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment will delay for one year the application of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, abbreviated as GMDSS, to fishing industry vessels. The purpose of the delay is to allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the time to address a number of serious concerns that have recently come to light involving GMDSS for fishing industry vessels. Also Mr. President, let me make clear that the delay will not affect any other type of vessel. 
GMDSS is a system created by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) under the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). It was intended to improve safety for large cargo and passenger vessels on international voyages. It is scheduled to go into effect on February 1 of next year. There is no doubt that GMDSS will indeed improve safety for these types of vessels. 
Fishing vessels are very specifically not covered by SOLAS, but the FCC regulation requiring GMDSS for international passenger and cargo vessels is also being applied to large domestic fishing industry vessels anyway. 
Because these types of vessels operate very differently, there are serious questions as to whether the system should be applied in the same way. 
The most important of the questions that has been raised for the fishing industry involves the safety and well-being not of the fishing vessels required to carry GMDSS equipment, but of the smaller vessels that work around them. 
One of the things that makes GMDSS attractive to large vessels on international voyages is that it is automated, using a feature called Digital Selective Calling (DSC). Because of this, when the large vessels switch to GMDSS on February 1, they will no longer be required to maintain a continuous watch on the two emergency frequencies used under the current system. 
In the United States, the watchstanding requirement has been extended to the year 2005 for VHF Channel 16, but will cease on February 1 for 2182 kilohertz. These are the two frequencies used by small vessels, including the small fishing vessels that operate in and around the larger vessels that will be required to convert to GMDSS. 
When a fishing vessel is in distress, the vessels closest to it and in the best position to render aid are other fishing vessels working in the same area. 
But, Mr. President, what will happen when the small vessel sends out a distress call, only to find that the larger and better-equipped fishing vessels around it are no longer listening? 
This is--obviously, and with very good reason--a major concern. Under the theory of GMDSS, contact with other vessels is to be replaced by contact with a shore station. That's all well and good on an international voyage, where it may eliminate confusion and speed up response. But for fishing vessels, it may very well slow response time--and believe me, Mr. President, in the frigid waters of the Bering Sea in the winter, every second counts toward life--or toward death. Because of this, there is a very real danger that shifting the largest and most capable vessels of the fleet to GMDSS may actually degrade safety for smaller, but far more numerous vessels operating in the same areas. 
In fact, although the GMDSS system is supposed to replace ship-to-ship emergency communications with a unified ship-to-shore system maintained by the Coast guard, the fact is that the Coast Guard itself is not ready to implement it fully. 
With the system scheduled to go into effect in just a few months, there are still major shore-based components that have not yet been installed. In Alaska, for example, the Coast Guard is only this summer starting the installation of medium-frequency receivers. And throughout the country, installation of VHF receivers has been delayed indefinitely--it is `on hold.' According to the Coast Guard's own task force on GMDSS, the VHF system will probably not be in place before 2003 at the earliest. 
The fact that GMDSS was not designed for the fishing fleet is an issue itself. Most every mariner of any sort is familiar with SOLAS, and knows that it does not apply to fishing vessels. As a result, when the FCC published the proposed GMDSS rule in 1990, and when it made the rule final in 1992, the fishing industry was not made aware that it would be applied to fishing industry vessels, which are generally treated as a separate class of vessels under U.S. law. 
Indeed, when the proposed GMDSS regulation was printed in the Federal Register in 1990, it specified that fishing vessels would not be included: `Small ships, such as private fishing vessels and recreational yachts, are not affected by the proposed changes.' This same statement is still being repeated, in an informational document about GMDSS that is currently offered on the FCC's Internet site. 
Given this confusion, it is no wonder that the fishing industry's concerns did not surface sooner; most of the industry was unaware of the need to comment. This alone is a huge flaw in the way the rulemaking was conducted, but one that can be corrected given a little more time to explore and address the fishing industry's concerns. 
Mr. President, the affected fishing industry vessels already carry all but one feature of the GMDSS system. They have VHF radios and single-side-band radios, EPIRBS, radars, radar transponders and hand-held VHF radios for their life rafts, and so forth. Each vessel already carries--at a guess--$20,000 to $30,000 worth of sophisticated communications equipment. The only thing they are lacking is the Digital Selective Calling (DSC) feature. 
In a recent meeting with the Coast Guard and the FCC, we learned that there is no reason DSC could not be added to the existing equipment for a very reasonable cost--perhaps $5,000. However, the industry has indicated that electronics vendors have so far either declined to sell DSC as a separate component, or if they do, to offer a component warranty on it. Instead, they are insisting that the fishing industry purchase large consoles where all of the GMDSS equipment is pre-installed--at a cost of $50,000 to $60,000 dollars each. Because of the confined nature of the wheelhouse on the average vessel, significant structural changes may have to be made to fit the console in place, and of course, the existing $30,000 of equipment would have to be scrapped. That means, Mr. President, that the cost of outfitting these vessels may reach as much as $100,000--all to get a $5,000 piece of equipment on board. That, Mr. President, is why people get upset at their government. That, Mr. President, is just plain wrong. 
These are just a few of the very serious issues that justify a delay for fishing industry vessels so that the rule can be re-examined and improved with better input from the industry. No one wants to see safety degraded in any way--including by mandating `improvements' that may be no such thing. 
It may be that GMDSS is the way to go for fishing industry vessels as well as the large international cargo vessels and passenger liners it was designed for. If so, it should be adopted, and I'm sure it will be. But if not, we must take the time to listen first.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Once again, Mr. President, the distinguished manager is correct. Based on discussions with the two agencies directly involved in this matter, and with the fishing industry, it is evident that the industry has legitimate concerns and questions that have not been answered. The moratorium will allow the agencies the time to revisit the issue in the detail that it deserves. I hope they will take the opportunity either to reopen the rulemaking with respect to fishing industry vessels or to open a new rulemaking that specifically deals with such vessels, so that the unique characteristics of the fishing industry are considered.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a good friend of the State of Alaska passed away on Sunday evening, Clifford Groh. He was a well-respected member of the Anchorage community and a leader in the Republican Party. He was educated in New York and New Mexico before settling in Alaska. He served his country in the Navy and plied his trade as a lawyer. Cliff served our state as a member of the Alaska Constitutional Research Committee, Chairman of the Anchorage Charter Commission, the Anchorage City Council, the Borough Assembly, and also as a State Senator. In 1967 he was appointed Honorary Chief by the Alaska Federation of Natives and in 1972, he was voted Outstanding Legislator of the Year by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. Cliff served as our State Party National Committeeman from 1976-78 and General Counsel from 1978 to 1990. President Bush appointed Cliff to the Arctic Reserach Commission. In 1977, I had the pleasure of presenting him with the Republican Party of Alaska's Life Service Award. He is survived by his wife, Lucy and their three children. 
Mr. President, we share the family's grief at their great loss and take solace in the fact that this talented, highly respected man will live on in the memory of all who had the pleasure to know him.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today with 12 of my colleagues, including our distinguished Majority and Minority Leaders, I submit an important resolution that affects the health and safety of all of our children. My resolution would designate October 15th, 1998 as National Inhalant Abuse Awareness Day. 
What is inhalant abuse? Many of you may know it as `sniffing' addiction. At alarmingly high rates, today's young people are using common household products to get high. In my state of Alaska alone, 22% of the high school and 19% of middle school students admit to experimenting with inhalants. 21% of students nationally will have tried inhalants by the time they graduate from high school. 
Inhalant abusers often start in elementary school, as young as 7 years old. In Alaska, there is even a report of a three year old using inhalants, having probably been taught to do so from an older sibling. Inhalant abusers are both male and female and cut across all socio-economic backgrounds. It is a national epidemic which affects all of our communities. 
Inhalant abuse is so prevalent because of the availability and affordability of the products. The over 1,000 products being abused include nail and furniture polish, markers, whip cream aerosols, glue, gasoline, and air fresheners. These products are available in every home across the country and are sold for only a few dollars in every corner market. Unlike other substances young people abuse--alcohol, cigarettes, and harder drugs like cocaine, marijuana and heroin--these are perfectly legal products and harmless if used according to the directions. 
All of us have these products in our homes and at some point, we have all asked our children to follow those directions and polish the living room furniture or fix a broken dish. But how many of us knew these items, which we so casually use, could someday kill our children? According to a recent study, only four percent of parents suspected their children of inhaling when in fact, 21% of them have. 
With the products accessible and cheap, how do we stop the abuse without more laws? Congress can't just enact another law this time, we can't outlaw furniture polish or gasoline. Instead, I strongly believe the solution lies within our communities and our families. We, as community leaders, parents, and grandparents, should make a concerted effort to involve young people in other activities--teach them a trade or give them a summer job. I suggest that families pray together and eat their meals together. Children who have loving supportive homes and who are involved in a job or their community are less likely to be enticed by drugs, including inhalants. 
We can also provide information. Inhalant abuse could be reduced if parents knew what symptoms they should be looking for. The warning signs for abuse include: unusual breath odor, chemical odor on clothing, a drunk or dazed appearance, hand tremors, red or runny nose and eyes, spots or sores around the mouth and anxiety and restlessness. 
A sudden drop in grades and school attendance can also be an indication of drug abuse. 
Most importantly, teenagers and children need to be told over and over again that even one try, one sniff, can kill. What they may view as simple experimentation can kill them. If they don't die from inhalant abuse, they may be left with permanent brain, liver and kidney damage. 
I hope that on October 15th, my colleagues in the Senate will join me in a nationwide conversation about inhalant abuse. Together, as community leaders, parents, and concerned citizens, we can educate parents and young people while encouraging community and family oriented solutions to drug abuse.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we have conversed with my good friend, the Senator from Arkansas, on this amendment. It is my understanding that we have worked it out as an accommodation to rectify a situation where veterans, native Eskimo Indian Aleuts, who were on active duty during the time of the Vietnam conflict, were therefore unable to apply for their allotment. This situation should be rectified. It scores zero dollars in the first year and perhaps $1 million each year thereafter. 
In view of the fact that this is a $93 billion package, I think it warrants consideration to right a wrong for those who served in active duty, served their country, and yet were unable to qualify for their 160-acre allotment because they were on active duty. We have assured all parties that none of the acreage would come out of conservation units, and Senator Bumpers has been most accommodating. It is my understanding the minority will accept the amendment--subject to Senator Bumpers' input.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. As we debate the provisions of the FY 1999 appropriations for the EPA and other agencies I would like to raise an issue of concern. During a June 4 hearing before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, committee members explored the concern that this Administration has no real plan in place to assure that we will meet the nation's substantial and growing energy needs. In responding to this concern, Administration representatives, including a representative of the EPA, failed to mention that in addition to failing to plan for our growing energy needs, EPA had recently taken action that could further erode our capability to fuel our economic growth by a `back-door' attempt to regulate carbon dioxide. 
On June 2, only two days before this hearing, the EPA had published a notice in the Federal Register of its intent to modify a consent decree between EPA and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an organization with very strong views on global climate policy. The proposed modification would require EPA to analyze emissions reductions of CO2 through its regulation of other emissions. While this seems innocuous enough, it is clear that this is an attempt to bring CO2 within the meaning of `air pollutant' under the Clean Air Act. 
Although EPA has apparently denied that this is an attempt to implement the Kyoto Protocol prior to its ratification, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council had a different response. In a Washinton Times article on July 8, Mr. Dan Lashoff of the Council states that the consent decree `is intended to look ahead to emissions reductions of carbon dioxide that may be required to achieve national objectives as established by the [Kyoto] treaty.' As a key party to the consent decree, Mr. Lashoff understands the objectives of this modification, even if EPA does not. 
My concerns about this development are several. First, this action constitutes an attempted breach of promise against the Administration's assurances to Congress that there will be no implementation of the Kyoto accord prior to Senate ratification. Under Secretary Eizenstat has gone so far as to commit that `no agency or interagency body has been given responsibility to develop potential proposals for legislation or regulation that would be intended to comply with the Kyoto Protocol if it were to become binding on the U.S.' Second, the proposed modification exceeds EPA's authorities under the Clean Air Act. Third, the proposed modification is outside the scope of the original consent agreement. 
Clearly, Madam President, Congress should expect both EPA and the Justice Department to withhold consent to this inappropriate modification to the consent agreement. Could you state whether you believe the actions I have described would be an appropriate use of the proposed funding for EPA in the appropriations bill under consideration?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to thank my colleague, the Chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee, Senator Bond, for including in this appropriations bill an important provision--one that would unlock and open the door to many first-time home buyers. 
As we are all aware, it is often the downpayment that is the largest impediment to home ownership for first-time home buyers. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) began a pilot program two years ago to help families overcome that impediment by lowering the downpayment necessary for an FHA home mortgage. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the pilot program, which is located in Alaska and Hawaii, has reported great success. 
This pilot program is effective because it accomplishes two feats: (1) it lowers the FHA downpayment, making it more affordable; and (2) it makes the FHA downpayment calculation easier and more understandable for all parties to the transaction. The pilot program requires--on average--only a minimum cash investment of three percent for home buyers. 
Earlier in the year, I and Senators Stevens, Akaka and Inouye, introduced a bill that amends the National Housing Act by simplifying the current complex downpayment formula. The simplified formula creates a lower, more affordable downpayment. Our bill would extend this lower and simplified downpayment rate to perspective home buyers across the country. 
Mr. President, the pilot program is a win-win situation: affordable homes are made available to responsible buyers without any increase in mortgage default rates. Here's what mortgage lenders have reported: 
There is no indication of increase in risk. The loans we have made to date have been to borrowers with excellent credit records and stable employment, but not enough disposable income to accumulate the cash necessary for a high downpayment: Richard E. Dolman, Manager, Seattle Mortgage, Anchorage Branch. 
Is the 97% program working? The answer is a resounding YES!. . .In this current day, it takes two incomes to meet basic needs. To come up with a large downpayment is increasingly difficult, especially for those just starting out. The 3% program is a good start. . .I do not believe that lowering the downpayment increased our risk. . : Nancy A. Karriowski, Alaska Home Mortgage, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska. 
We have experienced nothing but positive benefits from the FHA Pilot Program Loan Calculation in Alaska and Hawaii: Roger Aldrich, President, City Mortgage Corporation, Anchorage, Alaska. 
In fact, but for the pilot program, approximately 70% of the FHA loan applications in Palmer, Alaska would be rejected, simply because the buyer could not afford the downpayment. Mr. President, thanks to this pilot program, more and more deserving Alaskans are becoming home owners. 
Mr. President, our legislation has the support of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. They believe, as I do, that borrowers in all states should benefit from the simplification of the FHA downpayment calculation. 
Therefore, I am pleased that the Chairman of the Subcommittee has included in this appropriation bill a provision to expand the Alaska/Hawaii demonstration program to all states. The provision only offers the program as a two-year demonstration project, whereas, my legislation would have made it permanent--but I understand the Chairman's desire to continue evaluating the costs of this program before permanent status is granted. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that helping American families realize their dream of home ownership is vital to the Nation as a whole. This important provision in the VA/HUD appropriations bill does much to assist families in owning their first home--thereby making the American dream of home ownership a reality.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last week the Senate made an important statement that we support Taiwan by passing S. Con. Resolution 107. And that we are committed to her people, to her government and to her democratic way of life. 
While we have made countless statements in this body before concerning Taiwan, the circumstances which led to S. Con. Res. 107 were different--markedly different--from those in the past. During the President's trip to China last month, President Clinton `clarified' his policy toward Taiwan. He indicated while in Beijing--that the United States, in agreeing to the One China policy, had agreed with China that reunification would be peaceful. Further, while in Shanghai, he went a step further and, for the first time, uttered that the United States supports the `Three Noes' long advocated by the government of the People's Republic of China. That is: the United States does not support one-Taiwan, one China; the United States does not support Taiwan independence; and the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in nation-state based international organizations. 
To understand why this concerns me, Mr. President, one needs to understand the nuances of our federal law and policy toward Taiwan. It is in the Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by the President in 1979--back when the United States officially broke off relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan in favor of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Section 2(b)(3) states that `. . . the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means.' We have also signed Three Joint Communiques with the PRC which address the Taiwan question. While they all speak to the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, none goes so far to speak to the question of reunification. 
Up to now, the saving grace of American policy toward China and Taiwan, if there were any grace to it, was the ambiguity. China did not know what the United States would do if Taiwan declared independence; or if China attacked. They thought they found out in 1996, when the President rightly sent two aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Straits to show our strength and resolve--while the Chinese conducted missile tests aimed at influencing the national presidential elections in Taiwan. But we have a whole new ballgame, now Mr. President. What a difference a day makes. 
Incredible, Mr. President. The Administration then feigns innocence and insists that the President's remarks did not constitute a policy change and that our policy on Taiwan has not changed since 1979--that it is the same now as it was then. I'm sorry, but I have to expose this for what it is--a world of make believe. If you repeat something enough times, eventually people will take it as the gospel. Well not this time. 
This is a policy change; and a serious one at that. Considered collectively, which I know the Chinese government is doing, it appears to be a major concession by the United States on the issue of Taiwan. As I said last Tuesday, I know the Chinese; and understand full well that they will use it to their utmost advantage. They will tell Taiwan and the Taiwanese people that if they declare independence, even if by democratic referendum (one person, one vote), that the United States will not support them. Case in point, the Washington Post article last Friday, `China Tells Taiwan to `Face Reality' Reunification Talks Urged.' Although I brought this to the Senate's attention last week, I think the point needs to be reiterated so that people are on notice. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article appear in the Congressional Record following my remarks.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. This article points out that `Chinese officials have said they plan to use the remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into political talks on reunification.' So let me make sure I understand this--the leader of the greatest democratic society in the history of mankind, has tacitly agreed to a policy which, in itself, undermines democracy. How and why is this possible? Because political expediency took the place of sound policy and support for one of our strongest allies in an increasingly unstable Asian Theater. Well, Mr. President, I am afraid that these developments may have simply added to the Asian uncertainty, rather than clarified it. 
In agreeing to the `Three Noes', President Clinton has effectively stated that the United States will not support Taiwan independence even if Beijing agrees to it. Is this the message that was intended to be delivered? Think about it--the United States used to maintain the line that peaceful resolution was all that mattered because this in itself protected the rights of the 21 million people in Taiwan. If they could cut a deal with Beijing that allowed the two to go their separate ways, presumably our earlier policy would be fine with that. Personally, as the PRC becomes more open, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that an agreement could be reached. But President Clinton's remarks have ruled this possibility out--because the United States will not support an independent Taiwan. President Clinton just told the Chinese that they don't need to negotiate with Taiwan because so far as we are concerned an independent Taiwan is not an option. 
Although most of my colleagues are not aware of this, there is a terrible contagion going through Taiwan right now--it is very similar to polio. Estimates are that up to one million people may be carrying this bug in some form or another, but it doesn't impact adults. Only the children. In fact, a number of children in Taiwan have died from this disease which, as I understand it, is exacerbated by the heat. 
Well, Mr. President, Taiwan has applied for membership in the World Health Organization (WHO)--it is a national priority. But, even this application cannot proceed because membership in the WHO requires statehood. And that huge island off the coast of China, which we recognized officially from 1949 to 1979, doesn't have it. This is ridiculous, and it is about to get a lot worse. So, Taiwan is suffering from an epidemic which is killing children, and it can't get access from WHO specialists who might be able to help because Taiwan is not a sovereign government? Although the PRC has never controlled Taiwan, and despite the fact that Taiwan has developed a strong democracy and thriving, stable free market economy, it cannot particpate in the World Health Organization. Well, Mr. President, this seems yet another time when the facts somehow lose out to the politics. 
Mr. President, we have made statements reiterating our support for Taiwan, but it is time for us to back them up. The Senate should pass S. Con. Resolution 30 calling on the Administration to support Taiwan's bid to take part in international organizations; and we should expand it to include the World Health Organization. We should take every opportunity in this body to force the issue, so that our commitment to Taiwan does not ring hollow as Beijing's steps up the pressure.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have on my right an obituary. This obituary is very meaningful to the people of a small village in Alaska called King Cove. 
Ruth E. Croxton, 29, was killed July 15, 1981, when her twin-engine plane crashed and burned on a hillside. The plane was on approach to the King Cove, Alaska airstrip--in what was called `typical Aleutian weather.' Five other people died in the accident, including the pilot, Ernest D. Fife. 
Ms. Croxton was an anthropologist, a pilot, and a 1974 graduate of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. Born in Salem, Ore., her family moved to Alaska when she was six years old. She was graduated from Juneau-Douglas High School in 1969. 
Ms. Croxton and her pilot were bringing four cannery workers into King Cove but would have been evacuating a medical case once they reached the Aleutian village. 
She is survived by Mr. and Mrs. Loren Croxton of Petersburg; a sister, Mary, of Barrow; and her maternal grandfather, William Older of Livermore, Calif. 
Ms. Croxton died along with her passengers because there is no road between King Cove and Cold Bay. 
How many more people must die before we do something about it? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we have given the amendment to both of the floor leaders. 
The simple reality of this amendment is that this affects a group of native Alaskans--Aleut, Eskimo, and Indian--who served in uniform during the Korean or Vietnam war, and as a consequence of that service were unavailable and not in the State at the time when they would have had the opportunity to take advantage of an individual allotment, which was authorized under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, allowing the collection of up to 160 acres of nonmineral, vacant, unappropriated, unreserved land in Alaska to any qualified Alaska Native head of a household. 
What happened during that timeframe between 1968 and 1972, which is the 3 years that are explicitly addressed in this amendment, is that the authorization for the selection ended. So what we have here is the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971 that terminated this selection opportunity, and there were a number of Alaska Natives serving in the military who did not have an opportunity to take advantage of the 160 acres that were due them under the 1906 law. 
Now, Mr. President, it is fair to say that we do not have a scoring on this. We hope to have one tomorrow. It is fair to say also that scoring would be very insignificant because this is land where they traditionally have fished, they have hunted, they have subsisted, and it is not land in areas of sensitivity relative to parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife areas. In all candor, it is also appropriate to say that the Department of Interior will be in opposition to it from the standpoint of any public land transferring to any individuals, even the indigenous people who were given by congressional action the right to the selection of this land. 
Now, it is also fair to reflect on the fact that Alaska contains about 365 million acres. We are talking about authorization for those valid recipients of land in an amount less than 300,000 acres. So it would be equivalent to dropping, if you will, a tack in the State of Virginia in relationship to the footprint. 
I recognize the effect that anything of significant scoring would have on this bill. We do not want to jeopardize the bill. I have talked to the floor manager. It is my hope that we can get an accurate scoring that reflects reality. It is also my hope that we recognize this truly belongs in the category of veterans issues. I am on the Veterans' Committee. I have been on that committee for 18 years. These veterans simply were unable to take advantage of the opportunity because they were serving in the Armed Forces. 
So the amendment would restore the right of the Vietnam era Alaskan Native veterans to apply for these allotments as a right that they were denied only because they were serving in the uniform of our Nation. 
The Amendment calls for the same standards that were in effect under the Allotment Act to be used to evaluate the new applications. Additionally, it calls for DOI to develop rules to implement this bill in consultation with Alaska Natives. 
This amendment allows the Department of the Interior ample time to promulgate regulations needed to carry out the provisions of this amendment. 
The amendment protects the current valid rights of the Federal Government. 
The amendment also addresses the concerns of the administration about possible Veteran allotments within Conservation System Units. 
If an Allotment is within a Conservation System Unit The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to offer other lands to the allottee. 
I think this is a fair solution as these veterans had rights to these lands long before they were ever made part of a CSU. 
This amendment is appropriate on this bill as it addresses a specific problem incurred by Veterans of the Vietnam war who are Alaska Natives and were denied a privilege offered other Alaska Natives, for the sole reason that they were overseas defending our freedom. 
I know the administration would like to see this amendment `tightened' to include a smaller class of veterans and I think that is plain wrong. 
Where our veterans are concerned I think we should always err on the side of greater participation as without every one of them we would not be here today as free people. 
On a per capita basis, Alaska Natives represent the largest group of minorities serving in active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. 
It is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays tomorrow sometime, but I hope to have the opportunity to have further discussion with the floor managers on the scoring unless they have specific questions for me at this time.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. I recognize the timeframe. 
I think it is fair to recognize another thing though: That two-thirds of the world's population, or thereabouts, are under some type of sanctions or threatened sanction by the United States. I think the question we have to ask ourselves is, As we address the justification of sanctions, are we really helping the people we want to help? 
I commend the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, for bringing this matter up, because we can continue to debate it, we can continue to evaluate it, but the reality is, it is time to address the effectiveness of these sanctions. And, as a consequence, I rise to support the amendment of the Senator from Indiana on sanctions. 
I think he is offering the amendment for one reason, which is because sanctions are now a popular choice to promote our agenda and, of course, legitimately protect our national interests. There is nothing wrong with this reasoning except many times sanctions simply do not work in the manner that we have intended. They are one tool that we can use against rogue nations--granted. The question is, How effective are sanctions? In what cases should they be used? Unfortunately, as I have indicated, the tool of choice is sanctions. Some suggest it is a hammer for brain surgery. 
In any event, it is time to take stock in whether this amendment by the Senator from Indiana passes now or later. I think it is fair to say we should take up this matter and resolve it and examine, if you will, the posture of our policies. 
Let me conclude with one reference that is in the amendment of the Senator from Indiana; that is, he sets guidelines before imposing sanctions. That is important, in his amendment. The amendment will require a check and balance. It will require information on the goals of the sanctions, the economic costs to the United States, the effect on achieving other foreign policy goals, and whether other policy options have been explored. It is kind of a cost-benefit risk analysis. I wish we could apply it to some of our environmental measures. That is what we are proposing here, and that is why I support the amendment of the Senator from Indiana. 
This amendment will require careful thought before imposing sanctions. It does not prohibit sanctions. Dozens of sanctions are now pending before Congress. Sanctions, because they are the easy way out, have become a knee jerk reaction. 
Between 1914 and 1990 we imposed unilateral sanctions 116 times. Between 1993 and 1996 alone we imposed unilateral sanctions 61 times on 35 nations. In 1995 alone, it is estimated that sanctions cost the United States $20 billion in exports. 
The President has declared a national emergency 16 times during his term. In the case of Burma, the President invoked unilateral powers reserved to `deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.' 
Is Burma an `unusual and extraordinary threat' to the national security of the United States? I will go out on a limb and say perhaps no. 
But that is the problem. The choice to use unilateral sanctions is easy. It is a choice made for the short term to appease special interest groups. No thought is given to the chances of success or possible alternatives. 
Will unilateral sanctions work in Burma--probably not! Will they hurt the people we are trying to help--definitely so! 
We must look to the long term. 
I think a perfect example of this is Vietnam. Restoration of diplomatic relations and the lifting of the trade embargo on U.S. exports led to progress on the MIA issue and greater economic freedoms in Vietnam. 
The old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats is true. 
When we decide on appropriate action to take against rogue countries, we must make decisions based on what are the most persuasive actions rather than the easy way out. 
I do not condone the policies of Iran, or Libya, or North Korea. All these countries clearly pursue policies contrary to our national interests. 
But I believe it has come to the point where U.S. unilateral sanctions run the risk of being completely counterproductive because they get in the way of more effective multilateral steps that could be pursued. 
Unilateral sanctions should be a tool of last resort and only used after careful thought about the consequences, the costs, and the chances of success. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Lugar. Implementing sanctions should not be based on emotion but on a rational process. This is what this amendment does.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting with swift resolve in passing this important resolution reaffirming our commitments and support to the people and government of Taiwan. This is an important statement, which I hope gives some sense of reassurance to our friends in Taiwan that the United States will not turn its back on the right of any people to choose the path of democracy and freedom. And that we will not waiver in our support simply for political expediency. 
Yesterday before the Senate Finance Committee, I asked our Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about the President's statements in China. Well, to no real surprise, the Secretary had to pretend that there has been no policy change on Taiwan since official relations were terminated with Taiwan in 1979. Mr. President, this is an indefensible line; the Administration clearly agreed to China's position on the Three No's'; possibly as early as when when President Jiang was here in Washington, D.C. last October, but most certainly reiterated by President Clinton himself while in China last month. Make no mistake about it, this is a policy change--and a dangerous one at that.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the request of the Administration, I am today introducing its proposed electric power industry legislation, the `Comprehensive Electric Competition Act.' I do so not because I agree with all of the provisions of the Administration's legislation: I don't. I do so as a courtesy to the Administration and because I strongly support competition. 
Mr. President, let me first say that I am a strong proponent of increased competition in the electric power industry. For the past century our electric utilities--investor-owned, municipally-owned, cooperatively-owned--have served this Nation well. Particularly as compared to the rest of the world, we have reasonably-priced, extremely reliable and nearly universal electric service. But with some well thought-out changes, our electric power industry can do even better. We have seen in a number of other industries--oil, natural gas, trucking and airlines, to name but a few--deregulation has greatly benefitted consumers. Market-based competition has reduced prices, increased supply and sparked innovation. There is no reason why increased competition in the electric power industry would not similarly benefit consumers, the economy and our international competitiveness. 
I believe that there is a growing consensus that increased competition in the electric power industry is in the public interest. This is illustrated by the number of States that have already moved forward to promote retail competition. According to the Department of Energy, 18 States have already implemented retail competition, either through State legislation or by State public utility commission regulation. One hundred and twenty-one million people--49 percent of the U.S. population--live in these States. Of the remaining States, all but two (Florida and South Dakota) are now actively considering competition programs. This consensus is also illustrated by the 20 bills introduced to date in the Senate and the House of Representatives relating to this issue. Moreover, it is further illustrated by the Administration's decision to propose this legislation. 
Mr. President, as I see it, the issue isn't: Do we want competition in the electric power industry? We do. Instead, the issue is: How do we bring about competition without jeopardizing price and reliability or financially damaging the industry? There is a consensus on the first issue; unfortunately, on the latter there is no consensus. 
At the risk of oversimplification, there are two camps of thought on how to go about the task of promoting competition. On the one hand, there are those who want to see government-managed competition, not market-based competition. They believe that government should continue to regulate all aspects of the industry--just do it differently. Moreover, they prefer the Federal government--FERC--be put in charge and the States pushed out of the way. On the other hand, there are those who believe that competition should be market-based. They believe that the most effective and efficient regulator of business is the discipline of the free market--not the discipline of the government regulator. I fall into the latter camp. Having seen all too often the results of failed government regulation--wage-and-price controls, oil price and allocation controls, and natural gas wellhead price controls, for example. I believe that for electric competition legislation to benefit consumers it must deregulate, streamline and empower States to promote retail competition. We don't need different regulation; we don't need government-managed competition. We need deregulation; we need market-based competition. 
Turning now to the Administration's proposed legislation, let me first say that it contains several provisions that are in keeping with my philosophy. For example, it proposes to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act (`PUHCA'). This language is very similar to legislation Senator D'Amato introduced, S. 621, which has been reported by the Banking Committee and awaits action by the Senate. I am a cosponsor of S. 621, along with 22 other Senators. If we did nothing else, repeal of PUHCA would significantly promote competition in the electric power industry. This depression-era law, enacted in 1935, has long outlived its usefulness, and today is actually a significant impediment to competition. Repeal would allow both utilities and non-utilities to fully compete without fear of becoming tangled in PUHCA's regulatory spider web. More competitors mean more competition, and that would benefit consumers and our economy. Moreover, repeal of PUHCA would not diminish Federal and State consumer protections, which would remain in full force and effect. 
Another provision of the Administration's bill that I strongly support is its prospective repeal of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (`PURPA'). PURPA is one of the few remaining vestiges of President Jimmy Carter's ill-fated 1978 `National Energy Plan' that we have yet to extinguish. PURPA requires electric utilities to purchase electricity from others whether or not they need it, and to pay so-called `full avoided cost' regardless of the actual market value of the power. This law has, and will until it is repealed, cost consumers billions of dollars in above-market prices for PURPA electricity. As just one example of how this is hurting consumers, just the other day the FERC refused to rescind the PURPA QF status of a powerplant even though the so-called `useful' thermal output of the facility is to produce distilled 
water that, at times, is just being dumped down the sewer. As a result, electric consumers in Brazos, Texas will pay an extra $890 million for electricity over the life of the PURPA contract--$148 per year for the average family of four living in Brazos. It is also essential that PURPA's mandatory purchase requirement be repealed as it is a key contributor to the so-called `stranded cost' problem that is plaguing industry restructuring efforts. Clearly, like PUHCA, it is time to repeal this anti-consumer and anti-competitive provision of PURPA. 
While there are provisions such as these in the Administration's proposed legislation that I do support, there are many provisions that I am very concerned about--some of which raise serious Constitutional issues, others of which I just cannot support. For example, the Administration's bill imposes a Federal mandate on States; it imposes a new $3+ billion per year Federal electricity tax on consumers; and it has a 5 1/2 percent `renewable set-aside' mandate (that curiously ignores hydroelectric power as a renewable). Moreover, the Administration's proposed legislation includes numerous provisions that vastly expand FERC jurisdiction, largely at the expense of States. 
I am also troubled by the Administration's proposed legislation because of what it does not contain. The Administration's transmittal letter acknowledges that its legislation does not address several key issues. For example, the Administration's legislation does not resolve the competitive status of the Federal utilities--the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Federal power marketing administrations. Nor, does it address the competitive advantage municipal utilities have from tax-exempt bonds and access to Federal preference power. Also, it does not address key issues necessary to ensure viability of nuclear power. I do not see how any bill can be considered `comprehensive' if it does not address these and other issues.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a member of the conference committee, I rise in support of the conference report on this historic piece of legislation which will overhaul the agency that is most feared by the American people, the Internal Revenue Service. 
However, I want to make sure that the Record reflects my compliments to those many dedicated IRS employees who were not, and are not, a part of the abuses or the horror stories that we heard during the Internal Revenue Service hearings held before the Finance Committee. These are the many dedicated individuals doing their job in a satisfactory manner. 
With the Finance Committee hearings that began last September and ended in April, the American public heard some chilling testimony, testimony of an agency that is simply out of control and an agency with no or little accountability. 
For fishermen in Alaska, the conference report retains an important change that was proposed by Senator Stevens and myself. Under our amendment, it will be far more difficult for the IRS to seize limited entry fishing permits. IRS will have to factor in the amount of money a fisherman will earn if he kept his fishing permit before embarking on a seizure. And even if IRS determines that future earnings will not be sufficient to pay a tax debt, the fisherman will, for the first time, be able to appeal that 
decision--the point being, once the fisherman loses his or her fishing permit, they do not have a source of revenue for payment of taxes; as a consequence, the IRS is very unlikely to make a recovery. 
Another important change we've made prevents IRS from harassing the divorced woman for her ex-husband's tax cheating. Under the Conference agreement, divorced or separated innocent spouses will only he held accountable for taxes on their own income, not on the taxes owed by their spouse. 
We heard some horror stories in testimony, Mr. President, from women who were subjected to harassment by the IRS when, clearly, their husbands were cheating on their own taxes in an effort to evade taxes through tax shelters, and so on, without any knowledge of the spouse. 
In addition, we've added a rule suspending interest and penalties when the IRS does not provide appropriate notice to taxpayers within 18 months of filing. Although I preferred the Senate provision suspending interest and penalties if IRS fails to notify the taxpayer within 12 months, I was persuaded to delay the 12-month rule for 5 years to enable IRS to update all of its computers to meet this standard. 
The important thing for taxpayers to know is that long notification delays by IRS will no longer benefit the Service because it will not be able to stack penalties and interest on taxpayers who may have unwittingly made a mistake on their returns. 
We've also changed the burden of proof in cases coming before the Tax Court. This is a long overdue change. When American citizens go into a court, they should be presumed innocent, not guilty until they can prove their innocence. That principle is enshrined in our Constitution and must apply in tax cases as well as any other cases. Now it will. 
Mr. President, as I said earlier, the culture at the IRS must change. This bill makes very important changes that should give the American public more confidence that if they make a mistake on their tax returns, they will be treated fairly by their government and not subjected to threats and harassment. 
But this bill is just a first step. It is incumbent on the Finance Committee to hold the agency accountable for implementing this bill. More oversight is needed because it is only through oversight that we can hold this agency accountable to the American people. 
Finally, I note that problems between the IRS and taxpayers could be greatly minimized if we overhauled the far-too-complex tax code that is so intimidating that less than half of all taxpayers have the confidence to fill out their returns by themselves. 
I ask each of my colleagues to address his or her own tax situation relative to how many Members of this body do their own tax returns. I must admit that I, for one, do not, simply because of the complexity. 
I believe fundamental tax reform is the most important thing we can do to restore public confidence in the tax system. This conference report takes a small, but much needed step toward simplification. It changes the holding period for capital gains from 18 months to 12 months. I strongly support this change on both economic grounds and because this will significantly simplify tax filing for any individual who owns a mutual fund or shares of stock. 
Mr. President, this bill is an historic milestone and I expect it will pass with overwhelming bi-partisan support. I hope that next year we can produce fundamental tax reform that will have similar bi-partisan support. 
Mr. President, the conferees included a provision which is unrelated to IRS reform but will have an important effect in our on-going debates about international trade. We have included a provision that changes the name of `most favored nation' trade status to `normal trade relations.' 
This is a long overdue change that I strongly support. For many years, we have debated extending normal trade status to some of our former adversaries such as China. In determining whether to treat imports from these countries in the same way as we treat imports from our allies, such as Japan and Great Britain, the term `most favored nation' has historically been used. 
That term `MFN' has caused confusion among many members of the public, for it implies that we are granting a special favored status that is better than what we grant our other trading partners. 
As my colleagues in the Senate know, MFN--most favored nation--merely grants equal status, not greater status, for those countries. Changing MFN to normal trading relations should do a lot to clear up public confusion and allow us to debate the issues with a clearer focus. 
Mr. President, my hope is that my colleagues will support the conference committee's report with regard to the IRS, and, as a consequence, I thank the President and I yield the floor. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of Taiwan and the events concerning Taiwan which transpired during our President's trip to China. While President Clinton maintains that he did not make any concessions on Taiwan, or in any way alter our longstanding policy towards Taiwan, I am concerned that, indeed, he may have; and I think the facts back me up and show that President Clinton may have, in no small way, initiated changes in our policy towards Taiwan. 
I am specifically concerned with two incidents, Mr. President. First, during a question-and-answer period at Beijing University, President Clinton responded to a question on Taiwan. He remarked that `when the United States and China reached agreement that we would have a one China policy, we also reached agreement that reunification would occur by peaceful means.' 
Well, Mr. President, to my knowledge, the United States and China have never reached an agreement that the Taiwan question would be resolved through reunification. While the United States has not ruled out reunification as a possibility, we have also not ruled out the possibility that the question of Taiwan could be resolved in some other manner, as long as it was done peacefully. So there is a difference. 
Our Federal law on this question is quite clear. Section 2(b)(3) of the Taiwan Relations Act states that `The future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means.' The United States has also signed three joint communiques with the People's Republic of China which further elaborate our position on Taiwan. While they all speak to the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, none--none--go so far as to speak to the question of reunification. 
So why am I concerned with the President's choice of words while he was in China? Because I think it is misleading, dangerously misleading. It indicates to the Chinese and the Taiwanese that our policy on Taiwan has changed, when the President says it has not. 
The second incident which raises concern, Mr. President, is when President Clinton seemingly adopted the `Three-No's' policy long advocated by China. The `Three-No's' policy states the United States does not support one Taiwan, one China; the United States does not support Taiwan independence; and the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in nation-state based international organizations. 
As the July 2, 1998, editorial in the Washington Post correctly points out, the United States has long `acknowledged' China's position on Taiwan, but has never ever accepted China's position on Taiwan. There is a significant difference. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this editorial be printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Considered collectively, which I know the Chinese Government is doing, this could appear to be a major concession by the United States on the issue of Taiwan. My guess is that the Chinese now believe that if the Taiwanese people declare independence, the United States will not support them. What does that say for democracy and the ideals that we have sworn to uphold and support? 
In 1996, when the Chinese military conducted military exercises off the coast of Taiwan in order to influence Taiwan's national Presidential elections, President Clinton rightly responded; swiftly and with resolve. He showed that the United States will not tolerate the threat of the use of force against Taiwan, just as we will not tolerate the use of force against Taiwan. 
Mr. President, I am concerned that the President's statements made in China have now sent the wrong message, and one that could be destabilizing both to Taiwan and to the entire Asian theater. 
I think the United States should pursue our own `three-no's' policy on the question of Taiwan, and they are: We will not accept any nonpeaceful resolution of the Taiwan question; we will not force Taiwan to the table with China, nor will we be an intermediary in resolving this dispute; and we will not turn our backs on democracy and the right of the Taiwanese people, or any people, to live according to free democratic principles. 
So finally, Mr. President, well in advance of President Clinton's trip to China, I and a number of colleagues in the Senate sent a letter to the President urging him to press the Chinese Government on renouncing the threat of the use of force against Taiwan. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Washington in offering this amendment requiring the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration to sit down with the Veterans Service Organizations to find ways to honorable pay our last respects to our nation's veterans. Six months after enactment of this legislation, DoD will submit to Congress a report noting changes in DoD's policies for burial honors and recommendations for possible legislation to address this problem. 
Why is this needed? 
Let me tell you. Veterans across the country are dying. These are the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country. How do we as a nation pay our final respects--many times with one person with a folded flag and a tape of taps. With World War II veterans growing older, the problem will only get worse. 
Even around Washington, DC, with its many military bases this happens. 
This is not uncommon. The father of one of my staff members passed away a few years ago on the West Coast. She thought that since he was a World War II veteran, he would receive an honor guard--an appropriate thank you for the service he had given our country. 
What happened? As the family members watched, a member of the military--one member came and handed over a flag. There was no honor guard, no bugler, no final send off for a job well done. 
My staff person was shocked at the insensitivity and the impersonal nature of the burial service. I am shocked as all of us should be. 
This is a disgrace. 
Earlier this year Senator Murray, Senator Sarbanes and myself introduced legislation that required a five person honor guard with a bugler. DoD opposed the legislation because of the potential costs and drain on our military personnel. 
Mr. President, although I understand DoD's arguments, something must be done. This amendment moves the ball forward but it does not solve the problem. I expect in DoD's report realistic suggestions on solving this problem. One person and a tape of Taps is not an alternative. 
In closing, I would like all of us to think about the honor that our country bestows on our veterans and the honor they deserve. An honor guard is the last instance that we as a nation can thank them for their service. 
They deserve no less. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I offer substitute amendments to two similar bills passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee earlier this year. The two bills are S. 1158, a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, regarding the Huna Totem Corporation Public Interest Land Exchange, and S. 1159, a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, regarding the Kake Tribal Corporation Public Interest Land Exchange. Both of these bills direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conclude land exchanges which collectively will allow Kake and Huna to exchange land needed as municipal watershed in exchange for other Forest Service lands. 
By passing these bills two objectives will be met. First, the two corporations will finally be able to fully recognize the economic benefits promised to them under ANCSA. Second, the watersheds that provide the respective communities of Hoonah, Alaska and Kaka, Alaska will be protected in order to provide safe water for those communities. 
The substitutes I offer today clarify several issues that were raised during the Committee hearings and mark-up. First, the substitutes again direct that the Sealaska subsurface interest will mirror the Kake and Huna lands to be conveyed to the Secretary of Agriculture and the new lands to be conveyed to the corporations. Second the substitute clarifies that these exchange are to be done on an equal value basis. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the corporations insisted this be the case. I believe this is critical, Mr. President, because both S. 1158 and S. 1159 provide that any timber derived from the newly acquired lands be processed in-state, a requirement that does not currently exist on the watershed lands the corporations are exchange. Therefore, if this exchange was simply done on an acre-for-acre basis it is likely that the acreage the corporations are exchanging, without any timber export restrictions, would have a much higher value then what they get in return. It is for this reason that these exchanges were not done on an acre-for-acre basis. If it ends up that either party has to receive additional compensation, either additional land or cash to equalize the value, then it is my hope this is done in an expeditious way to allow the exchange to move forward within the times specified in the legislation. 
I believe these two pieces of legislation are in the best interest of the native corporations, the Alaska communities where the watersheds are located, and the Federal government. It is my intention to try and pass these bills out of the Senate before the end of this session of Congress.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise today in honor of my close friend, the distinguished senior senator from South Carolina and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Strom Thurmond, on the completion of the FY 99 Defense Authorization bill. This marks the last time that Senator Thurmond will manage a Defense Authorization Bill in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Senator Thurmond is an exceptional man, a truly remarkable individual who has unselfishly dedicated his entire life to the service of others. Mr. President, earlier in the 105th Congress, on May 25, 1997, Senator Thurmond made history in this institution when he became he longest-serving United States Senator in our nation's history. He is a model in perseverance and is a testament to the greatness of this body and to this nation as a whole. 
Senator Thurmond was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1954 as a write-in candidate. He was the first person in U.S. history to ever be elected to a major U.S. office in this manner. He has since served the people of South Carolina continuously in this body for over 41 years and 10 months, a record which is likely to stand the test of time and to never be broken. 
Throughout his career, Strom Thurmond has served South Carolina and the United States in a number of important ways: he has served South Carolina as a State Senator; a South Carolina Circuit Judge; a Governor and currently as a U.S. Senator. He served his country in World War II, and landed in Normandy on D-Day with the 82nd Airborne Division. He went on to earn 5 Battle Stars during World War II and 18 military decorations during his distinguished military career. He ran for President in 1948. And in 1959, while serving in the U.S. Senate, Senator Thurmond was made a Major General of the U.S. Army Reserve. 
First and foremost, however, Senator Thurmond is a teacher. He began his distinguished career as a teacher in South Carolina in 1923 and has continued to emphasize the importance of education in everything he does. He wrote the South Carolina school attendance law; worked hard to increase the pay to teachers and for longer school terms; and even today, Senator Thurmond continues to send a congratulatory certificate to every graduating South Carolina high school student. 
Senator Thurmond has taught all of us in this institution, Mr. President, I am honored to call him a friend and am pleased to rise today in tribute to this great man, this great American. It is fitting that we name this bill in his honor, and my deepest congratulations go out to him.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Senator Kyl and I have sponsored an amendment which would require the Secretary of Defense to study the issue of effective deployment of a theater missile defense system for the Asia-Pacific region. This is obviously needed to protect our troops in Okinawa and on the Korean peninsula. This amendment would further require that Korea, Japan and Taiwan be allowed to purchase such a system from the United States, should they desire. I suspect that all of them would be extremely interested in such a defense system, Mr. President, and I think it is incumbent upon us to extend this protection to them. 
A form of this legislation has already passed the House--albeit the House version was more specific in relating just to Taiwan. This legislation makes sense, is deeply needed, and would be a good show of support, meaningful support, to our allies in Korea, Japan and Taiwan. 
I thank the managers of the bill for agreeing to accept a scaled down version of this amendment. I had hoped that the entire version would have been eagerly accepted by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but clearly there are other issues at play in the Senate at this time. 
I want the Record to reflect that this scaled down version in no way reflects a diminished commitment to Taiwan. Quite the contrary. This amendment should be seen as a victory--because it is. It is one of the only provisions to be adopted into this bill addressing ballistic missile defense, and one of the only provisions adopted which addresses security issues in the Asian theater. And it is perhaps the only provision which addresses China and Taiwan. 
Our commitment to Taiwan is unwavering. As President Clinton goes to China, this amendment reiterates our support for the people of Taiwan, and the government of Taiwan. The question of Taiwan must only be resolved through peaceful means--and I again call on President Clinton to raise the issue of renouncing the threat of the use of force against Taiwan when he meets with President Jiang in Beijing. 
The Chinese missile tests off the coast of Taiwan in the Spring of 1996 brought our relations with China to the brink of conflict. Their actions were reprehensible and intended only to intimidate, and I think test, whether the United States was serious on the issue of Taiwan. They learned that we are, that the United States is unequivocal on the issue of Taiwan's security, and here right to a free and democratic society. We will not condone efforts to intimidate national free elections; the people on Taiwan have chosen to live a life of freedom--we commend them and support them in this. 
Finally, Mr. President, at a time when the United States is being pressured to reduce its forces in Asia, ballistic missile defense for Korea, Japan and Taiwan is even more important. if we reduce our forces in Asia, make no mistake--there will be a security void, a vacuum. Our amendment is intended to prevent a vacuum; to reduce the impact of missile development by China, North Korea and perhaps others in the region. Mr. President, the Loral Space communications issue has shown us one thing--that if our policies, even by accident, allow others to improve their missile capabilities, it is incumbent upon us to provide our allies with the support they need to defend themselves. Be extending ballistic missile protection to Taiwan, we are doing just that.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise with an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill which relates to our chemical weapons demilitarization program. I thank the managers of this bill, and the professional staff at the Senate Armed Services Committee for agreeing to adopt this amendment. 
This is a straightforward amendment, but may be on track to save us a lot of time and money with respect to our chemical weapons stockpile demilitarization program. Over the life of the stockpile demilitarization program which as gone from about $2 billion to $15 billion, to perhaps $16 billion as we speak. The anticipated time it will take to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention has also been extended, and it is increasingly unlikely that we will make the April 29, 2007 deadline which we agreed to here in the Senate last year. 
Mr. President, my amendment is intended to help save time and money in this program. It simply requires that the Department of the Army and the EPA be allied instead of adversaries. It requires that the Secretary of the Army sit down with the Administrator of the EPA and report back to Congress on how these departments can work together to help expedite the permits which are necessary for the demilitarization program. Most of these permits are pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). While the EPA does not have a role issuing permits, it does act in an advisory capacity to the various State governments which review and issue permits. 
Since the States are likely to follow the feds, cooperation between the Army and the EPA is critical. Let's simply make certain that all arms of the federal government are cooperating. Mr. President, we aim to be rid of these weapons by the year 2007. If we are serious about meeting this deadline, we need to do all we can now to give the program stewards the tools they need to get the job done. 
Again, I thank the bill managers for agreeing to adopt this amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Last week, the administration's climate change negotiators returned from Bonn, Germany. 
These negotiators were in Bonn from June 2 through the 12 with their counterparts from many other countries, working out the details of how to implement the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
Mr. President, people often say `the devil's in the details' and I think we have a case here with this Kyoto Protocol where the devil is definitely there--in the details. 
So, that is just what I want to talk about today--the details. 
Back in October of last year, President Clinton outlined his climate change proposal during a speech. If it seems strange that I have to refer to the text of a speech to describe the administration's climate change proposal, I have to do that, because the speech is all we have. 
Last year, I, along with Senators Craig, Hagel, and Helms, asked the General Accounting Office to review the administration's climate change proposal. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing earlier this month on GAO's results so far. 
The Office of Management and Budget told the GAO auditors that the Administration has no documentation of its climate change proposal, beyond the President's speech last October. The speech is the plan. I must admit, I was amazed by this. 
The administration is asking for an increase of $6.3 billion over the next five years for its climate change program, and the documentation of that program is a speech that is about 3 or 4 pages long. Out in the business world, you don't get $6.3 billion in financing based on a three page proposal. 
So, in this brief climate change proposal, what do we find? We find a statement of the administration's principles for addressing climate change. 
One of the administration's principles on climate change is: `Developing Countries Must Participate.' 
The President's climate change proposal says: `The President has committed that the United States will not adopt binding obligations without developing country participation.' 
Take note that this statement came from the Administration prior to the Kyoto negotiations, when the administration conveniently abandoned that principle, in order to come home with some kind of agreement to show everyone how successful they were. 
The administration still claims to be committed to `meaningful participation'--whatever that means--by developing countries. In fact, Mr. Dirk Forrister, the chairman of the White House Climate Change Task Force, told me during our hearing on June 4 that `meaningful participation' does include China and India. 
So, the President's climate change proposal says you must have developing country participation. Mr. Forrister tells me just three weeks ago that we must get China and India to participate. 
But then, what happens in Bonn, Germany? Over 1200 negotiators met there to start negotiating the details for the Kyoto treaty. The U.S. negotiating team had over 25 members. 
I wasn't at the Bonn meeting, so let me read from a report of what happened in Bonn. This is from the Washington Times, June 13, 1998. The headline is: `Third World, EU knock U.S. effort on global warming. Two week talks in Bonn end in impasse.' The article says: 
Third World and European nations dealt a blow to President Clinton's effort to make the global warming treaty more palatable to Americans at a negotiating session . . . in Germany. 
China and India, speaking for a group of 77 developing countries, opposed even discussing proposals that would require them to drastically cut so-called greenhouse gas emissions as the United States and industrialized nations are required to do under the treaty. 
Let me repeat that: China and India . . . opposed even discussing proposals . . . that would require them to . . . cut . . . emissions. 
What are we to make of this? The administration says China and India must participate. Yet, in Bonn, China and India led an effort by developing countries to oppose even talking about their participation. 
Let me point out another disconnect. President Clinton's climate change proposal says: 
The President is committed to a market-based emissions trading system, both domestically and internationally, that will har-ness the power of the market to reduce emissions . . . 
The administration's climate change proposal states that an emissions trading system will allow the United States to meet its reductions targets `with minimal economic costs.' 
In fact, Janet Yellen, Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, has testified before Congress that according to the administration's economic analysis--the details of which, by the way, almost no one is allowed to see--that Kyoto targets can be met for minimal costs. 
We are just finding out how you meet the Kyoto targets so cheaply. Apparently, the administration relies on achieving 85 percent of emissions reduction through emissions trading. They think we can `buy our way out' of the problem. 
But let's see what happened in Bonn. What did the rest of the world have to say about extensive use of emissions trading? 
Again, let me quote from the Washington Times article: 
The European Union said it would oppose extensive use of a complicated [emissions trading] scheme Mr. Clinton devised to ensure that Americans pay only modestly higher energy prices under the treaty, saying the United States should bear the brunt of such costs, which could total in the hundreds of billions of dollars. 
So, here are the results of Bonn. 
1. Developing countries are still saying `not interested' when it comes to signing up for binding reduction targets. 
2. Our European friends are saying, `Hey America, you can't buy your way out of your commitments through emissions trading. We want you to take more expensive action at home. 
What kind of actions might we take to reduce emissions, if we can't rely on emissions trading? To answer that question, I think it's helpful to look at the current situation. 
Where do we currently get our electricity from? We generate 53 percent of our electricity from coal. The administration says coal pollutes so we have to cut back on dramatically on how much we rely on coal. We generate 18 percent of our electricity from nuclear power. This is our largest emission-free source of power. I've talked about this issue over the years and the percentage of nuclear keeps falling. A few years ago we were 22 percent nuclear, last year this figure was about 20 percent. I think we should be clear about why this number is falling. 
We have an administration that won't deal with the nuclear waste problem. We have a President who says he will veto our nuclear waste bill, which has passed both this Congress by wide margins. The bottom line is that we are at risk of losing our nuclear power. 
We generate 14 percent from natural gas, but the administration has issued OCS moritoria and won't provide access to public lands for gas production, so there are limits to what gas can do. 
We generate 10 percent from hydroelectric power--another emissions-free source of electricity. But again, the Admin opposes hydropower and we have a Secretary of the Interior who brags he will be the first Interior Secretary to tear down a dam. 
We generate about 3 percent--a little bit under 3 percent--from waste or `biomass'. This is electricity from burning wood, garbage, old tires. This isn't exactly a carbon-free activity, so we will have to curtail our use of biomass for power production. 
We generate 2 percent of our electricity from oil. Again, this is something unpopular with the administration. They are opposed to fossil fuel use, and they won't allow access to public lands for further oil exploration. 
The remaining less than 0.1 percent comes from wind and solar. This is a very small percentage, yet the administration claims these are the technologies that will make-up for reductions in all the other sources. How realistic is this? 
The Sierra Club refers to wind turbines as `cuisinarts for the birds.' Wind power also depends on a limited number of sites, with strong, dependable winds. 
Solar technology has many obvious shortcomings. First of all, the sun doesn't shine at night. Also, solar panels take up a tremendous amount of space. It would take about 10,000 square miles of solar panels to replace the 18 percent of our electricity generated with nuclear power. This is about the size of the entire states of Vermont and Delaware, combined. 
So there are obvious limits to renewable resources, but there are places where they make sense. For instance, remote villages in Alaska, where electricity is now generated with diesel fuel for 30-40 cents per kilowatt hour. But for large populations these renewable technologies probably are not feasible. 
How does the President say we will meet our Kyoto targets? In addition to buying carbon credits from Russia and Ukraine, the President says we should increase energy efficiency . . . and `pay the bill' by deregulating electricity. I'm all for efficiency and rational deregulation . . . but if you've endangered your major sources of generation, efficiency and generation aren't much help. 
The President is clearly pushing this issue off onto somebody else's watch. So, where does this leave us? Well, we are headed into larger, higher-level negotiations in Buenos Aires, Argentina this fall. Should we be hopeful that we will have any better success than we did in Bonn? 
Don't get me wrong. I happen to think that principles are a great thing to have. The point is you have to stick to them. 
I fear that in Buenos Aires, the administration will once again be desperate for the appearance of success. In their desperation, the administration might conveniently abandon more of the principles they claim to hold regarding what the U.S. should demand of the rest of the world in a climate change treaty. 
Mr. President, I have been watching these events unfold for some time now. I have watched this climate change deal become more and more of a raw deal for Americans. 
But to sum up, I don't think I can put it any better than one of my constituents, Sam Tatum from Wasilla, Alaska. He wrote me a letter saying `this climate change treaty is bad news for our country.' Well, Sam, hold on to your pocketbook and let's see what comes out of Buenos Aries.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to an article which ran on the front page of the Washington Post yesterday morning regarding missile sales by North Korea. Although North Korea has denied selling missiles in the past, I for one have never taken them at their word on this and have long believed that they have been and continue to be actively engaged in the weapons trade; without question, the sale of weapons to rogue states has been and continues to be a major source of revenue for the North Korea government. 
Well, despite their past denials, the Washington Post reports that North Korea now admits to selling weapons to countries such as Iran, Iraq and Syria, and has actively assisted these countries with their own missile development programs. 
Mr. President, this article really comes as no surprise--it simply verifies what many of us have suspected all along. But I think we should also consider for a moment whether we have, in no small way, contributed to North Korea's missile development program. 
I am referring, of course, to the 1994 Agreed Framework, whereby North Korea would dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for American assistance in building two light-water reactors. Without going into the details, Japan and South Korea would contribute several billion dollars worth of assistance to the construction of the reactors, and the United States would also supply heavy oil to North Korea until the reactors were up and running--this would help North Korea meet its energy needs pending construction of the facilities. 
Mr. President, the Agreed Framework, no matter how well intentioned, puts a gaping hole in the international sanctions which we have levied against North Korea. The United Sates has already given close to $200 million taxpayer dollars, perhaps more, in combined food aid and to support the Korean Economic Development Organization (KEDO), which is tasked with sending heavy fuel oil to North Korea and carrying out other activities under the Agreed Framework. For a country whose economy is completely isolated and strapped for cash, this assistance frees up sizable amounts of money which North Korea can invest in other areas--including their national missile development program. 
So, the North Koreans use the aid which comes from the United States, Japan, South Korea and other countries to support other aspects of their economy, freeing up resources which can be used to develop weapons. These weapons are then sold to our enemies, and pointed at our troops, our allies, and even us. 
Mr. President, last year two North Korean defectors indicated in testimony before the Senate Government Affairs Committee that the North Korean missile development program already poses a verifiable threat to American forces in Okinawa and is on track to threaten parts of Alaska by the turn of the Century. 
Mr. President, I have no problem with humanitarian aid in itself--this is not the issue. The issue is whether we have an effective policy toward gaining cooperation with North Korea? I would argue, and I think the facts back me up, that we do not! Think about it. Every concession North Korea has ever granted has been on their terms--not ours, theirs! And when things do not appear to go their way, they take action which we try to deter through additional concessions. Sounds to me like the tail is wagging the dog.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the conference report on the Education Savings and School Excellence Act. 
Mr. President, whenever I return to Alaska, the one issue I consistently hear about is the state of public education. I think it is fair to say that Alaskans and all of the American people are extremely concerned that despite annually spending hundreds of billions of dollars at the federal, state and local level, our educational system is failing. The simple fact that 78 percent of all two and four-year colleges offer remedial courses in math, reading and writing, suggests that many high school students are being short-changed in their academic preparation for adulthood. 
The conference report before us raises the amount that parents and grandparents can contribute to education savings accounts from $500 to $2,000. Most importantly, it allows parents to make the choice to withdraw these funds tax-free for use either in college or in grades K through 12. 
Although modest in scope, these education savings accounts will give real choices to lower and middle income families who believe their children's best chance for the future lies in gaining an education in a private school. 
Income limits insure that the benefit of these education savings accounts are focused on middle income families. Wealthy families most often do not need to use these education accounts because they can easily afford the cost of private K-12 tuition and because the tax base in wealthy communities often provides the best possible public education in the country. 
But middle and lower income families don't have the same choices that the wealthy have when it comes to education because they don't have adequate resources to pay private tuition. Allowing these families the choice of using funds in an education savings account for K though 12 schooling, could enable families with modest incomes to send their children to the school where they believe their child will get the best preparation for college. 
What's wrong with that, Mr. President? If educational savings accounts can be justified for college tuition, shouldn't they also be allowed for the education expenses that give a child the opportunity to apply to college? 
Mr. President, this conference report contains an important provision that will benefit many families in Alaska. Under this measure, distributions from qualified state tuition programs, like Alaska's will be tax exempt if the proceeds are used for college or graduate school expenses. 
Finally, Mr. President, I am pleased the bill extends until 2002 the $5,250 per year exclusion for employer-provided educational expenses. However, I would have preferred that this exclusion would have also applied to graduate student expenses. 
Mr. President, I would hope that this win-win education bill will be signed by the President. It promotes greater choice for families in selecting their educational options for their children at a time when families are demanding greater accountability from all of their educational institutions.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of my colleagues to the distinguished record of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, which today marks its 59th year of operation. 
Most of us know this fine group of men and women only as the civilian arm of the Coast Guard--a volunteer group of friends and neighbors who offer safe boating and navigation classes, and perform courtesy inspections to ensure that our boats are equipped the way they should be. 
However, Mr. President, there is far more to the Auxiliary. The Auxiliary was formed when the clouds of war threatened all the civilized world, and when war came to the United States, the members of the Auxiliary served their country well. 
Recently, the commander of United States Coast Guard Group San Francisco, Captain Larry Hall, spoke to Auxiliary Flotilla 5-7 on the 55th anniversary of its formation. His address is a capsule history of the Auxiliary in general, and of San Francisco's `Diablo' flotilla as a specific example, as well as a look at how the Auxiliary and the active-duty Coast Guard work together to keep Americans safe.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I, and my fellow Senator from the State of Alaska, Senator Stevens, and my good friends and colleagues from the State of Hawaii, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka, are introducing a very important measure--one that would unlock and open the door to many first-time home buyers. 
As we are all aware, it is often the downpayment that is the largest impediment to home ownership for first-time home buyers. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) began a pilot program two years ago to help families overcome that impediment by lowering the downpayment necessary for an FHA home mortgage. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the pilot program, which is located in Alaska and Hawaii, has reported great success. 
This pilot program is effective because it accomplishes two feats: (1) it lowers the FHA downpayment, making it more affordable; and (2) it makes the FHA downpayment calculation easier and more understandable for all parties to the transaction. The pilot program, commonly called the `97 percent Loan-to-Value Program,' requires--on average--only a minimum cash investment of three percent for home buyers. 
Our bill amends section 203(b) of the National Housing Act by changing the current multi-part formula to a single calculation formula. The simplified formula creates a lower, more affordable downpayment while simultaneously simplifying the current, cumbersome loan calculation formula. Our bill would extend this lower and simplified downpayment rate to perspective home buyers across the country. 
Mr. President, the pilot program is a win-win situation: affordable homes are made available to responsible buyers without any increase in mortgage default rates. Here's what mortgage lenders have reported: 
There is no indication of increase in risk. The loans we have made to date have been to borrowers with excellent credit records and stable employment, but not enough disposable income to accumulate the cash necessary for a high downpayment: Richard E. Dolman, Manager, Seattle Mortgage, Anchorage Branch. 
Is the 97% program working? The answer is a resounding YES! . . . In this current day, it takes two incomes to meet basic needs. To come up with a large downpayment is increasingly difficult, especially for those just starting out. The 3% program is a good start . . . I do no believe that lowering the downpayment increased our risk. . : Nancy A. Karriowski, Alaska Home Mortgage, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska. 
We have experienced nothing but positive benefits from the FHA Pilot Program Loan Calculation in Alaska and Hawaii: Roger Aldrich, President, City Mortgage, Corporation, Anchorage, Alaska. 
We support the new loan calculation, as this has provided a step toward the goal of homeownership for everyone . . . We do not feel that there is a greater risk with the borrower putting 3 percent down rather than using the calculation under the standard program . . : Lorna Gleason, Vice President, National Bank of Alaska. 
Home buyers under the pilot program agree. Vicki Case of Palmer, Alaska is a single parent and a mortgage lender who earned too much to qualify for any of the low-income mortgage programs. She would have been unable to purchase her home had it not been for an FHA loan with the reduced down payment. 
In fact, but for the pilot program, approximately 70 percent of the FHA loan applications processed in Vicki Case's office would be rejected. simply because the buyer could not afford the downpayment. Mr. President, thanks to this pilot program, more and more deserving Alaskans are becoming home owners. 
Mr. President, our legislation has the support of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. They believe, as I do, that borrowers in all states should benefit from the simplification of the FHA downpayment calculation. 
I firmly believe that helping American families realize their dream of home ownership is vital to the Nation as a whole. Our bill, by creating a lower FHA downpayment, does much to assist families in owning their first home--thereby making the American dream of home ownership a reality. 
Mr. President, for details on how the new calculation works in comparison to the current calculation, I ask unanimous consent to submit into the Record a downpayment calculation comparison sheet. And I ask that my colleagues join Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, and me in supporting this important legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last Thursday, before Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin began testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, it is interesting to reflect on the status of the Japanese yen. At that time, it was trading at 141 to the dollar. During the hearing, I had an opportunity to ask Secretary Rubin whether or not the United States would intervene to stabilize the yen, and Secretary Rubin correctly observed that with the hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars and yen trading around the world on a daily basis, central bank intervention can only stabilize a currency for a very short period of time. It is further interesting to note, upon the completion of the Secretary's comments the yen fell to 144 to the dollar. So clearly there is a question of confidence. 
On Friday, the Government of Japan announced that the Japanese economy had met the standard definition of a recession; that is, two-quarters of negative growth. Unemployment in Japan is at its post-1950s record of 4.1 percent, which in Japan is extraordinarily high, with youth unemployment exceeding 9 percent. 
As of this morning, the yen has fallen through the 146 level. The Japanese stock market was within 2 percent of a 52-week low. Moreover, the stock markets--Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand--have all hit 52-week lows. Mr. President, it is clear that Asia has yet to turn itself around from the crisis that started well over a year ago, and the biggest reason Asia is tumbling is because the Japanese Government has failed to face up to the realities of its crumbling economy, especially the dismal state of its banking sector. So long as Japan fails to take decisive action in the banking sector, the yen is very likely to plunge further as lack of confidence prevails, carrying with it the threat to all Asian economies of deflation and further currency devaluations. I think you would agree that all Americans should be very concerned about this crisis in Asia, and particularly in Japan. 
Japan is the second largest economy in the world and imports more than $66 billion in goods from the United States. Moreover, Japan is a major importer from the rest of Asia, and if its economy continues in recession, the rest of Asia will remain mired in economic decline which could lead to political instability, not unlike what we recently witnessed in Indonesia. 
The reality of the yen decreasing in value is very simple, Mr. President. Eighteen months ago, the yen was about 80. A year ago, it was a little over 100. At that time, it took 80 yen to buy a U.S. lamp. Today, it takes 146 yen. As a consequence, we are not selling any lamps or much of anything else in Japan. 
Alan Greenspan recently noted: 
Without first fixing its banking sector, Japan has little hope of fueling economic recovery. 
An editorial in today's New York Times, commenting on Japan's recession, states: 
The first priority for Japanese officials must be to save the country's sick banking system. 
Ever since the so-called bubble economy burst in Japan 7 years ago, the banking system has been carrying bad loans on its books from the days of heady land and financial speculation. 
As a former banker with 25 years of experience in commercial banking, I can tell you what happens when these loans become nonperforming. When the payments cannot be made, of course, the interest can't be paid as well. More often than not, the bank simply adds the past-due interest to the principal and brings the loan current, and the loan appears current on the books when, in reality, it is a nonperforming loan and, in many cases, a loss. 
Since 1991, the Japanese Government has promised time and time again to reform financial sectors within the country, but it has yet to fulfill its promise. Instead, I believe that the Government has always believed it could say one thing and do another or, in this case, simply rely on exports to stimulate the economy. The reality is that it will not and has not worked in the past. 
In January, Japan's Ministry of Finance announced that the number of problem loans was $577 billion, of which at least $85 billion had already gone bad or were insolvent. The remaining, nearly $500 billion, had the potential to go bad as well. Some analysts believe the value of the problem loans today in Japan is closer to $700 billion. 
Following this report, the Japanese Government announced a large bank bailout, but since then almost nothing has been done to implement it. The sick banks stay open and the economy continues to hemorrhage. 
In Japan today, short-term interest rates are at their lowest level ever since economic statistics have been recorded. Short-term loans carry interest rates--interest rates, Mr. President--below 1 percent. Imagine that the yield on a long-term, 10-year Japanese Government bond is an incredible 1.3 percent. With interest this low, it is hard to imagine why Japan is sinking into a recession. 
Yet, in a recent poll, 95 percent of Japanese companies interviewed complained about the difficulty of receiving loans from Japanese banks. The explanation is simple: The banks are fearful of making new loans. There is a credit crunch in Japan because of the overhang of all the bad debt that is being carried on the banks' books already. So long as this overhang continues, Japan will continue to fall further into recession. 
Mr. President, the Japanese can learn a valuable lesson from our bad experience with the failed savings and loans in the United States. When the S&L crisis first began to be felt in 1985, it was debated at great length here on this floor. Congress and the President refused to face the crisis and did not provide the sufficient funds to close the failed S&Ls. This only prolonged the crisis and ballooned the cost of the bailout to the taxpayer. 
When we first recognized the difficulty with the failing savings and loans, the estimated loss at that time was $25 billion to $30 billion. But we in the United States did not take our 
medicine in a timely manner and the S&L bailout ultimately cost the taxpayers of this country more than $200 billion. 
We finally did face the S&L problem. The longer we put it off, the more it cost. We created the Resolution Trust Corporation. We closed down the failed banks and consolidated others. After several years, we finally put the S&L crisis behind us, because we recognized that keeping sick financial institutions open only exacerbates the problem and costs more to the taxpayer. 
By contrast, the Japanese banks and their regulators have for years tried to hide their financial problems. In order to help cover up the insolvency problems of Japanese banks, just before the end of the fiscal year, in March, the Ministry of Finance changed the accounting rules affecting the so-called BIS ratio, a ratio used by international markets as a bellwether of financial health of the banks. This ratio says that shareholder equity--or assets minus liabilities--should at least equal 8 percent of the weighted assets, or typically the outstanding loans. 
The changes allowed the banks to use the purchase price of their stock portfolios as the asset value when the stocks' prices have fallen. Since many of these stocks were bought in the heyday of the Japanese bubble economy, this enabled the Japanese banks to look healthy when, in fact, they were sick. Indeed, they are very sick, Mr. President. 
Moreover, the Government attempted to manipulate the end-of-March stock prices by buying up shares on the open market. Neither of these actions suggest that the Japanese Government is serious about making banking changes in conformity with good accounting practices. 
Until Japan faces up to its banking crisis, things are going to get worse, not only in Japan but throughout Asia, because of the importance of the Japanese economy to the rest of Asia. 
Another looming threat to Asia lies in China which also faces a seriously dangerous banking situation. I was over in Beijing and Shanghai towards the end of the year. It is amazing to see the number of huge high-rises with very little occupancy as they attempt to negotiate the rent to a level to get people in them, regardless of if it makes financial sense. 
By some estimates, China has as much as $250 billion in doubtful loans. The Government-controlled Chinese banking system has been directing funds to favored companies regardless of the economics. In China's case, 70 percent of the state-owned banking loans go to inefficient and near-bankrupt state-owned enterprises. The Government is attempting to encourage foreign ownership coming into China, but there is a great reluctance on the part of U.S. firms to come in and share the debt associated with those opportunities. 
In any event, Mr. President, as a result, an estimated three out of four state commercial banks are now believed to be insolvent in China. China has announced their intention to reform their banking system, but with the Asian economy weakening and Japan in recession, China may wait too long to make the tough changes, and then those changes become that much tougher. 
In the end, we could find the two largest economies in Asia in recession, and I think this is very likely. My experience in finance tells me that when you have bad financial news, if you can take the hit up front and get on with it, as opposed to bearing it and putting it off, you will be much better off. That is not what is happening in Asia in either the case of China or Japan. 
There is a great reluctance to face up to the realities and take the medicine to change the banking system and get them back on a functional basis. This would shore up the economy in Asia. 
Finally, Mr. President, our own U.S. economy is, more than ever, linked to the world economy. So I can only hope that the Japanese Government and the Chinese Government will accept the problems in their system and make the necessary changes before the cost becomes too great, before the cost affects the U.S. economy and the U.S. taxpayer. 
Mr. President, neither Japan nor China is going to survive this crisis merely by devaluing their currency and trying to export their way out of their economic problems. When we see both countries taking serious steps to address their failed financial institutions, as they are currently structured, and bringing greater transparency to their banking systems, then at last we will know that Asia is beginning to turn the corner. 
Mr. President, I suggest they start now without further delay. 
I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate has just passed landmark legislation which will serve to restore, reinvigorate and rebuild our National Park System. S. 1693 addresses a wide variety of Park Service operations from failing infrastructure to improve management and accountability for park programs. 
The Administration reports that it will take over $8 billion to bring our park facilities, historic structures, roads and trails up to an acceptable standard. Over the years while we have expanded the National Park System with new units and new responsibilities we have deferred maintenance and reduced funding in many important park programs. As a result we now have what can be best described as a National Park System that is worn-out and broken--a System in need of attention. Quite frankly, Congress does not have the available monies to address or devote to the problems currently encountered by park managers, however meritorious they may be. 
During this Congress, Senator Thomas, Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, has take a pro-active approach to National Park Service reform. While conducting over fifteen over-sight and legislative hearings on the problems confronting the National Park System. He found that despite reports of $300,000 outhouses, the National Park Service and Congress have failed to deal with the lack of personnel and fiscal resources desperately needed in our parks. Unfortunately, the needs are not limited to a certain number of parks or areas of the United States. The units of the National Park System require a major face-lift from coast to coast, in my State of Alaska, and parks on the islands of Hawaii and in American Samoa. 
While the lack of fiscal resources can be addressed. Throwing money to any government agency without accountability is in no one's interest. In this regard the legislation requires the Secretary to develop a comphensive training program for employees in all professional careers, for the purpose of assuring that the work force has available the best, up-to-date knowledge, skills and abilities with which to manage, interpret and protect the resources of the National Park system. 
The Secretary is also directed to implement a clear plan for management training and development to enable only those qualified to move into positions of park superintendents and regional managers. 
The legislation also addresses park budgets and accountability. Today individual park budgets, if you can find one, are a haze of smoke and mirrors. When this legislation is enacted into law each unit of the System will prepare a budget and make it available to the public. 
Mr. President, let me repeat, `make available to the public' a five year strategic plan and an annual performance plan pursuant to a published park budget on an individual park-by-park basis. There will be accountability for the expenditure of all appropriated funds as well as monies collected from enhanced fee collection programs. There will no longer be management in the darkness. Light will be shed where no light has shown before. 
During the 105th Congress we found that decisions by park service management are often not based on sound science, in fact, in many parks throughout the country the Service knows very little about the natural resources they are supposed to protect. This legislation directs the Secretary to undertake a program in inventory and monitoring of National Park System resources to establish baseline information and to provide information on the long-term trends in the condition of resources under his jurisdiction. In addition, the Secretary is directed to establish a comprehensive network of college and university based cooperative study units in order to complete the baseline information inventory. 
Mr. President, I mentioned earlier that one of the problems with the Park System is that over the last 20 years we have more than doubled the number of units in the System. There has never been a formal procedure to consider new areas which might be eligible for inclusion in the System, nor has any criteria been established by which a potential park area would be evaluated. I direct your attention to Title III of S. 1693 in which the legislation establishes procedures and criteria for Congress and the National Park Service to consider when studying potential new areas that may be added to the System. 
Mr. President, Title IV of this legislation deals with concession reform. After eight years of debate this very contentious issue has been resolved. Both Senator Bumpers and Senator Thomas deserve a great deal of credit to have turned this issue into a bi-partisan one. Senator Bennett as well as Secretary Babbitt also deserve recognition for their work and positive approach to working on the finer points of the concessions legislation. 
I have long been an advocate of granting an interest in property to those in the 
private sector who invest in our park facilities such as hotels, lodges, and restaurants. The private sector requires this incentive or interest to borrow from a bank--collateral--to invest in needed capital improvements. The advantage is that we can improve visitor facilities with private sector dollars as opposed to taxpayer dollars. However meritorious, possessory interest has been a large sticking point in ever reaching resolution on concession reform. 
As in any great bi-partisan compromise, no one got everything they wanted. The concession folks lost their right of preference in renewal but are allowed to maintain a form of possessory interest. We were able to place private sector expertise into the concession management program with an advisory committee made up of individuals in the hospitality industry and the Secretary is directed to contract-out certain concession management functions. 
I firmly believe that this legislation will enhance concession program management, increase competition among prospective concession operators, improve the delivery of goods and services to park visitors, improve facilities and increase revenues from concession franchise fees. 
Mr. President, the legislation extends the popular Recreational Fee Demonstration Program from the year ending in 1999 to 2005 and extends the fee collection authority to all 376 park areas. This should be a valuable shot in the arm for increasing park operating funds. 
For the first time since 1948 commercial film producers will pay a fee for using these unique backdrops; our parks, for major motion pictures and advertisement in addition to allowing the parks to recover their direct costs such as security activities and permit processing. In return the parks will do a better job in processing permits. As time is money it is much easier on the film industry to hear the word `no' early on in the process rather than wait weeks to receive a decision. 
Mr. President, the Park Service is directed by this legislation to establish a National Passport Program based on the familiar and popular Duck Stamp used by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The collectable stamp and related competition and posters etc. should produce additional revenues for major park projects. In addition to the National Passport Program which will provide the user entrance into any one of the fee areas an international passport will be sold overseas for use by foreign visitors. 
On another note we ask the National Park Foundation to share their expertise with many of the park's friends groups to encourage expansion of the volunteer ranks as well as to develop entrepreneurial programs at the local level. 
We have looked at the National Park System and found that many of our parks are adjacent to state and county parks. There is no reason why the NPS cannot share their personnel and resources with these local agencies and vice-versa. In other words you don't need two snowploughs when one could be shared. This legislation changes the law and provides the Park Service with the authorization to enter into agreements with other local agencies. 
Our own United States Park Police are often the forgotten step-child of the National Park Service. Their particular needs and requirements are unknown even though we have asked for reports from the Administration on a number of occasions. Within a year we have that report so that Congress can act in an appropriate manner while addressing the critical needs of the Park Police. 
Mr. President, I thank the Members of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources who came together in a bi-partisan fashion and reported the bill to the full Senate 20 to 0. The Senate can be proud, for this legislation represents a new beginning for the National Park System which will carry it into the next century, alive, vibrant and serving the hundreds and millions of park visitors yet to come. 
Perhaps, most important, our natural, cultural and historic resources for which these parks have been set aside will be better protected and managed for future generations. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues for their support on this important legislation.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when the Committee filed its report on S. 1275, the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act, the cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office was not available. The estimate has since been received and I ask that it be printed in the Record for the information of the Senate.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the passing of our former colleague, Senator Barry Goldwater--one of the giants of twentieth century American politics. 
There is no doubt that Barry Goldwater was a transformational political thinker whose courage and conviction never wavered despite enduring a defeat in 1964. For in that defeat were sown the seeds of the Republican revolution that ultimately brought Ronald Reagan to the Presidency in 1980 and Republicans to control of Congress 14 years later. 
Senator Goldwater was a man who never minced words. He was honest, open and forthright. After his 1964 Presidential hopes were completely vanquished, he observed `When you've lost an election by that much, it isn't the case of whether you made the wrong speech or wore the wrong necktie. It was just the wrong time.' In fact, Barry Goldwater was far ahead of his time and had the opportunity to see his beliefs vindicated when Ronald Reagan was elected President. 
Barry Goldwater did not base his political views on focus groups or poll results. He had core beliefs and was not willing to bend them for temporary political advantage. He warned of the dangers of big government and the welfare state precisely at the time that Lyndon Johnson was constructing the largest expansion of government since the Depression. He preached a strategy of winning the cold war through a policy of peace through strength while the conventional wisdom argued for peaceful coexistence with a de-emphasis on military strength. 
When the American Presidency was in crisis in 1974 after the Supreme Court had ruled against President Nixon's claims of Executive Privilege, Senator Goldwater joined several Congressional colleagues in a visit to the White House to give counsel to the President. Although he had long supported President Nixon throughout the ordeal of Watergate, most observers believe that his words were decisive in persuading the President that the case was hopeless and for the good of the Nation he must resign. 
Mr. President, there are certain quotations that live on decades and centuries after a man has died, yet they capture the spirit of the time and the man. Two centuries ago, when America was heading into revolution, that spirit was best captured in the words of Patrick Henry: `Give me liberty or give me death.' The words of Barry Goldwater spoken 34 years ago at the Republican convention best sum up the spirit, clarity and wisdom that he will forever be remembered for: `Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.' 
We will all miss this decent and honest man who made such a difference for America.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me try to clarify where we stand. What we have pending is the nuclear waste bill, the motion to proceed. The cloture vote is set at 6 p.m. That is cloture to H.R. 1270. After cloture, if we prevail I will introduce an amendment in the nature of a substitute, which will be S. 104, and that is the bill that passed this body. I propose to include in the substitute the Bingaman amendment. I know this is very important to a number on the other side of the aisle. 
Let me be clear about another matter. The idea of mixing resolution of the tobacco legislation with nuclear waste--that is a chemical compound that simply does not mix. 
The nuclear waste bill has been before this body previously, and I would like to recount a little history of S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. It passed this body 65 to 34; 53 Republicans voted for it as did 12 Democrats, specifically: Senator Cleland, Senator Graham, Senator Harkin, Senator Hollings, Senator Johnson, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Murray, Senator Robb, Senator Wyden. 
It is my understanding that somehow, in the minds of some, by voting for cloture we are somehow setting aside our responsibility to address and resolve the tobacco issue. You have heard the generalization that by prolonging this effort to resolve the tobacco legislation, we are hastening the number of young people who will initiate the use of tobacco. Mr. President, we had a vacation. We had a week off for the Memorial recess. We have lost yesterday. We have lost today. The point is, at some point in time the nuclear waste policy matter has to be resolved by this body. The fact that we have voted 65 to 34 previously on the issue, and the leadership has 
indicated a willingness to take it up today and set aside the tobacco bill--and further, make no mistake, it is the leader's intention to go back to the tobacco bill. As a matter of fact, he proposed a unanimous consent request that was objected to. So clearly the intention of the leadership on the Republican side is to proceed with tobacco. But there is a lot going on to resolve the tobacco issue and there will be a lot more time taken in order to reach a conclusion that is satisfactory to this body. So let's be realistic and recognize that today belongs to the issue of nuclear waste. The Senate has an obligation to resolve this issue, to vote for cloture. After cloture, set it aside, go back to the tobacco bill, and then come back on the issue of nuclear waste. 
Make no mistake about it. There is a lot of politics involved in this bill. I know what is going on in Nevada. There is an eager House Member who has issued a press release relative to the attitude of the House. I am not going to go down that particular avenue. But it is fair to say the politics in Nevada is against a nuclear waste site in that State. But to be realistic, nobody wants to have nuclear waste in their State. Yet 65 Members of this body voted on August 15, 1997, to put the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in order and designate Yucca Mountain to be a site for an interim facility. Furthermore, as passed, S. 104 set deadlines for the Department of Energy to meet its contractual obligations to accept and store at a single permanent repository the nuclear waste generated at the commercial nuclear power industry site that will be used to store all Federal nuclear waste. Congress selected Yucca Mountain, NV, as the site to be considered for the repository. 
So there you have it. You have a situation where we have designated an area. We have expressed, by a vote of 65 to 34, the attitude of this body. Now we are seeking cloture so we can proceed with the obligation to address and resolve this. 
So what is a `yes' vote for? Mr. President, a `yes' vote is for storage of nuclear waste at one, safe, Government-controlled site; responsible action to meet the Government's obligation to take our nuclear waste after collecting $14 billion from the consumers of electricity in this country. Currently, the Government is in violation of its contractual commitments to the nuclear waste industry. The suits that are pending on this could cost the taxpayers somewhere between $60- and $80 billion because the Government was supposed to take the waste beginning this year. What we are attempting to do with this legislation is address the responsibility, with finality, for the Government to deliver on its commitments. Also, as we address global warming, the Kyoto accord, and other concerns, there is definitely a role for the nuclear power industry from the standpoint of its contribution to air quality. Nuclear energy provides clean air. 
What does a `no' vote do for us? Storing high-level waste in over 80 sites instead of one site is what a `no' vote does for us. It is a continuation of a breach of contract that will cost the taxpayers, as I have said, untold dollars in damages, an estimated $60- to $80 billion. It will basically eliminate our largest single source of emission-free power, and it will result in moving over to another alternative which is not clean, in the sense of nuclear power. 
Today's vote is an opportunity for triumph, if you will. It is the issue of safety of people over politics. A successful vote today will allow us to consider and adopt a bill that will lead us to a safer future for all Americans. 
As we look at the history of this, as I have said, we passed this bill by large margins, bipartisan margins. The House passed the underlying bill with 307 votes. There you have a pretty good idea of the attitude in the House. 
It would be the height of irresponsibility to let our process down at this time, and obviously, as we look to our environmental concerns, to not have an answer to our high-level waste problem is basically a cop-out on our responsibility. 
We have, as the map on the right indicates, a number of sites around the country. Forty States are affected, Mr. President. There are 80 sites in the 40 States. This is in addition to the waste stored at the Department of Energy waste disposal facility. 
What we have is waste being stored in the backyard of constituents, young and old, across the country, near our neighborhoods, near our schools. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue storage of nuclear waste at each of these sites in a safe and responsible way is diminished. Why, Mr. President? Because many of these sites are filling up. They are designed for a certain capacity of nuclear waste and in many of those pools, at reactor sites, we are seeing storage up to its maximum-designed capacity. 
As I have indicated, the Government agreed to take that waste beginning this year, in 1998, but it can't fulfill its contractual obligation, and that is a contractual obligation of every Member of this body to address the responsibility of the ratepayers who have paid in $14 billion. It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. I for one am not going to let that happen. 
Again, I would like to identify in my State of Alaska I don't have a constituency associated with nuclear power or nuclear waste, but it is an obligation that I have as committee chairman and that we have as Members of this body who struggled with this issue of nuclear waste for more than a decade. 
Let me display a chart that shows the payments that have been made by each State. Here is what the electric consumers of the United States have contributed over the years to take care of nuclear waste beginning this year. There they are, Mr. President, in millions of dollars. They total $14 billion. They are asking for this Senate and the House of Representatives to mandate the removal of the waste as a consequence of what they have paid in so that the waste can safely be stored in Nevada. The U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that the Department of Energy has an obligation to take possession of this waste in 1998 whether or not a repository is ready. Last November, the court ordered the Department of Energy to pay contractual damages. 
I told you those contractual damages are estimated to be up to $80 billion of taxpayers' money, unless we address our obligation to put this waste out in the desert in Nevada. Neither the consumers nor the taxpayers deserve to bear the cost of the Government's failure. 
The administration has simply ducked this issue. They don't want to deal with it on their watch. They just as soon have the nuclear waste issue be resolved by somebody else at another time, regardless of the liability to the taxpayers, 
regardless of the fact that the ratepayers have paid in the $14 billion. 
Mr. President, we are here today trying again to address a responsible resolve, and to adopt a responsible resolve, we are going to have to get on the bill. This is a motion to proceed to the bill. That is all it is. 
Again, I reflect on the opening statements of my colleagues on the other side relative to tying this to the tobacco issue. Tobacco is complex enough without mixing it with nuclear waste. It doesn't belong there, and we have the obligation now to address it. 
The statement of the administration bases its objections on a misreading of the bill and a disregard for the reality of the Federal Government's obligation to take the waste beginning in 1998. The administration claims it cares about clean air and preventing climate change. 
Currently, 22 percent of our electric power is generated by nuclear energy. This is emission-free nuclear energy. The Department of Energy's information administration says the Kyoto treaty would require a 41-percent reduction of CO2 emissions from a predicted level in the year 2008 to 2012. Keep in mind, this administration isn't going to be here in the year 2008 to 2012. 
How do you get there from here in the Kyoto accord without the nuclear industry? You don't. You can't. There are no new emission-free sources that can economically take the place of nuclear energy. For the moment, we can forget about the Kyoto treaty and think about the present, the present time. Between 1990 and 1995, 37 percent of the sulfur dioxide reductions required by the Clean Air Act came from increased generation of existing nuclear power plants. That is where the reduction is coming from, and this administration doesn't want to accept the responsibility to take care of the waste. Why? It doesn't want to address it on its watch. 
Why are my colleagues on the other side mixing tobacco in the issue and saying each day that we delay when the leadership has asked unanimous consent to go back to tobacco after we resolve this matter? This is a cop-out, Mr. President. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to reflect on how their votes are going to be recorded. Those on the other side who voted with us last time are Senator Cleland, Senator Graham, Senator Harkin, Senator Hollings, Senator Johnson, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Murray, Senator Robb, Senator Wyden. 
I encourage them to reflect, again, that this shouldn't get mixed up with Nevada politics. If we look at polling in Nevada, we have to acknowledge Nevada does not want to be the resting place, even temporarily, for our nuclear waste. But both sides are against putting nuclear waste in Nevada. So it isn't a matter of competition among the Members who are against it. They are all against it. 
If you ask a Nevadan whether they want nuclear waste in their State, the answer is no. You can go to 49 other States and you will get the same answer. But we have a responsibility to put it somewhere, and we are proposing to put it in the desert where we have had over 50 years of nuclear testing. 
There it is. This is the location for the nuclear waste storage at the Nevada site that was used previously for more than 800 tests of nuclear weapons. If you don't want to put it there, you tell me where you want to put it. We spent over $7 billion at Yucca Mountain already testing it. We are proposing that the waste be moved in accordance with the Government's contract, move it out to a temporary repository until Yucca Mountain can be licensed and certified. 
If it isn't licensed and certified, then it is going to have to go someplace else, but until then, this is the site, and to suggest we shouldn't take it up simply means more storage piling up at our reactors. Some of those reactors are going to shut down. We are going to have to get that power someplace else. We will probably have to go to coal-fired power which, obviously, is not going to have the same effect that this has on our air quality. 
EPA can pass all the regulations in the world, but if the administration really does not care about clean air--well, they can do something about it, if the President would get behind this legislation. Instead, the administration intends to delay this issue, delay this issue, delay this issue, and the whole time telling the American people that it really cares for its safety, the environment, and their pocketbook. 
Let me tell you again, if you are concerned about the safety, you are not going to put this around in the number of States where we have it, that is 40 States with 80 sites. If you care about the dollars, you are not going to stop the realization that the taxpayers have paid $14 billion; and now we are looking at claims for nonperformance of the contract to the taxpayers in over $70 to $80 billion. 
Is the President really concerned about clean air and climate change or is this a cynical diplomatic or, more realistically, a political excuse? I think it is the latter, Mr. President. There is politics in this issue. There is politics in the mix of this issue and tobacco. This issue should stand on its own. 
Finally, Mr. President, we have really reached a crossroad. The job of fixing this program is ours. Time for fixing this program is now. The vote before the Senate is to move forward with a motion to proceed. Then we are going to move back to tobacco. 
We have made progress on this issue. We have made progress at Yucca Mountain. As I have indicated, the 5-mile tunnel is complete. We spent $7 billion of the consumers' money. We have to build on this progress. Our bill continues site characteristics, activities for permanent repository. It allows each State to designate the route that the nuclear waste will move to the site proposed in Nevada. 
I remind the President that we have waste moving throughout the United States, military waste across State lines. We can move it safely. We know how. Europe moves it safely by rail and by ship. There is no magic in this. But the realization is that today we need a temporary storage facility or we are going to be storing spent fuel all across this Nation for decades to come. We are going to be in violation of our contract, which will cost the taxpayers more money to settle the suit. 
And we can choose today whether to start on this process to resolve the issue of whether the Nation is going to continue to have 80 interim storage sites or just one safe site--that arid, remote Nevada test site where I have indicated we have exploded scores of nuclear bombs during the cold war. And it is safe and it is remote. And, unfortunately, it has to be in one of our States, and it happens to be in the State of Nevada. But it has brought a lot of jobs to Nevada, a lot of prosperity to Nevada over the years. 
And there is the realization that if Yucca is licensed--and it is likely to be--it is going to be a very, very easy task to move the spent fuel to the repository. And in the unlikely event that Yucca is not licensed, or found to be unsuitable, Congress and the administration are going to have to consider our options. In either case, we will be ahead of the game regardless of what happens at Yucca. 
This is a step that we should take. And remember today, yes is a vote for cloture. It is a vote for the storage of nuclear waste at one safe Government-controlled site. It is a responsible action to meet Government's obligation to take the nuclear waste, after collecting $14 billion from the consumers of electricity. It is for cleaner air. And a no vote, again, is for continuing to store high-level nuclear waste in over the 80 sites instead of the 1 safe site. It is a continuation of a breach of contract that is going to cost the taxpayers of this country some $70 to $80 billion as a consequence of our inaction. 
A no vote is for eliminating our largest source of emission-free power, resulting in dirtier air. And isn't it extraordinary that this Nation, with all of our technology, cannot address or resolve our high-level nuclear waste; but the French, the Japanese, the British, the Swedes have all addressed it responsibly? We cannot even get our Government to commit to its contractual commitment. 
The time is now. I urge my colleagues--I know the politics of this body. I know this is an issue in the race in Nevada, and I can understand and be sensitive of that, but each one of us has an obligation as statesmen to address responsibly the obligation we have towards taking this waste and putting it out in a temporary repository in Nevada. 
I understand the arguments from my colleagues from Nevada relative to their bottom line. They do not want it in their State. But we have an obligation to put it somewhere. We have voted previously to put it in Nevada, in a temporary repository. To back down now is to shirk a duty and an obligation that we were elected to address, Mr. President, address with a resolve; namely, the sanctity of a contractual commitment that is due to take that waste this year and the recognition that the Government, the administration, refuses to accept that responsibility, therefore, that obligation becomes ours; 
furthermore, the litigation and cost to the taxpayers who are going to be confronted with this, and the full employment for lawyers if we do not address it now. 
So do not let politics enter into the vote and the resolve on this issue. This issue should stand on its own. This issue does not belong in consideration of the tobacco bill. This legislation should be addressed and resolved with a vote in favor today so we can move on and meet our responsibility. 
Mr. President, I ask how much time I have remaining on this side.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Relative to powerplants, let me advise the President there are safety and economic advantages to having 1 central storage facility rather than 80. I think my colleagues would agree on the other side. Throughout the debate, we keep hearing suggestions like: `Why don't we study the issue some more? Why don't we just leave it at the plant sites?' which is what is suggested, and `Why do we have to solve the problem now?' 
Well, why should we leave spent fuel at the nuclear power plants in 34 States when there is a less costly storage method with an increased margin of safety in an area that has already been proven for its storage of waste?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the last few minutes we have heard from our friends from Nevada a good deal about the status of tobacco. How tobacco relates to high-level nuclear waste is beyond this Senator from Alaska. I think both can kill. Certainly tobacco, as we have evidenced, can kill and high-level nuclear waste, if not properly stored and not properly transported and not properly basically put to rest, can kill. But when I look at the reality of where we are in this debate, I refer my good friends to reflect on the action that was taken by the majority leader when he asked: 
I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, to resume consideration of the tobacco bill, notwithstanding rule XXII with respect to the nuclear waste bill. 
That was objected to, Mr. President. It was objected to by the minority leader. Let's not make any mistake about who is whom in wanting to go back to the tobacco bill. This was a unanimous consent request of the majority leader, a legitimate request, to guarantee going back, and it was objected to by the other side. So who is objecting to moving on tobacco? It is pretty clear. It ought to be clear to everybody. 
We are all concerned about the disposition of the tobacco bill, but this bill has no relation. We have an obligation on this bill to address it with a resolve. 
Do you have a few questions? Well, let's take a few, Mr. President. Anyone who buys the line that the tobacco industry and the nuclear power industry are somehow in bed together, why that is preposterous. It is absolutely preposterous. There is absolutely no connection, and we all know it. The Nevadans would have the alternative of doing absolutely nothing--absolutely nothing--about high-level nuclear waste. 
Mr. President, this also is about Nevada politics, not about tobacco. It is Nevada politics, again, on who can generate the responsibility for killing this issue in the Congress of the United States, whether it be the House Member who is running for the Senate office or the Nevada Senator who is up for reelection. Whoever can put the best spin on it in Nevada is going to claim a victory. That is politics, but make sure we understand it, Mr. President. 
When my good friend on the other side says that he has no idea what the substitute is about, well, somebody's memory is short because we debated the issue. We had a vote on the issue. The substitute we debated on April 15, 1997. The substitute was adopted 65 to 34. When he indicates that he has no idea relative to the amendment proposed to be offered, that was the Bingaman amendment. That was debated and debated extensively. So the record will note that the substitute was voted on 65-34 and was adopted. The Bingaman amendment was debated on the floor; it was rejected. The Senator from Alaska is proposing to take the Bingaman amendment, if we can move off the motion to proceed, and get this issue behind us. 
Mr. President, let's make sure we understand what this issue is all about. It is about ducking our responsibility. It is about Nevada politics, and we are now told that the House won't take it up. I haven't seen a statement from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Anyone can issue a press release, and it is important to recognize who is issuing the press release. It is the Congressman who is seeking the Nevada Senate seat so he can get aboard and claim that he is responsible for killing it. 
As I said, anyone can issue a press release, but I can tell you what is true: We have a bill that received a big bipartisan vote. This is not a partisan issue, as evidenced by the vote last time. 
We had 12 Democrats that voted with 53 Republicans. All right, that is a fact. I have the word of Chairman Bliley in the House that he is committed to getting this bill done. I know the majority and minority staff of the Commerce Committee spent all day every day in the last recess negotiating a compromise. I do not think they would have done that if the leadership did not intend to take up the bill. 
I think this is a blatant attempt to influence the vote today in effect to perhaps become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We have to focus on the substance of the bill and vote to do what is right, not put this off, not listen to political posturing from the other body or political posturing that affects this body. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture. You know, if you look at this picture, here is the Nevada test site, Mr. President. The last weapon there was exploded underground in 1991. Underground tests are still performed there with nuclear materials being exploded with conventional explosives, all with the wholehearted support--the wholehearted support--of whom? 
Well, here it is, Mr. President. Here is what the State of Nevada in its resolution says about the site. I would like to read relevant portions of the Nevada Assembly Joint Resolution No. 15 of February 26, 1975.  
Whereas, the people of Southern Nevada have confidence in the safety record of the Nevada Test Site and in the ability of the staff of the site to maintain safety in the handling of nuclear materials * * * [and] 
Whereas Nuclear waste disposal * * * can * * * be carried out at the Nevada Test Site with minimal capital investment relative to other locations; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Assembly and the State of Nevada, jointly, That the legislature of the State of Nevada strongly urges the Energy Research and Development Administration to choose Nevada Test Site for the disposal of nuclear wastes. . . . 
That is what some people in Nevada and the Nevada legislature think about this idea. It is a pretty good idea. It means jobs. They want to see the ongoing development, if you will, of this area.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from Florida, first of all, we have not been able to obtain a copy of any statement from the Speaker. The statement that has been alluded to on the floor is a statement by the Congressman from Nevada who is running for the Senate office. He released a statement which indicated that the House leader would not take up the bill. We have not been able to confirm that with the House leader. 
It would be my intention to offer the Senate-passed bill, Senate bill 104, with an addition of the Bingaman amendment, which was circulated at the time of the Senate consideration. If informal negotiations with the House bear fruit, which they certainly have been, I will probably offer a perfecting amendment, but there is no agreement at this time.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have heard tobacco brought into this discussion. Tobacco certainly is a problem. We recognize that. So is nuclear waste responsibility. We have that before the Senate now. But with nuclear waste, the 
Government has a liability already established and established in a court of law. There is no such obligation with respect to tobacco. We are trying to address that now. 
On nuclear waste, we have collected $14 billion from the taxpayers for its disposal. On tobacco, we have not collected one dime. 
I also remind my colleagues we have had a unanimous consent request to take up tobacco next. It has been objected to by the minority leader. 
So make no mistake about it, Mr. President, we spent a lot of time trying to resolve this important issue. We are in the homestretch now. The House bill got 307 votes, if there is any question about the attitude prevailing in the House. The Senate bill we are voting on today had 65 votes the last time. That is the kind of overwhelming bipartisan support--and there is no reason this bill should not be passed now. Democrats who were with us last time included Senators Cleland, Graham, Harkin, Hollings, Johnson, Kohl, Leahy, Levin, Moseley-Braun, Murray, Robb, and Wyden. 
The whole business is there today. The obligation remains here today to address this and not put it off. The Senators from Nevada say not today, not today, not today. Well, when? How many dollars does the taxpayer have to address as far as his responsibility, when the ratepayers have paid $14 billion and the taxpayers are now stuck for liability when we go to court and we don't have a resolve of this problem. There is no use putting it off today. The time to act is now. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of introducing legislation, that when enacted, will provide for a cleaner electrical system for Glacier National Park and Preserve in Alaska. 
Vice President Al Gore in his opening remarks to the President's Council on Sustainable Development on January 13, 1994 said `Our objective is results that are cleaner for the environment and cheaper for the economy.' My objective for Glacier Bay National Park and the nearby Gustavus community mirrors that of the Vice President--to produce electricity that will be cleaner for the environment and cheaper for the economy. 
Glacier Bay National Park currently generates its own electrical power using diesel generators. The electrical generation equipment now in place is expensive to maintain and is unreliable. It is my understanding that over the years there have been at least two oil spills into the waters of Glacier Bay, the tank farm is leaking, and the current electrical system is in need of major repair. In short, the diesel system at Glacier Bay is unacceptable in environmental terms 
Before we spend tax payers dollars to add band-aids to this antiquated system, we ought to consider an environmentally sound and cheaper option for the production of electrical power. 
Fortunately, there is a viable option. Enactment of this legislation would allow the placement and installation of a small water powered electrical system in the Fall Creek area on the southeast corner of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. 
Before park advocates take out their swords and start drawing lines in the sand, I want to make it very clear that I am not suggesting that we allow for the construction of a Hoover Dam in a National Park. I am suggesting that a `run of stream' small diversion weir be placed along Fall Creek within the boundaries of the Park. 
Since the Fall Creek area of this proposed hydro power system is in a Wilderness area designated by Congress, any redrawing of boundaries of Glacier Bay National Park or other procedure to permit the system requires Congressional approval. As envisioned, the site required will amount to approximately 78 acres. If only the `footprint' is considered, as little as 5 acres would be utilized. 
I believe there are considerable environmental benefits and economic advantages to be gained by eliminating dependence upon diesel fossil fuel and converting to a small water powered electrical system to provide power to the community of Gustavus and the National Park Service in Glacier Bay. In addition to providing clean, cheaper, stable priced, hydro electricity, substantial savings will occur to the State of Alaska, the National Park Service and to consumers. Significant economic savings from appropriations and increasing operational expenses for the existing systems, along with the environmental enhancements will have continuing long term benefits that more than compensate for a loss of some 5 acres for the Fall Creek System. These multiple benefits should be sufficient merit alone to justify a restructuring of Park boundaries to accommodate the new electrical generating system. 
I realize that however meritorious the proposal may be, taking Wilderness out of a system or lands out of a park will be unacceptable to some. Under the provisions of this legislation lands removed from the boundaries of the Park will be replaced with State lands in another park. In other words, there will be no net loss of Wilderness. 
We need to clean and protect the environment at Glacier Bay and Gustavus, this legislation is the beginning. The completed project will serve as a conservation model to other communities--an example of significant environmental advantages coupled with substantial economic savings to the public and government which could be realized elsewhere, particularly in the rural communities of Alaska.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this morning I introduce legislation to implement a settlement agreement between the Chugach Alaska Corporation (CAC) and the United States Forest Service. 
Pursuant to section 1430 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the State of Alaska, and the Chugach Alaska Corporation, were directed to study land ownership in and around the Chugach Region in Alaska. The purpose of this study was two-fold. First, was to provide for a fair and just settlement of the Chugach people and realizing the intent, purpose, and promise of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act by Chugach Alaska Corporation. Second, was to identify lands that, to the maximum extent possible, are of the like, kind, and character of those traditionally used and occupied by the Chugach people, and, to the maximum extent possible, are coastal accessible and economically viable. 
On September 17, 1982, the parties entered into an agreement now known as the 1982 Chugach Natives, Inc. Settlement Agreement in order to set forth a fair and just settlement for the Chugach people pursuant to the study directed by Congress. Among the many provisions of this agreement the United States was required to convey to Chugach Alaska Corporation not more than 73,308 acres of land in the vicinity of Carbon Mountain. The land eventually conveyed contained significant amounts of natural resources; however, they were inaccessible by road. Therefore, a second major provision of the Settlement Agreement granted Chugach Alaska Corporation rights-of-way across Chugach National Forest to their land and required the United States to also grant an easement for the purpose of constructing and using roads and other facilities necessary for development of that tract of land on terms and conditions to be determined in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. It is obvious that without such an easement the land conveyed to CAC could not be utilized or developed in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in ANILCA and ANCSA. 
More than fifteen years after the Settlement Agreement was signed the much needed easement has still not been granted and the CAC remains unable to make economic use of their lands. It seems absurd to me that Congress passed a Settlement Act for the Benefit of Alaska Natives; then the federal government entered into a Settlement Agreement to implement that Act where the CAC was concerned; and today, we find ourselves once again in a position of having to force the government to comply with these agreements. 
I have spoken directly to the Regional Forester about this issue and to the Chief of the Forest Service. While they assure me the issue is being addressed and, in fact, have signed an MOU to keep it moving forward, they cannot give me any assurance that it will conclude. Therefore, I find it necessary to once again have Congress rectify inaction on behalf of the Forest Service. 
The legislation is simple and straightforward. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to grant an easement to the CAC by December 11, of this year. It does not prevent the current process from going forward, it simply assures that there will be an end to it. 
It is my intent to hold a hearing on this issue in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee as soon as possible.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this legislation should have been the easiest thing we did this Congress. The Senate passed a bill on this issue by unanimous consent three times this Congress. This bill contains nothing less than our Nation's energy security insurance policy. This bill authorizes two vital energy security measures: the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and U.S. participation in the International Energy Agency. 
Both of these authorities have expired. Again, this year we have sent our soldiers to the Gulf to protect our Nation's energy security interests. We owe it to our soldiers, and the Nation's civilian consumers, to do everything we can to ensure that our energy insurance policy is in effect. 
However, to ensure our Nation's energy security fully, we need more than just a simple extension of these authorities. We must change the antitrust exemption in EPCA to comply with current IEA policy. The IEA changed its emergency response policy at our request, switching from command-and-control measures to more market-oriented coordinated stockdraw procedures. However, our laws haven't kept up. 
Right now, our U.S. oil companies don't have any assurance that their attempts to cooperate with the IEA and our government in a crises won't be a violation of antitrust laws. The IEA's efforts to respond to a crisis are already being critically impaired, because they can't coordinate with U.S. oil companies or even conduct exercises to prepare for an emergency. Our oil companies want to cooperate with our government and the IEA and strongly support this amendment. 
For every year in recent memory, we have authorized this Act on a year-to-year basis. Every year, we face a potential crises when these authorities go unrenewed until the very end of the Congress. The provisions of this bill are not controversial. However, there are those who see any important bill as leverage. 
This year, we are on the edge of a real crises. We have military activity in the Gulf, and no clear authority to respond to oil supply shortages. Playing political games with this bill has always been irresponsible; now it is downright dangerous. In the future, the only way to avoid the annual crisis is to renew EPCA for more than one year. I am disappointed that we can't do that now. But for now, we must avert the immediate crisis. 
I have tried to address concerns about the future of the SPR. Like many of you, I am dismayed by the recent use of the SPR as a `piggy bank'. In 1995, DOE proposed the sale of oil to pay for repairs and upkeep, opening the floodgates to continued sales of oil for budget-balancing purposes. So far, we've lost the American taxpayer over half a billion dollars. Buying high and selling low never makes sense. We're like the man in the old joke who was buying high and selling low who claimed that `he would make it up on volume.' I am pleased that we were successful in canceling the oil sale ordered by the fiscal year 1998 Interior Appropriations bill. I thank the appropriators for keeping my oil-sale cancellation amendment in the conference on the Supplemental Appropriations bill. By my calculations, we have saved the American taxpayer over $500 million. I am also pleased that the President's budget does not propose oil sales. I hope we have broken the habit of selling SPR oil forever. 
We have already invested a great deal of taxpayer dollars in the SPR. We proved during the Persian Gulf War that the stabilizing effect of an SPR drawdown far outstrips the volume of oil sold. The simple fact that the SPR is available can have a calming influence on oil markets. The oil is there, waiting to dampen the effects of an energy emergency on our economy. However, if we don't ensure that there is authority to use the oil when we need it, we will have thrown those tax dollars away. So, the first step is to ensure that our emergency oil reserves are fully authorized and available. 
We are talking about people's lives and jobs. The least we can do is stop holding this measure hostage to political ambition. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last year North Korean defectors indicated that the North Korean missile development program already poses a verifiable threat to American forces in Okinawa and seems on track to threaten parts of Alaska by the turn of the Century. The Taepodong missile, which is under development, would have a range of about 3,100 miles. From certain parts of North Korea, this weapon could easily target many of the Aleutian islands in western Alaska, including the former Adak Naval Air Base. 
The Washington Times reported last week that the Chinese have 13 of 18 long-range strategic missiles armed with nuclear warheads aimed at American cities. This is incredible, Mr. President. Opponents to the motion to invoke cloture somehow fail to understand that this threat is real and that we have a responsibility to protect the United States from attack, be it deliberate or accidental. Without question, the threat of an attack on the United States is increasingly real, and we must act now so that we can construct a national missile defense system with the capability of intercepting and deterring an aggressive strike against American soil from all parts of the United States. 
Mr. President, I support the motion to invoke cloture and hope that my colleagues will vote overwhelmingly in favor of this legislation in the near future.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman is including in the manager's amendment language that I offered along with my colleague, Senator Torricelli. 
Mr. President, one of the downsides of the technological revolution that is symbolized by communications today on the Internet is the growing multitude of junk e-mail. Junk e-mail has quickly become the scourge of the Internet. It clogs America's inboxes and raises costs to all Internet users. Among those who are regular e-mail users, junk e-mail is known as `spam,' which many suggest is an insult to the Hormel Corporation. I originally recognized spam as a spinoff of the Second World War where food was given to soldiers, commonly referred to as C rations, that implied a mixture of food products. In any event, it is the name that has been adopted for junk e-mail. 
Rural residents of our Nation and my State of Alaska are forced to pay long-distance charges to receive these unwanted solicitations, the majority of which contain fraudulent or pornographic messages. Not only are these junk e-mails objectionable, but they so clog the transmission network that Internet service providers are forced to spend tens of millions of dollars to expand their networks to handle all of these messages. 
America Online reports that up to 30 percent of daily incoming e-mail is junk e-mail. This volume has forced it and other Internet service providers, the ISPs, to buy more equipment and divert staff to handle users' complaints. These resources could be better spent by ISPs on improving service or even reducing monthly fees. 
My provision, Mr. President, is a modified version of legislation that I introduced last year--S. 771. When I introduced the bill, I put it up on the Web and asked for e-mail comments on the bill. So far, I have received over 1,500--the vast majority of which have been supportive of my efforts. 
So this provision is really a Truth in Advertising provision. It will simply require commercial e-mailers to identify who they are, their addresses, and their telephone numbers. The reason we have included this provision is that millions of junk e-mails are sent out with phony e-mail addresses which make it impossible for citizens to request that the sender stop cluttering their e-mail boxes. Under this provision, citizens will know exactly who the sender is and have the option of turning that sender away from their inbox. 
The provision further requires that a junk e-mailer must honor the request of an individual who asks that his or her name be deleted from the mailing list permanently. It's as simple as that. I doubt if there is anyone among us here today who would argue against someone's wish to simply be left alone by junk e-mailers. 
The amendment permits the Federal Trade Commission, the State Attorneys General, and Internet service providers to protect consumers from Internet junk e-mail by allowing them to sue those junk e-mailers who fail to identify themselves properly or refuse to remove a person's name from a mailing list. 
Mr. President, junk e-mail has become so pervasive that some have suggested a complete ban on such unsolicited advertisements. I believe that Internet users should control what comes into their electronic mailboxes, not the government. And I wish to emphasize that. This debate should not be about the government controlling the content of individual electronic mailboxes, but about individual users taking control of their own mailboxes. I think my provision will sufficiently reduce the problems of junk e-mail, and thus show that banning is unnecessary. 
Finally, I thank the floor managers for their attention to this issue, as well as the efforts of America Online and the Center for Democracy and Technology.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Stevens in introducing legislation that will allow Alaska Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts designed to promote the health, education, welfare and cultural heritage of Alaska Natives. 
Mr. President, in 1987, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was amended to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts to hold lands and investments for the benefit of current and future generations of Alaska Natives. Assets in these trusts are insulated from business exposure and risks and can be invested to provide distributions of income to Native shareholders and their future generations. 
Although the 1987 amendments were designed to facilitate the development of settlement trusts, many Native Corporations have been stymied in their efforts because the tax law, in many cases, imposes onerous penalties on the Native shareholders when the trusts are created. For example, when assets are transferred to the trust, they are treated as a de facto distribution of assets directly to the shareholders themselves to the extent of the corporation's earnings and profits. 
Even though the current shareholders receive no actual income at the time of the transfer into the trust, they are liable for income taxes as if they received an actual distribution. This not only requires the shareholder to come up with money to pay taxes on a distribution he or she never received, but also can result in a situation where a trust fund beneficiary is required to prepay taxes on his share of the entire trust corpus, which may be substantially more in taxes than the amount of cash benefits he or she will actually receive in the future. 
Our legislation remedies this inequity by requiring that a beneficiary of a settlement trust will be subject to taxation with respect to assets conveyed to the trust only when the actual distribution is received by the beneficiary. Moreover, the legislation provides that distributions from the trust will be taxable as ordinary income even if the distribution represents a return of capital. In addition, to ensure that these trusts do not accumulate excessive levels of the corporation's earnings, the legislation requires that the trust must annually distribute at least 55 percent of their taxable income. 
Mr. President, Alaska Native Corporations are unique entities. Unlike Native American tribes in the lower 48, Alaska Native corporations are subject to income tax. But unlike ordinary C corporations, Alaska Native corporations have diverse purposes, one of which is to preserve and protect the heritage of the Native shareholders. The settlement trust concept is well suited to the special needs of Alaska's Natives. As the Conference Committee Report to ANSCA amendments of 1987 stated: 
Trust distributions may be used to fight poverty, provide food, shelter and clothing and served comparable economic welfare purposes. Additionally, cash distributions of trust income may be made on an across-the-board basis to the beneficiary population as part of the economic welfare function. 
Settlement trusts will ensure that for generations to come, Native Alaskans will have a steady stream of income on which to continue building an economic base. The current tax rules discourage the creation of such trusts with the result that Native corporations are under extreme pressure to distribute all current earnings rather than prudently reinvesting for the future. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to see this legislation adopted into law this year. For the long-term benefit of Alaska Natives, this tax law change is fundamentally necessary.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me commend the chairman on his efforts to bring this to the floor. This is the second or third time he has done it. I am certainly pleased to be a cosponsor of the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act. 
In our State of Alaska, we have an effort relative to awareness being put on by the Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska, which has provided 25,000 women in 81 villages throughout the State an opportunity for free mammograms. This has been done not with government support but with private support. We have raised about $830,000 through a series of fishing tournaments each year, which some Senators have been a party to. 
Mr. President, I think that the significance of this bill, which means so much to so many, is that it would put an end to the `drive-through' mastectomies, as we know them today. Many of my colleagues have already spoken on this issue. The bill ensures that mastectomy patients would have access to reconstruction surgery. Scores of women have been denied this procedure because insurers have deemed this procedure to be `cosmetic.' Far too often, breast cancer victims who believe they have adequate health coverage have become horrified when they learn that reconstruction is not covered. 
In my State of Alaska, of the 324 mastectomies and lumpectomies performed in Alaska in 1996, reconstruction only occurred on 11 of the patients. That means that only 3.4 percent of the women who have a breast removed have reconstructive surgery, compared to the national average of 23 percent. 
The reason is cost, Mr. President. And if we look at one of the physicians in my State, Dr. Troxel, of Providence Hospital in Anchorage, who states: 
Women who are not able to receive reconstructive surgery suffer from depression, a sense of loss, and need more cancer survivor counseling. . . .Additionally, reconstructive surgery can be preventive medicine--women who don't have reconstructive surgery often develop back problems and other difficulties. 
Mr. President, one out of nine American women will suffer the tragedy of breast cancer. It is today the leading cause of death for women between the ages of 35 to 54. 
Alaskan women are particularly vulnerable to this disease. We have the second highest rate of breast cancer in the nation: 1 in 7 Alaska women will get breast cancer and tragically it is the Number One cause of death among Native Alaskan women. 
Mr. President, these tragic Alaska deaths are not inevitable. Health experts agree that the best hope for lowering the death rate is early detection and treatment. It is estimated that breast cancer deaths can be reduced by 30 percent if all women avail themselves of regular clinical breast examination and mammography. 
But for many Alaska women, especially native women living in one of our 230 remote villages, regular screening and early detection are often hopeless dreams. 
For more than 20 years, my wife Nancy has recognized this problem and tried to do something about it. In 1974, she and a group of Fairbanks' women created the Breast Cancer Detection Center, for the purpose of offering mammographies to women in remote areas of Alaska--regardless of a woman's ability to pay. 
Now, the Center uses a small portable mammography unit which can be flown to remote areas of Alaska, offering women in the most rural of areas easy access to mammographies at no cost. Additionally, the Center uses a 43-foot-long, 14-foot-high and 26,000-pound mobile mammography van to travel through rural areas of Alaska. The van makes regular trips, usually by river barge, to remote areas in Interior Alaska such as Tanana. 
Julie Roberts, a 42-year-old woman of Tanana, who receives regular mammographies from the mobile mammography van, knows the importance of early screening: 
There's a lot of cancer here (in Tanana)--a lot of cancer. That's why it's important to have the mobile van here . . . I know that if I get checked, I can catch it early and can probably save my life. I have three children and I want to see my grandchildren. 
I am proud to say that the Fairbanks Center now serves about 2,200 women a year and has provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska women in 81 villages throughout the state. To help fund the efforts of the Fairbanks Center, each year Nancy and I sponsor a fishing tournament to raise money for the operation of the van and mobile mammography unit. After just three years, donations from the tournament have totalled $830,000. 
Mr. President, Nancy and I are committed to raising more funds for this important program so that every women in Alaska can benefit from the advances of modern technology and reduce their risk of facing this killer disease. 
The importance of mammography and screening cannot be stressed enough--however, there has long been a tragic result of the disease that Congress has either ignored or failed to recognize--and that is the so-called `drive-through' mastectomy. 
Currently victims of breast cancer who receive mastectomies are being forced to get out of their surgery bed and vacate the hospital only hours after their surgery. The reason? Because far too often it is the practice of insurance companies to treat the procedure of a mastectomy as merely an `out-patient service.' 
Here's the horror that many insurance companies cause: 
Nancy Couchot, a 60-year-old woman had a radical mastectomy at 11:30 a.m. She was released from the hospital only hours later at 4:30 p.m: even though she was not able to walk or use the rest room without assistance. 
Victoria Berck, had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. and was released at 2:30 p.m. She was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. Ms. Berck concludes, `No civilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an out-patient service.' 
Mr. President that is why I am proud to co-sponsor of S. 249, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act. This bill would put an end to the drive-through mastectomies. 
Specifically, the Act will require health insurance companies to allow physicians to determine the length of a mastectomy patient's hospital stay according to medical necessity. In other words, the bill makes it illegal to punish a doctor for following good medical judgment and sound medical treatment. 
Another important provision of this bill ensures that mastectomy patients will have access to reconstructive surgery. Scores of women have been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure to be `cosmetic' and, therefore, not medically necessary. 
Mr. President, far too often breast cancer victims, who believe that they have adequate health care coverage, become horrified when the learn that reconstruction is not covered in their health plan. 
In Alaska, the problem is even more tragic. Of the 324 mastectomies and lumpectomies performed in Alaska in 1996, reconstruction only occurred on 11 of the patients. That means that only 3.4% of women who have their breast removed have reconstructive surgery, compared to the national average of 23 percent. 
The simple reason for this tragically low figure is simple: women can't afford the procedure. 
Breast reconstruction costs average about $5,000 for just the procedure. If hospital, physician and other costs are included--the cost averages around $15,000. 
Dr. Sarah Troxel, of Providence hospital in Anchorage, states the importance of reconstruction:  
Women who are not able to receive reconstructive surgery suffer from depression, a sense of loss, and need more cancer survivor counseling . . . Additionally, reconstructive surgery can be preventative medicine--women who don't have reconstructive surgery often develop back problems and other difficulties. 
Mr. President, insurance companies commonly provide reconstructive surgery for other types of cancers that alter or disfigure the surface of the skin--such as melanomas and all skin cancers. 
Here is why federal legislation is needed: Thirty-four states, including Alaska have no state law requiring breast reconstruction after surgery. And in addition, 70 million Americans receive health benefits through federally regulated self-funded ERISA plans which are not covered by state insurance requirements. 
These issues are not partisan issues. We may have our differences regarding managing and financing health reform, but I think we all endorse accessible and affordable health care that preserves patient choice and physician discretion. Cancer does not look to see the politics of its victims. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Res. 223, which I introduced yesterday on behalf of myself and Senator Stevens. Our resolution recognizes the Prince William Sound Community College and its celebration of its twentieth anniversary this Sunday, May 10, 1988. 
This is a notable milestone for the College and for the people of the Copper Basin Area. Prince William Sound Community College was established in 1976 as a Learning Center set up by the University of Alaska. It earned community college status just two years later. In 1987, the University of Alaska merged all community colleges in the state into the university system; however, due to overwhelming support from the local community of Valdez, Prince William Sound Community College remained the only individually accredited community college in the University of Alaska system. 
Today, after 20 years, the student body of the college has grown to nearly 2,000 students, and the college is a recognized leader in the University of Alaska system. 
Mr. President, I commend the Prince William Sound Community College for its 20 years of exceptional service to the people of Alaska and look forward to many more years of growth and contributions to the culture and economy of Alaska.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment my good friend from Florida relative to this particular issue concerning the IRS evaluation and the oversight board, in particular the position of the Secretary on this board. 
First of all, in this amendment that my friend from Florida has proposed, we would give the IRS Advisory and Oversight Board a far greater capacity to exercise its oversight and advisory functions, ensuring taxpayers are treated fairly. That is the object of this entire exercise. 
Our friends on the Finance Committee, and I am a member of that committee, as we discussed in the makeup of the nine-member board, we reflected on the debate yesterday where the Senate rejected the idea of making the board a full-time board consisting exclusively of private citizens. However, in my view, this board will have a very, very hard time fulfilling its oversight and advisory functions because, I think, as does the Senator from Florida, that its composition is basically unbalanced. 
First of all, let's examine the board. We have six private sector members to be selected based on their expertise in such areas as management, customer service, information technology, and, most important, the needs and concerns of the taxpayer. If those were the only members of the board, the board would be basically free to take an unbiased and objective view of how to improve the operations of this agency, with the goal of ensuring the proper treatment of the American taxpayer and the efficient and courteous delivery of services. 
But let's look at it realistically. Unfortunately, the board is not made up that way. As the board has emerged, it will likely be dominated by three additional people who are required to be members. First of all, we have added the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner. A representative of the employees of the IRS is the second member. And third, the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Does anyone in this body really believe that this board, consisting of three of the most important people--these are 
policy people--most important people involved in the operation of the IRS, will be free to exercise real oversight of the IRS? Why do we even need an advisory board to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of the IRS when these two individuals already serve on the board? What kind of advisory group are we talking about here? You have insiders on the advisory group. These insiders are very powerful--the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, a union employee representative of the Internal Revenue Service, and the Secretary of the Treasury. So where is the objectivity? These people will control the direction and policy of this board. So where does this advisory board stand independently? It does not. That is the fallacy in the makeup. That is why I encourage my colleagues to consider the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida, which I wholeheartedly support. 
We have heard the horror stories of taxpayer abuse described in the Finance Committee last September and at last week's hearings. Mind you, Mr. President, this occurred on the watch of the Treasury Secretaries appointed by both Republican and Democratic Presidents. What kind of oversight did these Treasury Secretaries perform on the IRS during their tenure in office? It appears there was very little, if any, oversight. Why? We would like to think because we don't have an independent board. But, if you put the insiders on the board, you don't have objectivity. If we allow the Secretary of the Treasury to participate on this board, along with the IRS Commissioner, I fear we will have business as usual in the IRS. That is what the Finance Committee attempted to address: no longer business as usual. 
I assume many of my colleagues are out there now making their sound bites, appealing to the folks back home that this is a major step forward, this legislation, in making the IRS accountable. But it is not. It is business as usual. You have the same insiders, only this time they are on the board that is supposed to oversee the IRS. 
Mr. President, let's stop kidding ourselves around here. The Secretary has a staff of thousands of people. They can provide him with any number of reasons to dissuade the board from recommending and implementing significant changes to the Internal Revenue Service. The Secretary and the IRS Commissioner work together. They have to. They work together on a regular basis and will form a powerful team that could prevent real and meaningful changes at the IRS. 
I have seen it in my own business career, where people of knowledge and responsibility who are insiders direct the activities of an objective group of outsiders simply because they have the power and influence of their position. This board should have as its No. 1 goal finding ways to improve services by the Internal Revenue Service to the American taxpayer. If the Treasury Secretary who oversees the IRS is on this board, I fear the interests of the bureaucracy--and I noted my friend from Florida mentioned time and again in his presentation `don't underestimate business as usual'--and the power of the bureaucracy. And, don't kid yourself, it is in the Internal Revenue Service as well. 
So I fear the interests of the bureaucracy and the Government are simply going to be put ahead of the interests of the taxpayers because it has always been that way in the past. It is inherent in the nature of his high position and his large and sophisticated staff that the Secretary of the Treasury will dominate this board and the interests of the taxpayer will not be adequately represented. 
I have the utmost respect and admiration for the Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin. He has done, and is doing, an admirable job as Secretary of the Treasury. I differed with him on the Mexican bailout, but he proved to be right. He has done, and is doing, an admirable job as Secretary of the Treasury. My support for this amendment has nothing to do with Mr. Rubin, in the interests of full disclosure. But it is my concern that the official in charge of Treasury and the IRS operations cannot bring an objective view to oversight of his own operations. I urge the adoption of the Mack amendment. 
Finally, I have been in the business community for 25 years. Many of my colleagues here have not. I can tell you how it works in that kind of environment, where you have insiders with positions of influence, not that they are not well meaning, but it is the very nature of the beast that you lose the objectivity that you are going to have if you have this board set up without considering the implications of the influence of the Secretary of the Treasury. 
I encourage my colleagues to consider the merits of this amendment and act accordingly. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I rise in strong support of this legislation which is going to overhaul the agency that is probably more feared by Americans than any other single agency--the IRS. 
Mr. President, at the Finance Committee hearings that began last September and ended last week, the American public heard some chilling testimony--testimony of an agency that is simply out of control and an agency that is unaccountable. Some say it was designed that way. Well, in a democracy, there is no place for the type of Gestapo tactics that we have seen. We have seen in the hearings and in the testimony that harassment, retribution, and abuse apparently have been condoned in some areas of the IRS for some time. 
Mr. President, when the GAO attempted to audit the IRS last year, it found that the systems the IRS had put in place were designed to ensure that there is no way--no way--for IRS personnel to be held accountable for their erroneous actions. There is no way to determine how many times the Internal Revenue Service has made a mistake in sending out a collection notice, and there is no way to determine how many complaints have been received. In effect, the managers at the IRS set up the system so that no one can trace improper behavior. There are no paper trails, there are no records. 
Mr. President, there is simply no accountability. The lack of accountability and the arrogance among some that pervades the IRS was best summed up last week when Tommy Henderson, a special agent and former group manager of the IRS's Criminal Investigation Division office in Knoxville, testified. He told the committee:  
IRS management does what it wants, to whom it wants, when it wants, how it wants, and with almost complete immunity. Each district director and chief appears to operate from his own little kingdom. 
Well, there are no kingdoms in this country, Mr. President. Anyone at the Internal Revenue Service who thinks he or she is above the law ought to be summarily fired. No one enjoys paying taxes, but no one in this country should fear the agency that is charged with the collection of taxes. Yet, we have learned that frightening taxpayers is certainly a tactic that is often used by the Internal Revenue Service. 
Last week, Robert Edwin Davis, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Tax Division at the Justice Department, told the committee that IRS criminal agents use violent and sometimes fearful tactics against nonviolent taxpayers. He told the committee of a raid by 10 armed IRS agents on the home of a woman at 7:30 in the morning. The 10 armed agents came into her house and searched throughout the house. What were they looking for? Illegal drugs? Firearms? Unreported cash? No. Well, then, why were 10 armed agents searching her home? They were trying to appraise the value of the furnishings in the house because the Internal Revenue Service believed the executor of the woman's deceased grandmother's estate had undervalued the furnishings for estate tax purposes. Can you believe that, Mr. President? 
The person who ordered that armed raid should have been fired. This is America, not Nazi Germany. 
Mr. President, several current IRS employees had the courage to come forward during the hearings held in the Finance Committee. I want to commend Senator Roth for calling those hearings. As a member of that committee, I was deeply moved by the testimony of the witnesses that he and the staff had generated. 
Again, several current IRS employees did have the courage to come forward. They described situations where revenue officers, with management approval, used enforcement to `punish' taxpayers instead of trying to collect the appropriate amount of money for 
the Government. One told the committee that IRS officials browse tax data on potential witnesses in Government tax cases and on the jurors sitting on those Government tax cases. 
We learned last week that one rogue agent, trying to make a reputation for himself, tried to frame a former Republican leader of this body, Senator Howard Baker--at that time, he was a sitting Senator from Tennessee and the majority leader--and when a responsible IRS manager tried to stop the agent, the agency retaliated, not against the agent, but against the manager. 
Those are the types of actual situations the committee focused on. 
Mr. President, lest I be overcritical, I am well aware of the dedicated people in the Internal Revenue Service who are doing an appropriate job in carrying out the duties that they must perform in service to the IRS as well as the country. 
Mr. President, Commissioner Ros-sotti has a tough job. If he is going to change the culture of the IRS, he is going to have to have some new tools and support by the Congress. This bill will give him some of those tools that he needs to get that job done. For example, the bill gives him the authority to fire an IRS employee if he fails to obtain required approval for seizing a taxpayer's home or business asset. Further, an IRS agent will be fired for providing a false statement or destroying documents to conceal mistakes. 
The bill creates an independent board to review and recommend changes to enforcement and collection activities of the IRS. I believe the committee made a mistake in placing the Treasury Secretary and the IRS employee representative on this board, and I am disappointed that the Senate did not remove those two individuals from that board. This should be a board that is made up of people who can act with real independence on behalf of honest taxpayers. It should not represent the interests of the Government or the employees of this agency. 
We have set up a truly independent Taxpayer Advocate to resolve taxpayer disputes with the IRS. This is a much-needed change, since we learned last year that the current Taxpayer Advocate, in reality, faces a conflict of interest because the people who rotate through this office are often called upon to make judgments on the people in the agency who can promote the individual after he rotates out of the advocate's office. 
Now, in the area of computer-generated property seizures, like we had in my State of Alaska, some 800 permanent fund dividend seizure notices that were issued last September should never, ever happen again, because IRS employees are going to have to have signed approvals before attempting to seize property. 
And for the first time, a taxpayer will be able to appeal seizures all the way into Tax Court. 
We've made sure that IRS won't be able to harass the divorced woman for her ex-husband's cheating. I want to express my concern that it appears the Administration does not support the proportional liability provision we've included for innocent spouses. 
Last week, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, Donald Lubick was quoted as saying the Administration cannot support our plan to provide innocent spouse relief. When I read the story about this comment, I asked my staff to obtain a copy of Mr. Lubick's speech but was informed there was no text for the speech. It is my hope that Mr. Lubick was not speaking for the Administration, since according to one study, there are 35,000 innocent women who must contend with attempts by IRS to collect on debts that they are not responsible for. 
In addition, we've added a rule suspending interest and penalties when the IRS does not provide appropriate notice to taxpayers within one year of filing. This ensures that delays by IRS, which can sometimes go on for years, will not benefit IRS by stacking penalties and interest on taxpayers who may have unwittingly made a mistake on their returns. 
Finally, we've changed the burden of proof in cases coming before the Tax Court. This is a long overdue change. When American citizens go into a court, they should be presumed innocent, not guilty until they can prove their innocence. That principle is enshrined in our Constitution and must apply in tax cases as well as any other cases. 
Mr. President, as I said earlier, the culture at the IRS must change. This bill makes very important changes that should give the American public more confidence that if they make a mistake on their tax returns, they will be treated fairly by their government and not subjected to threats and harassment. 
But this bill is just a first step. As I have indicated, there are certain portions with which I am not satisfied. I think it is incumbent on the Finance Committee to hold the agency accountable for implementing what is in this bill. More oversight is needed because it is only through oversight that we can hold this agency accountable to the American public. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
Seeing no other Senator, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will dedicate the Juneau, Alaska Federal building in honor of Hurff Saunders who passed away in 1996. Hurff was a lifelong Alaskan who touched the lives of countless people in Southeast Alaska and played an important role in Alaska's history both as a territory and as a state. 
Among his many accomplishments, Hurff was a federal government civil engineer in charge of the construction of the Juneau federal building. Typical of Hurff's efforts, the Juneau federal building project was completed on time and under budget. In addition, Hurff helped to correct many of the navigational charts for Southeast Alaska thereby assisting the United States Navy and the Coast Guard in safely carrying out their missions in southeast Alaska during World War II. 
I am privileged to have known Hurff and his family quite well. Hurff's wife Florence was one of my teachers as a young boy growing up in Ketchikan. Hurff and Florence were wonderful people, who left a long and lasting impression on those around them. 
Mr. President, I have received copies of a number of resolutions, including one passed by the City and Borough of Juneau, all requesting that the Juneau federal building be dedicated in Hurff's memory. Many other Alaskans who also knew Hurff have taken the time to write and to share their support. 
Hurff was a dedicated public servant who touched the lives of many Alaskans. Naming the Juneau federal building in his honor would be a fitting and lasting tribute to his memory.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the protocols of accession to NATO, specifically for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. NATO expansion is clearly in the security interests of the United States and the NATO alliance as a whole. 
We have an opportunity in the Senate today to make a truly a historic vote that will shatter, once and for all, the artificial division of Europe that occurred at the end of the Second World War. By expanding this alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, we will further erase the Cold War lines of division and broaden the scope of protection of this defensive military alliance which has played the central role in maintaining peace and stability in Europe since the end of World War II. Now, if history is any guide, it ensures and enhances the prospects for peace, prosperity, and harmony throughout Europe. 
It is important to remember that NATO is a defensive, not offensive, strategic military alliance. Although the new member countries were once considered so-called `allies' of the former Soviet Union, their so-called alliance had more to do with the presence of Soviet troops within their countries than any commitment to Soviet values or ideals. Bringing them into the NATO alliance is not a charge against Russia and should not be so construed. To the contrary, we are recognizing that the people of these countries are now our allies. We pledge to come to their defense if they are attacked by a non-member country, and they in turn make the same pledge to support all other NATO countries who may be attacked by a non-member party. 
Mr. President, in the nearly 50 years of its existence, NATO has provided the military security umbrella that has permitted old enemies to heal the wounds of war and to build strong democracies and integrated free economies. Expanding NATO to include the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe will, I hope, produce the same results. That is, stronger and freer economies whose people can live in the same harmony as do the people of France and Germany. 
Communism has collapsed. The Soviet Union is no more. This is not to say, however, that Europe no longer faces any security threats. I think that would be shortsighted. Threats continue to exist in Europe, and many of these threats are more difficult to identify and combat. Ethnic strife in many parts of Eastern Europe; the instability which we face daily with Iraq; terrorism; the list is long. These are all verifiable threats to which the United States and other NATO member countries must be prepared to respond and defend. By adding Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the NATO alliance, we are broadening and strengthening our ability to combat and defend against these threats. 
Mr. President, I would also note that the prospect of NATO enlargement has already begun as seen by the process of harmonization in Central and Eastern Europe. Hungary has settled its border and minority questions with Slovakia and Romania. Poland has reached across an old divide to create joint peacekeeping battalions with Ukraine and Lithuania. 
Without question, an expanded NATO will make the world safer simply because we are expanding the area where wars will not happen. As Secretary of State Albright testified last year before the Foreign Relations Committee, and I quote, `This is the paradox at NATO's heart: By imposing a price on aggression, it deters aggression.' At the same time, we gain new allies, new friends who are committed to our common agenda for security in fighting terrorism and weapons proliferation, and to ensuring stability in places such as the former Yugoslavia. 
There is no doubt in my mind that had Soviet troops not in 1945 occupied Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and installed puppet governments, the debate over whether these three countries should be members of NATO would have long ago been resolved in their favor. 
The people of these countries have yearned for freedom, democracy, and peace for more than 40 years, as evidenced by Poland particularly. The blood in the streets of Budapest in 1956, the demonstrations of the people in Prague in 1968 who confronted Soviet tanks, and the public confrontations of Solidarity throughout Poland beginning in the 1970s all laid the foundation for the collapse of communism, which we have seen in our lifetime. 
Now as they begin to build institutions of democracy and free enterprise, as they move to further integrate their economies with the rest of Europe, they should participate in the collective security of the continent. I think this will bind these countries closer together far into the future and ensure stability and peace throughout the continent. 
Mr. President, there have been expressions of concern by some people that expanding NATO is a mistake because it would somehow be perceived as a threat, a threat to Russia. I find that argument hard to accept. In my opinion, NATO has never been a threat to Russia. Even during the height of the Cold War, no one seriously considered that NATO threatened the Soviet Union. Quite the contrary. NATO stood to defend--defend--against any potential military threat to its members. There is a difference between defense and offense. And NATO is designed for defense. It was never designed as an alliance of aggression--rather, it is an alliance against aggression. 
I think the same holds true today, Mr. President. The people of Russia, who are slowly trying to emerge from the darkness and terror of 70 years of communism, have nothing--I repeat, nothing--to fear from NATO. Our goal is not to isolate Russia; but to engage and support her in her efforts to develop a lasting democracy and a free market. 
The people in the evolving democracies of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have earned the right to become full partners in Europe and full partners in NATO. I hope my colleagues will support the dreams, hopes, and aspirations of these people who have struggled for freedom for so long, after so many decades in which they have lived without hope. They have that opportunity today. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to commend these countries for the rapid progress which they have made nurturing democracy and building stable economic development based on free market principles. While some would argue that they have not evolved far enough, I would simply say that they are light years from where they were when the Berlin Wall fell and that democracy and the free market is an evolving process. They are well on their way; bringing them into the NATO alliance will only serve to help them along. 
The people of these nations have dedicated themselves to these democratic ideals, and it is incumbent upon us to support them in their quest. Mr. President, I strongly support expanding the NATO alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and hope that the Senate speaks loudly and strongly on this issue today.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of S. 660, known as the University of Alaska lands bill. 
Alaska entered the Union in 1959 as the largest State with about 360 million to 365 million acres of land, an area one-fifth the size of the United States. As part of our Statehood Compact, we were to be treated like other States and, from the standpoint of land provided for our land grant education system, namely the University of Alaska, we were to be accorded a reasonable amount of land for our land grant college. 
Today, Alaska ranks 48th out of 50 States in the federal land granted for higher education. We have approximately 112,000 acres. It is important that I put this in perspective, because the State of New Mexico has 1.3 million acres; Oklahoma has 1,050,000 acres; Indiana has 436,000 acres; New York, 990,000 acres. And here sits Alaska, 48th, with 112,000 acres. 
Something is lacking with regard to the issue of equity. We are the only federal land grant college in the country without the federal land. We received less than one-half of the Federal land that was promised. There is only one other State that has less land in its land grant system, and that is the State of Delaware with approximately 90,000 acres. Here is Alaska with 360 million acres receiving 112,000; New Mexico and Oklahoma over 1 million acres. 
This bill I have offered provides the university with land to support itself financially and to continue, obviously, to act as a responsible steward of the land for the education of our greatest resource, our children. 
Specifically, this bill would grant the university 250,000 acres of Federal land within our State. I might add that the Federal Government has approximately two-thirds of the landmass of our State, which is somewhere in the area of 200 million acres. So we are not talking about transferring very much. We are talking about 250,000 acres out of 200 million, or thereabouts. 
In addition to this initial grant, if the State of Alaska chooses to grant the University land, we propose an acre for acre match, up to 250,000 additional federal acres. This option would be solely at the option of the State. 
Again, the bill would provide 250,000 acres to be transferred to the State of Alaska, specifically for its university land grant system, and then if the State provides additional acres, there would be a provision for up to another 250,000 acres of matching Federal land. 
There are areas that the university cannot select land from within the Federal domain. They cannot select land within conservation units; they cannot select land within the LUD II areas designated in the Tongass National Forest. They cannot select land conveyed to the State or Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act Corporation land. They cannot select land with connection to any Federal military institution. 
This legislation also provides for what we think is a legitimate exchange, because the university does hold some rather sensitive land. They have land on the Alaska Peninsula in the Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The university has land in the Kenai Fjords National Park. The university has lands in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and the Denali Park and Preserve. The University would be required to relinquish these lands under this legislation. 
To give you some idea of some of the inholdings the university has, many, many years ago there was a major discovery in Glacier Bay National Park by the Newmont Mining Company, and that was a large nickel reserve. It has never been mined, but it was patented. The patent was turned over to the university. They are willing to give some very sensitive environmental lands back to the Federal Government in exchange for a fulfillment of their federal land grant. 
It is not without equity, Mr. President. I know of no other State that has given lands back to the federal government in exchange for lands given to it for its higher educational system.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and Majority Leader Lott, Senator Baucus, and Senator Campbell, to introduce legislation which would permanently authorize and expand the Medicare and Medicaid direct collections demonstration program under section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. 
This act will end much of the redtape and bureaucracy for IHS facilities involved with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and will mean more Medicaid and Medicare dollars to Native health facilities to use for improving health care. 
Our bill will allow Native hospitals to collect Medicare and Medicaid funds directly from the Health Care Financing Administration instead of having to go through the maze of regulations mandated by HIS. 
This bill is an expansion of a current demonstration project that includes Bristol Bay Health Corporation of Dillingham, Alaska; the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Corporation of Sitka, Alaska; the Mississippi Choctaw Health Center of Philadelphia, Mississippi; and the Choctaw Tribe of Durant, Oklahoma. All of the participants in the demonstration program--as well as the Department of Health and Human Service and the Indian Health Services--report that the program is a great success. In fact, the program has: 
Dramatically increased collections for Medicare and Medicaid services, which in turn has provided badly-needed revenues for Indian and Alaska Native health care; significantly reduced the turn-around time between billing and the receipt of payment for Medicare and Medicaid services; and increased the administrative efficiency of the participating facilities by empowering them to track their own Medicare and Medicaid billings and collections. 
In 1996, when the demonstration program was about to expire, Congress extended it through FY 1998. This extension has allowed the participants to continue their direct billing and collection efforts and has provided Congress with additional time to consider whether to permanently authorize the program. 
Because the demonstration program is again set to expire at the end of FY 98, it is time to recognize the benefits of the demonstration program by enacting legislation that would permanently authorize it and expand it to other eligible tribal participants. 
I hope that my colleagues will support this important legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would alleviate an IRS paperwork hassle that confronts every citizen of Alaska who has a child. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, in introducing this legislation. 
Mr. President, when this nation was facing the oil crisis of the 1970s, Alaskan oil from Prudhoe Bay was in large part responsible for allowing our nation to bridge the oil crisis and overcome the blackmail the world faced from the OPEC cartel. The state of Alaska made a foresighted decision at that time that it would take a portion of the oil royalty money and place it into a trust fund for the benefit of the citizens of our State. 
This trust fund has grown significantly in the past two decades and has allowed the state to issue dividends to every citizen of the state each year. Mothers, fathers and children are all entitled to an equal share of the dividend. Yet when it comes time to file tax returns, every family with a child in Alaska is forced to file a separate tax return for the child based on the fact that the child's only income is the permanent fund dividend. 
Children under 14 must pay income tax it they have investment income of more than $650. If their investment income is greater than $1,400, a special `kiddy tax' is levied that taxes the child's income at the parents' highest tax rate. The kiddy tax was designed for one simple purpose: To prevent high income taxpayers from shifting income to their children for tax avoidance purposes. 
Mr. President, in the case of nearly every child in Alaska, there is no effort for parents to shift income to their children. A two-year old is required to file a tax return simply because the state had the foresight to invest state oil royalty income for the benefit of all it's citizens. 
In recent years, the annual Permanent Fund dividend checks have averaged nearly $1,000 per person. For a two-year old child who received that dividend, the child's parents are responsible for having a tax return prepared for the child that will show a tax liability of $52.50. As all of my colleagues know, filling out tax returns has become ever more complicated. Fewer and fewer individuals are filling out their own returns. Instead, they are having to pay professional prepares to fill out these returns. 
In fact, IRS reports that returns filled out by paid prepares are a record high this year--54% of all returns filed had been prepared by professionals. For an Alaskan family with two children, that means a paid preparer must fill out three separate tax forms--one for the mother and father and one for each of the two children. How much additional cost does the prepare charge for the additional returns? The simplest form to file--the 1040 EZ costs $16.50 at the local H&R block. For two children that's an additional $33, on top of the costs of the parents' return. 
And what does it cost the IRS to process that return? I've heard costs that range from $5 to $30. I don't think anyone knows the real answer. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that families with children under 14 in Alaska are subjected to additional IRS paperwork and filing requirements simply because their children's permanent fund dividends are subject to a few dollars of federal income tax. 
The legislation we are introducing today would exclude from income permanent fund dividends received by children under 14. This will eliminate the paperwork burdens that families in our state face simply because their children receive a dividend from the state. Although I am sure this will be scored as losing a modest amount of revenue, about $50 for every Alaskan child, IRS will have to process far fewer tax returns from Alaska's children and parents in Alaska will not have to incur additional tax preparation fees.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Wednesday is Earth Day--a good time to reflect on our responsibilities to preserve and protect the environment that we will pass on to our children and grandchildren. 
I have six children, and, at last count, eleven grandchildren. I obviously care about the environment they will grow up in. 
I am encouraged by the fact that the air we breathe and the water that flows though America's rivers are far cleaner today than they were on the first Earth Day in 1970. You might not know that is the case if you listen exclusively to the gloom and doom pronouncements of many institutional environmental groups. 
Sometimes, these groups place my name on a list or issue a `report card' on my voting record that might lead one to believe that I do not care about the environment. This is, of course, nonsense. You cannot have eleven grand kids at the center of your life while working to shortchange the environment. 
Having said that, I must join my colleagues in reporting to the Senate that Vice President Gore returned from Kyoto with a climate treaty so fatally flawed that it will never be ratified by the Senate or enter into force. Nor should it. 
While the climate issue must be taken seriously, the Senate would be shirking its constitutional responsibilities if it were to ratify a treaty that is so blatantly unfair, economically burdensome, and of no benefit to the environment. 
The unfairness of the treaty lies mainly in its exclusion of `developing' nations such as China, India, South Korea and Mexico. Emissions from these nations will exceed ours in about 15 years, and their exclusion will only encourage the shift of manufacturing (and resulting emissions) from the nations subject to controls to the nations that are not. Thus, global emissions would not decrease. Since developing nations are less energy-efficient than we are, emissions might even increase. Under the treaty there would be no global environmental gain--but America would suffer economic pain. 
According to the respected economic firm Wharton Econometrics, the Kyoto Treaty would reduce Gross Domestic Product by more than $2,000 per household in 2010--and $30,000 per household between 2001-2020. Moreover, 2.5 million Americans would lose their jobs. Since the climate change problem will one day be addressed through technological innovation fostered in a healthy economic environment, the last thing we want to do is adopt a treaty that would create a national economic decline reminiscent of the oil shocks of the 1970s. 
If we are truly concerned about carbon emissions, we will revitalize nuclear energy and hydropower--our only large-scale, base-load sources of carbon free electricity. Nuclear energy generates 22% of our electricity, and hydropower adds an additional 11%. Solar and wind energy, in comparison, fill one-tenth of one percent of our total energy needs. Although solar and wind energy will grow, the immutable laws of physics limit that growth to just a few percent. Presidential initiatives to place solar panels on a million roofs around the country may have symbolic value, but what is the administration doing to promote nuclear and hydropower--the carbon-free emission sources that can really make a difference? 
Unfortunately, the President opposes the nuclear waste bill that has passed the Senate twice by a wide, bipartisan margin. Any failure to address the nuclear waste issue will result in the premature closure of nuclear power plants, whose capacity will be replaced with carbon-emitting, fossil-fuel plants. 
Bruce Babbitt aspires to be the first Interior Secretary to tear down hydropower dams. Additionally, other dams around the country are endangered by a cumbersome regulatory process that can make it cheaper to tear down the dam and purchase fossil-fuel generated power rather than endure the ordeal of relicensing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
On the international energy front, administration policy is in opposition to China's Three Gorges hydroelectric project--the alternative to which is thirty six new carbon-belching 500 megawatt coal plants. Is this part of a consistent carbon reduction strategy? In an intellectual contortion that defies common sense, Administration energy policy is anti-nuclear and anti-hydropower while professing to be anti-carbon. To appreciate that, one only needs to read the President's Climate Initiative unveiled last October. Nuclear energy isn't even mentioned, and hydropower is explicitly discounted in the document's exclusive discussion of `non-hydro' renewable energy. 
What is the President's answer? The President's strategy is to push the issue off to someone else's watch. The Kyoto Treaty doesn't require carbon reductions until the year 2008. 
Meanwhile, by agreeing to a fatally flawed treaty in Kyoto, the Vice President revealed his own Achilles' heel--he can't say no to any environmental cause, even if it directly harms U.S. interests and jobs here at home. Kyoto has exposed that weakness, and now it is the Senate's Constitutional responsibility to ensure that a bad treaty will never be ratified. 
Ninety-five Senators rarely agree on anything--but they agreed with passage of the Byrd-Hagel resolution that any climate treaty must be globally applied, without harm to our economy. In the case of the Kyoto treaty, the President failed to take our advice--so he cannot expect to receive our consent. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two important pieces of legislation relating to oil and gas production on federal lands. The first is a bill to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide permanent regulatory authority to reduce the royalty rate for stripper oil and gas wells on federal lands. 
This legislation is necessary, Mr. President, because of the depressed world oil price situation. With oil prices falling below $15 per barrel, it is more and more difficult for domestic energy companies to produce oil at a reasonable price. While this is good news to U.S. consumers because gasoline is at its lowest price ever when adjusted for inflation, it is not welcome news to small and independent oil and gas producers who will be especially hard hit. 
Under `normal' circumstances, stripper wells are on the edge of profitability. Low world oil prices threaten stripper wells and the jobs associated with those wells. That, in turn, has ripple effects elsewhere in the economy through loss of jobs in the industries that supply goods and services to producers, and in the communities where they operate. 
Mr. President, according to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, there are approximately 430,000 stripper oil wells and 170,000 stripper gas wells in the U.S. A sizeable number of these, perhaps as many as 30,000, are on federal lands. 
What is absolutely astounding, Mr. President, is the fact that stripper wells individually average a little more than 2 barrels of oil and 16 thousand cubic feet of gas production per day, yet in 1996 collectively contributed 352 million barrels of oil (more than 11 percent of U.S. production, and 5 percent of U.S. consumption), and almost 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
There are 38,000 jobs associated with stripper wells, and another 46,000 outside of the industry related to stripper wells. We cannot afford to lose stripper well production and the vital role they play in national energy security. Nor can we afford to lose the jobs associated with them. That is why I am introducing today the Federal Oil and Gas Stripper Well Preservation Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Nickles and Senator Hutchison in sponsoring this important legislation. 
Mr. President, our bill is very simple: it authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide permanent regulatory authority to reduce the royalty rate for stripper oil and gas wells on federal lands. The Secretary already has limited authority to grant stripper oil well royalty reductions. We want to ensure that there is permanent authority to do so. 
We also want to make sure that the Secretary has permanent authority to grant royalty rate reductions for stripper gas wells, something that the Secretary recently has declined to do. 
Second, our bill requires the Secretary to suspend any minimum royalty (if applicable) and per acre lease rental on stripper oil and gas wells on federal lands during the time of any royalty rate reduction. This will ensure that stripper well operators are afforded the greatest leeway during hard times. 
And finally, our bill requires the applicable lease rental and minimum royalty to be reinstated once the Secretary terminates a stripper well royalty rate reduction. 
Mr. President, I believe this legislation will make a significant contribution in stemming the tide of lost production from our Nation's stripper oil and gas wells. Once plugged and abandoned, these wells--and their vital contribution to national energy security--are more likely than not permanently lost. We should not lose this valuable national asset. 
I invite my colleagues to join Senator Nickles, Senator Hutchison and me in sponsoring the Federal Oil and Gas Stripper Well Preservation Act of 1998.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let's be sure we understand each other. The budget resolution before us already provides a $2.5 billion increase for the IDEA program, that is, individuals with disabilities, and it does so without raising taxes and creating a new entitlement program. The Senator from Arkansas is aware of that. When you strip away all the rhetoric, the issue boils down to the basic question of whether this Senate wants to go on record to support a nearly $311 million tax increase on the domestic mining industry. 
Retention of the depletion allowance, for those who do not understand it--and there are a few--is important to the health of the domestic mining industry because it recognizes the nature, the uniqueness of the mineral industry as an extraction industry by providing a realistic method of measuring the decreasing value of a mineral deposit which declines when you take it out, while generating the necessary capital to build a replacement project, so we can have employment. Metal prices are down, as has been evidenced. Gold has dropped from over $400 an ounce to $300 an ounce, the lowest price in 18 years. 
On a daily basis, newspapers throughout the West announce further mine closures. 
The Senator from Arkansas wants to tax the industry now. Lost jobs, lost futures. I ask my colleagues if they really believe this country has lost its hunger for raw materials, or do we simply want to send the industry overseas, import our 
minerals from overseas? If you do not think increased costs of operation such as proposed by the amendment by Senator Bumpers pose a real threat to the domestic mining industry and local economies, ask the people of Lead, SD. `Homestate Mining just laid off 466 workers at the Lead mine due to increased costs of operations and diminished gold prices.' 
This is not the time to be launching punitive action against an industry that contributes over $130 million annually to the American economy. We have a bill in my committee to accomplish comprehensive mining reform. The Senator from Arkansas is aware of that. I will be holding hearings on comprehensive reform on April 28. That is the place, in the hearing room, and the time to go about reforming mining law, not in a 10-minute debate on the floor of the Senate during consideration of the budget. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me and defeat Senator Bumpers' amendment. 
One more time. Do not be fooled. This budget resolution already provides a $2.5 billion increase for the IDEA program without raising taxes and creating a new entitlement program. So I encourage my colleagues to recognize what this is. It is a $311 million tax on our mining industry that is going to cause a job loss, and we are going to be more dependent on imported minerals.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today is National Breast Cancer Survivors Day and I want to take this opportunity to focus my colleague's attention on the importance of continued research and early detection efforts for this tragic disease. 
Mr. President, one out of nine American women will suffer the tragedy of breast cancer. It is today the leading cause of death for women between the ages of 35 to 54. 
Alaskan women are particularly vulnerable to this disease. We have the second highest rate of breast cancer in the Nation. One in 7 Alaska women will get breast cancer and tragically it is the Number One cause of death among Native Alaskan women. 
Mr. President, these tragic Alaska deaths are not inevitable. Health experts agree that the best hope for lowering the death rate is early detection and treatment. It is estimated that breast cancer deaths can be reduced by 30 percent if all women avail themselves of regular clinical breast examination and mammography. 
But for many Alaska women, especially native women living in one of our 230 remote villages, regular screening and early detection are often hopeless dreams. 
For more than 20 years, my wife Nancy has recognized this problem and tried to do something about it. In 1974, she and a group of Fairbanks' women created the Breast Cancer Detection Center, for the purpose of offering mammographies to women in remote areas of Alaska--regardless of a woman's ability to pay. 
Now, the Center uses a small portable mammography unit which can be flown to remote areas of Alaska, offering women in the most rural of areas easy access to mammographies at no cost. Additionally, the Center uses a 43-foot long, 14 foot high and 26,000 pound mobile mammography van to travel through rural areas of Alaska. The van makes regular trips, usually by river barge, to remote areas in Interior Alaska such as Tanana. 
Julie Roberts, a 42-year-old woman of Tanana, who receives regular mammographies from the mobile mammography van, knows the importance of early screening: 
There's a lot of cancer here (in Tanana)--a lot of cancer. That's why it's important to have the mobile van here . . . I know that if I get checked, I can catch it early and can probably save my life. I have three children and I want to see my grandchildren. 
I am proud to say that the Fairbanks Center now serves about 2,200 women a year and has provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska women in 81 villages throughout the state. To help fund the efforts of the Fairbanks Center, each year Nancy and I sponsor a fishing tournament to raise money for the operation of the van and mobile mammography unit. After just three years, donations from the tournament have totalled $830,000. 
Mr. President, Nancy and I are committed to raising more funds for this important program so that every woman in Alaska can benefit from the advances of modern technology and reduce their risk of facing this killer disease. 
Mr. President on this day that we recognize survivors of breast cancer, I want take a moment to discuss legislation that I am cosponsoring with Senator D'Amato to end the practices of so-called `drive-through' mastectomies. 
In too many cases women who survive the trauma of a mastectomy are being forced to get out of the hospital only hours after their surgery. How can medical care professionals allow this? Simply because many insurance companies demand that the procedure of a mastectomy be considered an out-patient service.' 
Here's the horror that many insurance companies cause: 
Nancy Couchot, a 60 year old woman had a radical mastectomy at 11:30 a.m. She was released from the hospital five hours-- 
even though she was not able to walk or use the rest room without assistance. 
Victoria Berck, had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. 7 hours late. She was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. Ms. Berck concludes, `No civilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an out-patient service.' 
Mr. President that is why I am proud to co-sponsor the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997, which would put an end to the drive-through mastectomies. 
Specifically, the Act will require health insurance companies to allow physicians to determine the length of a mastectomy patient's hospital stay according to medical necessity. In other words, the bill makes it illegal to punish a doctor for following good medical judgment and sound medical treatment. 
Another important provision of this bill ensures that mastectomy patients will have access to reconstructive surgery. Scores of women have been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure to be cosmetic' and, therefore, not medically necessary. 
Mr. President, far too often breast cancer victims, who believe that they have adequate health care coverage, are horrified when they learn that reconstruction is not covered in their health plan. 
In Alaska, of the 324 mastectomies and lumpectomies performed in 1996, reconstruction only occurred on 11 of the patients. That means that only 3.4% of women who have their breast removed have reconstructive surgery, compared to the national average of 23%. 
Mr. President, the simple reason for this tragically low figure is simple: women can't afford the procedure. 
Breast reconstruction costs average about $5,000 for just the procedure. If hospital, physician and other costs are included--the costs escalate to around $15,000. 
Dr. Sarah Troxel, of Providence hospital, the only doctor in the Mat-Su Valley who does breast reconstruction, states the importance of reconstruction:  
Women who are unable to receive reconstructive surgery, suffer from depression, a sense of loss, and need more cancer survivor counseling . . . Additionally reconstructive surgery can be preventative medicine--women who don't have reconstructive surgery often develop other medical problems or complications with their spine. 
Mr. President, these issues are not partisan issues. We may have our differences regarding managing and financing health reform, but I think we all endorse accessible and affordable health care that preserves patient choice and physician discretion. Cancer does not look to see the politics of its victims. 
It is my hope that we will adopt this legislation this year.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this past New Year rang in a harsh reality for senior citizens of America: As of January 1, 1998, senior citizens, for all practical purposes, have been stripped of a health care right afforded to any other insured American--the right to pay out-of-pocket for the doctor of their choice. 
I am outraged over this provision--a provision that was added into the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 in the twelfth hour of negotiations between the White House and Congress. 
The provision prohibits doctors who privately contract from treating Medicare patients for a period of two years. Therefore, it is now unlawful for a doctor to take a private payment from a Medicare-eligible patient if during the previous two years he has billed Medicare for any service rendered to a patient over the age of 65. 
What is the reality of the provision? The reality is that it will be almost impossible for a senior citizen to contract privately for medical services because few or no physicians are going to be able to make ends meet if they can't accept Medicare patients for two years. The reality is that, unlike every other insured American, senior citizens have now lost a significant right--a right of choice in who provides their health care. 
Currently seniors are being prohibited from going outside of the Medicare system for procedures that are not covered by Medicare. For example, if a senior fell and broke his hip, Medicare only reimburses for the lowest-cost hip prosthesis. Since seniors cannot pay extra to upgrade, they must settle for lower quality. (Private contracting would enable them to opt for quality.) 
Why is the federal government making that decision for seniors? If a 75-year-old women in Fairbanks, Alaska, fell and broke her hip, do you think that the government is competent enough to decide what hip prosthesis is best for her to gain the best mobility for the rough weather conditions of Fairbanks? 
Last week I turned 65 years old. The week before--when I was still 64 years old--I could choose any doctor I wanted and pay for that doctor in any manner I wanted. But now I'm 65, and the federal government is suddenly telling me I can't make my own medical decisions--that I no longer may enter into a private contract with my doctor. 
Mr. President, I ask you, isn't this a form of age discrimination against seniors? How can the Health Care Financing Administration restrict such a fundamental liberty--the freedom to choose the care and quality of health providers? 
The need for a senior citizen to be able to privately contract is magnified in Alaska. Alaska has no HMOs, physician shortages exist in two-thirds of the state and health care costs that are on average 70 percent higher than the rest of the country. 
All these factors combine to create a system where doctors can't afford to treat Medicare patients--which means that patient choice for Alaskan seniors is extremely limited. I've received letters from Alaskans who have been turned down by three or four physicians--because the doctors cannot afford new Medicare patients. 
I am pleased with Senator Kyl's sense of Congress--I believe it is an important stand for Congress to make. The body must do all it can to ensure that Medicare-eligible beneficiaries who choose to pay out of pocket will have an unrestricted right to health care. 
Mr. President, even in the socialized medical system of Great Britain, choice is offered to the elderly. In Great Britain, a senior citizen has the choice to pay privately for his or her medical services. Don't the elderly of America deserve that same choice?

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, recently some of my colleagues on the Energy Committee and I traveled to Venezuela to tour some of the oil and gas operations run by the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), and to learn more about the U.S.-Venezuela relationship on energy matters. Not many weeks prior to our trip, I had traveled to Venezuela for the first time to attend and address the Hemispheric Energy Conference in Caracas, which was co-chaired by Energy Secretary Federico Pena. 
As Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I believe my colleagues should know the important role Venezuela plays in U.S. and hemispheric energy security. And, as a Senator strongly committed to preserving and strengthening the U.S. oil and gas industry, I believe it is essential that we understand to the fullest extent possible the relationships between our countries and energy industries, and how we stand in relation to the rest of the world. I think it is safe to say, Mr. President, that very few people in our country appreciate Venezuela's importance in the global energy picture. 
Our visit to Venezuela was particularly timely in light of the recent drop in world oil prices and the agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC members to curtail production to halt the downward fall in prices. Venezuela is a member of OPEC, and is a country others are looking to for cooperation in scaling down production. 
What my colleagues and I learned about Venezuela's energy industry from our brief visit, Mr. President, is very impressive. I want to share some of the information we gathered with the rest of our colleagues in the Senate. 
The United States and Venezuela have a long history of cooperation on energy matters. Venezuela has continuously provided oil to the U.S. for more than 70 years. During World War II, the Korean War, the conflict in Vietnam, and more recently the oil embargos and Persian Gulf War, Venezuela has been a stable and reliable source of oil for the United States. The U.S. presently imports just under 1.5 million barrels of oil a day from Venezuela, making Venezuela the largest supplier of crude. Venezuela, Mexico and Canada are the leaders in the Western Hemisphere in supplying oil to the U.S., which imports 52 percent of its daily production from that region. 
Because of the proximity of our two countries, and certain synergies in our energy industries, the U.S. and Venezuela now enjoy a robust energy relationship that is triggering economic development and opening new trade and investment opportunities in both countries. To date, Venezuela's oil company has invested $2 billion in the U.S., and is importing hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. goods and services used for energy production in Venezuela. A new bilateral investment protection treaty presently being negotiated between the two countries will afford U.S. investors greater safeguards in such important areas as capital transfers, international arbitration, intellectual property rights and others, and will put U.S. investors on an even playing field with investors from other countries. 
Venezuela has 75 billion barrels of proven conventional crude oil reserves, ranking fifth-largest in the world and first outside of the Middle East. By comparison, U.S. crude oil reserves are three times smaller. In Venezuela's Orinoco Belt, which we visited, there are 1.2 trillion barrels of extra-heavy oil in place. Using a conservative rate of recovery of 20 to 25 percent at today's technology, it is estimated that 270 to 320 billion barrels of this resource could be recovered and used as a boiler fuel. In addition, Venezuela has 146 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, which rank seventh-largest in the world. The U.S. is sixth in the world with 165 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves. 
Mr. President, Venezuela is prepared to share its abundant oil resources with the rest of the world, and is implementing plans to almost double oil production from 3.7 to 6.5 million barrels per day by the year 2007. In order to do so, PDVSA plans to invest $65 billion in the next 10 years, $37 billion of which will come from its own revenue stream. $18 billion will come from PDVSA's foreign partners, and $10 billion will come from strategic alliances with foreign firms. Of the $65 billion total investment, PDVSA plans to invest $1.5 billion in the U.S. 
To expand production and improve operating efficiency, PDVSA has undertaken several rounds of `oil openings,' a process in which participation of companies operating around the world is solicited in an open bidding process. In the first round of bidding, ten light- and medium-crude fields were opened to foreign investment. Eight of the ten successful bidders were companies operating in the U.S: Amoco, BP America, Benton Oil and Gas Company, Dupont Conoco, Enron Oil and Gas Company, Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, Maxus Energy Corp., and Mobil Corp. 
PDVSA is involved in five joint ventures with U.S. companies to open Venezuela's extensive heavy oil reserves in the eastern Orinoco Belt and the western Boscan field. Those companies are Arco, Chevron, Conoco, Mobil and Total, N.A. 
In addition, PDVSA has issued more than a dozen contracts to companies to develop marginal and inactive oil fields that contain approximately 2 billion barrels of light and medium crude oil. Those companies include Amoco, Benton Oil and Gas Co., Chevron, Mosbacher Energy Company, Occidental, Pennzoil, Total, and Shell. 
Similar opportunities for investment in Venezuelan joint ventures lie ahead for U.S. companies. 
Mr. President, the harsh reality is that the U.S. will import greater and greater amounts of oil to meet its domestic energy needs in the coming decades, notwithstanding our efforts to maintain a viable domestic oil and gas industry. Presently, the U.S. is importing about 54 percent of its daily crude oil needs, and that level is expected to exceed 60 percent in a few short years. 
I believe U.S. government policies should favor reasonable oil and gas exploration and production efforts, fair royalty and tax treatment, and balanced environmental and conservation measures so that we can produce our own energy for our growing economy. Unfortunately, the Administration does not have those goals in mind, and does not see the importance of setting a national energy policy. 
In my State of Alaska, we have potentially large untapped crude oil reserves in the ANWR and on the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf. The Administration does not support environmentally responsible exploration of ANWR, however. Elsewhere in the lower 48 states, the Administration is frustrating exploration and production activities on federal lands by removing promising acreage from inventory of lands accessible for exploration purposes, and is making more difficult the job of producing energy by imposing onerous economic and regulatory requirements. 
Now, at a time when world oil prices are plummeting to record lows, it will be more and more difficult for American companies to produce oil at a reasonable price. While this is good news to the people of the U.S. because gasoline is at its lowest price ever when adjusted for inflation, it is not welcome news to small and independent oil and gas producers who will be especially hard hit, or to the larger energy producing companies. 
It stands to reason, Mr. President, that the U.S. economy and industrial sector will benefit during times of low energy prices. The bad news is that there is a down-side to lower energy prices, and one that few people fully appreciate. When world oil prices fall below a certain level, as they have recently, the U.S. stands to lose production from stripper wells and marginally economic wells, along with the jobs associated with those wells. That, in turn, has ripple effects elsewhere in the economy through loss of jobs in the industries that supply goods and services to producers, and in the communities where they operate. 
While we can take comfort in knowing that Venezuela is prepared to meet our oil import needs now and in the future, Mr. President, our trip served to bring more clearly into focus the U.S. energy situation and the need for policies and programs to preserve domestic production so that the current price situation does not cause permanent loss of jobs and domestic oil and gas reserves. 
I intend to take important steps in the coming weeks to address the U.S. energy situation, Mr. President.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my purpose in seeking time this morning is to communicate to the other Members of a grievous trespass occurring on public lands, a trespass that would certainly not be allowed in the State of Minnesota or in my State of Alaska. 
Today we have a significant standoff in the southern California desert between the Federal Government and trespassers at the Ward Valley site. For several years, the State of California and Governor Wilson have sought to purchase from the Federal Government the 1,000-acre Ward Valley site in southern California out in the Mojave Desert, a pretty inhospitable area. Large transmission lines go over the property. You can hear the buzz of the electrical energy going through those wires. And it has been determined to be a suitable site for low-level waste. 
California wants to build a low-level waste disposal facility on this Federal property which is located in a federally designated utility corridor, as I have indicated, with the power lines going over it. It is close to an interstate highway. The State of California has proposed to purchase this land from the Department of the Interior. It is appropriate to reflect that this waste has to go somewhere. Nobody wants waste, either high- or low-level, but we have to acknowledge the merits of the technologies that produce the waste. They improve our health. Because most of this waste is biotech, used for the treatment of cancer and other medical uses, x ray and radiological type of medical treatments that we all receive. It lengthens our lives and eases our misery. 
Currently this waste is located at just the State of California, over 800 temporary sites throughout the State. Many of these locations are in urban areas, near universities, communities, clinics. 
It has been determined that Ward Valley would be an appropriate disposal facility. The State of California, as well as other States, has been given the authority under certain terms and conditions to basically provide long-term waste storage, assuming that the Federal and State criteria are met. In this case Ward Valley has met the State of California criteria, yet the Department of the Interior refuses to support the selection of this site and move with the land purchase. We have had is a decade of environmental tests. I guess we are stuck with decades and a confirmation by the National Academy of Science--the last word, if you will, in science--that this property is suitable for low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. 
It is either this property or leave it where it is, 800 sites throughout California, on the way to schools, churches, shopping centers; facilities that have never been designed to hold this waste. However, the Interior Department still is not satisfied with the tests that have taken place. It is not satisfied with the report from the National Academy of Sciences. 
In February of 1996, the Interior Department announced it had planned on conducting additional environmental tests at Ward Valley. Let's do some more tests. These tests were finally scheduled to begin last month, 2 years after the original announcement. That is how long it takes, and I am not sure it is over yet. The tests still have not begun. They have not begun now because protesters at the site have refused to move off the site. 
These are protesters, trespassers on Federal land. Last month, the California State Office of the Bureau of Land Management ordered the protesters at the Ward Valley site to relocate by February 18 so the tests could begin. The protesters have been occupying the property for the last couple of years under a land use permit, issued by the BLM. I did not know this, but you can evidently get a land use permit to initiate civil disobedience. 
These protesters are already in violation of their original land use permit. They have refused to comply with the February 18 deadline. Incredibly, the protesters, who are clearly trespassing on Federal land, are still there today. February 18 has come and gone. Federal rangers made no effort to evict them 
from the property. In fact, on February 25 all Federal rangers were withdrawn from the property. The question is, why? 
Even more incredibly, over the past 6 weeks the trespassers have now taken control of the property. They now, the trespassers, mind you, refuse to allow the BLM employees access to the property to initiate the testing. The protesters have also refused to allow the U.S. Ecology, the State's licensee who is going to do the test, access to the property for environmental monitoring and refueling of its generators. When the BLM and the U.S. Ecology employees have been allowed to enter the property, they have been frisked by the protesters and all vehicles have been searched by the protesters' so-called security forces. 
Isn't that a turnaround? This is Federal property. The trespassers have taken it over and are dictating the terms and conditions by which the Federal agencies can have access to their own property. Where in the world is the Secretary of the Interior? Where in the world is the Attorney General? As chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I am extremely disappointed with how the Department of the Interior has handled this entire matter. The Department of the Interior is allowing persons who are in clear violation of the law to not only occupy Federal land but also control the Federal land by determining whether or not tests can occur. Even more incredible, the Department is allowing the trespassers, who are now outfitted with knives, cans of Mace and handcuffs, to dictate the terms and conditions under which the Federal employees have access to the Federal lands. What message does this send to our Federal employees? What message does it send to our citizens? 
The Department of the Interior says they are in negotiation with the trespassers, who include representatives of environmental groups and Indian tribes. However, there should be no room for negotiation with trespassers. They are just holding the Federal government hostage. The trespassers say that they will not leave Ward Valley until the Department of the Interior promises that no testing will occur and the property will not be transferred to the State of California. So they are saying, in effect, it cannot be used. 
The Federal government has spent tens of millions of dollars, to date, on Ward Valley. The State of California has spent tens of millions of dollars. California's licensee alone has spent about $80 million in preparation for their license to build the facility. Yet, protesters are dictating the terms and solutions. With such an absolute position, well, there doesn't appear to be much room for negotiation. 
I have asked the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt, to inform me and advise me how he intends to deal with the trespassers on the Department of the Interior land and how he intends to deal with them on other Federal lands he controls. I also want to know what the Department intends to do if the standoff continues. Does the Department intend to allow our public land to be controlled by trespassers? This is an unacceptable and dangerous precedent. 
I have also written the Attorney General, Janet Reno. As this Nation's chief law enforcement officer, I want to know how she plans to handle the trespassing at Ward Valley. Does she condone this illegal activity? Is she prepared to enforce Federal law? Will she fully and faithfully prosecute those trespassers? I hope this standoff can be peacefully resolved, but it needs to be resolved now--now, rather than later. It has already been 6 weeks in the making.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, first let me say in response to the recent statement by my good friend from Massachusetts about the degree of compassion associated with the Republican Members of the Senate that I disagree. I am sure that the Budget Committee and its able chairman, Senator Domenici, will respond in detail to the generalizations that have been expressed by my friend from Massachusetts. But let me just make one specific point. 
We have heard that the Republicans and the Republican budget do not invest enough in education; that they have not adopted the two key plans of the President's budget: $5 billion for school construction, and $7.3 billion to hire 100,000 more teachers over the next 5 years. 
The facts show that, indeed, the Republicans have kept their word. We have increased education spending by exactly what the President and the Congress agreed to do last year in the balanced budget agreement. We have provided $8 billion in additional discretionary education funding over the 5-year period, and in total we will provide close to $20 billion in kindergarten-through-grade 12 education funding this year. That is a 98-percent increase over the last 10 years. 
I would not take criticism relative to the Republicans' commitment to education. It supports exactly what the President has asked for. Again, that is $20 billion for kindergarten through grade 12 education funding and a 98-percent increase over the last 10 years. 
I am sure others on the Budget Committee will address other generalizations in more detail.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on March 24, 1998, I joined Senators Sarbanes and Murray in a bipartisan effort to correct a policy that is a disservice to our veterans. The issue we are addressing is the failure of the military to provide appropriate representation at a veteran's funeral in a military cemetery. To remedy this failure, we have introduced the `Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998' that corrects this failure. 
Currently, the Department of Defense allows commanders in the field to decide what level of military representation there will be at the funeral of a veteran. It is becoming a common practice for the military to send a single representative to provide the mourning family with the American flag along with an audio tape recording of Taps. 
Mr. President, I find it astounding that families mourning the loss of a veteran would be expected to bring a boom box to a funeral in order that a tape of Taps can be played. Is this the way the military thinks it is appropriate to honor the memory of a serviceman or woman who has served their country honorably? For the sacrifice that veterans have made, DoD can only respond with a single person and a tape recording. This is a slap in the face of the honor of all who have served. 
Mr. President, because I believe veterans deserve more, I have worked with my colleagues Senator Murray and Senator Sarbanes to set a minimum level of effort by the military for veteran funerals. 
As a former Chairman and member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I know that it is impossible to completely repay our debt to our veterans. However, I believe Congress can find ways to show our gratitude and respect. 
On Tuesday, we introduced legislation that requires at least a five person honor guard for veteran burials upon request. DoD, if it chooses, can send a larger contingent, but the five person honor guard will be minimum representation. And the legislation requires that one of the five representatives plays Taps--not a tape recording! 
This legislation will also allow National Guard and Reserves to perform this duty, thus increasing the resources available to DoD for this duty. Serving in the honor guard will not count as a period of drill or training. I believe this is necessary to preserve the readiness of the Guard and Reserves, who are playing a larger role in our downsized military. 
Mr. President, I know when I have seen funerals with a military honor guard, I walk away humbled. When we pay our respects for those who have served, it is the little things that make the difference. Five men or women participating in the service not only gives a final honor to the veteran but also recognizes the sacrifice the veteran and the family have made. 
I hope that my colleagues will join us in cosponsoring the `Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998.' A veteran should be remembered for their service and sacrifice. There is no better way to remind everyone of this, than with a military honor guard. It is the least that we can do to show our respects and gratitude for our veterans.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, the amendment before the body that I have proposed addresses a genuine emergency. Indeed, it belongs on the supplemental appropriations bill, and, as a consequence of its emergency status, no offset is needed. 
The amendment allows the President to stop the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that was ordered in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill. 
Perhaps a little history is in order. Some of us in this body and this Nation remember that in 1973-1974 we had an energy crisis. The oil embargo from the Arab world resulted in a shortage. There were lines blocks long in front of gas stations, and the American public was indignant that their oil supply should be interrupted. They had not seen such a curtailment since gas rationing in the Second World War. But it was very real. 
I find it rather disquieting that many people today do not remember what I am talking about and the fact that this occurred. But there was great concern in this body in 1973 and 1974 as a consequence of that outcry from the public over the shortage of gasoline. So Congress wisely created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is located in Texas and Louisiana in salt caverns, and the idea was that we would never be held in a position where we could be, in effect, a hostage to our increased dependence on imported oil. The important thing to note is that at the time we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we were about 37 percent dependent on imported oil. The idea was to have a 90-day supply at all times. The oil could be lifted in case of national emergency. At one time, we had a 118-day supply. 
The irony associated with this amendment today is that we are now selling oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the purpose of generating a cash-flow sufficient to manage and run the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is estimated to cost $207 million in 1998. 
The irony is that, today we are 52 percent dependent on imported oil. So if there was any logic at all to the decision back in 1975 to create the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because we were 37 percent dependent, it is completely illogical that today we are selling it when we are 52 percent dependent on imported oil. This suggests the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, which is not necessarily uncommon around here. 
In the 1998 Interior appropriations bill, the order is for the sale of $207 million worth of oil from the SPR. 
I think this is where the bear goes through the buckwheat. We are selling this oil at $9 to $12 a barrel, and we paid $33 a barrel for it when we put it in. We would have to sell 23.1 million barrels of oil, that we paid an average of $33 a barrel for, for somewhere around $9, $10, $11, $12. It is poor-quality oil. That is how we are going to raise the $207 million to pay for the operation of the SPR. 
Again, the oil cost $33 a barrel. The American taxpayer is going to lose $550 million on this deal. This is an emergency because we are about to lose a half a billion dollars of taxpayer money. Buying high and selling low certainly never made sense to me, but there is an old joke out there about the guy who is buying high and selling low and claims he is going to make it up in the volume. 
Maybe that is the logic here; I don't know. But if this sale from the SPR goes through, these sales will have cost the American taxpayer, over 3 past years, roughly $1 billion, because we have been selling the oil at a price that is substantially lower than what we paid for it. 
As we look at where we are on this issue, I think we have to recognize a couple of pertinent points. 
The Secretary of Energy indicated in an Associated Press article that this is the worst time to be selling oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He says that the Congress has given 
him no choice. This is unfortunate, because I have fought, and my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have fought, to ensure that we discontinue selling oil out of that Strategic Petroleum Reserve, particularly at a price that is substantially lower than we paid for it. 
The Secretary says that Congress has given him no choice. Today, we have a choice. We can choose to pay over a half a billion dollars for the privilege of throwing away some of our energy security, or we can save the taxpayer half a billion dollars and have this valuable resource when we need it the most. 
Again, we are 52 percent dependent on imported oil. Some may argue we should require an offset to the amendment. But let me make it clear again, this amendment saves the American taxpayer money. The American taxpayer understands clearly, if you bought it at $33, you don't sell it at $9. Selling $33-a-barrel oil for $9 and calling it income is a budget gimmick, make no mistake about it, and the taxpayer does not understand those kinds of gimmicks. 
Further, we are not offsetting funds for Bosnia because of its supposed national security importance. The importance of the SPR is significant to our national security. It could not be more clear. The health of our economy and the ability to defend ourselves is significant. 
Furthermore, we should look back at a couple of significant events in the history of this matter. Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, my good friend on the committee, and I, cosponsored a successful amendment to stop the sale on the Interior Appropriations bill. It was dropped in conference. Why? Well, a lot of things are dropped in conference. 
Selling oil from the SPR is a budget gimmick that, again, costs the taxpayer real money. Stopping the sale will save the taxpayer over half a billion dollars and our Nation's energy insurance policy. This is an emergency, and it should be part of the emergency supplemental. 
Let me conclude by saying Webster defines an `emergency' as a sudden, unexpected occurrence demanding immediate action. This amendment certainly addresses such an issue, and I think the amendment certainly qualifies for the Emergency Supplemental. 
Again, the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill orders the sale of $207 million worth of oil from the SPR to operate the SPR. As a consequence, that would cost the American taxpayer roughly $500 million, because we are proposing to sell that oil at $9 to $12 a barrel, when we paid in excess of $33 a barrel for the oil. That is the issue, Mr. President. 
I hope the managers of the bill will consider this on the merits of what it would save the American taxpayer. If anybody can explain the extraordinary accounting mechanism that would justify this as a good deal for the American taxpayer, the Senator from Alaska would certainly like to hear it. 
I thank the Chair and urge the floor managers to consider the merits of this amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S.J. Res. 42, a resolution to disapprove the President's certification that Mexico is fully cooperating in the War on Drugs. 
Last year, the Administration convinced Congress not to vote on a similar resolution, arguing that voting on such a resolution would hinder cooperative efforts with Mexico. So here we are, one year later, and the situation in Mexico is the same, if not worse than it was last year. 
Just today, a front page New York Times story cites a Drug Enforcement Administration report that indicates that the Mexican military is helping drug traffickers. As one anonymous official observed, if the indications of wider military involvement with traffickers are borne out, `it points to much of our work in Mexico being an exercise in futility.' 
Mr. President, I have not seen this report so I can't say how accurate this story is, but it does raise the same concerns I had last year about the level of corruption in Mexico. 
Last year, I joined 38 of my colleagues in signing a letter initiated by Senators Coverdell and Feinstein, the sponsors of today's resolution, calling on the President not to certify that Mexico was cooperating fully in anti-narcotics efforts. That letter went through in detail 6 examples of where Mexico was unable or unwilling to deal with drug trafficking problems effectively. Those areas were: cartels; money laundering; law enforcement, cooperation with U.S. law enforcement; extraditions; and, corruption. 
Based on the information I have received, it does not appear that the situation is improved in any of these 6 areas: Mexican cartels continue to expand their ties, operations, and violence in the U.S.; anti-money-laundering legislation is on the books, but is not being enforced; concerns about the safety of DEA agents in Mexico remain unresolved; the much-touted cooperative Bilateral Task Forces are not operational; no Mexican nationals whatsoever have been extradited to the U.S. on drug-related charges; and corruption remains chronic at every level in the military, the police and the government. 
Therefore, I think the President made the wrong choice to simply say that Mexico was `fully cooperating' in efforts to combat international narcotics trafficking. 
Mr. President, I do not make this decision lightly. Mexico is an important neighbor and we share a 1600 mile border. I do not want to cut off our relations with Mexico over this issue, but I also think we make a mockery of our law by simply glossing over issues to make a certification. 
I believe we would be better off if the President would say that Mexico is not fully cooperating, but then exercise his authority to waive the restrictions on bilateral assistance on national security grounds, as he did with Colombia this year. 
Unfortunately, the President did not choose that path, and we in Congress are left with only one option--a straight up or down vote on decertifying Mexico. Although it is not a perfect solution, I will vote for telling the truth to Mexico. She can and must do better to combat the nagging problem plaguing our borders.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the protocols of accession to NATO, specifically for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
I think this is truly a historic decision in the sense that it shatters once and for all the artificial division of Europe that occurred at the end of the Second World War. Now, if history is any guide, it ensures and enhances the prospects for peace, prosperity, and harmony throughout Europe. 
Mr. President, in the nearly 50 years of its existence, NATO has provided the military security umbrella that has permitted old enemies to heal the wounds of war and to build strong democracies and integrated free economies. Expanding NATO to include the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe will, I hope, produce the same results, that is, stronger and freer economies whose people can live in the same harmony as do the people of France and Germany. 
I would also note that the prospect of NATO enlargement has already begun as seen by the process of harmonization in Central and Eastern Europe. Hungary has settled its border and minority questions with Slovakia and Romania. Poland has reached across an old divide to create joint peacekeeping battalions with Ukraine and Lithuania. 
Mr. President, an expanded NATO will make the world safer simply because we are expanding the area where wars will not happen. As Secretary of State Albright testified last year before the Foreign Relations Committee, and I quote, `This is the product paradox at NATO's heart: By imposing a price on aggression, it deters aggression.' At the same time, we gain new allies, new friends who are committed to our common agenda for security in fighting terrorism and weapons proliferation, and to ensuring stability in places such as the former Yugoslavia. 
There is no doubt in my mind that had Soviet troops not in 1945 occupied Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and installed puppet governments, the debate over whether these three countries should be members of NATO would have long ago been resolved in their favor. 
The people of these countries have yearned to have freedom, democracy, and peace for more than 40 years, as evidenced by Poland particularly. The blood in the streets of Budapest in 1956, the demonstrations of the people in Prague in 1968 who confronted Soviet tanks, and the public confrontations of Solidarity throughout Poland beginning in the 1970s all laid the foundation for the collapse of communism, which we have seen in our lifetime. 
Now as they begin to build institutions of democracy and free enterprise, as they move to further integrate their economies with the rest of Europe, they should participate in the collective security of the continent. I think this will bind these countries closer together far into the future and ensure stability and peace throughout the continent. 
Mr. President, there have been expressions of concern by some people that expanding NATO is a mistake because it would somehow be perceived as a threat, a threat to Russia. I find that argument hard to accept. In my opinion, NATO has never been a threat to Russia. Even during the height of the Cold War, no one seriously considered that NATO threatened the Soviet Union. Quite the contrary. NATO stood to defend--defend--against any potential military threat to its members. There is a difference between defense and offense. And NATO is designed for defense. 
It was never designed as an alliance of aggression--rather, it is an alliance against aggression. 
I think the same holds true today, Mr. President. The people of Russia, who are slowly trying to emerge from the darkness and terror of 70 years of communism, have nothing--I repeat, nothing--to fear from NATO. Our goal is not to isolate Russia but to engage and support her in her efforts to develop a lasting democracy and a free market. 
The people in the evolving democracies of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have earned the right to become full partners in Europe and full partners in NATO. I hope my colleagues will support the dreams, hopes, and aspirations of these people who have struggled for freedom for so long, after so many decades in which they have lived without hope. They have that opportunity today.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened to my friend and colleague from the State of Nevada speak relative to the movement of high-level nuclear waste across various States. I think it is important to reflect on two points. I won't extend the debate at this time, because we will have an opportunity to do that, hopefully, in the near future. 
I point out that what we are advocating in the pending legislation is to authorize the storage of waste in a temporary repository in the general area of Yucca Mountain, where we have already expended more than $6 billion to develop a permanent waste repository. The idea of moving it there and putting it in temporary storage is simply to alleviate the situation in some of our nuclear power plants where they have reached the maximum storage capability allowed by their respective States and State regulations. 
My purpose in bringing this up is simply to note that while we are attempting to move this material and get the authorization out to the Nevada test site, where we have had tests for some 50 years, high-level radioactive nuclear tests, the issue of moving is, I think, relative to the reality associated with when Yucca Mountain receives certification and licensing, then the waste will have to be moved and simply go there. By moving it now, we simply allow our nuclear industry to continue to provide the 22 percent of the power generation until we get the permanent repository licensed and certified. 
The point is, we will move it sooner or later. So the question of moving it safely, while a legitimate point, eludes the reality that we have to move it. And whether we move it now or later is simply a matter of recognizing that the Government entered into a contract with the nuclear industry some 14, 15 years ago. The Government has collected about $14 million from ratepayers over that period of time, and the Government agreed to take the waste this year. So the Government is in violation of its contractual commitment. This is another full employment act for the lawyers here in Washington as they represent the various power companies that are suing the Federal Government for nonperformance of a contract to take the waste. 
I encourage my colleagues to recognize that while efforts are being made to put the fear of God into the various States and communities where the waste would move, the reality is that at some point in time we will have to address the issue. We have been moving military waste and high-level waste throughout the country and throughout the world for many decades and can certainly do it safely. 
I urge my colleagues to evaluate the merits of reality and recognize the contribution of the nuclear power industry. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise in support of Senator Specter's resolution which calls for the establishment of a war crimes tribunal to bring Saddam Hussein to justice. I agree that it is justifiable that Saddam Hussein be prosecuted as an international war criminal, thereby removing him from power. Such an action would eliminate the problem facing the United States and a good part of the free world today. 
Certainly with his systematic action to destroy the population of the civilian Kurds in Iraq through the use of chemical weapons in 1988, his war of aggression against Kuwait in 1990, his missile attacks on Israel in 1991, and his involvement in the attempt to assassinate former President Bush in 1993, there is no doubt in my mind that there is sufficient evidence to pursue him as a war criminal. 
Mr. President, I think this resolution is only one of the policies that this administration should pursue to shut down Iraq's terrorist regime. I propose one more, one that I raised earlier in this body this week. I think we must go back to the original purpose of the economic sanctions against Iraq and shut down Saddam Hussein's ability to fund his programs for weapons of mass destruction. 
In other words, Mr. President, cut off his cash flow, which comes from illegal oil sales. Mr. President, this is the only way we can bring Saddam to his knees. We must effectively cut off the flow of oil from Iraq. 
I would like to share a few facts that my colleagues may not be aware of but that are critical to the issue of how Saddam Hussein maintains his current grip on power. 
Revenue from oil exports have historically represented nearly all of Iraq's foreign exchange earnings. In the year preceding Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's export earnings totaled $10.4 billion, with 95 percent of that attributed to petroleum exports. So make no mistake about where the revenue comes from. It comes from his oil. Iraq's imports during the same year, 1990, totaled only $6.6 billion. 
U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, passed in 1991 at the end of the Gulf war, requires that international economic sanctions, including an embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, remain in place until--I emphasize `until'--Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass destruction programs and capabilities and undertakes unconditionally never to resume such activities. 
Well, where are we? The teeth in Resolution 687 have effectively been removed with the expansion of the so-called oil-for-food exception to the sanctions. The first loosening of the sanctions occurred in 1995 when Security Council Resolution 986 allowed Iraq to export $1 billion in oil every 90 days, which is $4 billion over a year. 
Most recently, during the period when Saddam was again violating Security Council resolutions by refusing to allow international inspectors to conduct their work, the United Nations voted to more than double the amount of oil Iraq can export next year. 
On February 20, the U.N. Security Council, with the Clinton administration's support, adopted Resolution 1153, which will allow Iraq to export $10.52 billion in oil sales per year. That is $5.256 billion every 6 months. In other words, Iraq is now authorized to export nearly as much oil, in today's dollars, as it did before it invaded Kuwait. 
So what are we doing, Mr. President? We are obviously increasing Saddam Hussein's ability to generate a greater cash flow to fund his purposes, that are certainly suspect, to say the least. 
The question is, Will the United States force Iraq to wait to rebuild its oil production capability until it meets the conditions imposed at the end of the Gulf war? We clearly have that answer: It is quite the contrary. In fact, paragraph 12 of Resolution 1153 directs the Secretary General to establish a group of experts to determine whether Iraq has the production and transportation capacity to export the full amount allowed. Well, the resolution goes on to say that the Security Council `expresses its readiness' to authorize `the export of necessary equipment to enable Iraq to increase the export of petroleum or petroleum products.' 
Clearly, we are giving him the green light to increase his production capabilities. 
Nowhere does the resolution mention the potential arms control problems presented by allowing Iraq to resume the import of petroleum equipment, some of which is dual-use and some of which can easily be disguised. 
We witnessed his efforts in the early 1980s to disguise shipments into Iraq that, at that time, were explained to the United States as `parts for his refineries,' when in fact they turned out to be parts for his huge cannon or pipe gun. 
Even as President Clinton vowed to `keep the sanctions on' Iraq until the regime lives up to most of its commitments, we are obviously creating a giant loophole for Iraq's most important commodity--and that is oil--to find its way out into the markets of the world.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Further, it should be noted that using this program to feed his people and to provide medicine frees up other resources that can be used to finance his factories of death. 
Moreover, the increase in illegal sales of petroleum products coincided with implementation of the oil-for-food program in 1995. Part of this oil is moving via truck across the Turkey-Iraq border. A more significant amount is moving by sea vessel through the Persian Gulf. Exports of contraband Iraqi oil through the Gulf have jumped seven-fold in the past year, from $10 million in diesel fuel sales in 1996 to $75 million in 1997. Furthermore, Iraq has been steadily increasing exports of oil to Jordan, from 60,000 barrels per day at the end of Operation Desert Storm to an expected 96,000 barrels per day this year. An ABC News report in December of 1997 cited the Center for Global Energy Studies' estimate that Saddam Hussein was generating $300 million to $400 million a year from contraband oil sales. 
Mr. President, I have absolutely no doubt that allowing Saddam to increase his oil production under the new resolution means that contraband oil exports will increase proportionately. It is this illegal flow of oil that is the lifeline that keeps his Republican Guards well fed and his weapons of mass destruction program on track. 
Finally, Mr. President, Resolution 1153 does more than address humanitarian imports; it finances almost the full range of imports that Iraq would make were it not under the sanctions. The resolution provides for infrastructure improvements, such as sewers and electricity--all activities that would normally be undertaken by the Iraqi Government. 
I have a few theories about the motivation of the interested parties. From the standpoint of the Clinton administration, this may have been viewed as a counterbalance to the call for military action. I think it was certainly counterproductive. But in any event, that was their decision. 
But for the other members of the Security Council, particularly those who oppose the use of military force--Russia, France, and China--the motivation is clear. The motivation is economic. As a recent Wall Street Journal article observed: 
For Kremlin envoys, more than $10 billion in contracts and debt is at stake in bringing an end to the United Nations economic sanctions against one of Russia's biggest trading partners. 
Indeed, even under the U.N. embargo, Russian oil companies have been the prime beneficiaries of the oil-for-food program. It is reported that Russia signed and delivered 36 contracts to supply pharmaceuticals worth $100 million to Iraqi hospitals under the U.N. deal. 
Russia's heavy industry would also benefit by supplying oil equipment, such as platforms and rigs, to Iraq, as would Russian arms makers. Of course, some Russian companies have not waited for the end of the sanctions. Iraq obtained several Russian gyroscopes used for aiming Scuds back in 1995. We know that. And just last week, U.N. inspectors accused Russia of selling Iraq huge steel drums that can be used to produce biological warfare agents. 
I should note that both China and France have similar conflicts of interest in that their close economic ties to Iraq and their desire for Iraqi oil have made them hard set against any military action. 
With the United Nations having now negotiated a deal with Saddam Hussein that appears, in the short term at least, to have sidetracked military options, and with members of the Security Council actively working to let Saddam off the hook, what can the United States do unilaterally to advance our national security interests? 
I am pleased to announce that Senator Helms and the Foreign Relations Committee and, in my capacity as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, will be holding hearings on this matter in the very near future. Our Committees will look specifically at enforcement and monitoring of the oil-for-food program, the flow of contraband oil out of Iraq, the effect of the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq by the United Nations, and the beneficiaries of that change of policy. 
I believe Congress should instruct the administration to pursue means to tighten the oil-for-food monitoring program so that we are assured that we have the accountability--and the United Nations has never been particularly adept at accountability--and to develop measures that will prevent the illegal leakage of oil into the world marketplace. 
I introduced a resolution 2 weeks ago--Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 76--which would send that message to this administration. I plan to amend the resolution to reflect what is learned in the congressional hearings, and will ask the Senate to take action on it in the near future. 
My resolution will call on the administration to consider a few options. The first would be expanding the Multinational Interdiction Force, MIF, in the Gulf of Arabia and ensuring that the rules of engagement allow MIF forces to effectively interdict vessels containing contraband oil. 
Second, using all diplomatic means available to ensure that other countries in the region are not aiding illegal oil exports in violation of the U.N. resolution. 
Third, inspecting all vessels leaving the Iraqi Port of Basra to ensure that the economic sanctions are not being circumvented. This type of blockade is justified under existing U.N. resolutions implementing economic sanctions. We maintain in the skies, in effect, what amounts to a blockade, and we certainly have the right to enforce the movement of illegal oil that is coming out of Iraq. 
And, fourth, entering into negotiations with oil-producing nations to encourage them to make subsidized sales of oil to Jordan so that Iraqi-Jordanian oil-flows can simply be shut off. 
Mr. President, oil is the key to controlling the future of the military capacity of Iraq. We have to control it if we are ever going to control Saddam Hussein. 
This concludes my remarks. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding me time to talk on this Iraqi issue.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my amendment on major investment study requirements for highway projects in metropolitan areas was cleared by the managers and adopted during today's debate, but I wanted to say a few words about it. 
Mr. President, regulations now require a major investment study for all large metropolitan projects. This requirement needlessly duplicates planning and study processes already required for such projects under other long range transportation planning efforts required in Title 23. The result is a significant slow-down in planning and project completion. 
In my home state, major projects in our largest city, Anchorage, have been frozen in place by this needless insistence on needless studies. This amendment directs the Secretary to adopt regulations eliminating the Major Investment Study as a stand-alone requirement within six months, and to integrate any non-redundant and worthwhile portions of it into a new, streamlined transportation planning process that involves all concerned parties as early as possible in the planning and decision process. 
This is a very important step in alleviating needless red tape and confusion for metropolitan planners, and moving forward on some vital projects, and I appreciate the managers' help in resolving this issue.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the staffs and I thank Senator Chafee. 
Mr. President, Ferries are a small but extremely important part of our transportation system. This amendment reauthorizes the ferry discretionary program at $30 million per year, with an authorization to appropriate $20 million more annually, and it calls on the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a thorough review of existing ferry services and potential new routes, and to both report back to Congress and to discuss his findings with interested local and state governments. It is our hope this will both maintain this important link in our transportation chain, and stimulate thought and action toward both standard and high-speed ferries as cost effective and environmentally sensitive alternatives for traditional solutions such as bridges and causeways. Included is a provision setting aside $12 million for ferry systems that are in the national highway system. 
Mr. President, in my state of Alaska, where roads are few and far between our ferry system--the Alaska Marine Highway System--is the only scheduled transportation link between many island communities which are not connected by roads. Many of these villages are too small even to have the smallest of landing strips, and expensive float planes are the only other option for travel. 
It is absolutely irreplaceable. It carries senior citizens from their small communities to doctors' offices and hospitals in larger communities. It is how basketball and swimming and other sports teams from remote villages are able to reach out to meet and interact with other teams from other communities. It is how small communities receive their fresh milk, their fresh bread, and their canned goods and other foodstuffs. Most of these are fishing communities, and quite often the ferry system is now a fishermen sidelined by an engine breakdown will get his new parts so that he can get back to making a living for himself and his family. 
Mr. President, I could go on, but I trust the message is clear. In my state, the service provided by our ferry system is an integral part of the fabric of life. When I say it is irreplaceable, that is not just a figure of speech, it is the literal truth. 
In other states, Mr. President, ferry services may have slightly different impacts, but they are all equally essential. In Hawaii they offer a necessary alternative to a strained road system that is close to its limits. In the southeast, they quickly and safely evacuate those threatened by hurricanes. In the Pacific Northwest and in the northeastern states they move hundreds of thousands of vehicles and millions of passengers quickly and safely and with a minimum of pollution. 
In all, 25 states have benefited from the ferry discretionary program under ISTEA. In alphabetical order, these are: Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Mississippi, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Puerto Rico and the Virgin islands have also received funds. 
Mr. President, that is an impressive list, but the sad fact is that the funding that has been available under this program is not keeping pace with the need. Ferries--like any vessel--are very expensive to operate, let alone the cost of maintaining the necessary shoreside facilities, and of expanding both those facilities and the capacity of our nation's ferries in response to increasing demand. 
Let me offer a little comparison here. The national highway program has paid for and is paying for the construction and replacement of over 483,000 bridges over waterways of various sizes. In FY97 alone, almost $2 billion went to bridges. The ferry program was a puny $18 million--less than one percent of the bridge dollars, and not nearly enough to do the job. 
And what of those communities that are beyond the reach of bridges and are dependent--literally dependent--on ferries? The communities may not be physically or reliably reachable by road, but they are full of American citizens who deserve the same priority treatment from Congress as those who are reliant on bridges. 
My amendment gives those communities the recognition and assistance they need and deserve. I urge the support of all my distinguished colleagues, and ask for it's immediate adoption.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank the managers for accepting my amendment on the reconstruction of the Alaska Highway. The Alcan is the only road link between the contiguous states and Alaska. It was constructed in 1942 during World War II to respond to a critical strategic need for such a highway. 
This amendment adds language needed to fund the last stages of a multi-year reconstruction project on the Alcan, which runs 1,520 miles from Dawson Creek, British Columbia to Fairbanks, Alaska. 
The still-unfinished portion is the last 95 miles of the 325-mile northern, or `Shakwak' section, so-called because a good part of it runs through a geological formation called the Shakwak Trench. 
At this point, Mr. President, I want to provide a little of this highway's fascinating history. Since the British burned the Capitol here in Washington during the War of 1812, the United States' territory in the mainland of North America has suffered only one invasion. That invasion was during World War II, in Alaska. 
In 1940, construction began on Fort Richardson, outside Anchorage. However, immediately after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it became clear that Alaska had great strategic importance as a staging area for forces in the North Pacific. Construction on the Alcan began in the spring of 1942. 
In June 1942, Japanese aircraft bombed Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Four days later, they invaded and fortified sites on Attu and Kiska, two of the Aleutian Islands, which they held for nearly a full year before our forces liberated them. 
During the Japanese occupation of these U.S. islands, the Alcan was built. It provided a secure route to move essential supplies and equipment safe from German or Japanese submarines. 
In a feat of engineering that is still unprecedented, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers managed to build this 1,520-mile road across trackless wilderness in just eight months. 
At first, naturally, the Alcan was just a dirt road punched through trees and across the tundra by bulldozers. After the war, however, civilian contractors began the long task of upgrading to a graveled road that civilian vehicles could manage. 
But traffic continued to increase, with 79% of the traffic Americans on the way to Alaska and back. A gravel road just isn't up to the task. 
In 1977, the United States and Canada joined in an agreement in which the United States government committed to pay the costs of reconstructing the Alcan to a modern, paved standard, and Canada undertook to pay for all maintenance and upkeep, such as snow removal. 
In passing, Mr. President, let me note that where the U.S. commitment in that agreement has been approximately $20 million per year and is now dropping to $16 million per year, Canada spends $40 million to $50 million per year on its portion of the highway agreement.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. The U.S. commitment to reconstruct the Alcan is only logical. The Alcan is an international highway from one part of the United States to another. It is considered as a national defense highway, and it is of direct benefit not only to Alaska, but to the United States as a whole. 
This is not an Alaska issue, Madam President. This is a project undertaken by the United States Government--a project that benefits the country as a whole and which protects our strategic interests. More importantly, it is one which we should now complete.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, although stories about Iraq have moved off page 1, history teaches us that we should be prepared for another crisis, and I will tell you why. Most of the previous debate on Iraq has focused on military options or support for opposition groups, but I am here to call the attention of my colleagues to an issue that seems to have been lost. Where is the will of the world to enforce the economic sanctions, including the embargo on oil sales, that date back to the end of Operation Desert Storm? 
We must go back, I think, to the original purpose of the economic sanctions against Iraq and simply shut down Saddam Hussein's ability to fund his program for weapons of mass destruction. Because there is a significant amount of oil that he is able to sell, and the proceeds are not going for humanitarian needs in Iraq; they are going into Saddam Hussein's pocket, and, as a consequence, he is fueling his military machine. 
In my opinion there is only one way to shut down Saddam's military machine. We must effectively cut off the flow of oil from Iraq. I would like to share a few facts that my colleagues may not be aware of, but that are critical to the issue of how Saddam Hussein maintains his current grip on power. He does that by the cash flow generated from illegal oil sales. 
Revenue from oil exports have historically represented nearly all of Iraq's foreign exchange earnings. In the year preceding Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's export earnings totaled $10.5 billion with 95 percent attributed to oil exports, so that's really his cash flow. Iraq's imports during the same year, 1990, totaled only $6.6 billion. 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, passed in the 1991 at the end of the gulf war, requires that international economic sanctions, including an embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, remain in place until Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass destruction programs and capabilities and undertakes unconditionally never to resume such activities. 
But the teeth in Resolution 687 have effectively been removed with the expansion of the so-called `oil-for-food' exception to the sanctions. The first loosening of the sanctions occurred in 1995, when 
Security Council Resolution 986 allowed Iraq to export $1 billion in oil every 90 days--$4 billion over one year. 
And most recently, during the period when Saddam was again violating Security Council resolution by refusing to allow international inspectors to conduct their work, the United Nations voted to more than double the amount of oil Iraq can export per year. 
On February 20, the U.N. Security Council, with the Clinton administration's support, adopted Resolution 1153 which will allow Iraq to export $10.52 billion in oil per year--$5.256 billion every 180 days. In other words, Iraq is now authorized to export nearly as much oil, in today's dollars, as it did before it invaded Kuwait. 
So we have now given Saddam Hussein the green light to completely rebuild his oil export capacity. As Patrick Clawson, from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, observed in a recent analysis of Resolution 1153: 
The UN-authorized limit translates into 2.25 million barrels per day (mbd), if the price averages $13 barrel. In addition, Iraq produces .4 mbd for domestic use and .2 mbd for export to Jordan and smuggling out the Gulf or to Turkey. That means Iraq would have to produce 2.85 mbd to make use of the full UN quota. In fact, it is unlikely that Iraq could produce more than 2.5 mbd today and it may take Iraq until the end of 1999 before it could reach a production level that takes full advantage of the UN-authorized export. In short, Iraq faces no effective limit on its oil exports, because it is now permitted to export all the oil it is capable of pumping. 
Mr. President, will the United States force Iraq to wait to rebuild its oil production capability until it meets the conditions imposed at the end of the gulf war? Quite the contrary. In fact, paragraph 12 of Resolution 1153 directs the Secretary General to establish a group of experts to determine whether Iraq has the production and transportation capacity to export the full amount allowed. The resolution goes on to say that the Security Council, `expresses its readiness' to authorize `the export of necessary equipment to enable Iraq to increase the export of petroleum or petroleum products.' 
Analyst Patrick Clawson correctly pointed out the dangers of allowing Iraq to resume the import of petroleum equipment:  
Were Iraq to resume large-scale imports of oil field equipment, that would pose serious arms control problems. Not only is some of the equipment dual use (e.g., heavy trucks), but it is important to remember that Iraq disguised its `super gun' barrel as an oil pipeline, convincingly enough to mislead some of the `pipe' producers. 
Even as President Clinton vowed to `keep the sanctions on' Iraq until the regime lives up to its commitments, we are creating a giant loophole for Iraq's most important commodity--oil. 
Of course, expansion of the food-for-oil program is sold as a humanitarian gesture. U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh described the Security Council action as the `largest U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian program' in its history. I have no disagreement with finding ways to reduce the misery of the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly under Hussein's leadership, but I do have a problem with the oil-for-food expansion, because I am not convinced it is controllable under the current U.N. proposal. 
The administration has not yet convinced me that the monitoring of this program is so airtight that it does not allow kickbacks that benefit Saddam Hussein directly. 
But even if the monitoring is airtight, Mr. President, I am convinced that the program indirectly benefits Saddam Hussein for several reasons. 
First, using this program to feed his people and to provide medicine frees up other resources that can be used to finance his factories of death. 
Second, the increase in illegal sales of petroleum products coincided with implementation of the oil-for-food program in 1995. Part of this oil is moving via truck across the Turkey-Iraq border. A more significant amount is moving by sea vessel through the Persian 
Gulf. The Multinational Interdiction Force that operates in the gulf reported last fall that exports of contraband Iraqi oil through the gulf has jumped sevenfold in the past year from $10 million in diesel fuel sales in 1996 to $75 million in 1997. Furthermore, Iraq has been steadily increasing exports of oil to Jordan, from 60,000 barrels per day at the end of Operation Desert Storm to an expected 96,000 barrels per day currently. 
An ABC News report in December of 1997 cited the Center for Global Energy Studies estimate that Saddam Hussein was generating $300 to $400 million a year from contraband oil sales. 
Mr. President, these are illegal sales that have generated funds for Saddam Hussein's war machine. 
I have absolutely no doubt that allowing Saddam to increase his oil production under the new resolution means that contraband oil exports will increase proportionately. It is this illegal flow of oil that is the lifeline that keeps his Republican Guards well fed and his weapons of mass destruction production program on track. A former head of Iraq's military intelligence, in an interview with ABC News, said that the dollars generated by smuggling `enable Saddam Hussein to support his intelligence services and the military to keep them loyal. That is how he stays in power.' 
Finally, Resolution 1153 does more than provide for humanitarian imports. It finances almost the full range of imports that Iraq would make were it not under the sanctions. Again quoting from Patrick Clawson: 
In fact, UNSCR 1153, provides imports at about half the prewar level, putting the lie to the idea that Saddam is stuck in an ever-constricting `box.' 
He is not stuck in an ever-constricting box; the box is full of holes. The resolution provides for infrastructure improvements such as sewers and electricity--all activities that would normally be undertaken by the Iraqi Government. To the extent this U.N. action quells citizen discontent with Iraqi leadership, we are just prolonging the life of this horrible regime. 
So why did the U.N. Security Council adopt Resolution 1153? I have a few theories about the motivation of the interested parties. For the Clinton administration, this may have been viewed as a counterbalance to the call for military action. I think it was counterproductive, but that was their decision. 
But for other members of the Security Council, particularly those who oppose the use of military force--Russia, France and China--the motivation is clear. It is an economic motivation. As a recent Wall Street Journal article observed: 
For Kremlin envoys, more than $10 billion in contracts and debt is at stake in bringing an end to the United Nations economic sanctions against one of Russia's biggest trading partners. Indeed, even under the U.N. embargo, Russian oil companies such as NK Zarubezhneft and AO Surgutneftegas have been the prime beneficiaries of the `food for oil' program . . . Russia signed and delivered 36 contracts to supply pharmaceuticals worth $100 million to Iraq hospitals under the U.N. deal. 
The Wall Street Journal correctly observes that Russia's heavy industry would also benefit by supplying oil equipment, such as platforms and rigs, to Iraq, as would Russian arms makers. Of course, some Russian companies have not waited for the end of sanctions. Iraq obtained several Russian gyroscopes used for aiming Scuds in 1995, and just last week we became aware that U.N. inspectors accused Russia of selling Iraq huge steel drums that could be used to produce biological warfare agents. 
In spite of these actions by Russia, it was reported this weekend that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan was studying a Russian request to have a Russian named as codeputy chairman of the U.N. special commission overseeing the weapons inspections. I sincerely hope the United States will use its veto power to prevent this appointment in light of the obvious conflicts of interest. 
I should note, Mr. President, that both China and France have similar conflicts of interest in that their close economic ties to Iraq have been in existence for some time, and their desire for Iraqi oil is well known. These have made them hard set against any military action for some time. 
With the United Nations having now negotiated a deal with Saddam Hussein that appears in the short term to have sidetracked military options--and with members of the Security Council actively working to let Saddam Hussein off the hook--what can the United States do unilaterally to advance our national security interests? 
I have some suggestions. First, the Congress should hold hearings to examine the impact of increased oil sales on Saddam Hussein's ability to stay in power. As chairman of the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, I would like to conduct these hearings jointly with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and my good friend, Senator Helms. 
Second, the administration should keep our forces in the gulf region while we test whether this time Saddam Hussein means what he says. 
Third, Congress should instruct the administration to pursue means to tighten the oil-for-food monitoring program and to develop measures that would prevent the illegal leakage of oil into the world marketplace. I submitted a resolution 2 weeks ago, Senate Concurrent Resolution 76, which would send that message to the administration. I plan to amend that resolution to reflect what is learned in congressional hearings, and I will ask the Senate to take action on that in the near future. 
My resolution will call on the administration to consider the following options: 
First, expanding the multinational interdiction force, the MIF, in the Gulf of Arabia and ensuring that the rules of engagement allow MIF forces to effectively interdict vessels containing contraband oil. 
Second, using all diplomatic means available to ensure that other countries in the region are not aiding illegal oil exports in violation of the U.N. resolutions. 
Third, inspecting all vessels leaving the Iraqi Port of Basra to ensure that the economic sanctions are not being circumvented. This type of blockade is justified under existing U.N. resolutions implementing economic sanctions. While it may sound like an extreme measure to initiate a blockade, I remind my colleagues that we have a blockade of the airspace over that part of the country, which we have taken the initiative to enforce. 
Fourth, and finally, entering into negotiations with oil-producing nations to encourage them to make subsidized oil sales to Jordan so that the Iraqi-Jordanian flow of oil can be shut off. 
Taken together, all these measures will serve to increase Iraq's economic isolation and provide a deterrence to illegal actions. This is an approach we used successfully in confronting the former Soviet Union, and I think we should return to it right now. 
Again, oil is the key to controlling the future military capability of Iraq. We must control it if we are ever going to contain Saddam Hussein. 
Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to the recent conclusion of the bilateral trade negotiations between the United States and the Republic of China on Taiwan. I think it is significant because it is this event that moves Taiwan one step closer to entry into the World Trade Organization. 
This event has particular significance to me because I was a member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1990 when Taiwan first applied for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the predecessor organization to the World Trade Organization. 
Then chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Claiborne Pell, and I and a number of others initiated a letter to President Bush, signed by 13 members of the Foreign Relations Committee, urging our Government to support the formation of a working group on Taiwan's application to GATT. A similar letter to the President, initiated by then chairman of the Finance Committee Lloyd Bentsen and ranking Republican Bob Packwood was signed by 20 members of the Senate Finance Committee. 
Mr. President, I am gratified that Taiwan and the United States have reached this important milestone in our bilateral relationship. I also congratulate Taiwan for committing to adopt WTO principles at this time, particularly when many countries in the region are questioning the merits of opening doors and providing freer access to their domestic markets. Taiwan, once again, is serving as a model for the region. 
Last week, members of the Finance Committee had an opportunity to meet with the U.S. Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, to discuss this issue, among others. The members of the Finance Committee attending that meeting signed a letter to Ambassador Barshefsky congratulating her and the other USTR negotiators for reaching a deal that will dramatically open Taiwan's markets to U.S. agricultural products, services, and other industrial goods.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I hope that Taiwan now continues its forward march and finishes its two outstanding bilateral negotiations with the European Union and Switzerland. And I call on our administration to continue to show leadership on this issue. 
I am also encouraged by the leadership of the Director General of the World Trade Organization, Renato Ruggiero, in his recent comments that, `Taiwan's entry does not depend on China. The negotiations of Taiwan are progressing well. At the World Trade Organization we are not, fortunately, ruled by political principles.' I hope the rest of the WTO members, the United States included, will abide by those words. 
Mr. President, I am not ignoring that Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization faces hurdles not faced by other prospective entries. It is well known that the People's Republic of China, which is not yet a member of the World Trade Organization, has indicated that Taiwan should not join the WTO before the PRC. The optimistic solution, of course, is that the PRC conclude its outstanding bilateral negotiations with the United States and the other countries and is prepared for entry at the same time. I would certainly support that outcome. Unfortunately, negotiations with the PRC are not proceeding quickly, and there is always the risk that the PRC will decide to drop its bid for WTO entry altogether. What happens then to Taiwan? Well, that isn't addressed, Mr. President. 
Fortunately, Mr. President, we are not yet faced with that situation, so I will not speculate on possible alternatives. But it does call to mind the delicate nature of the three-way relationship between the United States, the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China. 
Recently, comments of Dr. Arthur Waldron, a prominent Asia scholar and a professor of international relations at the University of Pennsylvania, have been brought to my attention because of the insight that he offers on American policy on this triangular relationship. 
I would like to share with my colleagues some of the observations Dr. Waldron made at a recent forum hosted by the American Enterprise Institute. 
Dr. Waldron said that, `although we have a military policy toward the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, we don't really have a political policy.' He was referring, of course, to President Clinton's decision in 1996 to send a pair of aircraft carriers into the region when the PRC began a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait on the eve of the first direct democratic presidential elections in Taiwan. 
Waldron argues that, while the United States showed military support for Taiwan in 1996, there has been little discussion of a long-term political policy. One of the reasons he says--and I agree--is that, `there are all kinds of taboos around,' particularly with regard to the language we use when discussing the issue. `We have a very strong relationship with Taiwan, but we're not allowed to go public with it,' Waldron said at last month's forum. 
We can't call them by their official name. You even look in the CIA guide and it has Taiwan, and where it says `official name', it says `none.' It's called the Republic of China, or the Republic of China on Taiwan. Those who work for our government aren't allowed to say that. I don't know why. 
Waldron believes that the American policy toward the PRC-Taiwan issue is based on similar problems of language. The three communiques between the PRC and the United States, along with the Taiwan Relations Act, outline the official U.S. position on the issue, which is that the United States supports `peaceful reunification' of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. But in the 1970s, when the first two communiques were signed, it was generally thought that Taiwan would not survive on its own for very long. `There was a real underestimation of the resilience, the capability 
of Taiwan and its people. There was a sense . . . that they would reach some sort of an agreement with the PRC, which would eliminate this issue,' he says. 
Of course, that has not happened, Mr. President. And today, with the PRC's Communist regime still in place and Taiwan's democracy growing every day, it is unlikely to happen any time soon. 
Waldron calls the current situation `the policy of denial.' `The idea is if you can get everybody in the world to say that Taiwan is no more than a renegade province, then somehow it will become a reality. Well, just having somebody say that something is so doesn't [necessarily] make it so,' he said at the AEI forum. 
Waldron concluded his remarks last month with the comment that he was not calling for `a sudden and dramatic change in policy.' Instead, he said: 
What I am calling for is a change in the way we talk and the way we think. We have to start saying to ourselves, suppose that there isn't going to be this wonderful peaceful unification that we've all been talking about, suppose Taiwan keeps on developing the way it is, with even more legitimacy in its political organizations, freer speech and independent capabilities that make it impossible for anybody to compel them. And suppose the PRC doesn't evolve in ways that would make a solution more possible. What should we do? Let's call things by their true names, and talk about real possibilities and real scenarios for the future, rather than imagining that somehow this problem has been solved. 
Mr. President, I found Dr. Waldron's comments refreshing. Back in 1993, I requested a hearing on Taiwan in the Foreign Relations Committee on how we could update our relations with Taiwan. This hearing was delayed for over a year as the administration completed the `Taiwan Policy Review.' That review was finally released in September 1994. Although the administration did take some positive steps, which I welcomed, it left unanswered many of the inconsistencies that Dr. Waldron discussed. 
Further on the subject of Taiwan, Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post carried yet another in what is clearly a series of Clinton Administration trial balloons on the subject of a Taiwan-Beijing dialogue. This article, authored by former Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye, indicates the Administration is continuing to use third parties to increase pressure on Taiwan to return to the negotiating table with Beijing. 
I, for one, would welcome fruitful dialogue between Taiwan and Beijing, but I think we in the United States would do well to ensure that it takes place on mutually satisfactory terms. 
We promised Taiwan in 1979, when we withdrew recognition of the Republic of China, that we would never pressure Taiwan into direct negotiations with the communist authorities on the mainland. 
I am troubled by Dr. Nye's thesis and the whole premise of the messages the Administration his been sending to Taipei through former government officials. That is, that Taiwan should hasten to sit at the negotiating table with a nuclear super power that refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan's democracy. I believe a renunciation of the use of force by Beijing would be an important demonstration of good will and would facilitate a meaningful dialogue so our democratic friends in Taiwan are not pressured by Washington to negotiate with a gun to their head. 
Further, Dr. Nye states that the United States should publicly announce that it will not defend Taiwan if Taiwan declare independence. While I agree that it is undesirable for Taiwan to declare independence, I think Nye's logic is backward. Do we want to encourage people to think that Taiwan is ripe for the picking? Our policy of creative ambiguity has long served U.S. interests. So has our demonstrated readiness to use force, as we did when we introduced the two carriers into the Taiwan Strait two years ago when China tried to intimidate the people of Taiwan on the eve of their presidential election. I believe we should not change this policy. The U.S. should continue to be prepared, under appropriate circumstances, to deploy our defense resources in support of democracy in Taiwan. 
Finally, Dr. Nye suggests that there is nothing but second class status in Taiwan's future. I do not think that the United States should endorse such a fate for the proud, free democratic people of Taiwan. With creative solutions, I hope Taiwan can assume its full and rightful place in international organizations. I don't think the United States through current officials, former officials or trial balloons should walk away from our support in this regard. 
As President Clinton prepares for another summit with President Jiang of China, I hope that he will take into consideration Dr. Waldron's comments and the input of interested Members of Congress who have long followed this issue. Taiwan is a strong democracy. It is not going to simply bow to coercion from China. The United States should recognize this and work to find a policy that will ease regional tensions and promote future stability in the Asia-Pacific area. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce on behalf of myself and Senator Stevens, legislation that will provide Alaska Native Veterans of the Vietnam era, from 1964-75, a chance to apply for Native Allotments. Because these brave men and women were outside of the country, serving America with distinction, they missed the opportunity to apply for these allotments. Our bill will create a year-long open season for these veterans and their heirs to apply for and select allotment parcels. 
The Alaska Native Allotment Act, in effect from 1906-71, allowed Alaska Natives who had continuous use of either vacant land or certain mineral lands set aside for federal use, the opportunity to apply for, select, and ultimately be granted conveyance of these lands. Alaska Native Vietnam Veterans did not receive the outreach and assistance in applying that other Alaska Natives received during the time the act was in effect, and were effectively denied the opportunity to apply for allotments when they were serving their country. Our legislation calls for the same standards that were in effect under the Allotment Act be used to evaluate these new applications. It calls for DOI to develop rules to implement this bill, in consultation with Alaska Native groups. Congressman Young has introduced a companion measure in the House, and our respective committees plan to hold hearings this winter on these pieces of legislation. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that my 1995 authorizing legislation, Public Law 104-2, that required the Department of the Interior to produce a report on the possible impacts of allotment legislation, has led to this day. The time has come to give these veterans the opportunity to join their fellow Alaska Natives in reaping the benefits of the historic Alaska Native Allotment Act.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the debate that we begin today on campaign finance reform must be prefaced with one question: To what extent, if any, should the Federal Government regulate political speech in our country? 
The President has endorsed Senator McCain and Senator Feingold's campaign finance reform legislation. However, I cannot. 
Campaign finance reform debate is not just about politicians and their campaigns. At the core of this issue is the First Amendment. The government must tread lightly in attempts to place limitations on speech. The government can no more dictate how many words a newspaper can print than it can limit a political candidate's ability to communicate with his or her constituents 
The McCain-Feingold legislation bristles with over a dozen different restrictions on speech--provisions that, I believe, flagrantly violate the First Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. 
I cannot overemphasize this point. George F. Will, in a Washington Post editorial stated of the McCain Feingold bill: 
Nothing in American history--not the left's recent campus speech codes,' not the right's depredations during the 1950s McCarthysim or the 1920s `red scare,' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by campaign `reforms' advancing under the protective coloration of political hygiene.' 
Mr. President, I would point out that the 1996 presidential system of campaign finance clearly reveals that two significant problems exists with our current election process: 
1. Too much money is spent on campaigns; and 2. Current laws are not enforced. 
Unfortunately, McCain-Feingold would do little to end the vicious cycle of fundraising. In fact, if anything, it would only prolong the campaign calendar. Since McCain-Feingold contains restrictions on express advocacy' financed by soft money only 60 days before an election--that will mean that money will simply be raised earlier in the calendar year, and the election season will seem virtually unending. 
And what is `express advocacy?' If this proposal ever becomes law, we can change the name of the Federal Election Commission to the Federal Campaign Speech Police. Every single issue advertisement will be taped, reviewed, analyzed and litigated over. The Speech police will set up their offices in all 50 states to ensure the integrity of political advertising. Is that what we in this chamber really want? I don't think so. But that is what will inevitably happen if we adopt McCain-Feingold. 
Mr. President, the political tactics and schemes of the 1996 Presidential election campaign reveal the abuses involved in our current system. Bottom-line, our current election laws are not being enforced. 
It's interesting to note that where the lack of law enforcement has become the most apparent is in the one area that receives guaranteed federal funding via a tax subsidy--federal presidential elections. 
As grand jury indictments amass with regard to Democratic fundraising violations in the 1996 Presidential election, we learn more and more about President Clinton's use of the perquisites of the Presidency as a fund-raising tool. It's important to recall some of those abuses as we begin our debate on campaign reform. And please keep in mind my point here is existing campaign laws are not being enforced. 
First, the Lincoln bedroom. During the five years that President Clinton has resided in the White House, an astonishing 938 guests have spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom, and generated at least 
$6 million to the Democrat National Committee. 
Presidential historian, Richard Norton Smith, stated that there has `never been anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of the White House for fundraising purposes. . .it's the selling of the White House.' 
Presidential Coffees. President Clinton hosted 103 `presidential coffees.' Guests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon and a Chinese businessman who heads an arms-trading company, donated $27 million to the Democrat National Committee. 
President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, recently turned over a large number of documents that show figures for both expected and actual donations from nearly every White House coffee. Mr. Ickes gave the President weekly memorandums which included projected monies he expected each `Clinton coffee' would raise. He projected each would raise no less than $400,000. 
Here's a comparison: President Bush hosted one `presidential coffee.' No money was raised. The cost was $6.24. 
Foreign Contributions. Investigations by both the Senate Government Affairs Committee and the Department of Justice into campaign abuses in the 1996 presidential campaign have revealed that the Democrats recklessly accepted illegal foreign donations in exchange for presidential access and other favors. A few examples: 
First John Huang. John Huang, raised millions of dollars in illegal foreign contributions for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which the DNC has already returned. 
Huang, despite being wholly unqualified according to his immediate boss, received an appointment to the Department of Commerce, where he improperly accessed numerous classified documents on China. 
Huang made at least 67 visits to the White House, often meeting with senior officials on US trade policy. 
Senator Specter stated that the activities of Mr. Huang at the Commerce Department had `all the earmarks of. . .espionage.' 
Second Charlie Trie. 
Longtime friend of Bill Clinton, raised and contributed at least $640,000 contributions to Clinton, Gore and the DNC. 
Shortly thereafter, Clinton signed an executive order to increase the size of the US Commission on Pacific Trade and appointed Trie to the Commission. 
On January 29th of this year, the Department of Justice indicted Trie on charges that he funneled illegal foreign contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to buy access to top Democratic Party and Clinton Administration officials.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this bill should have been the easiest thing we did this Congress. The Senate passed legislation on this issue by unanimous consent twice last year. This bill contains nothing less than our Nation's energy security insurance policy. This bill authorizes two vital energy security measures: the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and U.S. participation in the International Energy Agency. 
Both of these authorities have expired. At this moment, sabers are rattling in the Gulf. Very soon, there may be more than sabers rattling. As I speak, more American troops are headed to the Middle East. We owe it to our soldiers, and the Nation's civilian consumers, to do everything we can to ensure that our energy insurance policy is in effect. 
The House bill before us, H.R. 2472, would provide a simple extension of these authorities through September of this year. However, this is not enough to ensure our Nation's energy security. We must change the antitrust exemption in EPCA to comply with current IEA policy. The IEA changed its emergency response policy at our request, switching from command-and-control measures to more market-oriented coordinated stockdraw procedures. However, our laws haven't kept up. 
Right now, our U.S. oil companies don't have any assurance that their attempts to cooperate with the IEA and our government in a crises won't be a violation of antitrust laws. The IEA's efforts to respond to a crisis will be critically impaired if it can't coordinate with U.S. oil companies. Our oil companies want to cooperate with our government and the IEA and strongly support this amendment. 
We also need to amend H.R. 2472 to extend the authorization beyond September. For every year in recent memory, we have authorized this Act on a year-to-year basis. Every year, we face a potential crises when these authorities go unrenewed until the very end of the Congress. The provisions of this bill are not controversial. However, there are those who see any important bill as leverage. 
This year, we are on the edge of a real crises. We have ongoing military action in the Gulf, and no clear authority to respond to oil supply shortages. Playing political games with this bill has always been irresponsible; now it is downright dangerous. In the future, the only way to avoid the annual crisis is to renew EPCA for more than one year. I am disappointed that we can't do that now. But for now, we must avert the immediate crisis. 
I have tried to address concerns about the future of the SPR. Like many of you, I am dismayed by the recent use of the SPR as a `piggy bank'. In 1995, DOE proposed the sale of oil to pay for repairs and upkeep, opening the floodgates to continued sales of oil for budget-balancing purposes. So far, we've lost the American taxpayer over half a billion dollars. Buying high and selling low never makes sense. We're like the man in the old joke who was buying high and selling low who claimed that `he would make it up on volume.' I am pleased that President's budget does not propose oil sales. I hope we have broken the habit of selling SPR oil forever. 
We have already invested a great deal of taxpayer dollars in the SPR. We proved during the Persian Gulf War that the stabilizing effect of an SPR drawdown far outstrips the volume of oil sold. The simple fact that the SPR is available can have a calming influence on oil markets. The oil is there, waiting to dampen the effects of an energy emergency on our economy. However, if we don't ensure that there is authority to use the oil when we need it, we will have thrown those tax dollars away. So, the first step is to ensure that our emergency oil reserves are fully authorized and available. 
We are talking about people's lives and jobs. The least we can do is stop holding this measure hostage to political ambition. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this amendment and immediate passage of H.R. 2472. I also urge our colleagues in the other body to adopt this measure before we go home for recess during this dangerous and uncertain time.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution addressing the international sanctions regime that has been in place against Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf war. As we all know, there has been a great deal of deliberation in this Chamber relative to potential action that might be initiated by our Government against Iraq. And there is a feeling of, I think, growing concern as to just what type action we might take and what it will accomplish. 
But, Mr. President, I think I bring a different approach to this dilemma. As we acknowledge the risk of the approach to this dilemma. As we acknowledge the risk of the approaching confrontation with Iraq that has been brought about by Saddam Hussein's continuing unwillingness to allow the U.N. inspectors the right to inspect the facilities in Iraq, what we also know is that Saddam Hussein is very likely continuing to manufacture and develop weapons of mass destruction, probably of a biological nature. 
I was in Iraq in the early 1980s with a number of Senators and had an opportunity to visit with Saddam Hussein before the Persian Gulf war. It was clear from that meeting that we had a very unusual personality, one who is dangerous and clearly unpredictable. 
As a consequence, we find ourselves in the position that until the U.N. inspectors are allowed unfettered access to the facilities in Iraq, the world will continue to be held hostage to the destructive and threatening tendencies of Saddam Hussein. 
With the world's economy so heavily dependent on the free flow of oil from the Mideast, so long as these weapons of mass destruction exist, the economic stability of every nation in the world is somewhat at risk. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the Persian Gulf war was a war to ensure that Saddam did not take over the oil fields of Kuwait. That was Saddam's objective. It was a war about oil and the necessity of keeping oil flowing to the free markets of the world. 
So, Mr. President, one question that seems to be lost in the debate is, how--how--has Saddam been able to obtain the technology and the resources to construct facilities capable of producing poison gas and biological weapons? The U.N. economic embargo has been in place for 7 years, but somehow--somehow--he appears to have been able to maintain a cash flow to purchase the necessary technology for building these laboratories of death. 
Just this morning, the Washington Post is reporting that U.N. inspectors have uncovered evidence that in 1995 the Russian Government may have entered into a multimillion dollar deal to sell Iraq specialized fermentation equipment that could be used to develop biological weapons. If this story turns out to be true, Russia's credibility in its alleged efforts to broker a diplomatic solution to the current crisis could be seriously called into question. 
More importantly, the question remains, how could Iraq have financed this deal? Well, surely the Russians were not going to sell such equipment in exchange for worthless Iraqi dinars. The deal had to be financed with dollars, had to be financed with hard currency. But how could Iraq amass millions in hard currency in the face of 7 years of U.N. sanctions? 
Well, Mr. President, there is only one answer. It is an obvious one. The only mechanism that Iraq has to enable it to gain hard currency is to export its oil. There is virtually nothing else, besides dates and some agriculture products, that Iraq has to export. 
Prior to the U.N. sanctions in 1990, Iraq had exports of $10.4 billion. Of that amount, more than 95 percent--or almost $10 billion--was derived from oil exports. Clearly, Iraq's capacity to purchase equipment in the world market to develop weapons of mass destruction is directly linked to its ability to sell oil, and only oil. 
Ever since the gulf war ended, Iraq has been shipping oil into Jordan. Initially, Jordan received about 60,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day. That figure has recently climbed to over 80,000 barrels 
a day, and in an agreement reached in December, the oil trade between Iraq and Jordan is scheduled to climb to 96,000 barrels a day. 
Although the Jordanians claim that the oil is traded for food and medicine, I personally find it hard to believe that, with millions of dollars worth of oil and products daily crossing the Iraq/Jordanian border, that some of that oil is not leaking into the world market or that hard currency and sophisticated machinery are not flowing back into Iraq. As a matter of fact, we know that oil is leaking out. 
Moreover, there is a great deal of evidence that Iraqi oil is being shipped across the border into Turkey. Dollars are surely being traded in exchange for the oil, and those dollars are likely to be used to finance Saddam's factories of death. 
In addition, Mr. President, the Multinational Interdiction Force, the MIF, that conducts maritime searches in the Persian Gulf reported factually last fall that exports of contraband Iraqi oil through the gulf and jumped sevenfold in the past year, from $10 million in diesel fuel sales in 1996 to $75 million in 1997. Much of that oil is believed to be transshipped through Iran and the United Arab Emirates and on to the world market. 
What does Saddam do with the revenues from those contraband sales? Well, he keeps his weapons factories running, keeps the Republican Guards well armed and fed. 
Mr. President, the United States has been concerned about the hardships, of course, that the economic sanctions have imposed on the people of Iraq. Our conflict is not with the Iraqi people; it is with the dictator who has run that country for some 19 years while depriving the people of the basic dignities of life and slaughtering some tens of thousands of minority citizens of Iraq. 
In 1995, the United States supported a fundamental weakening of the economic sanctions against Iraq. We supported a resolution permitting Iraq to sell $1 billion worth of oil every 90 days under the oil-for-food program. I believe this was a weakening of the sanctions, and as a consequence was a mistake. 
What this has done is it has allowed Saddam to import food and medicine for the Iraqi people, which is true and certainly worthy, but it has also made it far easier for Saddam to divert some of the investment billions that he has hidden in accounts around the world. Prior to the oil-for-food program, Saddam had to use these investment profits to import food and medicine. The oil-for-food program frees up his investment profits to purchase equipment that can enhance all of his weapons capabilities, including his capacity to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. 
Mr. President, I believe that the United States must make every effort now to ensure that Saddam cannot use his oil assets to obtain more hard currency for weapons programs. 
That is why I am introducing the resolution today. The resolution specifically urges the President to oppose any measure that weakens the international sanctions that permit Iraq to export oil. 
Recently, the Secretary-General of the United Nations recommended a significant easing of the Iraq sanctions and proposed that Iraq be permitted to sell more than twice as much oil as is currently permitted. Under this proposal, Iraq could conceivably sell $10.4 billion worth of oil in a single year. I was shocked to learn that this administration has indicated it would support this unwarranted expansion of Iraqi oil exports. Mr. President, if this U.N. proposal is adopted we might just as well end all sanctions on Iraq. Mr. President, $10.4 billion dollars was the amount of oil that Iraq exported before her invasion of Kuwait. Are we going to allow Iraq to to return to that level of exports and still retain a public stance in support of sanctions? That proposal makes a mockery of the sanctions. 
My concurrent resolution would also urge the President to develop measures that will tighten the oil embargo on Iraq and prevent the leakage into the would marketplace that we have seen over the past few years. It also urges the President to try and convince both the Governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to end their boycott of Jordan and begin making subsidized oil sales to Jordan to replace the Iraqi oil. The Jordanian border is one of the most porous in the Middle East and the Jordanians are forced to trade with Iraq primarily because the Saudis and Kuwaitis will not sell Jordan oil. That policy may have made sense immediately after the gulf war but today it must be reconsidered. If we can replace 96,000 barrels of oil that Jordan imports from Iraq, we will have made a significant step toward tightening the flow of dollars to Iraq. 
Mr. President, oil is the key to controlling the future military capacity and capabilities of Iraq, and we must move more vigilantly in our efforts to stop the leakage of Iraqi oil onto the would market if we are going to contain Saddam Hussein. 
Mr. President, let me again highlight the specifics of the resolution I just introduced. The resolution urges the administration to oppose any further weakening of economic sanctions against Iraq. The resolution urges the President to propose to the United Nations measures to significantly tighten the international embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, including efforts to strengthen the multilateral interdiction force so that these illegal shipments can be stopped. And finally, the resolution urges the President to enter into negotiations with oil producing nations in the gulf to encourage these nations to make subsidized sales of oil to Jordan. 
Mr. President, recognizing the concern that we all share over developments in Iraq since the Persian Gulf war, we are faced with the necessity to take a hard look at our options. One option is the strategic bombing of the sites where we believe we have enough information to satisfy ourselves that a strike will have a meaningful impact. On the other hand, strategic bombing is likely to result in television shots of injured children and women that undoubtedly will be placed as human shields around strategic sites in Iraq. 
Another option is the use of ground forces to back up an air campaign to try and take out Saddam Hussein himself. Although the United States has significant resources, there is a recognition that a ground strike under current circumstances is unlikely given the increasing likelihood that American solders would lose their lives. Of course there is also the unanswered question of what we would do if Saddam survived such an attack? 
With either of these options we must address the reality that we do not have the multilateral coalition which included our Arab neighbors that we had when the Bush administration initiated Desert Storm. I think it is unfortunate that this administration has not maintained that coalition. So now we are pretty much alone. Great Britain, Canada and Australia are with us, and for that we are grateful, but from there on it gets pretty lonesome. 
Going it alone or going it with others, we still must talk 
about the end game. If Saddam Hussein survives, do we continue these same efforts in another few years? Are we going to give Saddam Hussein carte blanche in his ability to recover? Because he will recover by selling oil. That is what he has. 
Saddam Hussein has been able to generate roughly $1 billion per quarter from the sale of oil. There is information--and unfortunately I can't reveal some of the information because it is classified--concerning the large amount of illegal oil that is flowing out of Iraq. And we are not able to stop this flow both because there are not enough multilateral intervention force (MIF) vessels in the area and because the rules of engagement under which the MIF forces operate don't allow them to stop such illegal movement. 
It is these illegal sales that are primarily fueling Iraq's economy. Mr. President, it simply makes sense to this Senator to recognize that oil is the lifeblood of Iraq. We need to shut off this lifeblood, maybe through a combination of increased enforcement of the embargo and jawboning some of our allies who are purchasing Iraq's oil. Perhaps we need to go further, and consider the merits of a maritime blockade of some sort. A blockade certainly is not an unreasonable alternative when you consider that we might initiate a military action against Saddam. Stop Saddam Hussein's oil and you shut down his ability to funnel resources into his war machine and the economy, and ultimately, I think his regime will collapse. 
As a Congress, we must address the issue of oil sales and we must do it in a prompt manner. I believe we must terminate these illegal sales of oil and we must be more vigilant in our oversight to ensure that the oil that is allowed to be sold under the sanctions and the dollars generated are really going for the benefit of the people and their social needs. That is the basis of my resolution. We must stop Saddam Hussein's ability to fund his war machine by cutting off his ability to supply the markets with Iraqi oil. That is an action that we should have taken some time ago. 
I urge my colleagues to consider the merits of my concurrent resolution. It is certainly appropriate to consider this action as we address the merits of any further military action that might be contemplated to stop Saddam from whatever his ultimate objective is. Cut off his oil and you are going to get his attention.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this bill to rename the Washington National Airport `Ronald Reagan National Airport.' 
I am disappointed in the partisanship and delay tactics involved in stalling this legislation. Personally, I can think of no more fitting tribute to our 40th President then renaming the main airport facility for visitors to our nation's capital. 
During his eight years in as President, Ronald Reagan stood as a President of principle, integrity and optimism. He took America at a time of great disillusionment--gasoline shortages, hyper-Inflation and American diplomats held hostage abroad--and transformed our spirit through vision and leadership 
President Reagan showed America that leadership is not making promises, it's keeping promises. 
Ronald Reagan promised us a better future and he delivered. His message was simple: America can be better. His charm, wit and eloquence combined to communicate exactly the message that Americans needed to hear. And the nation reacted: 
Interest rates, inflation and unemployment fell faster under President Reagan than they did immediately before or after his Presidency; 
The nation experienced a 31% increase in real, inflation-adjusted gross national product; 
Exports increased 92.6% and manufacturing increased by 48%; 
Median family income grew every year during his Presidency for an increase of nearly $4000, after years of zero-growth in pre-Reagan years; 
In short, during the Reagan era, economic growth was 
stronger, job creation was faster, incomes were higher and productivity was healthier. 
President Reagan's accomplishments were achieved because he believed that a healthy economy should create opportunities and reward responsibility and work. In his first inaugural address he told us:  
It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work work with us, not over us; stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it. 
Some people believe that President Reagan's greatest legacy was the restoration of pride and optimism in America. He made us believe in ourselves and told us: `There are no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits on the human capacity for intelligence, imagination and wonder.' 
Americans reawakened to themselves as a great people with a great future. A notable Democrat, our former colleague, Majority Leader George Mitchell said, `Like President Roosevelt, President Reagan possesses a legendary ability to inspire in Americans pride in their nation and faith in its future.' 
And, perhaps, our colleague Senator Ted Kennedy said it best in a quote from the Boston Globe in 1989: `He (Reagan) has restored the public's confidence in the presidency. For that alone, he deserves our appreciation.' 
Not only did President Reagan restore our sense of purpose and meaning as a great country, but it was because of his vision and commitment to freedom and democracy that today there is no longer a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. There is today, no longer a Berlin Wall. 
These two seminal events of the 20th century are a direct result of the policies of President Reagan. Our children and grandchildren will know a level of security and peace well into the next century because President Reagan understood that peace can only be achieved and maintained when we provide the full measure of resources to our men and women in the military who stand guard to protect liberty 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. 
Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues to help demonstrate to President Reagan that appreciation. I ask my colleagues to help me in passing S. 1575.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will allow more sensible investment of the funds jointly received by the Federal Government and the State of Alaska from the civil settlement of damages arising from the Exxon Valdez oilspill. 
The settlement provided for Exxon to pay the Federal and State governments a total of $900 million over a 10-year period ending in 2001. Approximately $280 million remains to be paid under this agreement. Under the consent decree, the money is to be used for the recovery of damaged resources, and is to be managed as a joint Federal-State trust fund, administered by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, which includes representatives of three Federal and three State agencies. Under the consent decree, moneys not immediately expended are to be placed with the U.S. District Court, Fifth Circuit Court Registry Investment System. 
Recently, the trustees requested that Congress adopt measures to allow them to invest this money outside the Court Registry Investment System, in which earnings are limited to approximately 5 percent, and are further reduced by fees of 10 percent of the earnings. In the opinion of the trustees, even extremely conservative investment outside the court registry could yield an additional $20 to $30 million by 2002, which could greatly enhance continuing restoration projects. 
This bill responds to the trustees' request. It will allow investment outside the court registry system. Let me emphasize, however, that this authority is entirely discretionary. The trustees may use it to reinvest settlement moneys or not, as they deem appropriate. Further, Mr. President, as an added protection, the district court must approve any reinvestment. 
The bill also directs that the earnings on the new investment be used for marine research and monitoring, and for community and fishing industry economic restoration. This provision is needed to ensure attention to these important areas. 
Here again, let me make sure I am absolutely clear. The bill I am offering does not prevent the purchase of land or easements. It simply directs that the earnings--and only the earnings--on new investment go to other, equally valid purposes. 
The trustee council has already spent a large part of the money received from Exxon on land acquisition and easements that limit the use of land it has not purchased outright. To date, the total is about 424,000 acres, and the trustees' intention is to purchase or restrict as much as 750,000 acres. 
The Federal Government already owns 248 million acres of Alaska--more than the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, which is home to one-third of the entire population of the United States. Inside the spill area, there already are 20 different parcels of protected State and Federal lands, including the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and the Chugach National Forest and Copper River Delta Critical Habitat Area. 
Many of the trustees' additional land acquisitions have been for the purpose of habitat protection, and are valuable to the trustees' restoration mission, but some have included the purchase of land that has already been logged or land on which public access is restricted despite being purchased by public funds. These purchases are not so easy to justify. 
The trustees have already published plans to spend almost all of the $900 million. By the time Exxon makes its last payment, the only money not already spent will be the 12 percent the council is tucking away in a restoration reserve. 
After inflation-proofing, interest on this account could provide about $2.1 million annually for long-term research and economic reconstruction projects--or could vanish in more land acquisitions. 
Finally, Mr. President, my bill also provides for the new investment authority to sunset in 2002 unless the trustees bring to Congress their thoughts on how an independent board might be created to administer the funds remaining after 2002. Personally, I'd like to see them recommend an independent, scientifically-oriented group to guide a long-term research program--a board that would call for proposals, arrange for scientific peer review, publish findings, and so forth, without the appearance of conflict that exists when the trustees are funding projects in which their own agencies are involved. 
This is a responsible approach to a difficult issue. It gives the trustees the additional investment authority they want without prohibiting them from spending principal or the earnings from investments that remain in the court registry system however they choose, including more land acquisition. It does, however, encourage them to look at some areas that are equally important to the task of once again making whole both the resources and the people affected by the oil spill.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today we are on the verge of a revolution, the revolution of the transmission and distribution of electricity that is fast bringing about competition and deregulation to both the wholesale and retail level. Nowhere has the competitive model advanced further than in the State of California, where full deregulation will become a reality at the beginning of 1998. As many as 13 other States representing one-third of America have moved to competition in the electric industry. These are States with a significant population center. 
On Saturday, November 8, I introduced legislation referred to the Finance Committee, and I believe that it will enhance the States' ability to facilitate competition. 
The legislation arises from the Energy Committee's intensive review of the electric power industry and from the Joint Tax Committee's report that I requested. 
Over the past two Congresses, the committee has held 14 hearings and workshops on competitive change in the electric power industry, receiving testimony from more than 130 witnesses. One of the workshops specifically focused on how public power utilities will participate in the competitive marketplace. At these and in other forums, concerns have been expressed by representatives of public power about the potential jeopardy to their tax-exempt bonds if they participate in State competitive programs, or if they transmit power pursuant to FERC Order No. 888, or pursuant to a Federal Power Act section 211 transmission order. 
The Joint Tax Committee report, titled `Federal Income Tax Issues Arising in Connection with Proposal to Restructure the Electric Power Industry,' concluded that current tax laws effectively preclude public power utilities from participating in State open access restructuring plans without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of their bonds. Under the tax law, if the private use and interest restriction is violated, the utility's bonds become retroactively taxable. 
These concerns have been echoed by the FERC. For example, in FERC Order No. 888, the Commission stated the reciprocal transmission service by a municipal utility will not be required if providing such service would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the municipal utility. A similar concern exists if FERC issues a transmission order under section 211 of the Federal Power Act. 
Mr. President, if consumers and businesses are to maximize the full benefits of 
open competition in this industry it will be necessary for all electricity providers to interconnect their facilities into the entire electric grid. Unfortunately, this system efficiency is significantly impaired because of current tax law rules that effectively preclude public power entities--entities that financed their facilities with tax-exempt bonds--from participating in State open access restructuring plans and Federal transmission programs, without jeopardizing the exempt status of their bonds. 
No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become retroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in a State open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial markets and could undermine the financial stability of many municipalities. At the same time, public power should not obtain a competitive advantage in the open marketplace based on the Federal subsidy that flows from the ability to issue tax-exempt debt. Clearly we must provide for the transition to allow public providers to enter the private competitive marketplace without severe economic dislocation for municipalities and consumers. 
To remedy this dilemma, I have introduced legislation that will allow municipal utilities to interconnect and compete in the open marketplace without the draconian retroactive impacts currently required by the Tax Code. My bill is modeled after legislation that passed Congress last year which addressed electricity and gas generation and distribution by local furnishers. 
My bill removes the current law impediments to public power's capacity to participate in open access plans if such entities are willing to forego future use of federally subsidized tax-exempt financing. If public power entities make this election, and choose to compete on a level playing field with other electric power suppliers, tax exemption of the interest on their outstanding debt will be unaffected. They will be allowed an extended period during which outstanding bonds subject to the private use restrictions may be retired instead of retroactive taxation, which is the situation under existing law. The relief provided by my bill applies equally to outstanding bonds for electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. This would occur 6 months after the date of the bonds. 
Mr. President, without this legislation, public power will face an untenable choice: either stay out of the competitive marketplace or face the threat of retroactive taxability of their bonds. With this legislation, public power will be able to transition into the 
competitive marketplace. 
Let me provide a few examples of real-world choices that public power faces today. According to the Joint Tax Committee report, the mere act of transferring public power transmission lines to a privately operated independent service operator [ISO] could cause the public entity's tax exempt bonds to be retroactively taxable. Similarly, a transfer of transmission lines to a State operated ISO could, in many instances, trigger similar retroactive loss of tax-exemption depending on the amount or value of the power that is transmitted along those lines to private users. Moreover, participation in a State open access plan could, de facto, force public power entities to take defensive actions to maintain their competitive position which could inevitably lead to retroactive taxation of their bonds. Such actions would include offering a discounted rate to selective customers or selling excess capacity to a broker for resale under long-term contract at fixed rates or discounted rates. 
I have also heard from the California Governor and members of the California Legislature about many of these problems and the need for legislation to address them. I stand ready to work with them and representatives from other States to solve this problem as part of the legislation I have introduced. 
Mr. President, my bill allows public power to participate in the new competitive world and provides a safe harbor within which they can transition from tax-exempt financing to the level playing field of the competitive marketplace. In addition, the legislation recognizes that there are some transactions that public power entities engage in that should not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of their bonds under current law and seeks to protect those transactions by codifying the rules governing them. This list may need to be expanded and I look forward to the input of the affected utilities in this regard. 
In general, the exceptions contained in this bill closely parallel the policies enunciated in the legislative history of the amendments made in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. For example, the sale of electricity by one public power entity to another public power entity for resale by the second public power entity would be exempt so long as the second public power entity is not participating in a State open access plan. In addition, a public power entity would be allowed to enter into pooling and swap arrangements with other utilities if the public power entity is not a net seller of output, determined on an annual basis. Finally, the bill contains a de minimis exception for sale of excess output by a facility when such sales do not exceed $1 million. 
Mr. President, this legislation attempts to balance many competing interests. This will be a difficult transition and this legislation does not address all the difficult problems to be faced. This is why I emphasize today that this is a starting point for discussion over the months ahead. 
I look forward to receiving comments from all interested parties and will encourage Finance Committee Chairman Roth to hold hearings on this bill early next year. 
I am open to making revisions to this bill consistent with a public policy that emphasizes a level playing field and a soft transition to competition for our important public utilities. I look forward especially to working with the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, who has been a leader in addressing tax issues relating to competition in this industry.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to legislation pending before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee which will facilitate and promote the successful commercial reuse of the Naval Air Facility being closed on Adak Island, Alaska. The underlying legislation will ratify an agreement between the Aleut Corporation in Alaska, the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Navy concerning the reuse of lands occupied by the Navy. 
When the Navy's lease expires in October of next year the lands and facilities are to be relinquished back to the Department of the Interior for inclusion into the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The legislation introduced yesterday will facilitate the transfer of that land to Aleut Corporation in exchange for other ANCSA land selections made by the Aleuts. The amendment I offer today will ensure that the private property on Adak Island is transferred to the Aleuts as well as the land and interests in that land. Without this amendment, Mr. President, the facilities constructed on Adak Island by the Navy cannot be placed into productive civilian use. If we are to help the Aleut Corporation establish a community on Adak the ability to use these facilities is critical. 
I look forward to moving the underlying legislation and this amendment through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee early next year.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will facilitate and promote the successful commercial reuse of the Naval Air Facility being closed on Adak Island, AK. This legislation will ratify an agreement between the Aleut Corp. in Alaska, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Navy. 
While not yet complete, the Aleut Corp. has been working together with the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Navy on the agreement that would be ratified by this legislation. I know from my Aleutian constituents that a good number of issues have been resolved through extracted negotiations, but that important issues remain on the table. it is my hope that the remaining issues can be resolved through mutual agreement prior to hearings on this bill early next year. In the meantime, it is imperative that the Navy make the facilities at Adak available for interim reuse, as has been done with transfers at other closed facilities. 
For many decades the Navy has been an important and steadfast constituent in Alaska's Aleutian Chain. Their presence was first established during World War II with the selection and development of the island because of its combination of ability to support a major airfield and its natural and protected deep water port. The Navy's presence there contributed greatly to the defense of our Pacific coast during World War II and throughout the cold war. Through the Navy's presence, Adak became the largest development in the Aleutians as well as Alaska's sixth largest community. 
The facility was selected for closure during the last base closure round, and while the importance of using the island for defense purposes has diminished, it has not lost any of its unique geographic advantages. Adak is a natural stepping stone to Asia and is at the crossroads of air and sea trade between North America, Europe, and Asia. The Aleutian Islands, although stark and desolate to some, are the ancestral home to the shareholders of the Aleut Corp. This legislation will allow Adak's natural constituents, the Aleut people, to reinhabit the island and to make use of its modern developments. 
These very same features that made Adak strategically important to the Navy for defense purposes make the island strategically important for commercial purposes. Adak Island is at the middle of the great expanse of the Aleutian Islands, and is among the island chain's southernmost islands, near to the great circle route shipping lanes. With the ability to use Adak commercially, the Aleut Corp. aims to make the island an important intercontinental location with enterprise enough to provide year round jobs for the Aleut people. These goals are consistent with the promises and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the legislation that created the corporation. 
The legislation supports the broader interests of the country as well. In addition to the Navy, Adak has housed the Department of the Interior's Aleutian Islands subunit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. This legislation promotes the Department of the Interior's interests in managing and protecting the refuge by the exchange of base lands for certain property interests the Aleut Corp. holds throughout the rest of the Aleutian Islands refuge. In addition to the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defense is promoting this exchange as the most effective way to meet this country's objectives of conversion of closed defense facilities into successful commercial reuse. 
Many potential concurrent reuse possibilities of the Adak lands are being explored. These include but are certainly not limited to an air and sea transhipment, refueling and reprovisions facility, a new ecotourism cruise ship destination, a law enforcement or Job Corps training facility or a somewhat less glamorous but nonetheless needed correctional facility. All these are possibilities available through enactment of this legislation. 
Mr. President, it is my intention to hold a hearing on this legislation at the earliest opportunity when Congress returns next year. I suggest to all the parties to this agreement that I will be keeping a close eye on progress toward expedient closure on the final issues. If progress is not made, or if negotiated commitments are not honored, I am prepared to modify this legislation and direct an appropriate structure for this land exchange.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of low-level waste in this country and the issue of Ward Valley. California is the first State to site a low-level waste facility under legislation passed by Congress which granted States with the authority and responsibility for low-level waste. Low-level radioactive waste is produced from cancer treatments, medical research, industrial activities, and scientific research. In the State of California there are some 800 sites where this medical waste is being stored. It is being stored in temporary facilities that were not designed for permanent storage. 
This waste is stored near homes, schools, it's stored at college campuses, medical facilities, and so forth. 
This radioactive waste is vulnerable to accidental release from the fires and earthquakes, neither of which are uncommon in California. 
Public health and safety demands that this waste be moved from locations scattered across California to a single, monitored location--preferably, in a remote and sparsely populated area. 
The State of California is the first State to take advantage of the Federal process that we authorized for the States to develop their own low-level waste sites. But it is interesting to note how the progress has gone--not because of the lack of commitment by California, but the lack of cooperation from the Department of Interior to simply conduct a very simple land exchange. 
The State of California, in a process which began a decade ago, is trying to get their facility opened. They selected a site known as Ward Valley in the remote Mojave Desert. 
The California license was issued in accordance with all State and Federal laws, and has withstood all court challenges. The license contains 130 specific conditions designed to protect public health, safety, and the environment. 
But here comes the villain--the Department of Interior--having earlier agreed to sell California the land for the site--changed its mind, returned the check, and has refused to transfer the land. 
Since that time, the Department of the Interior has engaged in continuous, purposeful delay. They seek more studies, allegedly to assure that the site will be safe. 
We all insist on a safe disposal site, and we expect no less. Thus far, we have had two environmental impact studies and a special National Academy of Science study that all point to the safety of the site. 
Now, the State of California, in accordance with the guidelines of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and all applicable State and Federal laws, has done its job and done it well. But the Interior Department is still not satisfied. They want more studies. For starters, they insist on an additional water infiltration study and a third impact environmental statement. 
The State of California has generously agreed to perform the water infiltration study prior to any land transfer which was a tremendous concession on California's part. However, Interior has not thus far allowed California access to the land to conduct the very tests that Interior insists upon. Instead of working to resolve the matter, the Department of the Interior seems to be engaged in a cycle of continuous study and endless delay. One has to wonder why the Department of the Interior is taking such a tack. 
Are these delays and demands for more tests designed to assure public safety? Or are they merely part of a carefully orchestrated public relations campaign? Well, we can answer that question. 
Several weeks ago, a memo we uncovered from the Department of the Interior shed an extraordinary light on this question. In fact, this memo makes the motivations behind the Interior Department's actions absolutely clear. 
I have read this memorandum once on the floor of this body. 
I think it needs to be read again. This is a memo from Deputy Secretary John Garamendi, to Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Department of the Interior. It is short enough to read in its entirety. 
It says:  
February 21, 1996 
Memorandum 
To: Bruce Babbitt 
From: John Garamendi 
Subject: Ward Valley 
Attached are the Ward Valley clips. We have taken the high ground. [Governor Pete] Wilson is the venal toady of special interests. 
I do not think GreenPeace will picket you any longer. I will maintain a heavy PR campaign until the issue is firmly won. 
There you have the words of John Garamendi relative to his willingness to work with California to act in order that the low-level waste at some 800 sites in California can be removed and put in one area that will be monitored out in the Mojave Desert. 
I think this memorandum shows that Ward Valley has become a political football, a public relations issue. It also suggests that Interior has no plans other than to delay the transfer of the land. They just want to wage a PR campaign and delay a decision until somebody else's watch. They don't want to make this decision on their watch. They are putting it off because they know this administration is a few years from becoming history. They don't want to address it, they don't want the responsibility. 
But what has Secretary Garamendi told the Senate with regard to Ward Valley? How do his private statements compare to his public ones? 
At his confirmation hearing on July 27, 1995, John Garamendi testified under oath to our committee that the Ward Valley issue should and would be resolved quickly. Two years later, at a hearing on July 22, 1997, John Garamendi told the committee that he would work in good faith to resolve the matter in further negotiations with the State of California. 
Well, we still don't have a resolution. California does not even have permission to do the additional testing Interior seems to want to see performed. 
Instead of moving a process forward and transferring the land, Interior seems intent on waging a public relations campaign designed to further delay rather than enlighten. 
Now, what have others said about the Interior Department's handling of this issue? Let's look at the experts. 
The General Accounting Office, GAO, contends that the Department of the Interior is attempting to assess the site's suitability--a job that belongs to California by law and that California has already undertaken and completed--despite the fact that Interior `lacks the criteria and expertise' for the job. That is the opinion of the General Accounting Office--that Interior lacks the criteria and expertise. 
The GAO report also contends that there is no need for the new environmental impact statement sought by Interior since the substantive issues have already been addressed and that new information uncovered since the last environmental impact statement is generally favorable to the facility. 
Well, this report is too lengthy to insert into the Record, but for the benefit of my colleagues, I am referring to GAO report RCED-97-184, dated July 1997, for anybody who might want to look it up. 
To again summarize what GAO says, Mr. President, it says: First, Interior is trying to do a job that belongs to the State of California. The State of California was given the authority to do it; second, Interior is calling for new studies that aren't needed; third, Interior lacks the technical expertise to even perform these tasks. 
GAO isn't alone in their criticism of the Department of Interior's handling of this issue. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, has joined in the process as well. 
Specifically, the NRC has been critical of the Interior Department for distributing fact sheets which contain errors, misleading statements, and information falsely attributed to the NRC that was actually provided by project opponents. 
That is pretty strong stuff, Mr. President, but that is factual. 
So not only is Interior waging a PR campaign, they are playing fast and loose with the truth in the conduct of that campaign, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, you might ask, why would a Senator from Alaska even care about a facility in California that is not needed to dispose of radioactive waste generated in Alaska? We don't generate hardly any. 
Part of the answer involves my responsibilities as the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and our oversight responsibilities. Not surprisingly, my position on Ward Valley is the same one taken by my predecessor as chairman, Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. He understood, as I do, that Ward Valley is really more than a debate over the future of a thousand acres of land in the Mojave Desert; it is more than a debate over the disposition of low-level radioactive waste in California, Arizona, and the Dakotas; it is even more than the debate over the viability or even the future of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. I suggest there is much more at stake. 
I am taking on this battle because there is an intrinsic value in opposing the careless disregard of science and the decisionmaking process. It's important to stand up against those who engage in this dangerous manipulation of public fear. It is my job to work against the oppression of the public good by a vocal few. Because I very much care about human health, safety and the environment, I believe it makes sense to store this radioactive low-level waste at a single, monitored location in the desert, rather than at 800-some locations throughout California, near schools, neighborhoods, hospitals, medical centers, and so forth. 
Finally, I believe it is important to ensure that the Government keeps its promises. It was the intent of Congress, when it passed the Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980, and further amended it in 1985, that the safe management of low-level radioactive waste would be a responsibility of the States. That is precisely what the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, lobbied for when he was Governor. He argued that low-level waste should be a State responsibility. At that time, he was serving with the now President, but then Governor, Bill Clinton in the National Governors' Association. Well, he has changed his position. 
I know the view from the top floor of the Department of the Interior changes one's perspective from time to time, but it's difficult to appreciate, much less justify, the actions of the Department in this regard. 
Are the continuing delays at Ward Valley the good-faith actions of public officials purporting to act in the public interest? I think not. 
To answer those questions, I am announcing today that we are going to explore, in great detail on the committee, the Ward Valley issue in the next session, with a series of investigatory oversight hearings. What we are attempting to obtain, obviously, are the facts on why this administrative bungling seems to continue. I would like all who have an interest in this issue to be aware that these hearings will commence early in the next session. 
In the interim, we will be seeking relevant documentation from the Department of the Interior and the White House. With that notice given, I thank you, Mr. President, and yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues a little oversight on an issue that will be coming before this body again, and it covers the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions taking place in both California and Montana. I have the obligation as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to initiate authorization of these matters. I have had an active interest in the decisions of the Clinton administration to acquire the Headwaters Forest in northern California, and the New World Mine Site in Montana. 
These decisions were made by the administration with little congressional involvement and the administration has now gone out of its way to, in my opinion, limit the role of Congress in how these properties actually are acquired. 
Originally, the administration proposed acquiring both of these properties through land exchanges. When that proved to be very difficult and impossible to do without going through Congress, the idea of land exchanges was abandoned. So clearly the objective was to circumvent Congress. 
The Clinton administration then proposed using $315 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to purchase both of these properties. 
The administration then insisted, contrary to the provisions of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, that such money could be spent without specific congressional authorization, clearly intending to go around Congress. 
Ultimately, that argument failed. While I would have preferred to enact separate authorizing legislation, authorizations were contained within the 1998 Interior Appropriations bill. 
However, the authorizations do not take effect and the money cannot be spent until a minimum of 180 days after enactment, and then only if no separate authorizing legislation is enacted. 
During the 180-day review period, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I intend to conduct a series of oversight hearings to examine the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions. One focus of these oversight hearings will be the appraised value of the properties. To date the Clinton administration has refused to conduct appraisals to determine fair market values. This failure is in direct contradiction of existing law, which requires the appraisals be conducted for any Federal land acquisition. The appropriators had the foresight, of course, to recognize this hypocrisy. 
Fair market value appraisals for both properties must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The appraisals also must be reviewed, and independently analyzed by the Comptroller General of the United States. 
Once these appraisals are completed, I intend to closely examine them. I plan to look at the methodology and data used in the appraisals. Among the specific questions, I will ask: 
Do the appraisals comply with the Department of Justice's Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions? 
What criteria were employed to determine fair market value? 
What assumptions were made about the property and the use of the property? 
What was the scope of the appraisal? 
It is important to remember that neither the Headwaters Forest nor New World Mine acquisitions can proceed, absent these appraisals. So these appraisals must be done. 
Further, Congress will have, at a minimum, 60 days to examine the appraisals. For every day, after 120 days, that appraisals are not submitted to Congress, the 180 day period will be extended by 1 day. 
I also intend to examine during the 180 day review period, the true cost to the American taxpayer of the Headwaters Forest acquisition. A condition to the Headwaters Forest acquisition is that the current owner of the property can take on his Federal taxes, as a business loss, the difference between what he contends is the property's fair market value and the price the Federal Government and California are paying for the property. That differential is $700 million. 
In the event the owner receives such a ruling from the IRS, there will be a lost of tax revenue to the Federal treasury. This lost tax revenue could amount to $100 million or more. It is inaccurate to say that the Headwaters Forest is costing the American taxpayer $250 million. It could well cost the American taxpayer not only the $250 million cash purchase price but also this lost tax revenue. Under no circumstances should this total cost exceed the appraised value of the Headwaters Forest. 
As to the New World Mine acquisition, I intend to examine exactly what land or interests in the land the Federal Government is acquiring for $65 million from the mining company. This issue needs to be examined because the agreement, committing the United States to buy this property, incredibly does not answer this question. 
The mining company, which agreed to sell, owns or has under lease, interests in nearly 6,000 acres. However, the mining company has fee title to only 1,700 acres. The remainder is unpatented mining claims. The ownership situation is further complicated by the fact that most of the interests in the 6,000 acres are owned by a third party not a signatory to the agreement with the Federal Government. Congress, and the American taxpayer, have a right to know, what we are getting for $65 million. 
There are many other issues that my committee will examine about these acquisitions including: 
What is the status of the Habitat Conservation Plan for the land surrounding the Headwaters Forest? 
What impact will that Habitat Conservation Plan have on other property owners in the western United States and Pacific Northwest? 
Has California come up with its $130 million share of the purchase price for the Headwaters Forest? 
Do both acquisitions comply with the terms of the National Environmental Policy Act? 
How will the properties be managed? 
By whom? 
At what cost? 
How will the public access the Headwaters Forest? 
Is it good public policy to settle constitutional takings cases against the United States in this manner? 
Is it good public policy to settle environmental litigation in this manner? 
How does the Clinton administration interpret the phrase `priority Federal land acquisitions?' 
Are the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions consistent with the Federal land management policy on Federal land acquisitions? 
While this may seem like an exhaustive list of issue, I only have skimmed the surface of the numerous unanswered questions about the acquisitions. 
I want all of these questions answered before the acquisitions occur. It is in the interest of the taxpayers. It is the responsibility of this body. 
My goal is to ensure, despite the uncommon circumstances which have led us to this point, that Congress and the American people can have confidence in the decisions to acquire the Headwaters Forest and the New World Mine in the interest of the taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see several Senators seeking recognition, including the majority leader.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to introduce legislation relative to the benefits of community health aides. This particular legislation would be titled the Alaskan Community Health Aide Program Expansion Act of 1997. The purpose of the act would be to provide a link to health care for rural communities, primarily in my State. 
The Alaskan Community Health Aide Program Expansion Act would enable the health aides to have access to rural, non-Native communities throughout Alaska. The act will authorize training and continuing education of Alaskans as community health aides to small communities that do not currently qualify for the Indian Health Services' Community Health Aide Program. 
Mr. President, some 50 years ago, this unique system of community health aides was formed in my State. In the early 1940's, due to an extreme outbreak of tuberculosis across Alaska, volunteers were selected by local communities and trained as community health aides. These communities, of course, suffered from distance, extreme isolation. They were often located hundreds of miles from the nearest physician. And the community health aides, through radio contact to a distant hospital in the region, became the eyes, the ears and hands of a physician and administered life-saving medications to remote patients throughout the State. 
Today, through the Indian Health Services, the aides reside in 176 Alaskan-Native communities, small isolated communities throughout our State--which if you spread Alaska across the United States, in a proportional map it would run from Canada to Mexico, from California to Florida. So we are talking about a big piece of real estate, Mr. President. 
These aides, today, through telecommunications capability with physicians in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other urban areas, provide health care, provide disease prevention throughout our State. The health aides are broadly acknowledged as the backbone of rural health delivery for Alaska's Native people. 
However, Mr. President, there is a large void in Alaska's Community Health Aide Program. Approximately 50 of our local Alaskan communities do not have community health aides because the people who live there are non-Native, and thus they do not qualify for the service under current law. 
In these 50, 51 communities, there is no physician, there is no other health care provider of any kind. Instead, these communities are served by public health care nurses who come and go on an itinerant basis. In other words, Mr. President, health care access in these communities is infrequent at best. 
Often these non-Native communities are characterized by geographic isolation and cultural isolation, especially in areas such as the Russian communities of Nikolaevsk, Vosnesenda, Katchmaksel, and Rassdonla. 
Most of these communities are completely unconnected by roads. Access is only available by airplane, boat, and sometimes snowmachine or dogsled. The needs of these communities is a daunting task. 
The Community Health Aide Program Expansion Act would remedy this dilemma. For the first time in the history of our State, all communities and villages will have the opportunity to have health care available within a village. This legislation will enable the trained health aide to live within a community, teach basic disease prevention and health promotion, in other words, the basic skills for good health. 
Mr. President, this legislation will enable affordable and consistent access to health care to all Alaskan communities. 
I ask my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to establish the historic lighthouse preservation bill. This legislation would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to establish a historic lighthouse preservation program within the Department of the Interior. 
The legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of General Services to establish a process for conveying historic lighthouses which are around our coastal areas and Great Lakes when these lighthouses have been deemed to be in excess of Federal needs of the agency owning and operating the lighthouse. 
For entities eligible to receive a historic lighthouse, it would be for the uses of educational, park, recreation, cultural, and historic preservation. And the agencies that would be included would be Federal or State agencies, local governments, nonprofit corporations, educational agencies, and community development organizations, and so forth. 
There is no question that the historic lighthouses would be conveyed in a nonfee structure to selected entities which would have the obligation to maintain these historic structures and maintain their integrity. 
The historic lighthouses would revert back to the United States if a property ceases to be used for education, park, recreation, cultural or historic preservation purposes, or failed to be maintained in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act. 
Mr. President, as I said, I rise today to introduce legislation that will establish a national historic light station program. 
Lighthouses are among the most romantic reminders of our country's maritime heritage. Marking dangerous headlands, shoals, bars, and reefs, these structures played a vital role in indicating navigable waters and supporting this Nation's maritime transportation and commerce. These lighthouses served the needs of the early mariners who navigated by visual sightings on landmarks, coastal lights, and the heavens. Hundreds of lighthouses have been built along our sea coasts and on the Great Lakes, creating the world's most complex aids to navigation system. No other national lighthouse system compares with that of the United States in size and diversity of architectural and engineering types. 
My legislation pays tribute to this legacy and establishes a process which will ensure the protection and maintenance of these historic lighthouses so that future generations of Americans will be able to appreciate these treasured landmarks. 
The legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, through the National Park Service, to establish a historic lighthouse preservation program. The Secretary is charged with collecting and sharing information on historic lighthouses; conducting educational programs to inform the public about the contribution to society of historic lighthouses; and maintaining an inventory of historic lighthouses. 
A historic light station is defined as a lighthouse, and surrounding property, at least 50 years old, which has been evaluated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, and included in the Secretary's listing of historic light stations. 
Most important, the Secretary, in conjunction with the Administrator of General Services, is to establish a process for identifying, and selecting among eligible entities to which a historic lighthouse could be conveyed. Eligible entities will include Federal agencies, State agencies, local communities, nonprofit corporations, and educational and community development organizations financially able to maintain a historic lighthouse, including conformance with the National Historic Preservation Act. When a historic lighthouse has been deemed excess to the needs of the Federal agency which manages the lighthouse, the General Services Administration will convey it, for free, to a selected entity for education, park, recreation, cultural, and historic preservation purposes. 
My legislation also recognizes the value of lighthouse friends groups. Often, these groups have spent significant time and resources on preserving the character of historic lighthouses only to have this work go to waste when the lighthouse is transferred out of Federal ownership. Under current General Services Administration regulations, these friends groups are last on the priority list to receive a surplus light station in spite of their efforts to protect it. My bill gives priority consideration to public entities who submit applications in which the public entity partners with a nonprofit friends group. 
Everyone agrees that the historic character of these lighthouses needs to be maintained. But the cost of maintaining these historic structures is becoming increasingly high for Federal agencies in these times of tight budgetary constraints. These lighthouses were built in an age when they had to be manned continuously. Today's advanced technology makes it possible to build automated aids to navigation that do not require around-the-clock manning. This technology has made many of these historic lighthouses expensive anachronisms which Federal agencies must maintain even if they no longer use them as navigational aids. 
My legislation ensures that the historic character of these lighthouses are maintained when the lighthouses are no longer needed by the Federal Government. When the historic lighthouse is conveyed out of Federal ownership, the entity which receives the lighthouse must maintain it in accordance with historic preservation laws and standards. A lighthouse would revert to the United States, at the option of the General Services Administration, if the lighthouse is not being used or maintained as required by the law. 
In the event no government agency or nonprofit organization is approved to receive a historic lighthouse, it would be offered for sale by the General Services Administration. The proceeds from these sales would be transferred to the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program within the National Park Service. Congress established the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program in 1994 to provide grants for maritime heritage preservation and education projects. Unfortunately, funding for this program has been nonexistent so the proceeds from any historic lighthouse sales would help ensure the program's viability. 
It is my intent to ensure that coastal towns, where a historic lighthouse is an integral part of the community, would receive a historic lighthouse when it is no longer needed by the Federal Government. These historic lighthouses could be used by the community as a local park, a community center, or a tourist bureau. It also would ensure that historic lighthouse friends groups or lighthouse preservation societies, which have voluntarily helped to maintain the historic character of the lighthouse, could receive an excess lighthouse. 
Mr. President, I know firsthand the importance and allure of these historic lighthouses. When I was in the Coast Guard, I helped maintain lighthouses and other navigational aids. These lights were critical to safe maritime traffic and I took my responsibilities seriously knowing that lives were dependent on it. 
By preserving historic lighthouses, we preserve a symbol of that era in American history when maritime traffic was the lifeblood of the Nation, tying isolated coastal towns through trade to distant ports around the world. Hundreds of historic lighthouses are owned by the Federal Government and many of these are difficult and expensive to maintain. This legislation provides a process to ensure that these historic lighthouses are maintained and publicly accessible.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Akaka, Stevens, and Inouye, I am introducing legislation that will provide a measure of relief to the citizens of Alaska and Hawaii who must rely on air transport far more than citizens in the lower-48. 
When Congress adopted the balanced budget legislation last summer, one of the provisions of the tax bill re-wrote the formula for calculating the air passenger tax for domestic and international flights. As part of this formula change, Congress adopted a per passenger, per segment fee which disproportionately penalizes travelers to and from Alaska and Hawaii who have no choice but to travel by air. 
Th legislation we are introducing today would reinstate the prior law 10 percent tax formula for flights to and from our states. In addition, the $6 international departure fees that are imposed on such flights would be retained at the current level and would not be indexed. I see no reason why passengers flying to and from our states must face a guaranteed increase in tax every year because of inflation. We don't index tobacco taxes, we don't index fuel taxes; why should government automatically gain additional revenue from air passengers simply because of inflation? 
Mr. President, this legislation requires that intrastate Alaska and Hawaii flights will be subject to a flat 10 percent tax if such flights do not originate or terminate at a rural airport in our states. In addition, the definition of a rural airport is expanded to include airports within 75 miles of each other where no roads connect the communities. In many towns in Alaska, air transport is the only viable means of transportation from one community to another. There is no reason these airports should be denied the benefit of the special rural airport tax rate simply because our state does not have the transportation infrastructure or geographic definition that exists in most of the lower-48.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for Senate bill 1360, Senator Abraham's Border Improvement and Immigration Act introduced November 4. This legislation has already numerous cosponsors and is bipartisan in nature. 
This bill clarifies a provision included in the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section 110 of last year's immigration law requires the establishment of an automated entry and exit control system. While the merits of this provision are admirable, unfortunately, the reality is that this is not a feasible concept. 
The section would require documentation of every alien entering and leaving our country. Can you imagine? To document entry and exit of every foreign national, every alien entering the United States would be required to hold a visa or passport or some sort of border crossing identification card. 
In my State alone, Mr. President, Canadians are at our border. We are separated from the rest of the United States by Canada. We enjoy relatively free passage between the two countries as Americans. This facilitates trade and strengthens our historical ties of friendship. To require the documentation of entry and exit of Canadians would result in Canada requesting the same type of consideration. Of course, our Canadian neighbors would be forced to wait in long lines. Trade would be disrupted. And it would develop a feeling of distrust. This is simply unacceptable. 
When former Senator Simpson crafted this immigration reform proposal last year, he did not intend to create a new documentation requirement for our northern neighbors. Rather, the issue he wished to address was the illegal overstay rates of foreign nationals. 
I cannot agree more that the illegal overstays need to be addressed. The Immigration and Naturalization Service currently cannot provide accurate data on overstay rates. However, the answer does not lie in requiring documentation of every alien entering through our land points of entry. 
Section 110, if implemented as is, will only create more headaches for our friends and neighbors attempting to enter the United States and slow both trade and commerce that crosses our land border each day. It will do little to address my primary concern about overstay rates and subsequent illegal immigration. 
For these reasons, I am supporting Senator Abraham's efforts to correct section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and exempt land entry border points from collecting a record of arrivals and departures. I hope that my other colleagues join me in cosponsoring S. 1360, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, I would like to make one more statement, if I may, with the indulgence of my friend from Wyoming.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. There has been an awful lot of concern relative to the issue of global warming, greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide emissions, et cetera. 
This December, representatives of 166 nations are going to meet in Kyoto, Japan, to broker a new international climate treaty. This treaty will set new emissions controls for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 
Unfortunately, 130 of the 166 nations, including China, Mexico, and South Korea, are explicitly exempt from the new emissions controls or any new commitments whatsoever. As a consequence, it is my opinion that such a treaty simply cannot work and will not be ratified by the Senate. 
Even if one favors strong action to curb carbon emissions, there are three key reasons to oppose the approach embodied in the draft treaty. 
The first reason is, selectively applied emissions limits will harm large sectors of our economy. 
Analysts expect even the most modest versions of the treaty to cost over a million and a half jobs by the year 2005, along with cumulative losses in gross domestic product exceeding $16 trillion from the year 2005 to the year 2015. 
While the President claims the new global climate treaty will not harm the economy, the administration abandoned its internal analysis after their economic models predicted disaster --even when rosy assumptions were factored in. So bad were the results that the administration refused to even appear at a hearing of our Energy and Natural Resources Committee to comment on the treaty's economic impacts. 
Second, the environmental benefits of this treaty are really questionable, Mr. President. 
Any treaty without new commitments for developing nations will encourage the movement of production, capital, jobs, and emissions from the 36 nations subject to emissions controls to the 130 nations that are not. 
Actual global emissions will not decrease. Only their point of origin will change. 
Ironically, because of our industrial processes, which are more energy efficient than those found in developing nations, global carbon emissions per unit of production would, in my opinion, actually increase. In other words, we would endure economic pain for no identifiable environmental gain. 
Third, selectively applied emissions controls will doom any climate treaty that contains them. 
By an overwhelming vote of 95 to 0, this body, the U.S. Senate, passed a resolution in July demanding any new climate treaty contain new obligations--new obligations--for developing nations. At the same time, Mr. President, developing nations refuse to sign up to such a treaty. Thus, selectively applied emissions controls have become the so-called poison pill that is preventing the world from reasonably addressing the climate change issue. 
So I think it is time to be a bit pragmatic. If we want to keep a new climate treaty from becoming an international embarrassment, we should reconsider the rush to Kyoto and expand solutions that really work. 
What can really work, Mr. President? 
One is nuclear energy. One is hydropower. For instance, nuclear energy produces roughly a third of our electricity without significant emissions of carbon dioxide. Yet, President Clinton's global warming explicitly ignores these sources of virtually carbon-free energy. 
Even worse, Mr. President, the Clinton administration threatens--and has threatened numerously--to veto any nuclear waste legislation and continues to consider proposals to tear down hydropower dams, policies that endanger the carbon-free solutions that are in place today, and calls into question the administration's commitment to reduce our carbon emissions in a balanced, responsible manner. 
We even see the Sierra Club come out against wind power claiming that the windmills are some kind of Cuisinart that decimates the bird population. 
What does our President propose? 
It is rather interesting to reflect on where we are now because he has come almost full circle. The President hints at some vague notion of meeting our emissions targets through electricity restructuring, but he is very short on specifics. Perhaps the President is playing to the headlines today, but leaving the details to tomorrow or to the next administration. 
His proposal is that we, by the year 2008 to 2011, reduce our emissions to the level of 1990. Well, where is his administration going to be by that time? So they are just putting these things off as opposed to coming up with the mechanics that will work. 
There are, in fact, things that we can do in the context of energy restructuring that can help restabilize our carbon emissions. We have had some 13 hearings on this subject in my committee, the Energy Committee, and we have heard from 120 witnesses. Thus, I am prepared to suggest some of the specifics that the President has not suggested. 
For example, we can provide for stranded cost recovery of the more than 100 nuclear power reactors that together provide some 22 percent of our total electric power generation. 
We can provide incentives to encourage or require regions to employ a mix of carbon-free wind, solar, nuclear, or hydropower adequate to achieve a specified carbon-free emissions standard. 
We can offer a means to certify the claims of power producers who wish to market their power to consumers as low-carbon or carbon-free. 
And we can offer assistance for market-led investments in new research towards carbon-free or low-carbon energy. 
There is no shortage of policies we can pursue if we really want to address the issue of carbon emissions. We can be encouraged about recent technology breakthroughs in fuel cell technology, wind energy, solar technologies, and advanced nuclear plant designs. 
In the end, I think, Mr. President, American ingenuity, technological innovation, and common sense will produce the solutions that the U.N. negotiations thus far have been unable to provide. 
Finally, Mr. President, we need to employ these new technologies to increase energy efficiency, promote conservation, and stabilize our carbon emissions--but we do not need a flawed treaty that cannot get the job done. 
The climate issue is serious, but so are issues of equity, economic prosperity, and pragmatism. 
During the last round of negotiations at Bonn, the draft treaty got worse. It got worse, not better. As a consequence, we need to prepare ourselves and the American people for the prospect that the new treaty will be unworthy of support, even if you are deeply concerned about the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as I am. In other words, it doesn't do us any good to board a fast train, a fast train that is going in the wrong direction, particularly if all nations of the world aren't aboard. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to chat very briefly in morning business concerning a matter that has come before the Senate from time to time that is of great interest to those of us in the Western States. That is the national issue of what is termed `Teaming With Wildlife.' 
The Teaming With Wildlife initiative has grown, and those of us in the West recognize that we are very fortunate in having probably the best area on Earth to fish, hunt, and explore the great outdoors. I know the occupant of the Chair from the State of Oregon, and myself from the State of Alaska, are great boosters of that great outdoors with unsurpassed natural beauty and wildlife, particularly the Western States. I am not suggesting other States don't have the same. But perhaps ours is a little larger and the magnitude is a little greater. But we have extraordinary natural beauty, wildlife, and I particularly look forward every time I am back home in Alaska to enjoy the outdoors. 
As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction overseeing our public lands in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am well aware that this bounty we enjoy doesn't come free. It takes huge sums of money to acquire and maintain our legacy of public lands which we enjoy. That is why I support providing additional funds to the States for all outdoor recreation programs, including fish and wildlife conservation. 
This brings me to the goals associated with the Teaming With Wildlife proposal, which I support along with many Alaskans, and I know many of my colleagues in this body. But I would like to point out some of the concerns because in the enthusiasm for Teaming With Wildlife some of these things are overlooked. So let me share a few of them with you. 
Mr. President, the proposal advanced by the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies would impose a new tax on the American people where that connection between the products being taxed and the use of the tax revenue in some cases is tenuous, to say the least. 
Mr. President, for decades hunters and anglers have worked very well in contributing to the management, conservation, and restoration of wildlife habitat and fisheries resources through an excise tax imposed at the manufacturing level. These targeted taxes have been a resounding success for one reason. That reason, Mr. President, is there is a direct link between the items taxed and the use of the tax revenue. 
The Pittman-Robertson Act, for example, imposes an excise tax on sporting arms, on handguns, on ammunition and archery equipment. The Wallop-Breaux fund does basically the same thing with fishing equipment and motorboat fuel. Money raised from this generates revenue that goes directly back in enhancing fishing and motoring in our various lakes and waterways. So States use the resulting tax revenue for the purchase and restoration of public wildlife habitat, and wildlife management research. Hunters like myself don't mind at all paying the extra tax on rifles and shells because we know that the revenue will be spent on increasing and improving habitat where we can hunt and recreate. 
Yet, the direct link--this is the key, Mr. President--between the items taxed and the use of the resulting tax revenue is broader in the Teaming With Wildlife proposal. That legislative proposal would result in a tax being imposed on virtually everything from backpacks to tents, from hiking boots to sports utility vehicles, from film to binoculars. The revenue would be used by States for a worthwhile purpose, which I support, of wildlife research planning, fishing and wildlife-associated recreation, and research projects. 
But the facts are that while many of the items being taxed would be used in the great outdoors to benefit the expanded use of the outdoors, many of these products would not. We looked at a 1995 survey by the Sports Market Research Group that indicates that 69 percent of all backpacks sold--you might think they are going for camping--are used by schoolchildren while 27 percent of all sleeping bags sold are for indoor use. Is that a fair tax to those consumers? 
Some suggest a new tax is not needed when an existing program could meet many of the needs for outdoor recreation resources throughout the Nation. Over 30 years ago, we created in Congress the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the LWCF, for the sole purpose of meeting America's needs for outdoor recreation, including the acquisition of property for fish and wildlife conservation purposes. Money in the fund would come from offshore oil and gas royalties--OCS activities off the shores of our various coastal States. 
Up to 60 percent of the $900 million annually available is to be passed on to the States. Unfortunately, the States have not received any money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the past 4 years. And many in this body have even forgotten the benefits of the program. What we have done with that money is use it to reach our budget objectives, solely ignoring the purpose of the program. I think we should do more to encourage the States to support offshore oil and gas development in a responsible manner using our science and technology. As evidence is the tremendous development occurring in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana, Texas, and other areas. 
Perhaps we could by guaranteeing States some portion of the revenue from OCS activities. That would instill a sense of belonging and a sense of interest that those States currently don't have. 
Further, a portion of the Federal mineral receipts perhaps could be set aside in a dedicated permanent fund and the income generated from the fund could be passed on to the States in the form of matching grants for outdoor recreation. In many State parks in the West, including my State of Alaska, land was purchased with money from the land and water conservation Fund. And much of what Teaming with Wildlife seeks to accomplish should be done with funds generated from such areas. I think offshore oil and gas development would gain us a broader support necessary to pass legislation such as Teaming with Wildlife, and I think we must explore fully using existing funding resources to help meet these laudable goals because I fear that we are going to have a hard time differentiating just what portion is a legitimate tax on this broad area, as I have indicated before that we have identified, including sleeping bags, film, binoculars, hiking boots, and so forth. 
I encourage those who are interested to help us as we address responsibly how to fund equitably for this purpose of Teaming with Wildlife that, indeed, addresses those who are active in utilizing the great outdoors and purchase legitimate items that can be legitimately attached without getting into the situation where we are in dispute over the portion and the formula and the use. 
So as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am committed to help bringing the States together to meet the growing demand for fish and wildlife habitat, for outdoor recreation resources, and I certainly encourage all Alaskans to join me in providing input on what we think is a fair and workable method to raise funds for the great outdoors and not overlooking the intention of the land and water conservation fund which has been, I think it is fair to say, observed by the budgeteers as a place to pick up significant funding to meet some of our budget obligations. 
So I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and encourage everyone to work in a positive manner to meet the challenges associated with Teaming with Wildlife for a fair and equitable funding mechanism. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators on the floor, I wish to address my views on the passage of the nuclear waste legislation by the U.S. House of Representatives, which occurred last week. 
Mr. President, last week Congress took a very important step toward ending our Nation's 15-year struggle with how to solve our high-level nuclear waste problem. Last week, the House passed H.R. 1270 by an overwhelming, bipartisan 307-to-120 vote. The House bill is a companion to S. 104, the nuclear waste bill passed by the Senate by a 65-to-34 vote last spring. 
Like the Senate bill, the House bill would take nuclear waste from 80 sites in 40 States, from the backyards of our constituents all across this land, and move it to one safe, central storage site. The Federal Government has a contractual commitment to take this nuclear waste for safe and central storage by next January. 
Will that happen? The answer is clearly `no,' even though over $13 billion has been collected from America's ratepayers to pay for the permanent storage of that waste, and even though a Federal court order has reaffirmed the Government's legal obligation to take nuclear waste in January 1998. The same court is now considering what remedy the Government must provide for its failure to meet this obligation. This is the Government's 
failure, but it is the American taxpayer that is going to bear the burden. The American public paid that $13 billion into the nuclear waste fund and now will have to pay a second time. Estimates of potential damages for the failure of the Department of Energy to meet its obligations range from $40 billion to as high as $80 billion. That is $1,300 per American family. 
How important is the nuclear power industry in this country? It contributes around 22 percent of the total power generation in this country. It provides electricity with no emissions, so air quality is not a problem. The problem is what do you do with the waste? You cannot throw it up in the air. It has to come down somewhere. The reality is that no one wants it. The French reprocess their spent fuel and recover the plutonium, put it back in the reactors and burn it. The Japanese are moving in that direction, as well. 
We are hopelessly tied to a dilemma: no one wants nuclear waste and we don't have any place to put it. Some of the plants are reaching their maximum capacity. Without the licensing of proper storage and without the Federal Government meeting its obligations to take this waste, we stand to lose a significant portion of our Nation's nuclear generating capacity. 
How are we going to make up for this lost generation? Are we going to put more coal fired plants on-line? How does the Clinton administration reconcile this position with their professed concern about emissions? If we lose a portion of our nuclear power generating capability, it is going to have to be replaced with something, and the Clinton administration has not provided us with any answers. Nor has it adequately addressed its contractual responsibility to take this waste. 
Mr. President, without the legislation passed by the both the House and the Senate, there is no plan for action except more lawsuits, more employment for the lawyers. As we move to conference, opponents of the bill will continue to sing the same old, tired refrain. They call it `Mobile Chernobyl,' emasculating NEPA, running roughshod over our environmental laws. These scare tactics are a coverup, an excuse for no action. That is what we have had so far, no action in 15 years. 
They will say the fuel is safely stored where it is. It is stored in temporary facilities next to the reactors that were designed for just that, temporary storage. But if it is safely stored where it is, then why isn't it safe to store it in Nevada at the Nevada test site, near where we have spent over $6 billion to develop a site that is facing, in the near future, licensing and suitability decisions? In fact, there is no question in my mind it must be safer to have one central, monitored site than to have nuclear waste at 80 sites scattered around the country at facilities that have been designed for temporary storage. 
Then, of course, they argue that somehow it is unsafe to move nuclear fuel to one central site. But we have shown how we have been safely moving fuel around this country and abroad for many, many years. The French, the Japanese, and the Swedes move it by vessel, they move it by rail, they move it by truck. 
They say the transportation casks cannot stand a 30-mile-per-hour crash or survive a diesel fuel fire. These are more emotional arguments that have no foundation. We have shown that the casks have been tested by locomotives going 90 miles an hour crashed into brick walls. They have been submerged in water, bathed in fire. The casks are designed to withstand any type of imaginable impact associated with transportation. We have shown that, while we have had a few minor accidents, there has never been a release of radiation. We have shown how our national laboratories have certified that the transportation casks can survive any real-world crash. They say the radiation protection standard is unsafe. We have shown how our standard is more protective than the current EPA guidance that allows five times as much, and we will allow EPA to tighten the standards further if need be. 
The doomsayers say the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board says there is no compelling or technical or safety reason to move fuel to a central location. We have shown that a more complete reading of the technical review report and testimony indicates that there is a need for an interim storage and that there is a need for it at Yucca Mountain, if, indeed, Yucca is determined to be suitable for a permanent repository. 
They say, `We can delay the decision.' We have shown that delay is what got us into this mess in the first place; inactivity. Any time now, the courts will tell us what damages we will face when the Government is in breach of its contract. With each delay, the damages are going to mount. With each delay, the liability of the taxpayer will mount. With each delay, there will be pressure to yield a further delay. That is the way this place works. When we have a problem, we simply delay. The call for delay is a siren song and, ultimately, a trap. 
We stand at a crossroads. The job of solving this problem is ours. The time for solving the problem is now. We have made much progress at Yucca Mountain. The 5-mile exploratory tunnel is complete. We can build on this progress. Both the Senate and House bill contain site characterization activities for the permanent repository. But we cannot put all our eggs in the Yucca basket. We need a temporary storage facility now or we are going to be storing spent fuel all across the Nation for decades to come. We can choose whether this Nation needs 80 interim storage sites or just one. Where is that? The arid, remote, Nevada test site where we exploded scores of nuclear bombs during the cold war. It is a safe, remote location. It is monitored, and it is appropriate for an interim site. 
If Yucca Mountain is licensed, it will be an easy task to move 
the spent fuel a short distance to the repository. If Yucca is not licensed and is found to be unsuitable, we will need a centralized interim site anyway, so we will be way ahead of the game. Regardless of what happens at Yucca, this is a responsible step that we should take. 
Mr. President, the time is now. This legislation passed the House and the Senate. It is the answer. I urge my colleagues over the recess to reflect on the merits of our obligation to take this waste, to recognize the dependence we have on the nuclear industry, and move to take a responsible position to uphold the contract that has been made by the Government to take this waste in conformance with the terms of the agreement and the $13 billion paid by the ratepayers. 
For those who are still in doubt as to the merits of this legislation, I encourage them to recognize that it is irresponsible to object to what has happened in both the House and the Senate without providing an alternative. The development of this legislation has required a great deal of time and effort and a great deal of examination of alternatives. So I hope the critics come up with a workable alternative, as opposed to just criticism of the plan that is currently pending in the Congress of the United States, to meet our obligations to address the high-level nuclear waste issue. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I would like to engage in a colloquy with Mr. Thurmond regarding section 2812 of the conference report, the section of the bill authorizing the sale of military utility assets.  
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-murkowski-ak-2-19971106</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish to draw the Senator's attention to the plain meaning of section 2812 so that there is no confusion in its application or implementation. 
First, the plain meaning of the provision does not limit the Secretary of a military department's authority to convey electric utility assets present at a military base. There is no requirement that both electric generation and distribution facilities be present at a base in order for the Secretary of a military department to convey assets. Indeed, the plain language of section 2812 states that such Secretaries may `convey a utility system, or part of a utility system.' 
Second, section 2812 has no effect whatsoever on existing preference power allocations. If an entity that is not currently eligible for--or is not currently receiving--preference power buys an electric utility system at a base which is entitled to receive preference power, the base will continue to receive that preference power--subject of course to the terms of existing contracts, rights, or obligations. There is nothing whatsoever in the plain meaning of section 2812 to the contrary, nor is there any language in the provision supporting the idea that a base's preference power allocation will transfer to any asset purchaser that buys a military base utility system. Federal military bases, as customers of the Federal Government's utilities--the Power Marketing Administrations--will not be defeased of their rights to purchase preference power, regardless of the purchaser of military base assets. 
Finally, I wish to reiterate that there is nothing in the plain language of section 2812 which in any way supports the notion that a particular purchaser (either a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility or other entity) should be given any particular preference with respect to the purchase of military base utility assets. Indeed, the section is intended to create a level playing field for all to compete for the purchase of the facilities. There is no language whatsoever in the section supporting the idea that preference power recipients should receive an advantage in competitive bidding for military base utility assets. Moreover, regardless of who purchases the utility system, the base will continue to receive Federal preference power pursuant to the terms and conditions of contracts.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate reference, legislation to establish the Commonwealth of Guam. This measure is identical to H.R. 100 which was introduced by Congressman Underwood. I am introducing this measure at the request of Congressman Underwood and Governor Gutierrez of Guam. 
The quest for self-government and recognition of the authority to determine the laws and programs that facilitate or impede our social, political, and economic growth are an integral part of the territorial history of this Nation. Even before the Constitution had been ratified, the Northwest Ordinance set the pattern for the territory subject to the new Federal Government. The ordinance set a policy that the territory would be settled as soon as possible and admitted into the Union with the other States. That policy, of full self-government and limited governance from the Federal Establishment, marked territorial policy until the beginning of this century. 
While this century has seen the admission of States such as Arizona and New Mexico, as well as the more recent admission of Alaska and Hawaii, the progress of full self-government has been slower for most of the areas acquired as a result of the Spanish-American War or since that time. In 1898, a century ago, the United States acquired the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. In 1900 and 1904 treaties of cession confirmed the extension of sovereignty over American Samoa. In 1916 we acquired the Virgin Islands. In 1976 the covenant that provided the basis for the acquisition of the Northern Mariana Islands was enacted following a plebiscite in the islands. 
These areas, with the exception of the Philippines, have not followed the path taken by the other territories of the United States. The Philippines achieved commonwealth and independence, although World War II delayed full implementation. Shortly after World War II, Puerto Rico was permitted to replace the local government provisions of federal organic legislation with a locally drafted Constitution and to elect its Governor. Not until the 1970's were Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa afforded the opportunity to popularly elect their own Governor. Also, during that period, Guam and the Virgin Islands were provided the opportunity to develop a constitution to govern local matters. 
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa are in a slightly different situation. American Samoa has a locally developed constitution promulgated by secretarial order and the Northern Marianas operate under the local constitution authorized under the covenant. 
The process of local self-government and improvements in Federal-territorial relations has not stopped for any of these areas. This Congress has already seen as much attention as has occurred over the past decade. The Senate has passed legislation that provides the Virgin Islands with the same flexibility to issue short-and long-term bonds as the States enjoy. The Senate has also passed legislation that would reform the way surplus Federal lands are disposed of in Guam, providing the Government of Guam with an effective voice in decisions with respect to future land use management. We have also considered modifications requested by the executives in Guam and the Virgin Islands to the powers of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. Both the Senate and the House have pending legislation to provide a referendum in Puerto Rico on future political status. In that context we are considering status in the larger constitutional context of Statehood or independence as well as possible refinements to the present relationship. We also have pending in the Senate legislation forwarded by the administration that would revise Federal-territorial relations with the Northern Marianas in the areas of minimum wage, immigration, and trade. 
The legislation that I am introducing today is a very broad approach to Federal relations with Guam. The provisions address several different issues ranging from problems over resource allocation and use to operations of government to social and cultural issues. In the past decade since the voters in Guam approved the present draft, some of the provisions, such as judicial reform or disposal of excess Federal lands, have been addressed individually. Others may no longer be relevant due to other changes. The central issue, however, is as current and relevant as it was in 1982 when the voters in Guam decided to seek commonwealth as a means to obtain greater self-government. 
The central issue is the proper role and authority of Federal versus local government. Where should decisions be made, be they right or wrong, and who should bear the burden of providing for the future? Should the Federal or local government have the authority to safeguard and manage local resources and provide for the health, safety, education, and welfare of the local residents? Should noncontiguous areas bear the burden of regulations crafted to meet the needs of the contiguous United States and for the administrative convenience of bureaucrats in Washington? I use the word noncontiguous because the concerns that led Guam to seek the provisions of this legislation are equally applicable to areas in Alaska or Hawaii. Status, in the constitutional sense, is not the problem or the answer, but rather the allocation of power and authority under the Constitution between Federal and local government. 
An example of this would be the application of provisions of the Clean Air Act to Guam. Notwithstanding the fact that Guam is a relatively small island located in the western Pacific in the middle of the trade winds, it had to comply with the same emission requirements as did places like Los Angeles or Washington. My colleagues should remember that what made Guam so valuable to the Spanish was that the galleons leaving Acapulco were blown by the trade winds to Guam, where they reprovisioned prior to heading to Manila. The powerplants in Guam were required to install expensive scrubbers even though the nearest point of land was the Philippines. Eventually we managed to obtain a waiver for Guam, but it was only after years of effort by our committee, with the help I would note of my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, to convince EPA that granting a waiver for Guam was not a precedent for exempting the State of Nebraska. Alaska and Hawaii have not been as successful, I would note. Another example is the visa waiver that we finally managed to obtain for Guam for tourists. 
These are not unique problems. Administrative convenience seems to always outweigh the realities of life in the noncontiguous areas, nor are our provisions uniform. In some instances, the difference in treatment aggravates the local unhappiness with Washington. Guam is the southernmost of the Mariana Islands. The Northern Mariana Islands, which can be seen from Guam, are not subject to the Jones Act, but Guam is. The Virgin Islands has an exception, but Guam does not. While I would never argue for uniformity as an inflexible principle, I do think that Washington can be considerably more creative than it has been, and certainly can be more understanding of the uniqueness of the noncontiguous areas. 
Insensitivity is also a reason underlying some of the provisions of the legislation. The most recent example is the actions of the Fish and Wildlife Service in carrying out its land grab in Guam. Rather than devoting resources to the eradication of the brown tree snake, the Fish and Wildlife Service rushed to 
use the depredation caused by the snake as a reason for creating a refuge and overlay covering almost one-third of Guam. Well know habitat such as runways were covered. The reason for the rush to create the refuge is understandable since several of the native species are already extinct and the rest are scurrying for what little remains of their existence from the snake. If the Fish and Wildlife Service had not moved quickly, they would have had to defend creating the only refuge for non-existent species. I suppose they could have used it as a precedent for creating a refuge for dinosaurs in Utah and locking up whatever lands the President and Secretary Babbitt missed last year. In that context, I would suggest that at the next meeting of the Western Governors, the Governors of Guam and Utah swap stories of Federal land grabs. 
I am in full sympathy with the objectives of this legislation. The Governor of Guam may feel that he is alone, but we in Alaska know full well what dealing with Washington entails. We also must deal with insensitive bureaucrats, acquisitive Secretaries, irrelevant stateside standards, and a wealth of officious and fussy Federal agencies who seem to have as their sole mission making life as difficult, expensive, and complex as possible. Guam at least has a central road system and the possibility of developing the southern end of the island--an option that Federal managers are committed to denying Alaska. I fully understand the frustrations that led the U.S. citizens in Guam to develop this legislation. Unfortunately, I must say that the problem is not the plenary authority of Congress under the Territorial Clause.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do not necessarily support every provision in this legislation as drafted, but I do support the underlying objective of redressing the balance of power and authority between Washington and Agana. As a result of my trip to Guam last year, I introduced legislation to deal with the disposal of surplus Federal property and prevent any future land grabs such as the one engaged in by the Fish and Wildlife Service. That legislation was not everything that either the Governor or I would have preferred, but I think that the end result of the Senate action, if finally enacted, will be a significant improvement in Federal-territorial relations. I intend to take the same constructive approach to the provisions of this legislation. 
I appreciate that questions have been raised over some of the provisions from constitutional as well as policy grounds, but that should not be an excuse to avoid addressing the underlying concerns that led to the drafting and approval of those provisions by the voters in Guam. As I said before, we have a lot of experience with foolish and petty restrictions from Federal agencies. As a percentage, far more of Alaska is subject to Federal land domination and our communities suffer the consequences of an inability to obtain transportation and utility corridors across the Federal lands. I have sympathy and sensitivity to local cultural concerns as well because we also see Federal agencies trying to frustrate the benefits and protections afforded our Native Alaskans. Guam is concerned over the loss of the economic potential of its marine resources and Alaska holds the single most promising petroleum area on the continent. 
I hope to meet shortly with the Governor and with members of the Guam Legislature to discuss the provisions of this legislation. I fully expect that the next few years will be particularly active for our Committee as we consider not only how to improve and strengthen local self-government in and revise Federal relations with Guam, but also deal with concerns that have arisen with some of the expectations and implementation of provisions of the Northern Marianas Covenant, political status in Puerto Rico, and renegotiation and extension of certain provisions of the Compacts of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Much has happened in the north Pacific since World War II and it is our responsibility to be as sensitive and responsible as possible to the needs and aspirations of the local governments who are either within or in free association with the United States. I encourage my colleagues to take the time to become more familiar with these areas and to take their particular needs and problems into consideration when crafting legislation. It is far easier to address the situation of the noncontiguous areas at the outset of legislative efforts, than it is to come in later when we have entrenched bureaucrats who see their power threatened if we act responsibly.  
Exhibit 1 CARL T.C. GUTIERREZ, 
Governor of Guam. ROBERT A. UNDERWOOD, 
Member of Congress, October 29, 1997. 
Senator Frank Murkowski, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Murkowski: Today we had our first hearing on H.R. 100, the Guam Commonwealth Act, before the House Committee on Resources. As we work with the Members of the House Committee to perfect their version, we believe it is time to move forward and proceed to the next step in the process. 
Therefore, we respectfully request your support for the introduction of companion legislation to this bill in the Senate and consideration of a hearing at the earliest possible convenience of the committee. 
We pledge to work closely with you and your staff and assist you in any way we can. 
Sincerely,

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the nominee to be Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Charles Rossotti. Mr. Rossotti is unique among nominees for this position since he is the first nontax-lawyer nominated for the post. In fact, he is a businessman who is chairman of American Management Systems, a company he cofounded in 1970, which now employs some 7,000 people. 
Mr. President, if this man is confirmed, and I expect that he will be, he faces a daunting challenge in turning around an agency which has very serious credibility problems with this Senator and, I think, a majority of the American public as well. 
As this country learned some 6 weeks ago in the hearings at the Senate Finance Committee, the IRS is an agency with structural and personnel problems that have led to an agency culture that is abusive, unresponsive, and to some extent arrogant. Far too often, the Internal Revenue Service appears to be out of control, with no accountability to the public or to the policymakers here in Washington. For anyone who has tried to phone the IRS lately, why, I think you get the flavor for my generalizations. 
The bipartisan Kerrey-Portman Commission that examined the Internal Revenue Service recommended a series of changes at the IRS, including the creation of an independent board to oversee IRS operations. Recently, the House passed a measure incorporating nearly all of the Commission's recommendations. However, I believe that the lessons learned from the Finance Committee September hearings suggest that far more needs to be done if the public is going to regain a measure of confidence in the Internal Revenue Service. 
I applaud the Finance Committee chairman, Chairman Roth, for his commitment to hold a series of hearings that will build on the achievements of the House and bring a tough reform bill to the floor of the Senate next year. 
To give you an idea of the structural problems that exist at the Internal Revenue Service, consider the following description of the Service that was done by Paul Light, author of `The Tides of Reform: Making Government Work, 1945-1995.'  
Just imagine a bureaucracy that goes something like this: an agent reports to a district group manager, who reports to a district group manager, who reports to a branch chief, who reports to an assistant chief of the division, who reports to the assistant district director, who reports to the assistant regional commissioner, who reports to the deputy assistant commissioner, who reports to the assistant commissioner, who reports to the chief operating officer, who reports to the deputy commissioner, and so on. 
What we have here, Mr. President, is a layered bureaucracy which implies accountability on paper but which, in reality, is designed by its very nature to be unaccountable. 
Consider, Mr. President, the testimony the committee heard from Lynda Willis of the General Accounting Office [GAO]. 
IRS systems, both manual and automated, have not been designed to capture and report comprehensive information on the use and possible misuse of collection authorities. 
IRS cannot readily produce data on the overall use or misuse of its collection enforcement authorities or on the characteristics of affected taxpayers. 
In effect, GAO said they couldn't audit IRS because the systems IRS has put in place are designed to ensure that there is no way for IRS personnel to be held accountable for their erroneous actions. There is no way to determine how many times IRS has made a mistake in sending out a collection notice. No way to determine how many complaints have been received. And this is the way the managers at IRS set up the system--set it up so that no one can trace improper behavior. 
Mr. President, the committee also heard testimony to the effect that the Problem Resolution Office [PRO], the office designed to resolve taxpayer disputes with IRS is, and I quote one of our witnesses, `utterly useless' in protecting the American taxpayer. The reason the PRO cannot function as designed is because employees at PRO are evaluated for promotions by the same Collection Division management they are supposed to police while assigned to the PRO. 
Mr. President, there is no reason that that kind of conflict of interest should exist. I plan on working with the Finance Committee chairman to develop legislation that will fundamentally change the PRO structure to ensure that taxpayers get a fair shake when there's a conflict with the IRS. 
Mr. President, the Finance Committee hearings had a profound effect on the American public and on the President of the United States. Shortly after those hearings, and seeing the polls, the President did a 180-degree U-turn on the recommendations of the IRS Commission and decided to back the House reform legislation creating an independent IRS management board. 
That's not the end of this matter. Instead we need a top-to-bottom review of the IRS. In the past, we adopted two taxpayer bill of rights bills which many of us thought would improve taxpayer-IRS interactions. The hearings in the Finance Committee suggest that these bills did little to alleviate tensions between the IRS and the American taxpayer. 
That is why the Finance Committee needs to hold further hearings on IRS reform. It has taken decades for the IRS to develop internal procedures that appear to make it unaccountable. We've learned of these problems 6 weeks ago. I am willing to admit that we don't know all the answers, but I know that now is not the time to merely take the House bill, pass it, and tell the public we fixed the problems at IRS. We haven't. 
Mr. President, Charles Rossotti is to be admired for his willingness to leave the private sector and take on this challenge at a time when IRS is in serious trouble. I look forward to receiving his recommendations for change at the Service after he has been there a few months. And I am sure his hands-on experience will assist the Finance Committee in drafting a comprehensive IRS reform bill.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on October 29, 1997, I filed Report 105-119 to accompany S. 967, a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to benefit Alaska Natives and rural residents, and for other purposes. At the time the report was filed, the estimates by Congressional Budget Office were not available. The estimate is now available and concludes that enactment of S. 967 would `increase direct spending by about $10 million over the 1998-2002 period.' I ask that a complete copy of the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and Center Act of 1997. I am pleased that the junior Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas is cosponsoring this bill. 
Our bill clarifies the intent of Congress to allow health clinics to participate in the new Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program. 
Mr. President, great advances in health care have occurred during the past decades, however, some communities in remote areas continue to struggle to provide primary care services. These communities face unparalleled geographic, climatic and economic barriers to quality health care. They simply do not have the resources, surface transportation nor the demand to provide full service inpatient and outpatient care--yet the community might be located hours from an acute care hospital in an urban center. 
The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 addresses part of this dilemma. It exempts many rural hospitals from burdensome Medicare regulations designed for large urban hospitals and does not straight jacket them under the prospective payment system. This limited-service model has already helped to reduce unnecessary overhead and prevent cost shifting in eight States. 
The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Act means that extremely rural communities will finally be able to provide more complete health care to the elderly. However, Mr. President, this important Medicare provision needs legislative clarification. The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program addresses part of the dilemma faced by communities located in remote areas, but misses a piece of the health care puzzle for our frontier communities--health clinics. 
Frontier communities face conditions even more extreme than rural communities. For example, the communities on the Fox Islands in Alaska are 400 miles from the nearest limited-service hospital and 650 miles from the nearest major, acute care hospital. There are no hospitals or even limited-service hospitals on the Fox Islands--just health clinics. 
This legislation will enable clinics in frontier communities such as the Fox Islands to participate in the program. A frontier area is defined in the bill as borough with six or fewer people per square mile. Additionally, to ensure this extension goes to frontier communities who are truly in need, participating clinics must be located in health professional shortage areas, and be more than a 50-mile drive from another facility. 
Mr. President, the Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and Center Act of 1997 is the answer for ensuring health care for our elderly who live in extremely rural and frontier areas. Demonstrations conducted by the Health Care Financing Administration have already proven the cost effectiveness of limited-service facilities. 
I would also point out that yesterday, the National Rural Health Association [NRHA], in a letter to Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, the nominee to be Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, endorsed the concept of allowing rural clinics to participate in this program. 
I urge my colleagues to consider the health care needs of frontier communities and adopt this bill.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, as chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over many of the agencies funded by this appropriations bill, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I rise to express several concerns about the Interior appropriations conference report that is before us today. 
Included in the conference report are numerous provisions that are important to my State of Alaska; none more critical than language extending a moratorium preventing a Federal takeover of the management of Alaska's fisheries until December 1, 1998. 
Mr. President, last year, the Alaska congressional delegation was successful in temporarily preventing the Federal Government from taking over the management of our fisheries. That moratorium is about to expire. 
If this conference report is not adopted, the Federal takeover is inevitable, forcing the citizens of my State of Alaska to live with fisheries management not seen since territorial days. This is what statehood was all about, Mr. President, giving the people of Alaska the authority to manage our fish and game. We have just about come full circle. 
I cannot in good conscience turn the clock back on all of the advances that we have made in 38 years since statehood. It is for that reason primarily that I am inclined to vote for this conference report. 
However, Mr. President, I want to express my objection to several areas, specifically in the process that has led to the inclusion of amendments to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, ANILCA, as a part of the extension of the moratorium, as a consideration for the moratorium, 
Mr. President, several months ago the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Bruce Babbitt, informed the Alaska delegation that he would recommend a Presidential veto of another moratorium extending the prohibition of the Department of the Interior to take over the management of fish and game. 
The Secretary has now withdrawn the veto threat, but only under the condition that a provision which effectively amends ANILCA title VIII be included in this conference report. The provision also requires that the Alaska Legislature act and the people of Alaska approve the changes in a referendum before the amendments to ANILCA are effective. These amendments were worked out by Alaska's Governor, the Secretary of the Interior, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I was not a party to these negotiations, and I believe that there were other options that should have been explored. 
Nevertheless, Mr. President, rather than a congressional moratorium, my hope specifically would have been for the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor to have worked together so that the Secretary could have applied to the court for an extension of time to avoid a Federal takeover, based specifically on progress that was being made. And, indeed, Mr. President, there was a good deal of progress. 
A task force was established by the Governor. That task force met several times and made its final recommendations. The Alaska Federation of Natives held a number of meetings and came up with its seven-point proposals. The State house resources committee held statewide hearings. And the State senate held hearings in September. So there was a good deal of evidence that progress was being made. 
Perhaps this would have led to a special session and a resolve by the legislature, along with the input from the AFN, to give all Alaskans an opportunity to vote on the issue next year. 
Unfortunately, there was no input by the legislature, the elected representatives of the people. My fear is now that some in our State, some Alaskans, will have the unreasonable expectation that future moratoriums can simply be obtained by the delegation--we have done it before--and the State legislature would therefore have an excuse not to finally resolve the issue. 
The legislature will have a chance to receive input and provide recommendations on the proposed amendments to title VIII of ANILCA. 
I tell the people of Alaska that it will be highly unlikely that we are going to see another moratorium legislated by Congress. The extension of the moratorium will provide the State legislature with an additional 14 months to work toward a resolve on the subsistence issue. As I indicated, the legislature will have the chance to receive input and provide recommendations to the proposed amendments of title XIII of ANILCA. 
Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my intention, after the State legislature acts, is to conduct hearings here in Washington to cover the context of the language in the Interior appropriations bill and to receive input from the legislature and the State of Alaska, native groups, sportsmen's groups, and other interested parties on any further amendments to ANILCA title VIII that might be appropriate. 
Mr. President, avoiding a Federal takeover of fish and game management is simply critical in my State. When Alaska became a State, Alaskans were united in our desire to take over the management of our fish and game. Many Alaskans still have vivid memories of the disaster of Federal control. Alaska salmon runs plummeted to 25 million fish with Federal bureaucrats in control in Washington, DC. Under State management, our runs are increasing and have approached 200 million in the last few years. 
Alaskans must act now by participating in a process and agreeing to a solution to prevent a Federal takeover of our fisheries and gaining back control of our game management. The State, not the elusive Federal bureaucrats with no accountability to Alaskans, should manage our fish and game. They are responsible to the people of Alaska. And they are certainly accountable in Alaska as to managing the fish and game. 
A subsistence solution I think must follow four basic principles that must be laid down as objectives. 
First must be the protection of our resource. It must return and keep management of fish and game to the State of Alaska. 
It must provide all the subsistence needs of rural Alaskans, and it must be fair to all Alaskans. 
This issue must be resolved while both Congressman Don Young and I retain our respective chairmanships of the committees of jurisdiction on this issue. Some have suggested we simply repeal the Federal subsistence law. But the Clinton administration, of course, would oppose this and would undoubtedly veto the bill. Even if we did, the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt, would still have the authority to enforce a Native-only subsistence priority based on his trust responsibilities to Alaska Natives established by Indian law. 
As I indicated earlier, we have made more progress in the past year on resolving the subsistence issue than any time in the past. We have involved the Governor, the Natives, and the legislature in moving forward on this issue. These constructive actions are why I support the moratorium contained in the conference report but object to the process or lack thereof by which the ANILCA amendments were included without the input of the representatives of Alaska; namely, the State legislature. 
In the meantime, Mr. President, let me commend and support the ongoing process in the State to come to a general consensus and put a solution on the ballot in November 1998 so that Alaskans have the ability to vote on a final solution. This is an Alaskan issue, Mr. President. It mandates an Alaskan solution. As chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, I stand ready to work on amendments to Federal subsistence in concert with Alaska.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. During the past Congress, both the House Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held hearings on this dispute. We heard from members of the villages seeking their lands as well as from the Department of the Interior. At the end of the Senate hearing in September 1996, I asked if the Department of the Interior was willing to work with the villages to come to a resolution. While its initial indication was yes, more than 6 months later, no action had been taken. 
On January 2 of this year, Chairman Young and I wrote to Secretary Babbitt requesting again that appropriate department policy level officials meet with the affected villages and the regional corporation as soon as possible to negotiate a resolution acceptable to the administration and the Alaska Native corporations. Again, there was no serious effort to seek a resolution. 
Having no indication that the Department was willing to even try to negotiate a settlement of this dispute, Chairman Young and I wrote to Chairman Stevens on April 25 asking him to include language in the Interior appropriations bill to ensure conveyance of the disputed land to the villages.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I noted that the White House recently released a strategy for climate change talks. The President said the United States would not assume binding obligations until developing countries agree to participate meaningfully in the climate-change issue. White House officials said they expect requirements for developing countries would be fleshed out in negotiations. 
This is what concerns me, Mr. President, `fleshed out in negotiations.' The senior Senator from West Virginia and the occupant of the chair, Senator Hagel, authored a resolution that has been supported in this body by an overwhelming vote of 95 to 0. The Byrd-Hagel resolution said developing nations must have targets and timetables in the same timeframe as the United States. 
Mr. President, it is my contention that the President is glossing over the issue of developing-country participation. 
The Berlin Mandate says `no new commitments for developing nations.' Has the President repudiated the Berlin Mandate? Otherwise, how in the world can President Clinton simply state that this is something that can be taken care of in negotiations when the Berlin Mandate clearly says no new commitments for developing nations? Our President only says `meaningful commitments for developing nations.' I wonder what meaningful really means. 
At this time, we are somewhat at the mercy of our negotiators on this matter. We have seen comments in the Record from various members of the Senate praising the President's plan, stating that they are encouraged by the policy announcements and pleased with the White House plan. Another member said that the President's position should satisfy demands of the Byrd-Hagel resolution as expressed in this body. 
Those demands are not met, Mr. President, because Byrd-Hagel says developing nations must have targets and timetables in the same timeframe as the United States. That is the test. 
Another Senator indicates this is a green light that speaks to our Nation's commitment to reducing greenhouse gases. I am a bottom line person, a nuts and bolts kind of guy. How are we going to get there from here? How will we reach the goal the President expressed, which is to go back to emissions levels of 1990 by the years 2008 to 2012? 
Let's do the math. 
Fifty-five percent of our U.S. energy production is coal. What is happening to coal? If a new climate treaty is signed, there will be reductions in coal use. EPA's new air quality standards on ozone and particulate matter are likely to decrease coal use. EPA's tightened air quality standards on oxides of sulfur and nitrogen will put more emphasis on coal reduction. EPA's proposed regional haze rule will put more pressure on coal as will any new EPA mercury emission rules. 
So there is going to be more pressure to reduce use of the resource supplying 55 percent of our electricity. 
What about nuclear? 
Well, the President threatens to veto our nuclear waste bill. There have been no new orders for new plants in the United States since 1975. There is the potential inability to recover stranded costs of nuclear plants in electric restructuring, so nuclear use is likely to fall. 
Nuclear is the largest carbon-free generator of power. The President didn't even mention it in his plan. 
Let us go to our next contributor--10 percent of our energy comes from hydroelectric. Yet, there are considerations in the administration to tear down dams. An example that has been discussed is the Glen Canyon Dam. If we tear down Glen Canyon, we would drain Lake Powell--252 square miles. That is a lake that provides the water for Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. It would eliminate sources of carbon-free electricity for 4 million consumers in the Southwest. We would scuttle a $500 million tourist industry. 
What about gas that supplies 10 percent of our power? Gas also emits carbons, but not as much. Demand would increase, prices would increase, and shortages might result. 
Some people say we will pick up the slack with wind and solar. I like wind and solar, but you can't always count on it. It is kind of interesting to see the Sierra's Club announcement the other day opposing wind farms. They refer to them as `Cuisinarts for birds.' So they are opposed to that. 
So the point is, Mr. President, how do you get there from here if the administration does not consider nuclear or hydroelectric? In his speech, the President specifically excludes hydro from renewable energy. 
What about the rest of the world? Let me tell you what one of our witnesses said at a hearing yesterday. Mr. Bill Martin, former Deputy Secretary of Energy, said the world is likely to increase its dependence on coal primarily due to energy demand in China. This dependence is likely to result in the doubling of sulfur dioxides in Asia and at least a 30-percent increase in global CO2, in 1990 levels, by the year 2000. To reach a sustainable energy with respect to carbon, the world will have to triple natural gas production, increase coal efficiencies through clean coal technology, triple renewables, triple nuclear power to a worldwide total of 1,000 gigawatts and increase energy efficiency by at least 25 percent. 
Mr. President, these are the real terms and conditions in the world that we are living in. Nuclear energy, renewables and energy efficiency emerge as the only viable source to date that are emissions-free and offer some energy independence to nations which adopt them. 
The point I want to make here, Mr. President, is that nuclear and hydro, a big part of the solution, are not addressed in the administration's proposal on how to reduce emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2008 to 2012. 
The witnesses at the hearings we held yesterday said you cannot get there from here. You cannot physically do it unless you triple nuclear and the renewables, including hydro. 
Let me conclude with one other thing. The President says we can do this without a carbon tax. The Department of Energy says you need a carbon permit price of $50/ton. There is no difference. 
There are no free rides. Somebody has to pay it. If it is a carbon tax, it is $50 a ton, and it goes to the consumer. If we set up some kind of a market in emissions, somebody like the Board of Trade starts trading permits, they are estimated to equate to $50 a ton. Somebody is going to have to pay for that, and that is the U.S. consumer. 
Let me conclude with just one observation as we address China, as we address the question of whether we should sell nuclear reactors and technology to China. 
China has the availability of nuclear power reactors from France. They have it from other nations. Canada is selling; Russia is selling. And certainly they are a nuclear power. 
Do we want China to burn more coal? We already have a prohibition against assisting China in the development of the world's largest hydroelectric project. It is called the Three Gorges Dam. The Eximbank will not assist. 
Let me tell you how big Three Gorges is. That plant would produce 18,000 megawatts, equal to 36 500-megawatt coal plants. So that is how China will address some of its energy demands from carbon-free hydropower. But we are prohibited from participating. And we are prohibited from participating in their nuclear power program. 
So I think, Mr. President, we have to be realistic. As the administration comes down with its plan, again, I suggest to you that the President has glossed over the issue of the developing countries' participation. 
I suggest and remind my colleagues of the Byrd-Hagel vote that was 95 to 0. It said developing nations must have targets and timetables in the same timeframe as the United States. And the Berlin Mandate says, no new commitments for developing nations. 
So I conclude by saying the President only says `meaningful commitments for developing nations.' And I say `meaningful' means what? 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the old adage says everybody likes to talk about the weather, but nobody can do anything about it. A particularly strong El Nino has meteorologists predicting strange weather this year, so expect lots of people to be talking about the weather in the months ahead. But in a new twist, many will claim that there is something we can do about the weather as well. 
I'm talking about efforts to curb global warming. And if you'll pardon the pun, this is one of the hottest debates we are likely to see over the next year. 
Is human activity the cause of this particularly strong El Nino, or the warming that some say is underway? Or is this just natural climate variation? Scientists are divided. The prestigious journal Science, in its issue of May 16, says that climate experts are a long way from proclaiming that human activities are heating up the earth. Indeed, the search for the human fingerprint in observed warming is far from over with many scientists saying that a clear resolution is at least a decade away. We continue to spend over $2 billion each year on the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program for the simple reason that the science is not settled. 
One thing that scientists can agree on is that the Earth's climate has always changed--the ice core and fossil records bear that out. Hippos once grazed in European rivers. Sea levels were low enough during periodic ice ages to allow humans to walk from Asia to North America. The climate changes. It always has. And it will continue to change regardless of what we do or don't do. 
Yesterday, the President revealed his negotiating position on a new climate treaty. He has proposed reducing our carbon emissions to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. The Department of Energy estimates that we will have to engage in a crash course of research and development, plus impose a $50 per ton carbon permit price--or tax--to achieve this target. 
Talks are underway at this moment in Bonn, and everyone is preparing for December negotiations in Kyoto, Japan. It is almost certain that legally binding targets and timetables will be a central feature of the new climate treaty expected to emerge in Kyoto--and that these targets and timetables will not apply to developing nations. Even if you are a proponent of strong action to address increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases thought to warm the Earth's climate, there are plenty of good reasons to oppose selectively applied, legally binding targets and timetables for greenhouse gas reductions as the President has proposed. 
First, these are really just emissions controls targeted at just a few of the 168 nations that are parties to this treaty. Aside from being just plain unfair, these new emissions controls will be devastating to large sectors of our economy. They will raise energy prices in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe--while China, South Korea, and Mexico are specifically exempted from them. 
As a consequence, energy-intensive industrial production, capital, jobs, and emissions will shift from the U.S. to developing nations not subjected to the new controls. What will result from that? According to a study by the Department of Energy: 20 to 30 percent of the U.S. chemical industry could move to developing countries over 15 to 30 years, with 200,000 jobs lost; U.S. steel production could fall 30 percent with accompanying job losses of 100,000; All primary aluminum plants in the United States could close by 2010; many petroleum refiners in the Northeast and gulf coast could close, and imports would displace more domestic production. 
Needless to say, China, South Korea, Mexico, and some of our other most competitive trading partners salivate at the prospect of this monumental shift in capital, production, and jobs. 
Putting economic and competitive aspects aside for a moment, it's important to ask the questions: Will these emissions controls applied only to a few nations work? Can they decrease emissions and stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations? 
The answer is no. Actual global emissions won't decrease--only their point of origin will change. In fact, because our industrial processes are more energy efficient than those found in most developing nations, global carbon emissions per unit of production would actually increase under the administration's approach. 
In other words, the United States and a few leading industrial nations would suffer domestic economic pain, without realizing any global environmental gain.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is often useful to compare the public statements of Government officials with their private statements. Such a comparison can say a great deal about an official's true motives, not to mention their character. Last week, in response to a question I posed for the public record, the Department of the Interior provided me with a copy of a memo written by Deputy Secretary of the Interior John Garamendi to his boss, Secretary Bruce Babbitt. This memorandum was dated February 21, 1996, and it concerns the Ward Valley low-level waste disposal issue. 
For those who do not know, Ward Valley is the site of a low-level radioactive waste facility licensed by the State of California under the Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. The site sits on the Bureau of Land Management land in a remote and sparsely populated area of the Mojave Desert. But the Department of the Interior reversed an earlier decision to sell the land to California, and has insisted on study after study to achieve endless delays. 
Meanwhile, low-level radioactive waste is piling up at hundreds of urban locations all across California. It is stored in basements, stored in parking lots, stored in trailers, stored in warehouses, and temporary shelters. It is on college campuses, it is in residential neighborhoods, it is in hospitals--sites that were not designed for permanent storage. As long as the waste in these temporary locations in populated areas is where it is, it is subject to accidental radioactive release from, fire, earthquakes, and floods. 
Governor Wilson is understandably concerned about the health and safety of Californians. That is his job. He is frustrated by the delays California has faced in trying to get this facility open, and so am I. 
I am further frustrated by the fact that the President's nominee to be the Deputy Secretary of the Interior, Mr. John Garamendi, appeared before our committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on July 27, 1995, and testified under oath that Ward Valley and the issue should and would be quickly resolved. Mind you, this was July, 1995. 
It may interest my colleagues to know that Ward Valley was scrutinized by two--not one, but two--environmental impact statements under NEPA, and two biological opinions under the Endangered Species Act. Although all these environmental reviews have been favorable to the Ward Valley facility, the Secretary of the Interior continues to opt for further studies rather than just transferring the land to California. 
In 1994, having seemingly exhausted the studies available to delay the process under NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary turned to the National Academy of Sciences and asked for yet another study. But in May 1995 the National Academy of Sciences study was complete, and again it was favorable to the Ward Valley site. 
Finally, it appeared that Secretary Babbitt had little choice but to transfer the land, and announced his intention to do so in May 1995. Environmentalists bitterly complained. Greenpeace even picketed the Secretary. Movie stars and pop singers rallied against the facility. It did not matter what the science said. The facts didn't seem to matter. It was simply good politics in California to oppose a radioactive waste site and I guess the Secretary did not like the unfavorable press he was getting at the time. 
Indeed, the politics of Ward Valley seems to loom large in another memorandum that we have uncovered, going back to 1993. I have a memorandum to the Secretary from October 19, 1993, that speaks to the prevailing mindset at Interior, and it says: 
And I quote: 
This memorandum addresses only the politics of Ward Valley. I can imagine no scenario that allows us to go forward with the land transfer and retain credibility with Boxer and the enviros. 
So to keep themselves out of hot water with environmental groups, Deputy Secretary Garamendi had to devise a new way to delay Ward Valley while simultaneously waging a public relations and political campaign against the site. 
As far as John Garamendi was concerned, a new excuse for a new study and further delay simply had to be found. 
So in February 1996, the Department of Interior evidently struck gold, or thought they had. A former low-level waste facility in Beatty, NV, was determined to be `leaking.' 
Ignoring the fact the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey told him that you could not relate Ward Valley with the Beatty, NV, site, Deputy Secretary Garamendi knew a good excuse for another study when he saw one and a PR campaign to go with it. 
So environmental and radiological factsheets were prepared by the Department for the press and the public, factsheets that were later criticized by the chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the errors and misinformation they contained. 
Press conferences were held where Deputy Secretary Garamendi announced that new tritium tests would be conducted, and another new EIS would be performed because of so-called new information about the Beatty, NV, site. 
These new studies and the lawsuits that would surely follow might take years. 
But what were Interior's true motivations? Did Interior ever intend to transfer the site under their watch? Was Interior interested in the public health and safety or good PR and political advantage? 
Mr. President, I now have the internal memo that cuts through the public statements and press releases to provide clear insight into the Department's motivations. Let me read this memorandum for my colleagues. It is dated February 21, 1996, memorandum to Bruce Babbitt from John Garamendi. Subject: Ward Valley:  
Attached are the Ward Valley [press] clips. We have taken the high ground. Wilson-- 
Meaning Governor Pete Wilson-- is the venal toady of special interests (radiation business). 
It goes further to state: 
I do not think Greenpeace will picket you any longer. I will maintain a heavy PR campaign until the issue is finally won. 
Mr. President, here is the Deputy Secretary of Interior engaged in a PR campaign to portray the Governor of California as a venal toady. For those in this Chamber who may not know the precise definition of a `venal toady,' it means a deferential, fawning parasite who is open to bribery. 
A venal toady. That is Secretary Garamendi's characterization of the Governor of California, or the goal of his PR campaign. I am not sure which. 
Is this what Deputy Secretary Garamendi calls the high ground? Is it taking the high ground to call for study after study and create delay after delay while ignoring all the studies that show the site is safe so far? 
Is it taking the high ground to keep radioactive waste spread around 800 locations in California subject to some accidental release, a flood, fire or earthquake, where literally millions of people could be exposed to radioactivity, or finding a site and put it there, which we have given California the authority to do? 
Is it taking the high ground to say you are working to protect public health when you are, in fact, endangering the public's health? 
Is it taking the high ground to pretend to be pursuing a careful deliberative process following standards of good Government when, in fact, you are waging a ruthless PR campaign in which misstatements and half-truths are used?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I might add, I did not seek this letter from the NRC. It came unsolicited. Perhaps one might give the Department the benefit of the doubt and recognize that it is human to err. But then you encounter a memorandum such as that of February 21 to the Secretary and the Department's intent becomes obvious. 
This is nothing more than a political and public relations game. Secretary Garamendi seems to be saying: Let's not worry about the waste or danger it may pose. If nothing is done, that's fine. Let somebody else take care of it on their watch. But let's just make the Governor of California look like a `parasite open to bribery,' as the definition of `venal toady' describes. 
I believe that the Department of Interior has absolutely no intention of transferring the Ward Valley land until they are ordered to do so by the Congress or the courts. 
If the Senators from California and I cannot work out something with respect to land transfer legislation, we will either have to have a floor fight of some kind or be content to let the courts decide the issue. 
I encourage my colleagues to recognize the significance of the administration's attitude toward the Ward Valley issue and refer to the memorandum that I have highlighted of February 21, 1996, from John Garamendi to Bruce Babbitt where he criticizes, in inappropriate terms, the motivation of the Governor of California and suggests to the Secretary that he does not think Greenpeace will picket him any longer. 
So again, Mr. President, the terminology, referring to the Governor of California as `the venal toady of special interests,' deserves reflection by my colleagues on the total inappropriateness of such a memorandum from the Deputy Secretary, John Garamendi, to the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Indian Employment and Training Improvements Act of 1997, making technical amendments to the Indian Job Training and Consolidation Act of 1992. I was an original cosponsor of this law because I saw a need to reduce unnecessary, repetitive administrative costs in job development programs geared toward American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
I am glad to say that after only a few years, it is clear that this program is working. Alaska tribal groups tell me that they have reported great savings in administering employment and training programs through consolidation of application and reporting requirements. The Cook inlet Tribal Corporation in Alaska alone reports a near tripling of jobs in the Anchorage area since the passage of this act, from 500 to nearly 1,500 jobs. The Aleutian Pribiloffs Island Association, the Bristol Bay Native Association, Tlingit-Haida Indian Tibes in southeast Alaska, and Kawerak corporation in Norton Sound all report satisfaction with this program. I thank these Alaska Native groups for working with my staff to complete these amendments. 
I would also like to thank Senator Campbell for his work on this issue and for introducing his fine bill. I look forward to combining the best aspects of our bills at a mark-up to be held later this year. I appreciate his sensitivity to Alaska-specific concerns on this and other Indian Affairs issues. 
Mr. President, my bill would make several technical corrections that would encourage more tribes to take advantage of this demonstration. Let me highlight a few of these changes. First, it would establish the Office of Self Governance as the lead agency, replacing the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This change is needed because the BIA has shown resistance to allowing two of its programs to be included in the program: the Johnson O'Malley education program and general assistance dollars. The Office of Self governance, in contrast, has shown itself to be an effective administration in working with tribes to meet their needs. 
Second, it would allow the regional non-profit corporations in Alaska to act on behalf of the tribes, without having specific authorizing resolutions on the exact subject at hand, though the tribes could always object and opt out of the regional's actions. Third, it would enable tribes to establish one consolidated advisory committee to encompass all the advisory councils currently required by the programs that are included in the demonstration. 
All these changes will allow the participating tribes to get more out of the Indian Job Training and consolidation Act by enabling them to better tailor their programs for their individual needs and by reducing regulatory barriers to efficient consolidation of Indian job training programs. 
Mr. President, the drop-out rate from college of Alaska Native kids in the Anchorage area is usually between 80-90 percent. We need to provide these young Alaskans with both educational and job skills so they can fully participate in Alaska's economy. The technical amendments I am introducing today will lead to further economic growth and more efficient use of Indian job training dollars. I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as Congress prepares to leave for the Columbus Day recess, I notice that there are other celebrations going on around Washington, including `National Day' celebrations in Chinatown. These celebrations brought to mind several issues that I wanted to share with my colleagues regarding United States relations with Taiwan. 
As Washington prepares for the State visit of President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China, some press reports have speculated that the issue of Taiwan might be on the summit agenda. First, let me say that I welcome the visit of President Jiang. High-level dialogue with the Chinese should be regular and routine, and this summit presents an opportunity to discuss many issues of mutual concern to our two countries. But let me add that improving relations with the PRC need not, and indeed, should not, come at the expense of our relationship with Taiwan. 
Therefore, I sent a letter, signed by 10 of my colleagues including Majority Leader Trent Lott, Minority Leader Tom Daschle, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Jesse Helms; and East Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee Chairman Craig Thomas, to President Clinton urging him to oppose any efforts at the summit by the PRC leadership to diminish American support for Taiwan.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act of 1997. This legislation protects the right of the elderly to be treated by the physician of their choice. 
Great reform of Medicare was achieved during the 1997 Balanced Budget Act: regulations were streamlined, greater flexibility was given to rural health care, and, most important, the Medicare trust fund--on the verge of bankruptcy--was salvaged for an additional 10 years. 
However, due to the administration's threat to veto the entire Balanced Budget act, the conference committee to the act added a requirement clearly infringing on the rights of senior citizens. The President's provision prohibits providers who privately contract from treating Medicare patients for a period of 2 years. Therefore, upon enactment of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, it is now unlawful for a doctor to take a private payment from a Medicare-eligible patient if during the previous 2 years he has billed Medicare for any service rendered to a patient over the age of 65. 
What is the reality of the President's provision? 
The reality is that it will be almost impossible for a senior citizen to contract privately for medical services because few or no physicians are going to be able to make ends meet if they can't accept Medicare patients for 2 years. The reality is that, unlike every other insured American, senior citizens have no option but to receive the services that their insurance carrier, Medicare, recognizes and is willing to pay for. In essence, upon turning the age of 65, you have now lost a significant right--a right of choice in who provides your health care. 
Mr. President, even in the socialized medical system of Great Britain, choice is offered to the elderly. In Great Britain, a senior citizen has the choice to pay privately for his or her medical services. Don't the elderly of America deserve that same choice? 
To remedy this situation, I have sponsored legislation introduced by Senator Kyl of Arizona and Senator Nickles of Oklahoma. This legislation explicitly provides that any Medicare beneficiary can enter into an agreement with the physician or practitioner of their choice for any health care service and for any length of time when they choose to pay for such services out of their own pocket. In brief, the bill will ensure that Medicare-eligible beneficiaries who choose to pay out of pocket will have an unrestricted right to the health care provider of their choice. I cosponsored a similar bill two years ago. 
The American Medical Association has strongly endorsed this legislation. In a letter dated September 18, 1997, the AMA executive vice-president writes: 
The AMA believes that it is essential that Medicare-eligible seniors have the unfettered right to spend their own money to buy health care if and as they so choose, irrespective of coverage under the Medicare program. * * * (this) bill is an urgently needed clarification of the law and would greatly further the goal of providing Medicare beneficiaries with more choices in their pursuit of health care. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate reference, legislation on behalf of myself and Senator Akaka that the administration has provided me in response to my request for a drafting service. This legislation represents the language that the administration believes will implement its recommendations contained in the most recent report on the Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, Immigration, and Law Enforcement in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 
In 1994, Congress directed this Initiative in Public Law 103-332 and provided $7 million for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 with an additional $3 million for fiscal year 1997. In testimony before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the administration committed to provide an annual report on the progress of the Initiative. 
Partially in response to concerns that had been raised about conditions in the Commonwealth, Senator Akaka and I visited Saipan in February of last year. In addition to extensive briefings and meetings with Commonwealth officials, we also met with Federal agency personnel and the U.S. attorney. We also visited a garment factory and talked with some Bangladesh workers who had not been paid and who were living in appalling conditions. We were assured that corrective action would be taken. I want to note that my concerns were not exclusively with the Commonwealth government, but also went to the willingness of the administration to commit the needed resources to address the problems that we saw. I specifically asked the Attorney General for the appointment of a full-time U.S. attorney for the Northern Marianas rather than having the U.S. attorney for Guam also serve the Northern Marianas. The Attorney General responded that there wasn't enough work to justify a U.S. attorney. 
On June 26 of last year, I chaired a hearing that examined what progress had been made. In addition to the administration, the acting Attorney General of the Commonwealth appeared and requested that the committee delay any action until the Commonwealth could complete a study on minimum wage and assured me that the study would be completed by January. I agreed to the delay. My intention was to revisit this issue in the April-May period after the administration had transmitted its annual report. While the CNMI study was not finally transmitted until April, the Administration did not transmit its annual report, which was due in April, until July. On May 30, 1997, the President wrote the Governor of the Northern Marianas that he was concerned over activities in the Commonwealth and had concluded that Federal immigration, naturalization, and minimum wage laws should apply. That letter provoked a flurry of statements, letters, articles, stories, and legislation, most of which generated more heat than light. 
It quickly became clear that unless there was some definition as to exactly what the problem was and what solution was being proposed, little would happen other than a series of bewildering and increasingly hostile statements. The atmosphere also made the possibility of a useful oversight hearing increasingly remote. I must say that I have not been particularly impressed by either the advocates of Federal legislation or the opponents. One side responds to concerns over workers living in barracks, abuse of domestics, prostitution, and other problems by 
suggesting that the answer is to raise the minimum wage. The response to allegations of abuse of workers, especially women, is not to propose raising the minimum wage. Paying a person more does not justify abuse. The other side of the argument seems to me to also miss the point. The last time we heard a justification that economic advances would be jeopardized if workers were treated properly was shortly before Appomattox. Whatever economic benefits some may have realized, that does not justify worker abuse, indentured servants, or the conditions that I saw those Bangladesh workers living in. 
There are certain issues that I believe need a full hearing and careful review. The minimum wage study that the Commonwealth commissioned noted at one point that the Marianas has used its control over immigration and minimum wage to import foreign workers who would be paid more than they would receive in their home countries, but less than the Federal minimum wage. These workers would produce garments that would be subject to quotas if produced in their home country, but which could be imported duty free into the mainland United States since the Marianas is outside the customs territory of the U.S. but subject to preferential treatment under General Note 3(a) of the Tariff Schedules. That is an issue that the Congress should review. 
When we considered the Covenant for the Marianas, we were sensitive to the fact that the Marianas had been under the minimum wage provisions of the Trust Territory and that immediate introduction of the Federal minimum wage might have an adverse effect on a developing economy that was still heavily dependent on annual Federal grants for basic Government services. We also recognized the concern expressed by the negotiators for the Northern Marianas that their small population could be overrun easily by migration. In response, we permitted the Marianas to control the timing of minimum wage and to exercise control over immigration. We also provided restraints on land alienation to protect the population. We did not consider that entrepreneurs would discover a loophole that would allow a lower minimum wage and immigration to create a non-indigenous industry that is Marianas in name only. Congress should examine whether this is a situation that should be permitted under the tariff schedules. 
There are also legitimate questions concerning minimum wage and immigration. We should now have sufficient experience to assess whether the Marianas is capable of providing the pre-clearance for any persons who attempt to enter the Marianas. The United States routinely does this in foreign countries as part of our visa process. The situation that I saw with the Bangladesh workers should never have happened. Reports of other workers who arrive only to find no jobs should also never happen. There should be no unemployment among the guest workers. These are legitimate immigration related issues. They do not necessarily lead to a Federal takeover, but they are legitimate issues and it serves no purpose to distort history and pretend that the current situation was the goal of the Covenant negotiators. 
Minimum wage is also a fairly straightforward issue. It does not appear that any U.S. citizens in the Northern Marianas are paid less than the current Federal minimum wage. Is there a justification and a need to pay foreign workers less and to what extent does the ability to import skilled foreign labor at less than Federal minimum wages contribute to the unemployment rate in the Marianas? Is there a reason to pay less than the minimum wage to attract skilled positions? There are issues that should be reviewed in a hearing.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor to the Special Separation Benefits [SSB] Improvement Act of 1997. Offered by my colleague on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs--Senator Jeffords, this legislation will correct a current injustice where service connected disabled veterans, who participate in the special separation benefits program [SSB], are wrongly doubled taxed on their benefits. 
In 1991, the Department of Defense [DOD], in an effort to downsize the armed services, established the SSB, which gives military personnel a lump sum payment to retire. However, for those veterans who are subsequently determined to have a service-connected disability, their SSB benefit amount is offset by withholding the veteran's disability compensation from the VA. A veteran only receives the SSB benefits after taxes are withheld. At the same time, disability compensation is not taxed. The injustice is that the veteran must repay with his or her disability compensation the pre-tax amount of the SSB payment--in effect double taxing the veteran's benefits. 
The Special Separation Benefits [SSB] Improvement Act of 1997 eases the double taxation for all members who participated in the SSB program retroactively to December 5, 1991. These servicemembers will receive payment for their lost compensation portion that was taxed. According to the Congress Budget Office [CBO], the near term costs are estimated to be less than $500,000 through the year 2000. For this small amount, Congress has the opportunity to correct an injustice against our veterans who have given so much. 
I hope that my colleagues can join me in cosponsoring this legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me wish the Presiding Officer a good morning. Let me thank my colleague from Georgia for his leadership in this area, and my good friend from Montana for the points he made so succinctly. 
Good morning, Madam President. I have an obligation and an opportunity as a member of the Finance Committee to address this problem. As a member of the committee of jurisdiction, I had the privilege of participating in an extraordinary set of hearings that were chaired by Senator Bill Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee. These hearings really illuminated for the first time the internal workings of an agency of the Government that really generates fear, anger, frustrations and oftentimes public outrage, and that is the Internal Revenue Service. 
No matter how scrupulous and honest the citizen is in filling out his or her tax return, when that taxpayer opens the mailbox and receives an envelope from the IRS, a shiver of fear shudders through that citizen. And after this week's hearings, it is clear to all of us why the public holds this view of the IRS. 
A witness--some of those witnesses were hooded, I might add--testified that her 17-year ordeal--let me say that it wasn't just an ordeal, it was more of a nightmare--involved improper liens and unwarranted demands from the IRS for more than $10,000 simply because there was a mixup in the taxpayer's employment identification number--17 years, and still the matter is not resolved. 
Another witness testified about her 14-year ongoing dispute with the IRS involving a joint return she had filed with her former husband. Although this matter could have been easily resolved, the IRS demands caused her to lose her apartment and ultimately forced her second husband to file for divorce to avoid improper IRS liens. 
Neither of these cases have been finally resolved even though it is clear that at every stage the IRS simply acted improperly. 
A former IRS employee told the committee of a common IRS tactic of assessing a tax twice for the same 1040 tax form. 
A current IRS employee, an employee who did not want his identity known for fear of IRS retaliation, told the committee of situations where revenue officers with management approval used enforcement to punish taxpayers instead of trying to collect the appropriate amount of money for the Government. 
Another anonymous current IRS employee told the committee that IRS officials browsed tax data on potential witnesses in Government tax cases, and on jurors sitting on these Government tax cases. 
Madam President, this is a portrait of an agency of Government which appears to be out of control. 
Is there political influence in the IRS? The answer is clearly yes. One witness testified that she had been advised by her senior official to be somewhat lenient on union returns or returns from union officials. This, obviously, smacks of political influence in the IRS. 
Earlier in the week it was reported that 800 Alaskans from my State received notices from the IRS that their permanent fund dividends--this is a payment that comes from the yield of oil revenues distributed to our citizens by our State government--were being seized; 800 seized with a tax lien. 
The reason for the seizures? The IRS claimed these Alaskans owed back taxes. In one case the notice claimed a deficiency of 4 cents. In another, 7 cents. That's right, Madam President, notices to 800 Alaskans based on alleged underpayments of 4 to 7 cents. An IRS spokesman apologized and, you guessed it, Madam President, blamed the computer. But who programmed the computer? Who checked the program? Is the programmer still working for the IRS? Who approved sending out 800 notices to Alaskans? 
From what I know about the IRS, no human being approved that mailing or the millions of other mailings that go out from the IRS. It appears to me that the managers of the IRS have set up a system that minimizes human oversight so that whatever and whenever there is a foulup, no employee, no manager can be held accountable. It is easier to blame an impersonal machine for a problem than hold an individual accountable. 
Madam President, I believe a culture that affixes blame on machines and not human beings reflects on an institution that has for far too long not been held to account for its activities. What we learned from the General Accounting Office is that the system the IRS has in place is designed to ensure that there is no way for IRS personnel to be held accountable for their erroneous actions. 
I can assure the American taxpayer that I will be working closely with my colleagues on Finance Committee to change the culture of the IRS and demand a system be put into place that makes the individuals who work for the IRS accountable to the American people. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a Senate resolution to commemorate Representative Hu of the Republic of China for his outstanding service as the head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office [TECRO] here in Washington, DC. President Lee Teng-hui has called Dr. Hu back to Taiwan to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This new appointment is a tremendous honor, and I am sure that he will serve his government as ably as Foreign Minister as he has done in Washington, and in his other previous posts. 
Serving Taiwan so well here in Washington, DC, has been no easy task. Dr. Hu must balance the needs of Taiwan with the difficult dynamics associated with the issues surrounding the Republic of China. Maintaining stability and peace in Southeast Asia while promoting democracy and strengthening our ties with our allies should be a top priority for both our governments. 
I have spoken often on the floor of the United States Senate regarding numerous issues including our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, Taiwan's bid to enter the World Trade Organization, President Lee's visit to Cornell in 1996, and military exercises by the People's Republic of China in the waters around the island of Taiwan on the eve of their historic Presidential elections. In all cases, Dr. Hu has provided valuable insights regarding these matters to me. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Hu has distinguished himself among his countrymen. From his days as the ROC delegation leader at the U.N. World Youth Assembly in 1970 to his current post as the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office here in Washington, DC, Dr. Hu has made a name for himself as an expert on foreign affairs. Obviously, President Lee recognizes Dr. Hu's abilities and has asked him to take the lead in foreign affairs. I hope Dr. Hu's replacement will be as helpful and knowledgeable about Taiwan issues. 
Finally, I would like to wish both Dr. Hu, his wife Shirley, and their two children good luck and express to him my heartfelt thanks for a job well done.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me first commend my good friend from Georgia for his efforts to bring attention to the significance of the current education situation in the United States, and in particular, for emphasizing some of the shortcomings in our educational system and what we can do to change them. I am very pleased to join him in this effort. 
Mr. President, I would like to talk about issues concerning education and the attitude of constituents with regard to what they see as insensitivity by the Federal Government. They look upon education as a responsibility that should be shared, with the primary concern resting with the parents, the educator, and then moving into the community as a whole and the school boards, as opposed to a centralized dictate from faceless and nameless bureaucrats in Washington, DC, dictating an educational system which suggests, `one size fits all'. 
When I go back to my State of Alaska, I consistently hear about the state of education--not only in my State but as it applies in our country today. I think it is fair to say that the American people are extremely concerned that, despite annually spending hundreds of billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local level, our education system to a large degree is failing. The simple fact is that 78 percent--I am astounded at this--of all 2- and 4-year colleges offer remedial courses in math, reading, and writing; 78 percent. We would assume that our high school students have these skills when they get to the university. But that is not the case. Seventy-eight percent of all 2- and 4-year colleges now offer remedial courses in math, reading, and writing. 
What does that suggest? It is pretty obvious that many high school students are being shortchanged in their academic preparations for adulthood. 
Is that a responsibility of the parents, the educators, the school board, or the system? Well, I would have to say, it is pretty much the system. 
As my friend from Georgia recently stated on this floor, the educational savings account offers relief. The recently enacted balanced budget bill contained nearly $40 billion in tax incentives to help parents and students defray college education costs. 
In addition, the new law provides individuals a $2,000-per-year lifetime learning tax credit that can be used by an individual throughout his or her life, to enhance professional skills or complete graduate or undergraduate degrees. 
I strongly support these tax incentives because in the globally competitive 21st century our Nation's economic success--our very future--will depend on a highly educated and high-skilled labor force. 
It is so disturbing today as we look at some of the areas, particularly the inner-city areas of this country, where, unfortunately, many young people come from homes in which they spent little time with either parent, and oftentimes with a relative trying to do the best he or she could in raising those children as a single parent. Some of these children are involved at a very young age in simply transporting narcotics, a trade made easier because law enforcement agencies might not initiate any significant sentencing on these young people. Some of them become addicted as teenagers and young adults and thus depart on this trail which leads to dire consequences. Others may be incarcerated from time to time as teenagers. The fact is when they are looking for a job, their skills are very limited. Many of them can't read and can't write. They have a very bleak future. Oftentimes that future leads to crime, drugs, and ultimately, a burden on society. 
It is just not the inner-city areas where we have this exposure. We have it in other areas of the country also. Obvioulsy, we need to alleviate this situation. To do so, we should assist families instead of offering a Federal solution which more often than not will not work. 
So I go into this area to elaborate a little bit on the dilemma facing society today. Some of the solutions that have been proposed, and the tax incentive for higher education that was supported by the President along with the majority of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, do not contain restrictions that condition the incentives on students attending a public university. So families at the college level can take advantage of incentives whether the children attend State school or private universities. 
But I think it is ironic that while the Congress and the President work so well together on promoting higher education incentives, the President, as we know, had threatened to veto the entire tax bill because a bipartisan group of Senators, including myself and the Senator from Georgia, sought to give parents with children in grades kindergarten through 12 basically similar tax choices. 
Why is it that it is all right to provide incentives for attending private universities but similar incentives are deemed inappropriate while students are attending kindergarten through 12? The White House has not offered much of an explanation. 
As important as a university education is this day and age, the best assurances that a child will do well in college, let alone be admitted to college, is the quality of education that student receives between the ages of approximately 5 through 18. When are study habits developed? When are reading, writing, and math skills developed? Everyone in this Chamber knows that children do not suddenly develop these disciplines when they enter college. The foundations for educational development begin at the early stages of kindergarten, preschool, and evolve as the student moves up in grades through junior high and high school. 
As we look at other societies, particularly Japan, I have often been struck by the commitment of parents. Many times the mother will study with the child. As a consequence, a family unit takes a significant interest in the learning process. When those youngsters who are in the Japanese system want to go on to school, they must take an exam. There is a great deal of family excitement around the test as the student studies for the exam and the family experiences a great deal of anticipation as to whether or not the child will pass the exam. But it is a system, if you will, that is 
supported by strong parental association. 
Sixty Senators voted in June to allow parents to establish educational savings accounts, proceeds of which could be used to offset the cost of private schools or home schools in the K through 12 grades. This would have given parents of young children a very modest tax subsidy if they choose to send their children to private school. Contributions to such accounts would not have been tax deductible. The only benefit of these accounts would have been that earnings could be withdrawn tax free. 
Although modest in scope, these accounts could have given real choices to low- and middle-income families who believe their children's best chance for the future lies in gaining an education in a private school. 
Income limits ensure that the benefits of these educational savings incentives would have been focused on middle-income families. Wealthy families most often do not need to use these educational accounts because they can easily afford the cost of private K through 12 tuition and because the tax base in wealthy communities often provides the best possible public education in the Nation. 
But middle- and low-income families don't have the same choices that the wealthy have when it comes to education because they don't have the adequate resources to pay private tuition. Allowing these families the choice of using funds from educational savings accounts for grades K through 12 would enable families with modest incomes to send their children to the schools where they believe that the child will get the best preparation for college. 
What is wrong with that? 
Mr. President, if the education savings accounts can be justified for college tuition, shouldn't they also be allowed for the educational expense that gives the child the opportunity to apply to college? 
Mr. President, Congress and the President will again have the opportunity to debate this aspect of educational choice in front of the American public. 
I am pleased to be a cosponsor with my good friend, Senator Coverdell, who is with me on the floor today, of his bill, PASS A+ Act--and I think that is an appropriate name, PASS A+ Act--which would allow parents to make contributions to education savings accounts that can be used to finance K through 12 education. 
I hope we can pass this legislation before the end of the year. I hope that President Clinton will reconsider his opposition to helping families finance the cost of sending their children to the primary and secondary schools of their choice. 
Mr. President, while I am a strong supporter of giving families a choice of where they send their children to school, I believe a vibrant and dynamic public school educational system is a strong bulwark of a free society, and I totally support it in this Nation. 
That is why I supported an amendment to the Labor-HHS bill offered by Senator Slade Gorton that will award all funds appropriated to the Department of Education for K through 12 programs directly to local school districts. 
Let the local school districts bear the responsibility associated with the education process and let them be responsive to the parents of those children entrusted to the local boards of education for performance. That is the concept, the very basis of the accountability concept. It is pretty hard to hold nameless bureaucrats in Washington, DC, under a dictate one-size-fits-all. I think Senator Gorton's amendment puts the responsibility down at the local area, with the local school boards, by giving them, if you will, the necessary funding. His amendment I think reflects my fundamental belief that education policies and procedures are best determined by those who are the closest to the student. That means shifting decisionmaking to parents, teachers, and local school boards and away from Washington bureaucrats. 
By simply block granting education dollars to local school boards, each of the thousands of communities in this country will have the flexibility to improve their education system at the local level, putting the responsibility on the people. 
And by consolidating Federal education funds into a block grant we can assure that almost every school district will receive more funds for actual education rather than having the funds lost in a bureaucratic administration mire that exists here in Washington. 
Under the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, more than $11 billion would be distributed under the block grant approach. Currently, the costs of administering the programs that would be block granted represent nearly 15 percent of the $11 billion. The block grant approach would free up the administrative dollars, meaning nearly $1.5 billion more--$1.5 billion more--could be used for students instead of filling out forms to be sent back to Washington, DC. 
Mr. President, there are 788 Federal education programs that spend nearly $100 billion a year. How many of these are necessary? These programs are administered by 40 departments and agencies of the Federal Government. These agencies, I assure you, are not supportive of our proposal because they would not have anything to do. 
Well, it is time to do a top-to-bottom review of how we could streamline the delivery of education dollars to local communities, and I think Senator Gorton's amendment is the first step. It is my hope the President will support this approach through educational funding that puts children and teachers ahead of bureaucrats and program managers in Washington. 
So I think it is time for Washington to catch up with the American people on how to improve the educational opportunities of our children. 
Mr. President, I wonder if I could defer and make a short introduction of a resolution that would follow as opposed to interrupting the presentation by my colleague.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my good friend, the Senator from Texas. 
I rise today to support the amendment submitted by my distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison. I think her amendment represents a reasonable compromise to what has become a very divisive issue. 
I think every Member of this Chamber would agree that some of the works the NEA has funded in the past have been offensive. They call into question the appropriateness of the Federal Government being involved in the promotion of the arts. Several years ago we had an exhibit here--and it had to be covered. We couldn't allow the Senate pages to see it. It was absolutely unsuitable for public view--certainly for young people. I personally was offended, and I think we all learned something from that. 
Art works funded by a Federal agency should be those you take your children to see and, in the case of NEA-sponsored works, this has not always been the case. But, certainly the arts, overall, have a legitimate voice in our society. I think the amendment of Senator Hutchison that would take 20 percent of the NEA budget and keep it here in Washington, DC to be distributed to works of national prominence is satisfactory. It also addresses the concerns of those who do not believe it is in the Federal Government's jurisdiction to fund the arts. She has an answer to that--send 75 percent of the money to the States. This amendment will allow each of our States to develop the arts locally, hopefully reflecting the true role of the arts and the role they play in each of our communities. 
I think this is a good amendment and merits the overwhelming support of this Chamber. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, I would like to call attention to the statement that was made by the Senator from Arkansas relative to the Green Creek Mine. The thing that made that so different is the 
unique characteristic of that particular discovery, where all the components were known relative to the value of the minerals. The roads were in, the infrastructure was in. It was not a matter of discovery, going out in an area and wondering whether you were going to develop a sufficiency of resources to amortize the investment necessary to put in a mine. So I remind my colleagues, there is a big difference between the rhetoric that we have heard here and the practical realities of experience in the mining industry. 
We have seen both the effort by Canada and Mexico to initiate royalties. What has happened to their mining industry? It simply moved offshore. We have to maintain a competitive atmosphere on a worldwide basis; otherwise the reality for United States mining will be the same as was experienced in both Mexico and Canada. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to Senator Bumpers' amendment. This is not the first attempt he has made, initiating actions through the Interior appropriations process. We seem to be subjected to this every year. I know the intentions are good. But the reality is that the amendment as offered represents a profound--and I urge my colleagues to reflect on this--a profound and wide-reaching attempt to reform the Nation's mining laws in a way that prevents any real understanding of the impacts of the legislation. Because, as written, Senator Bumpers' amendment would not only put a royalty of all mining claims--all mining claims--but would also put a fee on all minerals produced off of lands that have ever gone to patent. Those are private lands. Let me, again, cite what this amendment does. It would not only put a royalty on all mining claims, but would also put a fee on all minerals produced off lands that have ever gone to patent. Those are private lands. So, this is nothing more than a tax. It is a tax. And it is this Senator's opinion that this makes Senator Bumpers' amendment subject to a constitutional point of order. 
Let me set this aside for a moment and address the specifics of my opposition to the amendment. This approach to revenue generation is no different than placing a tax on, say, all agricultural production from lands that were at one time, say, homesteads. It is retroactive. Even though Senator Bumpers doesn't like it, the fact remains that patent claims are exactly the same as homestead lands. They are all private lands. 
I cannot even begin to imagine the genesis of this punitive and dangerous amendment. This is an unmitigated attack on all things mining. We have absolutely no idea what impact this legislation would have on our ability to maintain a dependable supply of minerals; no idea what environmental disasters would be created when this legislation shuts down the producing mines across the country. We have no idea how many workers will be put on the unemployment line. We have no idea whatsoever on the effects of this legislation. 
The issue is very complex. It is not appropriate that it be dealt with in an appropriations process. There is a right way and a wrong way to go about mining reform. You can chose the right way and offer your reform in a fair and open process, giving everyone the opportunity to participate in the formation of the legislation, which is what Senator Craig and I, along with the cosponsors of the legislation, have attempted to do in the legislation that has been offered. Or you can, as I observe, do what Senator Bumpers has seen fit to do and offer your legislation in a form where not one single person outside the Senator's office has the opportunity to either understand or contribute to the process. 
I think there is too much at stake in mining reform to treat this complex subject in such a dangerous and offhand manner. Senator Craig, along with myself, Senator Reid, Senator Bryan, Senator Bennett, Senator Burns, Senator Hatch, Senator Thomas, Senator Campbell, Senator Stevens, Senator Kempthorne, among a few, have introduced S. 1102, the Mining Reform Act of 1997. As such, I encourage my colleagues to recognize the time and effort that has been put into developing a package of reforms that set the stage for a meaningful, honest, and comprehensive reform. We are going to be holding a series of hearings to explore all aspects of the legislation and the effect it will have on the Nation's environment and economy. 
I know many Members have indicated their interest in the formation of this legislation and the process of the hearings as they unfold and intend to participate. This is how reforms should take place. Reform should take place in an orderly manner in the hearing process, and we have lived up, I think, to the expectations of those who have indicated, `All right, we will stand with you, but give us a bill.' We have met that obligation and filed a piece of comprehensive mining reform legislation. 
We are going to consider the amendments as part of the process of debate, and if they make a legitimate contribution to the mining reform effort--and I emphasize reform effort--we are going to adopt them. This is the appropriate method to resolve mining reform, not as a last-minute amendment to the Interior appropriations bill, which we have seen the Senator from Arkansas propose time and time again. 
The reform that Senator Craig, I, and others have offered lays a solid foundation upon which to build mining reform. Our mining reform bill should, I think, please reasonable voices on both sides. If you seek reform that brings a fair return to the Treasury, and it is patterned after the policies of the mining law of Nevada--and it works in Nevada--and it protects the environment and preserves our ability to produce strategic minerals, I think you will find a great deal to support in this legislation. It does work. 
The legislation protects some of the smaller interests, the small miners. It maintains traditional location and discovery practices. 
Yes, it is time for reform, but it has to be done right. Bad decisions will harm a $5 billion industry whose products are the muscle and sinew of the Nation's industrial output. The future of as many as 120,000 American miners and their families and their communities are at stake. Any action to move on amendment is absolutely irresponsible to those individuals, because it is the wrong way to do it. 
I know you have heard this before, time and time again, but we do have a bill in now and it is a responsible bill. We owe Americans a balanced and open resolution to the mining reform debate. This reform mining legislation honors the past, recognizes the present, and sets the stage, I think, for a bright future. 
The legislation that we offer advances reforms in four areas: royalties, patents, operations, and reclamation. 
Let me be very brief in referring to the royalties. The legislation creates the first-ever hard rock royalty. It requires that 5 percent of the profit made from mining on Federal lands be paid to the Federal Government. This legislation seeks a percentage of the profit, not the value of the mineral in place. We do this for a very specific reason. Failure to do so would cause a shutdown of many operations and prevent the opening of new mines. It would also cause other operators to cast low-ore concentrates into the spoil pile as they seek out only the very highest grade of ores. 
America boasts some very profitable mines, but there is an equal number that operate on a very thin margin. The Senator from Arkansas doesn't address the reality of what happens when the price of silver or the price of gold drops and their margin squeezes. We have some mines that actually operate during those periods with substantial losses. 
That is why we designed our royalty to take a percentage of the profits. Under the proposal that the Senator from Arkansas has proposed, time and time again, many of these mines would actually operate at a loss because they could not deduct their production costs prior to the sale of their finished product. 
If the mine makes money, the public gets a share. That is a fair way to do it. Nobody benefits from a royalty system so intrusive that it must be paid for through the loss of jobs, the health of local communities, and the abandonment of lower grade mineral resources. 
Some would want to simply drive the mining industry out of the United States because they look at it as some kind of an environmental devil that somehow can't, through advanced technology, make a contribution to the Nation. I say that they can, they will and, through this legislation, they will be able to do a better job. 
In 1974, British Columbia put a royalty on minerals before 
cost of production was factored in. Five thousand miners lost their jobs. That is a fact. Only one new mine went into operation in 1976. The industry was devastated. The royalty was removed 2 years later in 1978. 
That is the reality of the world in which we live and the international competitiveness associated with this industry. Years later, the industry in British Columbia still has not completely recovered. I happen to know what I am talking about because the Senator from Alaska is very close to our neighbors in British Columbia. 
So I say to those who forget history, they are doomed to repeat it. 
Patents: Patenting grants the right to take title to lands containing minerals upon demonstration that the land can support a profitable operation. 
Patents have been abused, no question about it. A small number of unscrupulous individuals have located mineral operations for the sole purpose of gaining title and turning the land into a lodge or ski resort. These practices are wrong. They are not allowed under the new legislation. 
The reform that we have offered cures these problems without punishing the innocent. We would continue to issue patents to people engaged in legitimate mining operations, but a patent would be revoked if the land is used for purposes other than mining. 
Operations: To separate legitimate miners from mere speculators and to unburden the Government from mining claims with no real potential, we require a $25 filing fee be paid at the time the claim is filed and make the annual $100 claim maintenance fee permanent. 
Environmental protection: Our revisions weave a tight environmental safety net. The reform permit process requires approval for all but the most minimal activities. The bill requires reclamation, and the bill requires full bonding to deal with abandonment. 
The Senator from Arkansas doesn't acknowledge the effort relative to what this bonding will mean. It will mean that mines that are abandoned will have a reclamation bond in place to make sure the public does not have to bear the cost of cleanup. The bond is going to be there; it is going to be held. It is a performance bond, that is what it means. 
As we address the responsibility for a prudent mining bill, please recognize the contributions that have been made in trying to formulate something realistic that will address the abuses that we have had in the past. That is what we do in our bill. 
The bill addresses mines already abandoned by establishing a reclamation fund as well. Filing fees, maintenance fees and the royalty go into that fund. So we have addressed that in a responsible manner. 
For those who seek meaningful reform to the Nation's general mining laws, then our legislation does the job. It fixes past abuses without punishing the innocent. It shares profits without putting people out of work. It assures the mining operations cause the least possible disturbance. And it makes sure we don't pay for actions of a few bad operators and provide sources of funds for reclamation. 
Both sides of the mining reform debate have come a long way toward a constructive compromise. I have met with Senator Bumpers on many occasions, and at one time actually thought we were going to reach an accord. But unfortunately we didn't. But we have gone ahead and put in the bill. The bill will help carry us, I think, the last mile and provide the balanced reform that has, so far, eluded us. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me, Senator Craig and others in continuing to craft this open and meaningful mining reform. With equal vigor, I ask each and every Member of this body to join us in opposing Senator Bumpers' proposal, a reform crafted in the dark of night and offered in a forum guaranteed to confuse and shroud the real impact of the legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join with my colleague the Senator from New Mexico with regard to the amendment that he has offered. 
What this amendment would do is avoid the ultimate budget gimmick, which is selling $60 a barrel oil for $18 and calling it `income' for the American taxpayer. These oil sales would result in $173 million actual loss to the American taxpayer. 
We have sold 28 million barrels of oil. What have we sold it for? To contribute to balancing the budget. Think of the inconsistency here. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975. We created it because at that time we were dependent on imported oil for about 36 or 37 percent of our oil consumption. Today we are facing a 52 percent dependence on imported oil. 
In light of our current situation, selling down the SPR simply makes no sense whatever. In 1975, when we were 32 percent dependent, we formulated the SPR with the idea we had to have a reserve oil supply in case of national emergency, and suddenly when we are 52 percent dependent, we start to sell the reserve? 
The oil from Elk Hills was supposed to go to the SPR, but we have waived the requirement for the last 10 years, and the oil was sold to balance the budget. Now we are selling Elk Hills, and it is only right that some of the money go to the purpose of stopping the drain on SPR. 
This amendment does not cost the taxpayers any money. What we are trying to do is try to avoid a huge loss. This amendment works within the budget rules and avoids a terrible policy result--both from the energy and budgetary standpoint--buying high and selling low. 
But the Government seems to do it all the time. We are like the man in the old joke who was buying high and selling low and who claimed that he `would make it up on volume.' 
So, today, Senator Bingaman and I are introducing this amendment to provide a short-term source of funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Soon, the Department of Energy will complete the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1, as directed by Congress. We are optimistic that the sale will raise more money than previously estimated. This amendment would place proceeds in excess of $2 billion from that sale in a fund that would be used to pay for the SPR. 
This amendment was proposed by the DOE and should, at a minimum, avoid an oil sale in the next fiscal year. I think it is appropriate that extra proceeds from the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve, after contributing to deficit reduction, be used to stop the drain on our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
The amendment will not permanently resolve the problems with providing funding for SPR, but it should temporarily stop the bleeding. In the face of our oil dependency, and the continuing drain on SPR, I can't resist noting that there are still some in this body that oppose the production of domestic oil resources. 
So as it stands now, this body does not appear to support the domestic storage or production of oil. Some may not like the reality that this Nation will continue to need petroleum. Petroleum moves our transportation system. We have no other alternative, at least none in the foreseeable future. However, reality doesn't cease to be a reality because we ignore it. We are talking about people's lives, jobs, their livelihood. I certainly understand the difficult task that the Appropriations Committee faces as it attempts to fund all of the important programs under its jurisdiction. 
However, I must insist that, in the future, we resist the temptation to drain the SPR to meet these priorities, if indeed the SPR has an objective at all, which is to serve as the country's energy security during a time of crisis. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support the amendment today. I also strongly urge my colleagues to join with us to permanently end the draining of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to fulfill our shortsighted, short-term desires. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me commend my good friend, the Senator from Alaska, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens. 
I want to point out that my amendment is very similar to the one offered by the Senator from Arizona. It does, however, make one significant change that I think is critical to the success of this trust fund. 
Before I start, I want to say that I am particularly pleased that Senator McCain recognizes the significance of these funds--the $1.6 billion that flowed from receipts that had been generated from lease sales in Alaska, the offshore, so-called `Dinkum Sands.' He has taken my Senate bill, S. 1118, and used it as the model for his amendment. Obviously believing that this authorization should occur on an appropriations bill. 
My particular initial concept was to use $800 million to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
I think the improvement that the Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator have added formulating consideration of the national parks, as well as Arctic research, are to be commended. And, as a consequence, I think the appropriateness of my second degree is worthy of consideration. 
My amendment differs specifically on one significant measure. It places simply all of the Dinkum Sands escrow account--that is $1.6 billion--in an interest-bearing account in the Treasury Department as opposed to the amendment of Senator McCain, which would put only half of that amount--or $800 million in an interest-bearing account in the U.S. Treasury. 
What we would do, Mr. President, is not utilize the principal but simply the yield. The interest off the account would be approximately $120 million a year, and would be distributed in the same manner as the McCain-Stevens-Murkowski amendment: Forty percent would go to our national parks; 40 percent to the state-side Land and Water Conservation Fund and 20 percent to Arctic research. 
I might add the necessity of funding our national parks is as a consequence of the billions of dollars in deferred maintenance that are associated with those parks, and the reality that we clearly need some capital improvement projects. 
So, again there would be a long-term funding mechanism. And the merits, I think, speak for themselves. 
It would relieve the appropriators in the sense that this would fund a good deal of what currently we have to fund through an annual appropriation process. 
I am not going to go through the jungle of bureaucratic interpretations and the manner in which the Budget Committee has to operate. But 40 percent would go to national parks capital improvement projects, and 40 percent to the State, matching the Land and Water Conservation Fund. That is a State and Federal matching program which has done a great deal in the history of encouraging States, and the people in those States and communities, to generate funding of their own with the Federal matching funds and pride for worthwhile projects in their communities. Twenty percent would go into marine research, primarily in the Arctic. 
Here is the authorization and appropriation chart for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. You can see the that authorizations have simply gone off the chart. We continue to authorize, and feel good about it. We go home and say, `We have authorized the project.' But if it is not appropriated, why, it is window dressing. 
You can see the red line, or the actual appropriations. They hit a high in 1977 of about $800 million. They dropped down to virtually nothing--somewhere in the area of $150 million in 1981, and they have leveled off. The state-side LWCF matching grant program has fared even worse. 
Clearly, this is a worthwhile program. It is two for one: for every Federal dollar it is matched by state and local money. 
There is the other chart, shows the demand for stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund grants. 
Clearly, the demand is there from America, American citizens, and communities with regard to the benefits of this type of funding. 
By placing only half of the Dinkum Sands revenue in this fund, I think it will be self-defeating. It will not provide the money necessary to adequately fund these programs, especially the State-side Land and Water Conservation Fund matching grant programs. 
I would also like to say that as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I intend to work with the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee next year to ensure that we have not just created another paper account. Rather, I promise to work to ensure that the money earned off this account will be available for appropriations for the very important purposes we set forth in this amendment. 
Before the conference we would like to work with the Budget Committee on how to best minimize the impact of this amendment on the appropriators. That is the only way we can answer the call of my outdoor recreation initiative to reinvigorate our parks, forests, and public lands in order to enhance Americans' visits to those parks and conserve natural resources, wildlife and open spaces. 
My bill--S. 1118--now a part of my second-degree amendment, would create a trust fund with the $1.6 billion Dinkum Sands escrow account. It would use just the interest from the account as follows: 40 percent to fund capital improvement projects at our national parks; 40 percent to fund State-side LWCF matching grants; and 20 percent to fund arctic research. 
With respect to the portion that would go to the state-side LWCF matching grant program, for over 30 years those grants have helped preserve open spaces. They have built thousands of picnic areas, trails, parks and other recreation facilities. 
I urge my colleagues to look at the merits. This is one chance in a lifetime where we have found the funding, $1.6 billion. We can put this money in an area which has worked so successfully and address the legacy that we have to maintain our national, state and local parks. 
At a June 11 hearing, witnesses from across the country testified in support of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It has helped fund over 8,500 acquisitions on 2.3 million acres and built 28,000 recreation facilities in all of the 50 States. Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund grants are matched dollar for dollar by State and local communities so Americans can get two for the price of one. My amendment presents an opportunity to expand on that possibility. 
The state-side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act makes it possible to have a national system of parks, as opposed to just a National Park System. So one would ask, why did Congress and the administration defund this successful program 2 years ago? Well, that is a good question, Mr. President. They defunded it because they had other priorities. 
This is an opportunity to address one of America's highest priorities, and that is our national system of parks. Working with the coalition including Americans for Our Heritage and Recreation, the National Conference of Mayors, the National Recreation and Parks Association and various endowment groups, we were successful in building support for the Land and Water Conservation State grant program. 
Senator Gorton, I think, heard the message. He put funding for the state-side LWCF matching grant program in the Interior appropriations bill, for which we are most appreciative. I think his wise action ensures the short-term viability of the stateside matching grant program. 
Our next step, of course, is to find a long-term program for the State matching grant, and our amendment, like my initial effort, certainly does that. That is why I support the initial amendment by the Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens. But as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the committee with jurisdiction over national 
parks, I recognize the reality of what we are doing here. We are moving without the authorization of the respective committees, and I am certainly sensitive to that. But this is a rare and extraordinary opportunity to address the disposition of funds that come in, and as a consequence I think can best be used in the manner proposed in my amendment. 
I might say further that I am happy that a portion of the interest will fund this backlog of capital projects in our parks. We have held committee oversight hearings on March 13 and March 20 to tackle the challenge of park maintenance, and I am glad to see Senator Thomas, who chaired this meeting, is joining me in this second-degree amendment. 
I think it is important to recognize further, Mr. President, as we address this rare opportunity, that we have had in the Energy Committee extensive hearings on this matter. This is a chance where America can take better care of her parks, and it is our duty to restore their brilliance, their luster. We face an $8.6 billion backlog of unfunded Park Service operations and programs in this country --$8.6 billion. We are not appropriating the funds. The interest earned by this account may not be enough, and until the National Park Service has a system for settling priorities for capital improvements and infrastructure repair, Congress is going to have to keep a close eye on how the money is spent. But we have the money and we are directing that it not go for administration purposes of the Park Service. 
The land and water conservation fund is authorized through the year 2015 at $900 million a year. However, far less than that authorized amount is appropriated each year, and we now have an opportunity to fix the system. 
Using the proceeds of this account for these purposes makes sense. It is consistent with the vision of the Land and Water Conservation Act and the promises made three decades ago. These promises were, I remind my colleagues, that oil receipts, offshore oil receipts, will primarily fund the land and water conservation fund for public recreation and conservation in this country. 
Well, it is fine to put it in, and obviously the industry is out there and they are initiating a cash flowback, but it is not going where it was intended simply because there are other priorities. And I am not here to delve into the priorities. 
Mr. President, if the underlying amendment were made law, the interest on the account which could be spent on the stateside Land and Water Conservation fund grant program would only be somewhere between $16 million and $24 million--not much to be divided between the 50 States, territories and Indian tribes. If the need in our country for recreation is overwhelming, the very health of our Nation requires our attention, and the States are in the best position to address that shortfall. 
I would like to point out, if the amendment that I have proposed is accepted, this amount we were looking at from the yield off the principal, not the expenditure, would total some $32 million to $48 million for the stateside LWCF matching grant program each year--a considerably increased sum and obviously more meaningful to the States and territories as well. 
The needs in our country for recreation are overwhelming. The very health of our Nation and our natural human resources depend on programs such as this, particularly in the innercity areas. Again, every dollar we provide to the stateside of the land and water conservation program doubles the impact as far as this matter is concerned. 
Finally, we have an opportunity to take a step to improve the System and reap benefits for our children and their children. 
Finally, the question is, do you want to do just a little or do you want to have a major impact--a major impact--on preserving open spaces, refurbish and build picnic areas, trails, parks and other recreation facilities. You have the opportunity.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me turn to the issue of Arctic and North Pacific fisheries research--a critical issue I have worked on from my first day in the Senate: 
My first speech on the floor of the Senate involved the importance of Arctic research, particularly as it related to fisheries. 
My first major legislative initiative was the Arctic Research and Policy Act, signed into law by President Reagan. 
The Arctic Research Commission, created by this Act, had as its first recommendation the need to develop a fuller understanding of Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea, and the ecosystems they sustain. 
This amendment include our effort to fulfill the commission's recommendations. I am pleased to see the commission play an important role on the board created by this amendment. 
I particularly like the approach of using proceeds from Arctic OCS revenues invested in scientific research to better understand the Arctic ecosystem: 
Arctic wealth provided these revenues, so it is only fair to return a portion to help protect the Arctic itself. 
The wealth of North America is in the Arctic. Not simply energy and mineral wealth--but also a wealth of renewable resources, a wealth of scenic beauty, a wealth of diverse living ecosystems, and a wealth of recreational opportunities. 
Our scientific investment in this part of the world is inadequate, particularly when we compare it with what we spend for scientific research in the Antarctic, where we do not have people or resources. 
Today we take another step in addressing this inequity. It isn't the first step, nor will it be the last. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The mayors of every city in the Nation want it, the Governors of every State in the Nation know the good that can be accomplished. 
I think the Chair. 
I commend the amendment to the Senate, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe this is the Stampede Creek Mine amendment. I am not sure of the status of the issue, other than I believe the minority has agreed to it and it has been discussed. There was a question by the occupant of the chair and by the Senator from Arizona. 
In 1987, the Federal Government, through the Park Service, blew up the University of Alaska's mine. This was a mine that was a working model. It was in Denali National Park. It had been donated to the University of Alaska School of Mines by a man by the name of Earl Pilgrim who, in 1942, purchased the claim and continued to operate the mine--it was an antimony mine--until 1972. At one time, the mine was the second-largest producer of antimony in the United States. It was located in an isolated section of the park preserve. The Stampede Mine was found to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places on June 20, 1989. 
Today, the mine site contains--excuse me, did contain several historic workable structures. The site is rich in equipment, machinery, tools, and the myriad objects that make up the stuff of a mining camp. Many of these items are unique to the Pilgrim's operation and reflect on his own inventiveness and mechanical skills. 
In 1979, Stampede Mines, LTD, entered into negotiations with the National Park Service and the University of Alaska. As a result of those negotiations, the mining company made a donation to the National Park Service of the surface rights including road access from the airstrip, the historic buildings, water rights, and stream banks. 
It was believed at the time that the National Park Service possessed the wherewithal to better maintain and protect the valuable historic structures. Unfortunately, in 1987, history would record that there was very little merit to this line of thinking. 
At the same time, the University of Alaska Fairbanks' School of Mineral Engineering was donated all the mining rights, mining equipment, and fixtures, with mineral development restrictions for the education of students. 
Mr. President, the mineral development restrictions included provisions which allowed for only educational use of the mineral estate. No commercial mining would be allowed, only small-scale educational mining, and even though the buildings, roads, trails, and airstrips were owned by the Park Service, the university is responsible for maintaining them. 
The School of Mineral Engineering was most pleased with the arrangement and looked forward to providing their mining students a unique opportunity to learn firsthand about earlier- to present-day mining operations and equipment by having the mining mill to actually operate for the students. Given the chance, they would like the opportunity to conduct such an education program in the future. 
The educational program is consistent with the intent of the university's receipt of the property. The School of Mineral Engineering has developed a meaningful program that provides for initiating activities associated with instruction-investigation about environmentally sound mineral exploration and mining techniques in a sensitive natural environment, as well as studying the geology, biology, and ecology of the area, and studying the historical aspects of the mine. 
The program has already helped the mineral industry develop methods to explore for and develop minerals on lands located in sensitive areas throughout Alaska, even on land controlled by the Department of the Interior. 
Mr. President, it was to be an absolute win for the National Park Service and a win in the field of education for the university. No one in their worst nightmares, would have believed that the National Park Service could blow this opportunity. 
During 1986-87 National Park Service personnel conducted field inspections of old mining sites located on their lands for the purposes of identifying potentially contaminated sites and hazardous conditions. 
Toward the end of July 1986, the Stampede Creek site was examined. The inspectors recommended immediate action to examine the safety of old blasting caps and chemicals at the site. Before taking any action, the inspectors recommended that the ownership issue be resolved. 
In other words, Mr. President, someone actually considered private property. The matter was treated as serious, but not an emergency or life-threatening. Nothing further occurred for 8 months. 
Subsequently, National Park Service personnel and members of the U.S. Army's explosive ordnance detonation team arrived, unannounced, at the Stampede Mine site and on April 30, 1987, changed the configuration of the mine site and its historic structures. 
Mr. President, they moved 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate--private property of the University--and placed it on top of the still frozen Stampede Creek. Ammonium nitrate may sound dangerous but in its packaged state it is nothing more than common fertilizer. 
They piled 4,000 pounds of fertilizer on top of the creek and added several half gallon bottles of acid-more private property which they retrieved from the assay lab. Finally they added 45 pounds of high explosives--set the charge and left the area. 
Mr. President, let me refer to the pictures on my right which show the Stampede Mine prior to this episode of the Park Service and the U.S. Army ordinance detonation team. 
This is the Stampede Creek. This is the mill and the mine. The mine is back here in the hills. This is where the concentrates are recovered, and so forth. The pictures show the facilities before the explosion occurred. 
I am going to show you the next chart which shows you what happened when the Park Service finished their work. This is what the mine and the mill looked like. As you can see, it is totally devastated by the blast. 
When the smoke cleared and all the debris fell back to the earth, they found that the explosion left a crater in the creek 28 feet wide and 8 feet deep. They also noticed a substantial change in the mining site, which is depicted by this photograph. 
Let me show you again the creek which indicates the significance of what this crater did to this stream bed. You can imagine a hole 28 feet wide and 8 feet deep. And this creek flows down into the watershed that flows into the Tanana River which flows into the Yukon River, obviously polluting and killing fish along the way. 
The Park Service did it, Mr. President. 
In addition to the mine entrance and mill, damage occurred to other buildings, trees, landscape, and stream bed. The bombing also blew up a 5,000 ton tailings pile which by using USGS records for the current price of metals would be worth approximately $600,000 in place. Unfortunately the heavy metals of the tailings pile were last seen moving from the site and being scattered throughout the environment by the force of the blast. 
One of the most telling reports concerning this debacle is from the U.S. Army incident report No. 176-23-87 which stated that the NPS personnel were aware that detonation would result in damage to the surrounding buildings and according to Sergeant Seutter `at no time was it relayed to me that damage was unacceptable. 
Mr. President, violations of the law are clear. There are violations of the Clean Water Act, the Historic Preservation Act, section 404 of the Clean Water Act involving wetlands, not to mention the taking and destruction of private property. 
Further, since the explosion, approximately $2 million worth of mining equipment, some historic, has been damaged or destroyed due to exposure to inclement weather and the normal Alaska freeze and thaw cycles. 
What I find equally outrageous is the fact that no one from the National Park Service has, until most recently, said `I am sorry'. 
To be fair, during the course of the last 2 years the NPS has been working with the university in an attempt to allow the university to continue its educational program. Unfortunately, the site in its reconformed condition lacks the historic integrity and lure that it once possessed. 
The university has located another historic mine site outside of the national park boundaries that can meet the needs and requirements of the university, its curriculum, and its students. 
Mr. President, my amendment does not attempt to rectify all the wrong that has been done. If we were to pass legislation, or use the court system, to right the wrong that has been accomplished, the cost would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Some of the historic mining equipment loss due to the explosion and subsequent neglect is cost-prohibitive to replace. 
My amendment would direct the Secretary: subject to an appraisal--and I emphasize `appraisal'--to provide up to $500,000.00 to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, School of Mineral Engineering; and, remove certain salvageable historic mining equipment to a location that will be convenient for the university to pick it up and move it to a mine site outside of the park boundary. 
One would question, `Well, what is the justification for this action?' There is none. The Federal Government blew up private property, and the Federal Government should be held responsible and make restitution. 
My amendment would require the U.S. Army: to provide two six by six vehicles to the School of Mineral Engineering; and, to construct a bridge across the Bull River at the Golden Mine site to allow unimpeded ingress and egress for the activities conducted by the School. 
My amendment will ensure that all remaining rights and interests in the Stampede Mine site held by the university would be conveyed to the National Park Service, which is the wish of the Park Service. 
Mr. President, passage of this amendment, and its subsequent enactment into law, will ensure us that justice in this matter will have been served and we will be able to put this incident behind us. All accounts will have been satisfied. 
Mr. President, the difficulty in asking the Park Service to meet their obligation as in stating `may' and mandate that they actually perform by stating `shall' is the difference between action and no action. We have encouraged the Park Service. We have asked the Park Service. And now it is time to direct the Park Service to right this wrong because they blew up private property belonging to the University of Alaska School of Mines. This amendment would attempt to rectify that situation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise today to speak about Title V of H.R. 2107--the Interior Appropriations Bill. Title V provides an additional $700 million appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), pursuant to the Balanced Budget Agreement, for priority land acquisitions and exchanges. While I had sought to have more money appropriated to the state-side LWCF matching grant program, I commend Senator Gorton for appropriating this $700 million in a manner consistent with the terms and spirit of the LWCF Act. 
Over 30 years ago, in a remarkable bipartisan effort, Congress and the President created the LWCF. The LWCF provides funds for the purchase of federal land by the land management agencies--the federal-side LWCF program--and creates a unique partnership among Federal, state, and local governments for the acquisition of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities--the state-side LWCF matching grant program. The LWCF is funded primarily from off-shore oil and gas leasing revenues which now exceed $3 billion annually, and has been authorized through the year 2015 at an annual ceiling of $900 million. 
However, LWCF monies must be annually appropriated. And, despite the increase in offshore oil and gas revenues, the LWCF has not fared well in this decade. Expenditures from the LWCF have fluctuated widely over its life but have generally ranged from $200 to $300 million per year. In the 1990s, total appropriations to both the federal and state sides of LWCF steadily declined from a high of $341 million during the Bush Administration to $149 million in FY 1997. 
Most significantly, all of the FY 1997 appropriation was for the exclusive purpose of federal land acquisition. In 1995, Congress and the President agreed to shut-down the state-side LWCF program. For FY 1998, the President requested $165 million for federal land acquisitions and only $1 million for monitoring previously funded state-side projects. The President did not request any funds for new state-side projects. 
After submitting his budget to Congress, the President appears to have seen the value of the LWCF. In the Balanced Budget Agreement, Congress and the President agreed to provide an additional $700 million for priority land acquisitions and exchanges from the LWCF. President Clinton wants all of this additional $700 million spent on Federal land acquisitions. He has not requested that any of this additional LWCF appropriation be used to fund the state-side LWCF matching grant program.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee I have taken a keen interest in the development of this technology. In fact at a committee hearing in July of this year we discussed some of these developing technologies. One thing that is becoming clear when you talk about natural gas conversion to liquids is that there is `more than one way to skin a cat.' 
In other words there seem to be a number of companies around the globe that are developing this technology with their own particular nitch. I would not, at this time try to predict which particular process is going to 
emerge as the best, nor would I attempt to predict when this technology will be used on a commercial basis. By some industry accounts this technology is here now. By others it is years off.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think there has been a little misunderstanding on the concept of road purchaser credits and the allegation that somehow this is corporate welfare. Logic will dictate that if we don't have purchaser credits for the construction of roads, those who are going to log in the forests, the Federal forests of this country, are simply going to bid less for the timber because they have to offset the costs of getting the timber out. They basically have to build the roads themselves. 
When the Government in this case builds the roads, as it has through the purchaser credit program, the Government has been benefiting by getting higher bids for its timber. Take this away and the Government will simply get less. That is the reality. That is the economics. It is not a matter of corporate welfare. It's a matter that the Federal Government owns the forest and has traditionally dictated the terms and conditions that the roads will be built on, so they are built to their standards. And the benefit of those roads to the States, for recreational purposes, is obvious. 
I rise to speak against the amendment of the junior Senator from Nevada. Not only does the amendment eliminate the purchaser road credit program, but it transfers $10 million out of road construction. I must strongly oppose the provisions. I think the amendment is bad policy. It would have a catastrophic impact on the management of the national forests. I urge my colleagues to defeat it. 
The Forest Service in my State has finally completed a land management plan for the Tongass. It took 10 years and $13 million to do it. I am, frankly, less than enthusiastic about the plan, and most of my colleagues are aware of my distress. 
It reduces timber sales by half. The two largest manufacturing employers in the pulp business in my State have closed their doors in the last 2 years. They have gone out of business. We have closed their doors. We have lost thousands of jobs in the last 2 years, and these have had a dramatic effect on our small communities in the southeast. Nevertheless, I have decided to set my lack of enthusiasm aside and focus my oversight responsibilities on implementation. 
At the September 10 hearing, I asked the Forest Service if it could achieve even the severely reduced allowable timber sale quantity in the Tongass if the Bryan plan were adopted. The answer was: 
If we don't have the money to support the roads program, we will not be able to deliver the economic sale program. 
They further stated that the Tongass depends heavily on the construction of new roads to deliver timber to the communities in southeastern Alaska. One might say, `Why don't you go to the private sector?' We don't have private timber. The Federal Government and the Forest Service own southeastern Alaska. There are cities and people there: Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, Skagway, on and on and on. 
The theory was, through multiple use, those interests would be protected with a balanced timber industry. Therefore, according to the Forest Service, the Bryan amendment would render null and void the goals of the Tongass plan. 
It is kind of interesting, in a letter sent to the Senate only one day before the testimony, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman supported the Bryan amendment because roads pose the `greatest environmental problems on the forests.' You can't have it two ways. The roads provide recreation in the forest, they provide environmental benefits by providing access to stop fires, and I could go on and on and on. It is fairly inconsistent with the administration support for implementation of the Forest Service's final Tongass land management plan, but I have grown accustomed to the flip-flops of the administration on these issues. But Secretary Glickman isn't holding a position long enough to make it warm. 
Finally, the Bryan amendment is nothing more than an attempt to eliminate sales on the national forests. At least we have seen some of the groups like the Sierra Club come out in opposition to any harvesting of the national forest. That is basically what this administration is attempting to do, and this is how they are attempting to do it. 
The amendment isn't about subsidies, the amendment isn't about saving money, the amendment does nothing more than carry out the agenda of the extremists. 
I will conclude by pointing to this chart, Mr. President, which simply shows where the money has gone and the decline in road miles. In 1985, we had 8,000; in 1998, 2,652. It shows reconstruction taking up the major portions. We maintain the roads that we have previously built. There is very little for new construction, roughly 18 percent. 
So there is the picture, Mr. President. It says it better than I could relative to what is happening with this program with the necessity of maintaining it and maintaining the forest products industry as we know it today and the appropriate role of the national forest in providing a renewable resource in the timber that grows so profusely, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the floor managers. I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to bring an important element of the Alaskan national park experience to a wider range of visitors than has previously been the case. 
Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, west of Juneau, can be reached only by boat or plane. Park headquarters at Bartlett Cove is 65 miles from Juneau. It is an additional 40 miles from Bartlett Cove to the park's signature tidewater glaciers. 
Glacier Bay proper is highly regulated by the National Park Service. Currently, only two cruise ships are allowed to proceed, from the outside, into Glacier Bay per day. 
This amendment is not about cruise ships, nor will it adversely impact the forty miles from Bartlett Cove to the tidewater glaciers. In fact, this amendment has nothing to do with going into the bay beyond Bartlett Cove at the entrance to the Park. 
Bartlett Cove, within Glacier Bay National Park, contains the Glacier Bay Lodge and Visitor Center, campground, Ranger Station, employee housing, maintenance facilities, etc. In short, it is the only developed area within the 3.3 million acre park. 
The Cove also includes the docking facilities for NPS craft and the daily concession-operated tour boat. Overnight facilities are extremely limited, so day-use concession trips are one of the only ways, short of taking a cruise ship from Vancouver, to visit the park. 
According to a recent `Consumer Report's' article, Glacier Bay is the highest rated park in America. The article does, unfortunately, mention the words `if you can get to it'. 
Currently, daily or overnight guests who leave Juneau by ferry for Glacier Bay National Park must disembark at the Gustavus docking facility and then get into a bus and drive for 45 minutes to an hour, to get to the NPS unpaved portion of the road which then leads to the docking facility so that you can again board a tour boat to go out and see the tidewater glaciers. 
On the way back to Juneau from the glaciers, visitors travel by tour boat, then by the bus back through Gustavus, and finally by boat, back to Juneau. 
Mr. President, this amendment is about: Convenient visitor access, access for the handicapped, access for the elderly; and, safety. 
Somewhere along the line, in its effort to control the waters of Glacier Bay, the Bureaucracy forgot the concept that we are here to serve the all of the public * * * all of the people who would like to be National Park visitors * * * including the elderly, including those with handicaps and those whose age or physical condition necessitate easier forms of access to their national park. 
It may be a surprise to some, but, some park visitors cannot leap tall facilities in a single bound. Some visitors, because of a disabling condition cannot get from the deck of a boat to a deteriorating dock facility 18 feet overhead. 
Some visitors, even the most able among us, cannot be expected to jump from a boat on to an unprotected dock in high and windy seas just off of Icy Passage. 
Unfortunately, in Alaska, and specifically Glacier Bay National Park, we have forgotten about the park visitor's convenience and safety. The dock facility at Gustavus is inconvenient, it is less than handicapped accessible, it can certainly be considered unsafe in certain wind and sea conditions. 
This amendment will only allow the Auk Nu Marine--Glacier Bay Ferry to deliver park visitors, safely, to the protected harbor at Bartlett Cove within the boundaries of Glacier Bay National Park so that they can conveniently board the tour boat, or go to the lodge * * * period. The amendment does nothing else. 
This amendment does not preclude the Superintendent from imposing speed limits and/or taking any other such actions to protect the wildlife and the other natural resources or waters of Glacier Bay National Park. 
The amendment is not an attempt to subvert the current permit system, it is not as complicated as how do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes. The amendment is simple and straight forward. 
This amendment only involves safe and user-friendly access to the developed park facilities. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the managers of the bill have accepted an amendment I have offered concerning the organization and funding for the Alaska Region of the U.S. Forest Service. I appreciate the consideration of the managers on this matter. 
As many of my colleagues know, the Forest Service has recently completed the Tongass land management plan after a 10-year and $13 million effort. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has conducted an extended oversight process on the development of this plan and on the prospects for successful implementation upon completion. Hearings held in July, August, and this month have raised significant questions about whether the Forest Service is organized, staffed, and funded to assure full implementation of the Tongass land management plan. 
As a consequence of concerns raised during the early hearings in this series, the subcommittee chairman agreed to include language in the committee bill directing a reorganization of the Alaska Region. In subsequent hearings, we have collected additional information that suggests that, rather than moving to immediately reorganize the Alaska Region, it might be better to provide the Agency some direction on: First, the allocation of funds within the Alaska Region; and second, the development of a transition plan for implementation of the Tongass land management plan. 
I believe that through the information collection in the oversight process conducted by the Commission on Energy and Natural Resources we have developed a more perfected proposal than the one included in the committee bill. Therefore, I am offering, as an amendment to the committee bill, new language which directs that: 
Funds appropriated by this Act for Region 10 of the Forest Service to implement the Revised TLMP shall be spent and obligated at the Forest Supervisor and Ranger District levels. No funds appropriated under this or any other Act for the purpose of operations conducted at the Region 10 Headquarters, including funding of centralized field costs or funding of persons employed at the Regional Office, shall be obligated or expanded in excess of $17.5 million from the total funds appropriated for Region 10. 
The managers have also agreed to the following explanatory language in their statement explaining changes made to the committee bill: 
The Tongass Land Management Plan reduces the Allowable Sale Quantity of the Alaska region. It is presumed that the Forest Service will tailor its workforce and organization appropriately. The Committee notes that expenditures on Regional Office operations and centralized field costs at the Region Headquarters has risen to 30 percent from 18 percent of annual appropriated funds since 1993. The Committee recognizes that the reduced timber volume offered under this plan will create economic hardships for local communities and that imbalanced distribution of remaining federal jobs and spending in the region may compound those hardships. Accordingly, the Committee expects the Regional Forester to conduct a regional work load study and to develop a workforce plan that ensures high levels of customer service throughout the region, preserves the Regional Headquarters in Alaska, evaluates the need to consolidate and/or relocated offices, including relocating the Regional Office to Ketchikan, and provides for implementation by January 1, 2000. Further, the Committee expects the workforce plan to reflect the full participation of affected Southeast Alaska communities, and to include a community by community assessment of economic impacts and the rationale used by the Regional Forester to distribute federal jobs under the workforce plan. The Committee expects that the workforce plan will emphasize retention of personnel experience in Southeast Alaska's multiple use mission, will make maximum use of local hiring authority, and will be submitted to committees of jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate by March 1, 1998 for review and further guidance, if warranted. Any expenditures at the Regional Office in excess of $17.5 million from the funds provided to the Region shall be preceded by a 60-day notification of the Appropriations Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
I believe that this language will provide direction to the Forest Service to allocate funds in a fashion that will come closer to assuring full implementation of the Tongass land management plan. 
This approach will materially improve Forest Service operations in Alaska. During our oversight process, we discovered that over the last 6 years the Agency has increased the amount of funds consumed in the Regional Office from an average of 18 percent of annual Regional appropriations to something closer to 30 percent. This has diminished the Agency's field capability. Now, with the TLMP complete it should be the Forest Service's intention to focus more of the funding and effort at the field level. 
Should the conferees be agreeable to adopting the language that we are including in the Senate bill, I would hope that conference report language could be included which directs the Forest Service to tailor its work force and organization appropriately. 
I would hope that the conferees note that expenditures on regional office operations and centralized field costs at the regional headquarters have risen to 30 percent from 18 percent of annual appropriated funds since 1993. 
I trust that everyone recognizes that the reduced timber volume offered under the new TLMP plan will create economic hardships for local communities and that imbalanced distribution of remaining Federal jobs and spending in the region may compound those hardships. Accordingly, I would hope that the conference report would direct the regional Forester to conduct a regional work load study and to develop a work force plan that ensures high levels of customer service throughout the region, preserves the regional headquarters in Alaska, evaluates the need to consolidate and/or relocate offices, including relocating the regional office to Ketchikan, and provides for implementation by January 1, 2000. 
Further, the workforce plan should reflect the full participation of affected southeast Alaska communities, and include a community-by-community assessment of economic impacts and the rationale used by the regional forester to distribute Federal jobs under the work force plan. I hope that any work force plan will emphasize retention of personnel experienced in southeast Alaska's multiple use mission, will make maximum use of local hiring authority, and will be submitted to committees of jurisdiction in both the House and Senate by March 1, 1998, for review and further guidance, if warranted. 
Under my amendment, any expenditures at the regional office in excess of $17.5 million from the funds provided to the region would have to be preceded by a 60-day notification of the Appropriations Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives. I believe this language properly reflects the results of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources oversight efforts.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering would amend the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to permit the Virgin Islands to issue parity bonds rather than priority bonds as now required under the organic legislation. The amendment would also permit the Virgin Islands to issue short-term revenue bonds in anticipation of the receipt of taxes and other revenues. These are authorities generally available to the States. The Governor requested this authority. The Delegate supported the legislation. The administration testified in support of the provisions and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources unanimously adopted the provisions as part of S. 210, which has passed the Senate. Inclusion of this language on this measure may facilitate providing the Government of the Virgin Islands with this authority and I thank the managers of this legislation for their cooperation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Abraham and Senator Kennedy's efforts to amend and reauthorize the Visa Waiver Pilot Program [VWPP]. The Visa Waiver Pilot Program has been highly successful program, freeing up embassy staff, promoting tourism and trade, and fostering closer ties between our country and her allies. Chairman Abraham has made a number of important changes to the VWPP which I believe will make this program even more successful. The changes include tightening controls so that there will not be abuse of the program, and adjusting the admission criteria to include deserving countries. 
As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong advocate of including South Korea in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. I believe no other country, not currently included in the pilot program, represents as close an ally as South Korea. As our fifth largest export market, home to 37,000 of our troops, and with an economy larger than all but 5 of the current visa waiver countries, this democratic country deserves the right to participate in this program. With a 1996 unemployment rate of 2 percent, lower than all but one of the VWPP countries, the burgeoning middle class in South Korea should be able to travel to the United States without the cumbersome restraints associated with citizens traveling from high-risk countries. 
The Abraham legislation is a positive step, but it is unclear if South Korea will be eligible for the VWPP in the short term because of the bill's continued reliance on refusal rates as the defining criteria for admission. However, under this legislation Korea stands a much better chance of becoming eligible than under current law. For this reason and the fact that Senator Abraham and Senator Kennedy have strengthened the safeguards in the VWPP, I am supporting this legislation. 
This bill expands along the concept of promoting tourism and trade and fostering closer ties between our country and our allies by increasing the refusal rates needed to become eligible for inclusion into the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. The bill also addresses many of the concerns raised by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Justice Department by including additional safeguards to ensure that the program is not abused and becomes a vehicle for illegal immigration. 
For instance, in order for a visa waiver country to be redesignated as a visa waiver country, under this legislation the Attorney General must make precise estimates, based upon data collected from an automated entry-exit control system, of the overstay rates of each country. If the Attorney General cannot make an estimate for a country, that country will lose its privilege to travel to the United States visa free. 
In the past, Congress could not adequately monitor the effectiveness of the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. With the requirements for overstay rates, Congress will have analytical evidence that countries are not abusing this privilege and that the Visa Waiver Pilot Program works. Coupled with the additional safeguards, including the requirement for machine readable and highly fraud resistant passports for countries entering the program, the entry-exit control system, already being implemented by INS, will ensure that the VWPP continues to be successful. 
I would like to see further changes. For example, changing the reliance on arbitrary refusal rates decided in many cases by overworked staff in our embassies and consulate offices abroad. Examples where embassy staff have mistakingly denied visas, abound. They include: 
President Kim Young Sam's sister rejected the first time she applied for a tourist visa. 
The daughter of the chairman of the multibillion-dollar company, Hyundai, was rejected for a student visa based on insufficient financial resources. 
The son of the president of IBM Korea was rejected because the consular office did not believe the son would be a good student. He had already been accepted in the school in the United States. 
For South Korea, where our United States Embassy processes more nonimmigrant visa applications than any other country in the world, the use of the refusal rate automatically puts South Korea at a disadvantage. This needs to be corrected. Perhaps with the establishment of a working entry-exit control system required in this bill, the overstay rate coupled with other objective criteria can be used to determine eligibility. 
I would like to commend Senator Abraham and Senator Kennedy for taking such an active role regarding Korea and the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. The Subcommittee on Immigration on the Judiciary Committee has worked closely with my staff to try to accommodate my concerns. I look forward to working closely with both Senators in the future regarding this issue.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, later during the Senate's consideration of this bill, the Interior appropriations bill, there will be, it is my understanding, a rider offered by Senator Bryan of Nevada. That rider would reduce the Forest Service road construction by $10 million, roughly 20 percent. It would eliminate the Forest Service's Purchaser Credit Road Construction Program and modify the formula for receipt-sharing for Forest Service receipts with the counties. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to rise in opposition to the amendment and vote against it. I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. But I wanted to share a brief perspective with my colleagues from the standpoint of the chairman of the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over these matters. 
The Bryan amendment will follow hard on the heels of a similar amendment which was offered in the House by Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Porter in July. That amendment precipitated, as a consequence, a very intense debate in which numerous sets of facts were presented to the House and some statements were made that were not necessarily factual. 
Not surprisingly, the material that was brought into the debate, to a large degree, was in conflict. I have often believed that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but that we ought to try to express our opinions using a commonly held set of facts. Oftentimes in this Chamber rhetoric will prevail over sound science simply because of the inability of the scientists to be heard and the scientists' willingness to stand behind their recommendations with their professional reputations.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. At the end of the House debate, many of the parties in opposition to one another found they simply shared a common goal. So after an extended debate, they came together and found what they could agree upon. They cared a great deal about the skyrocketing costs of the Forest Service program, without exception. They agreed then that collaboration and common understanding was necessary to address the problems in a way that would most likely achieve a mutual beneficial solution and it would be better to do that than simply replay the debate. 
I think that is where we are today, Mr. President. We do not want to replay that debate that unfolded in the House and perhaps would unfold in this body. 
So Congressman Young has taken the lead from the Speaker of the House of Representatives to work with the conflict resolution center at George Mason University to schedule an all-day workshop with interested Congressmen to review these issues and find where some common ground and consensus could be found. And this is the issue in mind, the Forest Service's Purchaser Credit Road Construction Program. 
Congressman Young is inviting me and other interested Senators to the workshop. I will support the House effort and urge Members here to do likewise. 
I do not believe that we can make sound public policy decisions when we disagree on basic facts associated with the issues that come to the Senate floor. This particular issue is ripe for that kind of exposure. So I will leave it to my colleagues later in the debate to come to their own judgment. We voted on this issue time and time again. It prevailed. But I believe the search for consensus, which has been initiated in the House, is something the Senate should adopt. I urge the consideration of my colleagues.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today on behalf of the Huna Totem Corp. and the residents of Hoonah, AK. 
This bill would require the Huna Totem Corp. to convey ownership of approximately 1,999 acres of land needed as a municipal watershed to the U.S. Forest Service. This will ensure that the residents of Hoonah, AK, have a reliable source of clean water. In exchange for these lands the Huna Totem Corp. will be allowed to select other lands readily accessible to Hoonah in order to fulfill their ANCSA entitlement. This legislation also requires the exchange of lands to be of equal value and provides for additional compensation if needed. Lastly, the legislation requires that any potential timber harvested from land acquired by Huna Totem Corp not be available for export. 
Mr. President, the city of Hoonah is located in southeast Alaska on the northeast part of Chichagoff Island. Hoonah has been the home of the Huna people since the last advance of the great ice masses into Glacier Bay, forcing the Huna people to look for new homes. Since the Huna people had traditionally used the Hoonah area each summer as a subsistence harvesting area, it was natural for them to settle in the area now called Hoonah. The community has a population of approximately 918 residents and is located 40 miles from Juneau; Alaska's capital city. 
Within the city of Hoonah is located the Huna Totem Corp., an Alaska Native Corp. formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA]. Huna Totem is the largest Tlingit Indian Village Corp. in southeast Alaska. Under the terms of ANCSA each village corporation had to select lands within the core township or townships in which all or part of the Native village is located. 
In 1975, Huna Totem filed its ANCSA land selections within the 2 mile radius of the city of Hoonah as mandated by ANCSA. Since the community of Hoonah is located along the shoreline at the base of Hoonah Head Mountain, the surrounding lands are steep hillsides, cliffs, or are designated watershed for the municipal water sources. Most of the acres, approximately 1,999, of this land are not conducive to logging or development due to the topography and watershed limitations. 
Therefore in order for the Huna Totem Corp. to receive full economic benefit of the lands promised to them under ANCSA, and for the city of Hoonah to protect its watershed, alternative lands must be sought for Huna Totem to seek revenue from. 
The legislation I am offering today would achieve these goals. By authorizing a land exchange between the Huna Totem Corp. and the U.S. Forest Service the residents of Hoonah will be assured a safe supply of drinking water. Additionally, Huna Totem Corp. will be able to fully recognize the benefits promised under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Kake Tribal Land Exchange Act. This legislation would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which authorized the transfer of 23,040 acres of land from the U.S. Government to Kake Tribal Corp. The land was transferred to Kake to recognize an immediate need for a fair and just settlement. 
Unfortunately, Kake has not received the full beneficial use of its 23,040 acres because the city's watershed--over 2,400 acres--rest within Kake Tribal's lands. In order to protect the city's watershed and still receive beneficial use of their 23,040 acres we are proposing land exchange. This will assist the people of Kake, AK, as they move toward a safer, cleaner, and healthier future. 
Under this proposal, Kake Tribal would exchange the watershed for other acres in southeast Alaska--thereby allowing Kake to receive its full entitlement under ANCSA. This legislation is of great importance to the residents of the community of Kake, AK. 
This legislation will ensure protection of the Gunnuk Creek watershed which is the main water supply for the city of Kake as well as protect critical habitat for the Gunnuk Creek hatchery. 
The legislation has received wide support in Alaska from diverse groups such as: the city of Kake, AK, the organized village of Kake, the Kake nonprofit fishery, the Alaska Federation of Natives, and Sealaska Corp. Additionally, the Governor of Alaska has written to me in support of this exchange. 
This legislation is similar to legislation I introduced last year and held hearings on in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. During these hearings the Forest Service objected to the bill for four reasons, all of which have been addressed in the legislation I now introduce. 
The first issue was the potential selection of Berners Bay/Slate Lake Parcel. Kake has made it clear as evident in the maps that they have no intention of selecting that area. Second, was the potential that Kake would select established log transfer facilities. Again it is clear from the maps that these areas will not be selected. Third, was regarding subsurface issues with Sealaska which are not addressed in this current version of the bill. And finally, the USFS objected to this exchange because they did not want to manage the watershed. Since the hearing the city of Kake has said they want to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Forest Service to manage the watershed themselves. 
Additionally, Mr. President there is a provision in this bill that assures Kake Tribal will receive appropriate compensation for the watershed lands to be exchanged. This is important because this legislation would require Kake Tribal to process any timber derived from the newly acquired lands in State, potentially reducing the value of lands received. Therefore, in order to provide for a fair compensation, under the terms of this legislation Kake Tribal could be eligible for additional compensation should the value of the newly acquired lands be deemed less than their original lands. Likewise, the United States could also benefit from this provision should a determination be made that the lands they are receiving are less valuable then those they are conveying. 
I introduce this legislation with the confidence that it is the best interest of not only the citizens of Kake but with the knowledge that it is in the best interest of all Alaskans and Americans to protect drinking water for our communities. Lastly, this legislation will help fulfill out commitment to the Natives of Alaska that they will be treated fairly and justly under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of this resolution honoring the memory of a woman who may be the 20th century world's greatest role model and humanitarian, Mother Teresa. 
Words cannot express the contribution she has made to humankind. By her selfless acts over the past five decades administering to the poorest of the poor, she has set an example for how we all should try to live. The world would be a far better place if all people followed the light of her shining example. 
I have heard the word `Saint' used in the same breath as the name Mother Teresa. It is hard to imagine any other person who has lived in this century to whom that appellation would better apply. Hers was truly a life of selflessness, where the totality of her identity comes through service to God. 
I have, in my life, met many people who have been major actors on the world stage--Presidents, Prime Ministers and other leading officials at home and abroad. This year, I had the opportunity to meet and briefly talk with this very frail nun in our Capitol. This was an honor that I will cherish throughout my life. 
It is not often that I have had the chance to be with someone whose very presence is so intensely humbling. That was the case with Mother Teresa. She truly was representative of the best in the human spirit and will be remembered for centuries to come. 
She will be sorely missed.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the passage of this legislation we are embarking on a new road. We will establish a new park area operated by the private sector rather than the traditional park operated by park service personnel that we are accustomed to visiting. 
Upon visiting the Oklahoma City National Memorial you will still observe the traditional park ranger in his flat hat, but behind the scenes things will be a little different. 
The legislation establishes a trust composed of civic leaders who will manage the park in accordance with Park Service standards, rules and regulations. I anticipate these leaders will maintain and operate the facilities at this memorial at the highest standard ever achieved by any NPS unit. 
I do not believe we will ever have to revisit this issue in the appropriations process. I expect the leaders of the trust will maintain their facilities with proper preventative maintenance programs so America's investment will be more than properly protected without the deferred maintenance programs which currently plague the NPS and the Congress. 
I expect that the programs and operations at the memorial will be above and beyond anything we have ever experienced in a park unit to date. 
Is this road risky ? The answer is yes. We are now facing $8.6 billion in unfunded NPS programs. The private sector has the answers, and it may teach us a few lessons on how to avoid the situation that we are currently facing in the National Park Service. 
The passage of this legislation will begin to show us how to achieve a National Park Service unit that will be a model for the future. 
In the absence of a report, that will follow shortly, I have included information in my statement for the benefit of my colleagues that explains the background and the provisions of the legislation. 
BACKGROUND 
One hundred and sixty-eight Americans lost their lives and many more were injured on April 19, 1995, when a bomb was detonated at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK. This tragedy constitutes the worst terrorist incident in American history. 
This legislation would create a memorial at the site of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on 5th Street, between Robinson and Harvey Streets, and would also include the sites of the Water Resources Building and the Journal Record Building. 
Concepts for the Memorial were solicited through a design competition. We received 624 design submissions from 50 States and 23 foreign countries. The design selected was created by Hans-Ekkehard Butzer, Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg, a German-based design team. The design includes 168 chairs in the Murrah Building footprint, a water element designed to reflect a spirit of change, a survivor tree, envisioned to reflect hope, and `gates of time' on each end of Fifth Street that focus the visitor's attention on memorial inscriptions and the other elements of the Memorial. Torrey Butzer of the German team states, `We watched Oklahomans and the world respond to this tragedy from afar. This is our way of giving something to honor the Victims, survivors and the heros. This design will tell the story of all of us changed forever.' 
The Memorial established by this Act would serve not only as a monument to those who died and were injured in the bombing on April 19, but as a symbol of the courage and goodwill shown by local citizens and Americans across the country following the incident. The Oklahoma City National Memorial will be designated a unit of the National Park Service. It will be placed under the charge of a wholly-owned government corporation, to be known as the Oklahoma City National Trust (Trust). The Trust will be governed by a nine-member Board of Directors (Board) which will have the authority to appoint an executive director and other key staff. Interim staff are authorized for 2 years to assist in the development of the Memorial. Permanent National Park service staff and the ability to retain staff from other Federal agencies are also provided by this measure on a reimbursable basis. 
The act authorizes $5 million of Federal funds for construction and maintenance, but stipulates that any Federal expenditures must be matched by non-Federal funds, dollar for dollar. It is expected that matching funding sources will include the Oklahoma State legislature and private donations.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there are many elements of the tax package that I strongly support including the children's tax credit, the reduction in capital gains, and the first step in estate tax relief. For those reasons, I will vote for the tax package. 
However, I want to take a moment to discuss with my colleagues what I believe is a fundamental inequity in the structure of the package. What I am referring to is the new air passenger tax formula. The conferees rejected the Senate's approach, which would have maintained the current flat 10-percent tax and instead adopted a dual tax structure that imposes both a flat tax and per-segment, per-passenger tax. 
This new formula fundamentally discriminates against low-fare carriers, especially those who fly smaller aircraft that make multiple intermediate stops. The new formula will have an especially detrimental effect on flights to and from the lower 48 from Alaska and Hawaii. 
For several years, Congress has recognized the unique travel circumstances faced by citizens of these two noncontiguous States. In reality, the only way to get to Alaska and Hawaii is by air. And once you arrive in Alaska or Hawaii, air travel is often the only suitable way to get around. 
Unfortunately, the new passenger tax formula fails to recognize our States' strong reliance on the airplane. Passengers in small communities like Ketchikan could see their air tax bill jump by 30 to 40 percent when the new formula is fully phased in. That is simply unfair to Alaskans, who already must endure close to the highest cost of living of any State. 
Moreover, the new structure has a hidden timebomb that would explode if we see a spike in inflation. Not only is the head tax indexed for inflation, but the special $6 departure fee that is only imposed on flights to and from Alaska and Hawaii is also indexed. What this means is that every year, flights to Alaska and Hawaii are guaranteed to see a double tax hike, whereas flights within the lower 48 will only see a tax rise on the per-passenger fee. 
I think that is fundamentally unfair and it is my intention to introduce legislation that will reinstate the current air tax structure for flights to Alaska and Hawaii.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a significant achievement for the literary arts in Alaska and for the University of Alaska system, in general, and the University of Alaska Anchorage, in specific. 
Last month, on June 8, 1997, the spring and summer 1997 edition of the Alaska Quarterly Review was recognized in the Washington Post book review section, Book World, as `one of the nation's best literary magazines.' That is high praise indeed coming from the Eastern press, and justified, if not long overdue recognition, of the literary prowess of the publication. 
In the 15 years since its inception at the Anchorage campus of the University of Alaska in 1982, the Alaska Quarterly Review (AQR) has served as an instrument to give voice to Alaska writers and poets, while also publishing the best of material from non-Alaskan authors. While the AQR is firmly rooted in Alaska, it maintains a national perspective--bridging the distance between the literary centers and Alaska, while also sharing an Alaskan perspective. This balanced presentation of views has earned AQR local, regional and national/international recognition over the years. It is nice that recognition now also has come from a publication in the Nation's Capital. 
`Congratulations for publishing one of the best among the literary magazines,' said Carl Houck Smith, vice president and editor of W.W. Norton, in comments made in May 1994. 
`AQR is highly recommended and deserves applause,' said Bill Katz in the Library Journal. 
`It is an impressive publication, comprising as diverse and rewarding an aggregation of work as a reader is likely to find in any literary journal,' added Patrick Parks in the Literary Magazine Review. 
`The Magazine has a wonderful sense of place about it, and it conveys Alaska without being parochial. It's not pushing a particular agenda. There's no coterie of writers made up of the editor's friends. The work is original and fresh,' says contributing editor Stuart Dybek in explaining the publication's success. 
The review, for example, won the 1996 Alaska Governor's Award for the Arts--Alaska's highest award in the arts. Recent works in the review have been selected for or won: 
 1997 Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards (Anchor Books/Doubleday). 
 1996 Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards (Anchor Books/Doubleday). 
 1996 Best American Poetry (Scribner) 
 1995 Best American Essays (Houghton Mifflin) 
 1995 Andres Berger Award (Northwest Writers Inc.) 
 The Pushcart Prize (1995-96 Pushcart Prize XX and 1996-97 Pushcart Prize XXI: The Best of the Small Presses). 
 UAA's 1995 Chancellor's Group Award for Excellence in research and creative activity. 
 1994 Special Recognition Award from the Alaska Center for the Book. 
 And numerous mentions in the Chronicle of Higher Education, the Small Press Review, Best American Essays, Novel and Short Story Writers Market, and in a host of other publications. 
I rise today to honor the publication, not just because of its many awards, but because many Alaskans do not understand or appreciate the breadth and scope of the publication and how important it has become as a gateway for Alaskan authors to winning recognition from a wider literary audience. And also how it has helped to improve the literary quality of the works of Alaskan writers. I hope by these words, Alaskans will recognize how fortunate the 49th State is to have such a quality publication being edited and published from Anchorage. 
I want to thank the University of Alaska Board of Regents and the leadership of the University of Alaska Anchorage for supporting the publication. Alaska's university system has been facing difficult economic times because of falling Alaska State revenues. It has taken a tremendous commitment to academic excellence to continue the funding necessary to permit the review to be a quality publication and artistic success. The University deserves great credit for its efforts at promoting the publications in these difficult financial times. It is because of the need for more revenues for the University to permit it to reach the highest level of greatness possible that I have introduced legislation to help the University finally gain the land-grant entitlement it should have received at its founding. I hope that this Congress will look favorably on my bill, S. 660. The University of Alaska Land grant bill, to help the University gain the economic means to support such important endeavors. But more on that in the future, following committee review of the legislation, likely this fall. 
I also want to thank and publicly recognize the work of Ronald Spatz, the executive editor and founding editor of the review for all of his efforts on its behalf. Mr. Spatz, currently professor and chair of the University of Alaska Anchorage's Department of Creative Writing and Literary Arts and director of UAA's honors program, has been a member of the faculty since 1980. A professor, who has been recognized with commendations for `Outstanding Leadership' by the University's Board of Regents and the President of the statewide system, Mr. Spatz is the former chair of the University of Alaska Statewide Assembly, president of the UAA Assembly and the vice president of the Faculty Senate. He is the winner of two university-wide teaching awards: The Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Teaching and the Distinguished Teacher of the Year Award presented by the UAA Alumni Association. 
Mr. Spatz, a film maker and writer, besides editor, has produced, directed, photographed and edited a range of short subject and expressionist documentary films for children and adults. Several of the films are in national distribution; his film, `For the Love of Ben,' was broadcast nationally on public television and his stories and articles have appeared in a host of publications. He has received a total of more than 35 individual and project grants for his works. 
For the future, due to a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, which has provided three major awards (grants) to the publication, AQR this fall will be issuing a special anthology. `Intimate Voice, Ordinary Lives: Stories of Fact and Fiction.' 
Mr. President, Alaska, in fact all of America, is far richer artistically because of the review's presence over the past 15 years. It truly is a window for Americans to view society in Alaska at the close of the 20th century, and a worthy stage for the serious works of all writers. I commend it and its contributors for its many achievements, and I know all members of the U.S. Senate join me in wishing it continued literary success.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today our negotiators are gathering in Bonn, Germany to continue negotiations toward a new climate treaty, so it is appropriate to address the Senate on this issue. 
My comments today will focus on the issue of science, scientific certainty, and scientific honesty. 
During the Senate's debate on Friday there were some general and specific comments made about climate science that were simply wrong, and I'd like to begin by addressing some of the general misunderstandings that may exist. 
First, some of our colleagues seem to have it in their minds that there is scientific certainty and consensus over the issue of whether or not human activities are causing global warming. This is simply not true. 
While it is true that Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth said that `the science is settled,' it is clear that there is not a broad scientific consensus that human activities are causing global warming. 
Don't take my own word for it: 
The prestigious journal Science, in its issue of May 16th, says that climate experts are a long way from proclaiming that human activities are heating up the earth. 
Even Benjamin Santer, lead author of chapter 8 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] report admits as much. 
Here is what Dr. Santer says: 
We say quite clearly that few scientists would say the attribution issue was a done deal. 
Indeed, the search for the `human fingerprint' is far from over with many scientists saying that a clear resolution is at least a decade away. 
Even the Chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Bert Bolin, says that the science is not settled. When told that Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth had said the science was settled, Dr. Bolin replied: `I've spoken to [Tim Wirth], I know he doesn't mean it.' 
Mr. President, the science is not settled. We continue to spend over $2 billion on the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program for the simple reason that the science is not settled. 
We know human activities result in carbon emissions. We also know that land-based records indicate that some warming has occurred. We do not know that one has caused the other. 
Let me now turn to some specific statements that were made during the debate last Friday that simply don't agree with the latest scientific literature: 
My good friend, Senator Kerry, said (on page S8118 of the Congressional Record) that the `global average temperature has changed by less than a degree Celsius up or down for 10,000 years--[and that] the projected warming is expected to exceed any climate change that has occurred during the history of civilization.' 
Unfortunately, the facts simply don't match up with Senator Kerry's statement. According to data from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, temperatures were up to 3C higher than present values some 2500-3000 years ago. (Reference: L. Keigwin, Science, volume 274, p. 1504-1508, 1996.) 
In addition, independent studies using a different set of data indicate abrupt worldwide changes in temperature about 8000 years ago. (Reference: Stager and Mayewski, Science, volume 276, p. 1834, 1997.) 
Another statement made by Senator Kerry (on page S8137 of the Congressional Record) claims that `. . . we are living in the midst of the most significant increase that we have seen in 130 years, and the evidence of the prognosis of our best scientists is that it is going to continue at a rate that is greater than anything we have known since humankind, since civilization has existed, civilization within the last 8,000 to 10,000 years on this planet.' 
Well, the facts are somewhat different. The most significant temperature increase in the last 130 years occurred between 1900 and 1940, and is generally believed to be a natural warming, a recovery from the Little Ice Age. 
In pointing these facts out, it is not my contention that Senator Kerry is trying to mislead anyone. He is merely repeating some of the information that has been provided to him by his staff or others, and I know he believes them to be correct. 
But they are not correct. 
I believe this makes my point that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about this issue, in addition to the lack of scientific certainty I alluded to earlier. 
I'd like to briefly turn my attention to a few statements made by others outside the Senate about the science of Climate Change. 
When I opened the newspaper on Saturday I was amused to see the level of `spin control' that some were attempting with respect to the Senate's actions of Friday. 
Indeed, on page A11 of Saturday's Washington Post, in an article by Helen Dewar, I read that Phillip Clapp, the President of the Environmental Information Center, said the Byrd resolution `endorses the science on global warming . . .' 
Well, I hope the public and the press will follow the wise counsel of Senator Byrd and allow the resolution to speak for itself. 
Indeed, the resolution does not say anything about endorsing the science of global warming. 
If it had, it would not have passed the Senate at all . . . much less than by a vote of 95-0. 
Special interest groups will, I suppose, do their best to advance their special interests. But we should demand a certain level of integrity and scientific honesty in our public debate of this issue. 
This brings me to the final issue that I wish to address today--the issue of scientific honesty and integrity. 
As pointed out above, there is a great deal of scientific uncertainty about climate change. Well respected, highly qualified scientific experts disagree over this issue. 
The hearings held before the Energy Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee have all featured solid, respected scientists--some of whom question the link between human activities and a warming planet. 
Before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee which I chair, Dr. Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for astrophysics questioned the link between human activities and climate change. 
Before the Environment and Public Works Committee, Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pointed out problems with the General Circulation Models that are the basis for the predictions of warming. 
My Committee also heard from Dr. V. Ram Ramanathan of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, about the role of water vapor as a confounding factor in these models. 
In the Environment and Public Works Committee, Dr. John R. Christy of the Earth System Science Laboratory at the University of Alabama in Huntsville discussed the satellite temperature records that conflict with ground-based data. 
Before the Foreign Relations Committee, Dr. Patrick Michaels, professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, directly challenged the links between human activities and observed warming. 
These are all respected scientists. They are not crackpots, nay-sayers, or as some press accounts have branded them, a `small and noisy band of skeptics.' 
Instead, they are scientists, doing what scientists do. Consistent with the scientific method, they are challenging the findings of other scientists, in an open, intellectually honest manner, using all the data and analysis that they can bring to bear. 
That is how the system is supposed to work. 
Unfortunately, the proponents of the view that we must take extreme actions now to address climate change have been attacking the credibility and the reputations of some scientists who do not share their view. 
Instead of attacking their science, they attack the scientist. 
They claim that scientists who disagree with the so-called consensus view of climate change are part of some kind of anti-science conspiracy, funded by big oil and big coal to deliberately mislead the American public. 
That sounds silly, doesn't it? 
Yet, on the Diane Rehm radio program which aired locally on WAMU-FM on July 21, a prominent guest made some pretty remarkable assertions. Let me quote from the transcript of this radio interview:  
. . . it's an unhappy fact that the oil companies and the coal companies in the United States have joined in a conspiracy to hire pseudo scientists to deny the facts . . . the energy companies need to be called to account because what they are doing is un-American in the most basic sense. They are compromising our future by misrepresenting the facts by suborning scientists onto their payrolls and attempting to mislead the American people. 
A `conspiracy,' Mr. President. 
`Pseudo scientists.' 
`A deliberate attempt to mislead the American people.' 
`Un-American.' 
These are serious charges. 
Who was the guest who was making these charges of a conspiracy designed to deliberately mislead the American people? 
Was this guest calling Dr. Lindzen a pseudo scientist? Or Dr. Baliunas? Or any of the others I mentioned? 
Are they part of this conspiracy? 
Sadly, a member of the President's Cabinet--the Secretary of the Interior--was responsible for these remarks. 
Here is a political appointee who appears to be making judgments about the scientific integrity of others. 
Those were unfortunate remarks, Mr. President. And they are the sort of remarks I hope that the Senate will avoid as we continue the debate on climate change. 
Let us keep to the high road. 
Let us appreciate the fact that scientists, and indeed, all Americans, are free to disagree and to challenge the views of others in honest, public debate. 
There will be disagreements. Just as I challenged the scientific understanding of Senator Kerry on several issues earlier in my remarks, others will surely challenge my understanding of the science at some point in the debate. 
And in the process, we will all learn. That is the way it should be. 
But there will be some, Mr. President, who will attack the scientist instead of the science. 
There will be some who say that you must agree with me, or you must be part of some conspiracy that is trying to mislead the American people. 
That, to use Secretary Babbitt's words, strikes me as un-American. 
Let's not fear a healthy scientific debate. Instead, let's depend on it.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 1 month ago, Hong Kong reverted to the control of the People's Republic of China, ending over 150 years of colonial rule. This was a historic and unprecedented event in Chinese history. I was honored to serve as the chairman of the official Senate delegation that attended the handover ceremonies along with several of our colleagues from the House of Representatives, led by Congressman Chris Cox.  
I hope that when I return to Hong Kong next year, and the year after, and the year after, I will witness the same optimism that I observed during the transition from British to Chinese rule. The people of Hong Kong should be congratulated for their determination to keep Hong Kong the pearl of the Orient. 
During our visit, our delegation was fortunate to meet with the new chief executive, C.H. Tung, as well as his Chief Secretary, the highly respected civil servant, Anson Chan. This duo has been referred to as the dream team and the name is well deserved. It is my opinion that if C.H. Tung and Anson Chan work together they will lead Hong Kong to a brighter future. But they will face severe trials. The `one country, two systems' approach of the late Chairman Deng is untested, and I predict that there will be hurdles to its implementation, especially in the area of personal and political autonomy. 
The purpose of the Senate Delegation to Hong Kong was to demonstrate our continued commitment to support the people of Hong Kong and to protect United States interests. And Congress will continue to monitor events in Hong Kong. 
The key events that I think will determine whether this experiment will work are the following: 
Whether the elections C.H. Tung has called for May of 1998 are free and fair and allow broad participation. 
Whether the Court of Final Appeal functions as the final word, or whether the PRC People's Congress uses the fig leaf of `national security' to step in and usurp Hong Kong's legal system. 
How the PRC Government handles Martin Lee, and other democrats. Thus far, democratic protests have continued without intervention. 
What happens to the first paper to publish a Pro-Taiwan or Pro-Tibet editorial. 
Whether Chief Secretary Anson Chan stays in her post after 1998, and whether there is an exodus of other civil servants. 
But I also urge restraint by my colleagues. We should not assume the worst for Hong Kong. Specifically, we should not alter trade laws that assume that Hong Kong cannot enforce her borders and her laws. If Hong Kong cannot live up to her commitments in this regard, then the United States should act, but we should not act prematurely. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to extend my commitment to the people of Hong Kong to support their efforts. I hope on my next trip to Hong Kong I can say that Hong Kong remains the vibrant, successful, energetic engine of Asia.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to speak today about a man whose life has been dedicated to public service--in particular, service to America's veterans: Chris Yoder. 
Many of my colleagues know Chris. He has spent his entire career working for veterans. And now, Chris has decided to leave the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs [VA]. However, his life-long commitment to veterans will continue as he moves to the Commission on Service Members and Veterans' Transition Assistance. 
I have known Chris for many years, and I have come to rely on him for his expertise. 
He served in Vietnam and after he returned home, he began his career with the Veterans' Administration in 1972. He joined the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 1985 when I served as the Committee Chairman. Chris immediately demonstrated a remarkable recall and uncanny knowledge of veterans' issues. In 1991, Chris joined Tony Principi when Tony went to work for the Bush Administration as Deputy Secretary for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In 1993, when I served as Vice Chairman of the Committee, Chris returned. 
Over the years, I have asked Chris to examine a number of veterans' programs and I have always expected Chris to ask tough questions about these programs. We spend billions of dollars on veterans' health care and benefits, and members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee constantly struggle to ensure that the money is spent efficiently and in an equitable manner. 
Is the veterans' health care program based on the most modern medical delivery systems, or are we sticking with an aging infrastructure that is consuming dollars that need to be redirected to meet the real needs of veterans? That's the type of issue that Chris has had to tackle. 
Last Congress, we passed Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform. If you think the tax code is complicated, you should have seen the VA's health care eligibility criteria before our reforms. It confused veterans, it confused Congress, and it even confused VA doctors and administrators. 
Chris took it upon himself to play the leading role in crafting a reform proposal that simplified the criteria without sacrificing the quality and access to care for our Nation's veterans. By far, this was the most important veterans' legislation passed in the 104th Congress, and one of the most difficult and complex issues I have witnessed during my 17-year tenure as a U.S. Senator. 
I do not think anyone can doubt the commitment and dedication Chris has for our veterans, and I know every member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs will miss his dedication and expertise. 
He is a man with the courage to tackle the difficult questions and the knowledge to find the answers. Chris Yoder will be sorely missed on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. As a friend, I wish him the best of the luck.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I stand today to add my strong support for the introduction of this comprehensive package of reforms intended to bring this Nation's mining law into the 21st century. 
There are few issues before the Senate that are more complex and contentious than mining law reform. Make no mistake, it is an issue within which major ideologies compete. The outcome of these debates will define for years to come the role public lands play in the Nation's ability to maintain a viable strategic mining capability. 
Across the Nation--from the White House, and from within this very chamber we have been regaled with stirring speeches on the short comings of the 1872 mining law: the unfairness it imposes on the American people. Unfortunately this rhetoric has served only to inflame passions and polarize the American public on this complex issue. 
It will come as no surprise why, under these circumstances, mining law reform has been such a difficult undertaking within the Congress. There is one additional circumstance which serves to frustrate legitimate efforts to bring mining reform negotiations to a successful culmination. Legitimate reformers within the administration and the Congress have been joined by those who see mining reform as the perfect vehicle for ending mining on public lands. With these forces there is no appeasement. As reform proposals move toward addressing legitimate concerns, the goal line is moved. As you can imagine, this causes a great deal of frustration among those of us engaged in serious reform efforts. 
Be that as it may, the only unforgivable action this Senator could take would be to abandoned the effort. In the great debate before us I would ask you to look carefully at the issues--if you seek reform which brings a fair return to the public treasury, that protects the environment, and preserves the Nation's ability to produce strategic minerals--then you will find a great deal to support in the legislation we lay before you today. 
I also take a great deal of pride in the fact that this legislation does not forget about the Nation's smallest mining operations. It will allow them to stay in business and to continue to compete on an even playing field with the larger, better financed operations. And for those of you who might wonder why small miners are important; you need only remember that the great majority of large mining operations across the country started out as a nothing more than a crazy idea inside the head of a prospector simply too stubborn to give up on their dream. 
On the other hand, if it is your intention to use mining reform as a vehicle to end mining on public lands or punish mining companies for making a profit, then you will find little in my legislation to aid in your cause. 
There is one resounding note of agreement across the Nation relating to mining reform--it is time to bring this piece of historic legislation into the 21st century. 
However, in our zeal to bring about this necessary modernization, we must not forget what we are tinkering with. Bad decisions clouded with emotionally charged rhetoric can have devastating effects on a $5 billion industry. An industry whose products form the muscle and sinew of the Nation's entire industrial output. We are taking into our hands the well-being of 50,000 American miners, their families, and their communities. We will be reaching out and directly affecting the future well-being of thousands who derive their primary source of income manufacturing the goods and services which support this critical industry. We owe it to that industry, those people, their communities, and the entire American public to make good decisions. There is simply too much at stake to let our collective emotions get in the way of good decision making. 
The Nation's first comprehensive mining laws were negotiated under torchlite miner's courts, over copious amounts of whiskey, and down the barrels of cocked six shooters. These laws literally emerged out of the muck and grime of the gold fields of California, the silver fields of Nevada, and countless other mining camps scattered across the American West. The initial law was designed to give every miner the opportunity to compete on an even playing field without fear of having his hard earned gain taken away during the dark of night. The law was also intended to give a young nation a self sufficiency in its mineral needs. The industrial revolution was upon us, and our mills and factories were hungry for the raw mineral feed stocks necessary to keep pace with the growing demand for industrial products. 
And Mr. President I am here to tell you that we were successful. Due in no small part to the mining industry of this Nation and all the hard working miners, the United States moved to the pre-eminent position that enabled us to win two world wars and set a standard of living that is still the envy of the world. 
This package of mining reforms contained in this legislation honors the past, recognizes the present, and sets the stage for a bright future. 
This legislation honors the past by refusing to abandon the basic tenets of the Nation's mining law. A system that allows for the location, development and production of mineral resources off the public lands. Resources necessary to keep this country's mills and factories working at full capacity. 
We recognize the present through the creation of fair reforms which recognize that over one hundred years have passed since the general mining laws went onto the books. During that time many changes have occurred in this country and the mining industry. 
We set the stage for the future by placing instruments within the legislation that directs the reclamation of old abandoned mine sites and preventing abuses in the exercise of the rights authorized within the law. 
Mr. President, we recognize that the time has come to reform the general mining laws. But it must be reform that fixes the things which are wrong without destroying this important industry and the lives and communities dependent on it. 
The legislation we offer today does that but in such a way that corrects the problems with the law without killing the mining industry. 
The legislation advances reforms in 4 general areas; royalty, patents, operations, and reclamation. 
No area within the 1872 mining laws has been so greatly criticized as the failure on the part of that legislation to require royalty to be paid for minerals extracted from public land. 
The legislation that we introduce today corrects this. It requires that 5 percent of the profit made from a mining operation on federal lands be paid to the federal government. 
This legislation seeks a percentage of the profit, not the value of the mineral in place. We do this for very specific reasons. Failure to do so will cause the shutdown of many operations and prevent the opening of new mines. It will cause other operators to cast low ore concentrates onto the spoil pile as they seek out only the very highest grade ores. 
Yes, highly profitable mines do exist and I am sure you are going to hear a lot about them from our opponents. But I can also assure you that there is an equal number that operate on the margin. Mines are like people, no two are alike. Through legislation we seek to create a one-size-fits-all royalty. If that royalty is designed to address highly profitable mines, many marginal mines will go under. That is why we designed our royalty to take a percentage of the profits. If the mine makes money, the public gets a share. This approach recognizes that the public benefits from a strong mining industry beyond the royalty it might collect. A continuous and competitive supply of metals to the Nation's mills and factories, high paying mining jobs, and healthy, viable communities also contribute to the common good. 
I fail to see how the public good is served through the creation of a royalty system so intrusive that it must be paid for through the loss of jobs, the health of local communities, and the abandonment of lower grade mineral resources. For those of you who would dismiss these predictions need only look north of our borders to British Columbia to see living proof of this prediction. In 1974 they put a royalty on minerals before cost of production was factored in. 
Five thousand miners lost their jobs, mining diminished to the point where only one new mine went into operation in 1976. The industry was devastated. The royalty was removed in 1978. Years later the industry still has not completely recovered. 
Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it--let us not forget the experience of our neighbors to the north. 
Patenting or the right to take title to lands containing minerals upon demonstration that the parcel can support a profitable operation is another area targeted for intense criticisms by opponents to existing mining law. 
There is no doubt that there have been serious abuses of this provision of the 1872 mining law. Unscrupulous individuals have located mineral operations for the soul purpose of gaining title and turning the land into a lodge, resort or ski area. These practices are wrong and should be corrected. But it should not be done in a way that punishes the great majority of miners who patent lands for the sole purpose of mining. Punishing everyone to get at the few is absolutely wrong and down right un-American. 
The legislation we introduce today cures the problem without punishing the innocent. We would continue to issue patents to operators who are engaged in legitimate mining operations. However, we also include provisions allowing the Secretary to step in and reclaim lands should it be determined that they are no longer being used for mining. 
This approach protects the legitimate miner while insuring that unscrupulous operators can no longer turn mining operations into other activities. 
Much criticism has been levied in the past at the 1872 mining laws for what has been called the encouragement of speculative activities on mineralized lands. Because no controls were in place, any person could go out and stake lands purely for speculative purposes. This kept legitimate miners from accessing lands for development and burdened the bureaucracy with mining claims that had no real mineral potential. 
The legislation we introduce today addresses this practice. It requires that a $25 filing fee be paid at the time the claim is filed, and makes permanent the $100 per year per claim maintenance fee. These fees will discourage speculative claim staking while allowing miners intent on mining access to lands. 
The 1872 mining law did not address environmental protection. Our revisions weave a tight environmental safety net to protect the federal lands. We include a permit process which requires secretarial approval for all but the most minimal mineral related activities; furthermore, we require that lands disturbed by mining be reclaimed to prevent undue and unnecessary environmental degradation. To correct situations where mine operations are abandoned, this legislation requires all operations be fully bonded to pay for reclamation. We do this in ways that allow individual miners the opportunity to choose the bonding tool that best suits their individual needs while not losing sight of the overall reclamation goal. 
While bonding assures that no further reclamation responsibilities will fall to the public, what about sites which have been abandoned in the past? I won't be breaking any secrets by telling you that discretionary funding for new projects around here is about as scarce as virtue at a lawyers convention. There is simply too much need with not enough dollars to go around. Does this mean that reclamation is not important? Not at all--- there is no question that the reclamation of these abandoned sites needs to occur. The only question is where the dollars are going to come from and what other priority must fall to the side. 
This legislation addresses this issue through the establishment of a mine reclamation fund. This fund is capitalized by the funds collected by this legislation. Filing fees, maintenance fees, and royalty collected all goes into the fund to pay for the reclamation work. This fund dovetails with other reclamation funds and fills the gaps. It is not duplicative. 
The Nation's small miners will find that there are exemptions from the payment of fees for the first 25 claims, royalty relief for yearly profits of less than $50,000, authorizations to use state reclamation bonding pools, and the ability to maintain exclusive long term land use tenure. 
For those who seek meaningful reform to the nation's general mining laws, this legislation does the job. It fixes past abuses without punishing the innocent. It establishes a partnership with miners to share in the profits of mining without putting people out of work. It works with existing environmental legislation to assure that mining operations are carried out with the least possible disturbance. It makes sure that the public does not have to pay for the inappropriate actions of the few while allowing the many to pursue their activities in a ways that do not jeopardize their financial well being. And, it sets up a process to pay for existing mine reclamation needs without taking money away from ongoing federal programs. 
This is good legislation, it fixes existing problems without creating new ones. It establishes partnerships between the Federal and State governments and treats the mining community with respect and dignity without turning a blind eye to past indiscretion. 
I recognize that we have an up-hill battle. Mining reform has been shrouded for far too long in a smokey veil of rhetoric and sensationalism. The complexity of the issue is such that before we can show any meaningful progress we must separate the voices of those who seek meaningful reform from those who are using the debates to prevent mining on public lands. I believe this legislation will do that--it provides a platform for reasonable discussion and negotiation without threatening to end mining on public land. 
What we propose may not be poetic, but it does have a rock solid substance; it does not lend itself to catchy media blurbs, but it is genuine reform; it does not offer quick fixes; but it does make changes that are needed without punishing the innocent. It may not be pretty and it certainly is not easy to understand but I can promise you one thing--it will work. 
Both sides of the mining reform debate have come a long way toward achieving meaningful compromise. I am certain that the legislative vehicle we launch today will carry us that last mile and finally bring us the reform that is needed.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment Act of 1997. My bill provides a long-term funding source for the State-side matching grant program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. 
Thank you to Senate appropriators for honoring my request to fund the LWCF matching grants. The 1998 Interior appropriation bill ensures the programs's short-term viability. I wish we could have earmarked more, but I understand the challenges members face and thank them for their accomplishment. Special thanks to Senators Ted Stevens and Slade Gorton. 
I am confident we can win on the Senate floor, in conference and with the administration because the program is truly worthy. 
The LWCF matching grants have helped build thousands of miles of trails, protect thousands of acres of open space, and develop parks, campgrounds, and recreation facilities in every State. 
Every Federal dollar has been matched--we get two for the price of one. Unfortunately, Congress and the administration defunded the program 2 years ago. 
That's too bad, given what candidate Bill Clinton said: `I would increase funding for several programs * * * and reinvigorate the Land and Water Conservation Fund to make more funds available for the acquisition of public outdoor open spaces'. 
He also said, `I would also make funds available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to help address critical infrastructure needs in state and local facilities.' 
The millions of Americans who benefit from the matching grants need more than promises. Thankfully, the Interior appropriations bill saves the program for the short term. I am here today to offer a long-term solution. 
At a recent hearing before the Senate parks subcommittee, former Park Service Director Roger Kennedy said that as long as there is competition between Federal and State programs for LWCF appropriations, the State matching grants will lose. He suggested a separate source of funds. 
I am taking his advice to heart, and calling upon Congress to establish a separate and permanent fund for State matching grants. 
My legislation creates an $800 million permanent endowment to provide LWCF matching grants to the States. Interest from that account will help provide parks, campgrounds, trails, and recreation facilities for millions of Americans. It will also help preserve open spaces for the future. 
Where does that money come from? On June 19, 1997, the Supreme Court ruled the Federal Government retains title to lands underlying tidal waters off Alaska's North Slope. As the result, the government will receive $1.6 billion in escrowed oil and gas lease revenues. 
This sum is twice the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated for the concurrent budget resolution. My bill places this bonus $800 million in a permanent endowment account. 
This new approach is consistent with the vision of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act and a promise made to the American people 30 years ago. 
Our Government promised us that a portion of proceeds from offshore oil and gas leases would fund outdoor recreation and conservation. My bill makes good on that promise--permanently. It makes sure the State grants are never forgotten again. 
That sound we hear on the doors to this Chamber is opportunity knocking. We must seize the opportunity and use those funds to renew and reinvigorate the bipartisan vision of the LWCF. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor and support the Community Recreation and Conservation Endowment Act of 1997.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to benefit one of Alaska's most isolated regions, the Alaska Peninsula. This bill, The Izembek Refuge Land Exchange Act, provides a balanced approach to a difficult problem. In this remote area, there is a small Aleut Native village, King Cove, which is completely isolated from other Alaska cities and towns, and the rest of the world. The only way you can get to King Cove is by air or sea. And in this part of Alaska, the weather is so bad that neither sea or air is very reliable. 
My bill will permit King Cove to be connected to the rest of the world through a road link to Cold Bay, a regional center, and the location of a good, all weather airport which can provide year round and emergency medical evacuation for the residents of King Cove. Currently, when somebody is injured or gravely ill, treatment is at the mercy of weather and sea conditions. 
Mr. President, King Cove is a tough place to live and the residents are tough and independent people. Their ancestors migrated to this part of the State thousands of years ago and have made a life out of this area with its rich bounty of fish. But people get sick there just like any place in the country, emergencies happen there more than most other places in America because the lifestyle is so close to the edge. 
We have had long debates in this body this year about access to health care. Nowhere does this take on a more dramatic meaning than in King Cove. When I say access, I mean access. That means the actual physical ability to get to a hospital in Anchorage or Seattle to get the specialized health care needed in the event of a serious emergency or sickness. Right now, the residents of King Cove do not have this access. Since 1981, 11 air crash fatalities have occurred flying residentS from King Cove to Cold Bay. Numerous other crashes have also occurred, luckily without fatalities. 
Many of these crashes involved flying injured or sick people out of King Cove in an attempt to get emergency care. Often the trip to care is as dangerous as the infliction itself. For example, in 1981, a medivac plane was forced to leave King Cove for an emergency/life and death rescue mission. There was no alternative to this flight and the plane crashed. Four people died including the pilot and the medivac victim. Six years ago another fatal crash occurred with six people killed. The list goes on. 
This is a terrible place to have to fly out of if you cannot afford to wait. On medical emergencies, nobody can afford to wait. These residents are predominantly Alaska Natives, Aleuts for the most part. They have a good Alaska Native hospital available to them in Anchorage. In fact, thanks to this body, it is a new hospital with great facilities. But it might as well be on the dark side of the Moon for the residents of King Cove. When they need it, they can't be sure they will be able to get to it. 
This legislation provides the solution by allowing ground access to an all-weather runway only 30 miles from King Cove in Cold Bay. In fact, thanks to World War II, Cold Bay has the third longest runway in the State. The runway has modern all weather equipment such as instrument landing systems and many other modern landing system improvements. In the past 4 years, the Cold Bay airport has seen only one instance in which air traffic from Anchorage could not land. It is safe to say that air operations can occur here in virtually all weather and can accommodate the King Cove emergency needs at all times. With no road between King Cove and Cold Bay there will be no hope for those seeking help. My bill would provide a land exchange that will permit the road to be built between King Cove and Cold Bay. This is the reasonable solution. 
Mr. President, there is a need for this road, but there will be concerns raised because most of that road will be sited through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. This is unavoidable. The refuge is located completely astride the route between King Cove and Cold Bay. This is nobody's fault, and I know that the Fish and Wildlife Service has concerns. I also have concerns and my constituents and I are prepared to do what it takes to minimize the impact of this road on the surrounding area and resources. 
The King Cove Corp. has proposed an exchange for valuable wetlands it owns near the refuge for the road right of way. The bulk of the right of way is already owned by King Cove as an inholding in the refuge. Only 7 miles is not owned by King Cove and this is the Federal land which would be exchanged under my bill. That portion is in the wilderness portion of the refuge, but there is no alternative to this except further danger to my constituents and the inevitable death and destruction to future victims of the next air crash. 
Mr. President, I stand ready to work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to make this as constructive process as possible, but make no mistake, it is absolutely critical that this road be built. My constituents deserve a way to save their lives in times of emergency. They cannot be hostage to fear for life and limb.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Byrd-Hagel resolution expressing the sense of the Senate on international agreements covering greenhouse gas emissions. 
I wish to thank and commend my colleagues, Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel, for their efforts in forging this bipartisan, common sense resolution. I was proud to join them as an original cosponsor. 
The Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I chair, has had significant interest and long involvement in the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change because any attempt to address carbon emissions fundamentally affects energy investment, use, and policy. 
Our committee has held a variety of hearings, seminars, and briefings on this subject for the benefit of members, staff, and the public. 
Moreover, we have remained closely attuned to the negotiations toward a new climate treaty through close and regular contact with the principal State Department and Department of Energy officials. 
My predecessor as chairman, Senator Bennett Johnston, also had a keen interest in this subject, and made it a centerpiece of the committee's oversight responsibilities. 
So this is not a new issue to us. 
Having said that, I believe Senators Byrd and Hagel have done a superb job with this resolution expressing the Senate's aspirations and concerns with respect to any eventual climate treaty. 
This resolution will strengthen the hand of our negotiators during upcoming meetings in August, October, and December. 
Although this is not a binding resolution, it conveys the legitimate concerns of the Senate to other parties in the negotiations. 
Our negotiators can use this resolution to inform other nations of the elements that must be contained in any new climate treaty that can be ratified by this body. 
Turning now to the substance of the resolution, I have a letter from President Clinton, dated August 21, 1996, that contains a statement I very much agree with. And I quote: 
Establishing a sound framework is a critical first step in the negotiating process. We are already conducting additional analyses and technical assessments . . . our ultimate position will fully reflect economic considerations and our commitment to the principle that environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand-in-hand. 
The President is right. Economic considerations are important. We must not proceed down a path that will bring adverse economic consequences, competitive disadvantages, and energy price increases. 
The importance of economic considerations, as expressed by the President in his letter, are very much in line with this resolution. 
This resolution simply says that any new climate treaty must not result in serious economic harm to the United States. 
The Byrd-Hagel resolution also states that any new climate treaty must be global in its approach: 
New commitments on the part of developed countries to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be accompanied by new commitments on the part of developing countries to do the same. 
The issue of developing countries and their participation is critically important: 
According to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Department of Energy, carbon emissions from China will exceed ours by the year 2015. Their greenhouse gas emissions are expected to grow 185 percent above 1990 levels. 
Emissions from developing nations as a whole will also exceed those from industrialized nations by 2015. 
Clearly, this is a global issue that requires a global approach. If further science confirms the fact that carbon emission do indeed have dangerous implications for the climate, then all nations must take meaningful steps. 
The industrial nations simply do not have it in their power to do it alone, even if they wanted to. 
But here is some good news: We have time to approach this issue in a careful, deliberative manner. 
We gain nothing by getting ahead of the science. Indeed, we risk a great deal by moving too quickly: 
According to economic analysis by the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum, an orderly, long-term strategy of achieving a scientifically-justified carbon emission reduction costs just one-fifth what it would cost to achieve the same reduction over the near-term. 
In other words, you can get the same result 80 percent cheaper by taking a long-term view, and allowing capital equipment to be retired in an orderly fashion as new energy efficient technologies come on line. 
Mr. President, there is simply no need to compel working American families to pay five times as much as they need to for the same eventual outcome. 
Clearly, there is not a need for extreme actions such as carbon taxes, strict command and control regulations, and one-sided treaties that will impose economic harm. 
Let's take the time to do the job right and enjoy tremendous economic savings. 
Turning to the broader issue of climate change and climate science, let me say we should all be concerned about increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. 
It is an indisputable scientific fact that concentrations of greenhouse gasses are on the rise. 
Yet significant scientific uncertainties remain. 
Some scientists believe that higher carbon dioxide concentrations will bring only moderate change, warmer winters, reduced energy demands, and longer growing seasons. 
Virtually every climate scientist will tell you that the warming signal suggested by some data sets are all within the bounds of natural variability, and that climate change is the rule rather than the exception. Throughout the planet's history, the climate has changed. 
I will confess to my own personal fascination with the Greenland ice core records that I first became familiar with when the University of Alaska removed an ice core record spanning the entire depth of the Greenland ice cap. 
These ice cores are high-resolution records of climate which can be analyzed like the rings of a tree--only these records go back 100,000 years or more. 
The Greenland ice core record tells us that the earth's climate has always changed and shifted, often dramatically and over surprisingly short periods of time. 
Thus, the investments we've made in the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program, approaching $2 billion per year and more, are expensive but worthwhile. Because there is much more scientific work to do. 
The common refrain that I hear from climate scientists, virtually without exception, is this: 
The climate system is remarkably complex, and exceedingly difficult to model. 
Meanwhile, our current climate models are comparatively crude. 
We lack sufficient data for model inputs, particularly information about the effects of clouds and water vapor. 
And finally, as we have learned more and refined our computer models, estimates of future warming have fallen, not risen. 
Clearly, the science is uncertain, and the scientific debate is not over. Nor should it be. 
And that brings me to what I see as a troubling trend: 
Some who have argued for immediate and urgent action to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions have claimed that the science arguing for quick action is unassailable, and that the scientists who express doubts are somehow extreme or out of the mainstream. 
Frankly, talk such as that makes me cringe, because the scientific method itself is based on challenge and peer review. 
Contrarians should not be shouted down for the sake of political correctness. 
Whenever scientists are called out of the mainstream or extreme by a political leader or a journalist, you can bet that an attempted subversion of the scientific method is at hand. 
We should condemn any subversion of the scientific method whenever we see it occur in the climate debate. Too much is at stake. 
Continued investment in science will only enhance our understanding. We have invested billions in a climate change research program that is only now beginning to yield significant results. 
We should not stake our economic future on partial information. 
Since extreme, unilateral actions are unwarranted at this point, we have time to encourage developing nations such as China to participate in meaningful commitments. 
The resolution before us states that new commitments on the part of developed countries to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be accompanied by new commitments on the part of developing countries to do the same. 
I believe the Senate would have difficulty ratifying any new climate treaty that imposed legally binding greenhouse gas reduction targets and timetables, which are essentially energy quotas, only on the most developed nations. 
Such an approach would be unfair, economically devastating, and ineffective. 
To repeat: New energy quotas, imposed only on one set of nations, would be unfair, economically devastating, and ineffective. Let me explain: 
One-sided energy quotas would be unfair: 
They would allow some nations to gain tremendous competitive advantages over others by encouraging the movement of jobs, manufacturing and capital from nations that are subject to the energy quotas, to nations that are not. 
One-sided energy quotas would be economically devastating: 
They would require carbon taxes or regulation that would cost jobs, harm our economy, and diminish our standard of living. 
One-sided energy quotas would be ineffective: 
Because manufacturing, capital, jobs, and even emissions would move from nations that are subject to the energy quotas, to nations that are not, emissions would not diminish, they might even increase. 
Moreover, because the total greenhouse gas emissions from developing nations will soon exceed those from developed nations, exempting developing nations wouldn't do anything to improve the problem. Greenhouse gases would still increase. We would suffer economic pain without environmental gain. 
What I am saying here today has been confirmed by some of the administration's own economic analysis. A new study produced by the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory contains some surprising and compelling findings. Let me cite some of them: 
Increased energy and fuel prices in industrial nations resulting from a new climate treaty that does not contain meaningful commitments for developing nations such as India, China and South Korea would encourage a reallocation of investments away from industrial countries towards the developing countries. To the extent this occurs, emissions would simply be redistributed and could even increase. 
Some 20 to 30 percent of the energy intensive basic chemical industry could move to developing countries over 15 to 30 years, with 200,000 jobs lost. 
U.S. steel production could fall 30 percent with accompanying job losses of 100,000. 
All primary aluminum plants in the United States could close by 2010. 
Many petroleum refiners in the Northeast and Gulf Coast could close, and imports would displace more domestic production. 
Mr. President, these are serious economic impacts, and I believe we can all agree that this is precisely what we must avoid. 
That's what this resolution is about, and that's why I feel it should pass with a broad, bipartisan margin. 
Some will argue that we cannot be successful in efforts bring developing nations along in the negotiations in time for the December 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan. 
But I believe we should try. And if we cannot achieve a new treaty that includes developing nations in this timeframe, then perhaps Kyoto can at least produce a roadmap leading to meaningful commitments by all nations. 
Mr. President, there is no need for a headlong rush toward rash policies. 
The carbon problem didn't appear overnight. It won't be addressed overnight. We have time to devise and consider balanced approaches that can work. 
Time will allow new energy and efficiency technologies to mature. 
Time will provide for global solutions that include the developing nations. 
Time will allow us to sharpen our science and better understand the true threat of climate change, if it is indeed a dangerous threat. 
Yes, the climate issue is a serious one. But it's not a reason to panic. 
This resolution helps our negotiators. It sends an important message that this is a global problem that requires the attention and participation of all nations. 
I urge the Senate's adoption of the resolution, and I again commend Senators Byrd and Hagel for their leadership and tireless efforts.

Mr. President, I would like to call attention to an extraordinary experience that occurred last weekend, involving several Members of this body who joined my wife and me in visiting our great State of Alaska: Senator Helms and Mrs. Helms, the Senator from North Carolina; Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, and Senator Smith from Oregon. We left last Friday after the close of business Thursday night. We covered approximately 7,400 miles in about 64 hours. We visited eight cities and communities. I think we were in the airplane some 23 hours, spent 6 hours on a bus, and at least 10 hours visiting with people on the ground in Alaska. But for that relatively brief time, I think a great deal was learned. 
The purpose of the trip, relative to aspects of the national energy security of the country, was to observe the oil development on the North Slope of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay, and to follow the pipeline 800 miles down to the terminus at Valdez. 
We flew on Friday direct from Washington, DC, via Edmonton, Canada to Cordova, AK, in Prince William Sound, where we were met by Mayor Johnson, who gave us an overview of the impact of the Federal Government relations and the aftereffects of the Exxon Valdez oilspill at Bligh Reef. 
We then got into smaller aircraft and flew around Prince William Sound. We viewed Colombia Glacier and at the area where the Exxon Valdez went aground--we observed the beaches closely. I am pleased to tell my colleagues that there was absolutely no sign of any residue from that terrible accident. 
We then landed in Valdez, were met by a group of people, and boarded a bus to go around the harbor to the pipeline terminal, which is the largest oil terminal in the United States. A full 25 percent of our total crude oil production is dispatched on U.S.-flagged tankers that move it to Hawaii, to Los Angeles and San Francisco on the west coast, and to other areas. 
It was remarkable to note that there were hundreds of tourists fishing for salmon, right next to the oil terminal, in small boats. We saw several fish being caught. These weren't shills, these were real people, real tourists out there, Mr. President. 
We had an opportunity to inspect the terminal. We observed the major storage area. We actually went into one of the storage tanks that was being cleaned. The setting of the terminal--that I remind my colleagues has the capability of supplying this Nation with 25 percent of its total crude oil--is really dramatic. It sits on a shelf across the harbor from Valdez, on solid rock, with a dramatic background of snowcapped peaks. More significant still is, I think, the technology that has been adopted there. 
They are currently able to recapture any emissions from the loading tankers, that is, the fumes coming from loading the tankers, and put them back into a closed recovery process. So there are virtually no emissions coming out during the loading process. To protect against liquids, each ship has a boom around it while it is loaded to make sure that there is no oil can possibly escape. I think the oil spillage there in the last several years has totaled less than a gallon, to give you some idea of the safety and technology that has been adopted. 
We next went back to Valdez by boat, met with community leaders and then got back on our airplane and flew to Fairbanks. In Fairbanks we were hosted at a dinner by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp., the Alaska Native corporation representing the North Slope area. Next morning we flew from Barrow to Fairbanks, about an hour-and-a-half flight. Point Barrow is the northernmost community in the United States. You can't go any further north without falling off the top. 
There we met with a number of Native people, and they were very explicit in explaining to us the significant difference that energy development has made to their lives. One young man indicated that he used to come to school to keep warm, because there was not enough heat in his home. They had to scrounge on the 
beach for driftwood, driftwood that is not native to the area because Barrow is far north of the tree line, but would float in from the MacKenzie River 100 miles away to the east and wash up on the beach. He said things are different now. He went to a school that was built by the North Slope Borough government and funded by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. It is one of the finest schools in the United States. It has everything--even indoor recess capability, a good idea in that climate. Really a magnificent facility. We also visited the local hospital and several other things. 
But the point the resident brought out is that they prospered only as a consequence of having a tax base based on resource development--oil and gas. They were able to send their children to school. And it was not like the past when there were no economic benefits, no support base. I think everyone was very pleased at the presentation because it provided a point of view on energy development that is not often made. 
We next flew in our airplane to Prudhoe Bay, the beginning of the 800-mile pipeline, to observe the oilfields. Then we went by bus to a site called Endicott. This is a field based on a man-made island about 11 miles offshore, made of gravel. It is the seventh largest producing oilfield in North America, and yet it has a footprint of only 54 acres. That's very significant when you consider the advancements in oil technology between Prudhoe Bay and Endicott, and realize they can develop oil using directional drilling from a very small platform--that is what Endicott means. 
We then drove back to Prudhoe Bay, got in small aircraft and went east to the Canadian border. There, we were inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--ANWR. We actually flew into the ANWR area to a village that is in the middle of ANWR called Kaktovik. We met with the villagers. They were out fishing. It was a beautiful day. There was virtually no wind. The icecap moved away from the shore, leaving blue waters. We saw maybe 10,000 caribou, and several hundred musk ox on the tundra. 
The interesting thing is we saw where the proposed wells are going to be developed on the State's side of ANWR, and then we went near a well site that is very close to the edge of ANWR called Sourdough. This is a well on State land adjacent to ANWR and which may be the site of a major oil discovery. 
The question there is whether this discovery extends into ANWR or is limited just to the State land next to it. Of course, this presents a problem and a question of responsibility for the Secretary of the Interior. Because he has public trust responsibility to determine if there is, in fact, a reservoir of oil on the Federal side. That's important because if the State allows drilling and the State pulls down the oil deposit under its well, a portion of that resource could belong to the Federal Government. 
We went to a couple of other areas that were interesting. Some in the group asked, `Where are the pictures of the coastal plain that we see in the environmental magazines that portray the sensitive coastal plain area?' We took the group back into that area, a dramatically different region that is not in the same area as the coastal plain despite the pictures we see so often. We also observed a number of areas where they plan to drill on the State's side, and flew over the one exploratory well that had been drilled within the ANWR area. There was no evidence, other than you can see a discoloration of the tundra, of that well's existence--no structures of any kind. 
What that well may or may not contain we still don't know because that information has never been released by the companies that did the drilling. It is somewhat academic at this point, because if there were substantial reserves there, there is no way to take them out because it's all Federal land. Without the ability to transfer the oil through a pipeline it is impractical and unreasonable to proceed until Congress resolves the issue of what to do with the 1002 area. 
This is a unique area, part of ANWR, but just 1 1/2 million acres out of the 19-million-acre total. The area of ANWR is basically made up of three parcels. About 8 million acres are in the wilderness, about 9 million acres are in what we call refuges. Only 1 1/2 million acres are included in the so-called 1002 area, which was reserved for the Congress of the United States to decide whether or not it is in the national interest to open that area for oil and gas exploration. 
To conclude with a brief description of the trip, I think my colleagues would agree, they saw a great big hunk of American real estate and got a feel for the sensitive areas. They got a feel for the advanced technology that is underway currently for oil and gas exploration and production. We saw foxes. We saw caribou running ahead of our bus on the roads in Prudhoe Bay. 
Then after that day, we flew back to Fairbanks where we were hosted by the Alaska miners to a dinner. The next morning, the University of Alaska, on Sunday, hosted the Members to a breakfast at 8 o'clock. Then at 9 o'clock, we went out to the Fort Knox gold mine. This is the largest gold mine in Alaska producing from a new technology that gets the very fine gold and is able to recover it. It is operating 7 days a week, 24 hours a day with a shift of about 200 personnel, but the significance is that they brought in a bar of gold, a brick, a little bit bigger than a brick, very heavy. It was worth about $167,000. That is what one brick of gold is worth. 
We drove back to Fairbanks, got in the airplane at noon on Sunday, and flew back the rest of the day, got in here at midnight, and went to work Monday morning. 
I simply describe this as evidence, I think, of an opportunity for Members to see Alaska, such as Senator Helms, Senator Jeffords, Senator Inhofe, Senator Smith, the current occupant of the chair, and see for themselves what the issues are relative to the issue of ANWR and other aspects of the national energy security interests which Alaska contributes significantly to and address the dilemma associated with development on public land and talk to Alaskans who we feel are the best stewards of the land. 
So I encourage my other colleagues to contact the Senators in question--Senators Helms, Jeffords, Inhofe, and Smith of Oregon, because we would like to host others in Alaska and let them see for themselves as they address many of the issues that are going to determine the manner in which Congress authorizes resource development on public lands in our Nation's largest State. 
With that, I thank my colleague who has been patient, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have one more item, relating to legislation addressing several important aspects of the administration and management of Glacier Bay National Park in my State of Alaska. 
As many of you know, Glacier Bay National Park, west of Juneau in southeastern Alaska, has been named as the No. 1 national park in our country's National Park System. It is a unique tourist destination. It can only really be reached by cruise ship. The season runs roughly from Memorial Day to Labor Day, the season for the cruise ships that visit southeastern Alaska. 
For the most part, these are the same ships that traverse the Caribbean in the wintertime, then move to Vancouver, BC, in order to sail to Alaska in the summer. There are probably 30 ships. I believe the number of tourists who visit Alaska by cruise ship is somewhere in the area of 600,000 in that short 90-day period. 
Because of the popularity of this unique tourist destination, the legislation I have introduced would encourage the continuation of the Park Service's ongoing efforts to work with concession operators to try to improve visitor services, as well as deal fairly and finally with the longstanding dispute over the status of the commercial and subsistence fishing that has gone on in that park from time immemorial. 
The footprint that any of these activities leaves in this park is pretty insignificant in relationship to other parks, because the park is seen, for the most part, by visitors on a cruise ship. You might get an occasional candy wrapper blown overboard, but the ships are very good at keeping their impact to a minimum. The point is, compared to impressions left in other national parks by visitors, the footprint left by visitors who come to the park on a ship--and never get off--is extremely small. That's part of what makes the park so unique--access by cruise ship. 
In any event, this bill reflects the progress of several years of discussion with local interests and the Park Service. The efforts, I think, are positive. But we have been hampered from achieving consensus by some groups who seem to be unwilling to compromise for reasons we can only guess at--perhaps they don't want to see other visitors during that short summer season. 
Insofar as possible, this bill represents an attempt to stake out some reasonable, responsible middle ground that would respect the wishes of all concerned. The issue of commercial fishing is one where, historically, fishermen have plied the waters of Glacier Bay and the outer coast, the Gulf of Alaska area now included in the park, for over 100 years. Local Native villagers, the Huna Tlingit people, have been doing so for thousands of years. At no time have their activities damaged the park or its resources, nor have they harmed the area's wild and scenic qualities in any way. Their presence has provided a colorful backdrop to the mystique of the park, as a matter of fact. This simple fact I don't think can be overemphasized. 
To put it another way, commercial fishing and local villagers have continually fished in Glacier Bay since long before it became a park or a monument. The fact that we value it so highly today is proof that they have not had an adverse impact on the species in the bay. Unfortunately, some interests do not seem to be concerned about fairness, or the obligation to the Native people of Alaska, and would like to see fishing and gathering banned, no matter how environmentally benign or how critical to the local livelihoods it may be. 
On subsistence, this bill corrects inconsistencies in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, known as ANILCA. Villagers living near Glacier Bay, whose ancestors have used the bay continually for at least 9,000 years, must be allowed to continue to use the bay's resources to feed their families, to fish for halibut, salmon, crabs, collect clams, seaweeds, berries, and other foods that are part of their traditional culture. 
Let me emphasize, we are talking about a relative handful of families--most from the local Native village of Hoonah, which has 
a population of about 900 or so, and a few people from other nearby communities such as Elfin Cove, Gustavus, and Pelican. We are not talking about thousands of people. These Alaskans do not have the convenience of supermarkets or strip malls. They deserve consideration and respect. They deserve to have their historic use recognized and provided for by this Congress. 
My bill also addresses commercial fishing in the park. For generations, commercial fishermen caught salmon, halibut and crabs in Glacier Bay and have fished the rich grounds of the outside coast as well. And there is no biological reason, none whatsoever, for restricting commercial fishing activity anywhere in the park. The fishery resources are healthy, they are diverse, they are closely monitored by the State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and they are very carefully regulated. It should also be noted that, of the park's approximately 3 million acres of marine waters, only about 500,000 are productive enough to warrant real, significant interest. 
There are few anadromous streams in the park--that's streams where the salmon go up and spawn--because most of the fresh water that comes down comes down from the glaciers and there is simply no place for the salmon to spawn. 
In any event, the fisheries are restricted both as to method as in the number of participants, and are carefully managed and controlled to assure continued abundance. There is nothing in the bill and there is no desire by the fishing industry to change these controls or increase the level of this sustainable activity. Alaska is a very careful steward of its resources. Commercial fishing does not harm the environment in any way. In spite of what you hear, Alaska fisheries are in very good shape. We have had record runs 8 of the last 11 years. Under Federal management, things got so bad there was one year when we only took 25 million salmon, but when we became a State that began turning around. I think last year we put up 218 million. That's because we don't open our season until we have had adequate escapement, that is, enough fish to go up the streams to spawn so that we are guaranteed renewability of the resource. 
So, in the grand scheme of things, and recognizing consideration of the Nation's economy, these fisheries are small potatoes. But to the fishermen, the natives who depend upon them, to the families of small remote communities in which they live, these fisheries are of the utmost importance. They are harm free. And those who partake in them deserve this Government's help, not the destruction of their simple lifestyle. 
This bill authorizes traditional fishing throughout the park for subsistence users as well as historical commercial activities. However, because there are special, sensitive areas inside Glacier Bay itself, it also designates the waters inside the bay as a special reserve, in which a joint team of Federal and State scientists will make recommendations on where fishing should occur and at what level. 
A further special provision is also included in one area where there is significant potential for conflict between fishermen and certain limited nonmotorized uses, such as kayaking, during the brief 3-month summer period. 
This area is in the Beardslee Islands, near the entrance of the bay. Under this bill, the only commercial fishing that would be allowed in the Beardslees would be crab fishing, and that only in a very small area, by a very small number of people who historically are dependent on this fishing--less than a dozen people. This would only include people who can show both a significant history of participation and a real dependence on that fishery for their livelihoods. This privilege could be transferred to one successor, when the original fisherman retires, but will cease after that. And at any point the Park Service could eliminate all fishing in the Beardslees with a fair payment to the individual fisherman. 
The reason for such a special rule in the Beardslees is simply that these fishermen have no other option than fishing in the Beardslees, due to the small size of their vessels and their reliance on this one fishery, and a few other factors. 
So this bill will not contribute to any increase in fishing. In fact, over time the opposite may occur. It will simply provide for the scientifically sound continuation of an environmentally benign activity. Finally, I think it's important also to note that the continuation of both subsistence and commercial fishing enjoys wide support from local residents of Southeastern Alaska, including environmental groups such as the Southeastern Alaska Conservation Council. 
I look to my colleagues for support on the merits of the bill. 
Mr. President, I see no other Senators in the Chamber. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of introducing legislation that I think is most significant. This legislation will particularly appeal to those who are inclined to enjoy the outdoors because it will establish our Nation's first coast-to-coast multiuse hiking trail. Take a moment and think about that. You will be able to hike from coast to coast on a hiking trail. That means off the highways, away from the roads, behind the freeways. A true outdoor experience. 
Trails are one of America's most popular recreation resources. Millions of Americans hike, they ski, they jog, they bike, they ride horses, they drive snow machines and all-terrain vehicles, they observe nature, commute, and relax on trails throughout the country. 
A variety of trails are provided nationwide, including urban bike paths, bridle paths, community greenways, historic trails, motorized trails, and long-distance hiking trails. This legislation will establish the American Discovery Trail, or ADT as it is commonly called. The ADT is a continuous coast-to-coast trail to link the Nation's principal north-south trails and east-west historic trails with shorter local and regional trails into a nationwide network. 
Mr. President, by establishing a system of discovery trails, this new category will recognize that using and enjoying trails close to home is equally as important as traversing remote wilderness trails, of which we have many in my State of Alaska. Long-distance trails are used mostly by people living close to the trail and by weekenders. Backpacking excursions are normally a few days to a couple of weeks. As an example, of the estimated 4 million users of the Appalachian Trail, each year it is estimated that only about 100 to 150 walk the entire trail annually. This will be true of the American Discovery Trail as well, especially because of its proximity to urban locations throughout the country. 
The ADT, the first of the discovery trails, will connect 6 of the national scenic trails, 10 of the national historic trails, 23 of the national recreation trails, and hundreds of other local and regional trails. 
Until now, the element that has been missing in order to create a national system of connected trails is that the existing trails, for the most part, are simply not connectable. With the ADT that will no longer be the case. 
The ADT is about access. The trails will connect people to larger cities, small towns, urban areas and to mountains, forests, deserts and natural areas, incorporating regional, local, and national trails together. 
What makes this so exciting is the way it has already brought people together. More than 100 organizations along the trail's 6,000 miles support the effort. Each State the trail passes through already has a volunteer coordination effort, and coordinators who lead an active ADT committee. A strong grassroots effort along with financial support from Backpacker magazine, Eco USA, The Coleman Companies and others, have helped make the ADT move from a dream to a reality. 
Only one very more important step on the trail needs to be taken. Congress needs to authorize the trail as part of our national trail system. I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort. 
The American Discovery Trail begins, or ends, when your two feet go into the Pacific at Point Reyes National Seashore, just north of San Francisco. Next are Berkeley and Sacramento before the climb to the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail in Lake Tahoe in the middle of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
Nevada offers historic Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode, the Pony Express National Historic Trail, Great Basin National Park with Lehman Caves and Wheeler Peak. 
Utah provides national forests and parks along with spectacular red rock country, which leads into Colorado offering Colorado National Monument with its 20,445 acres of sandstone monoliths and canyons. Then there is the Grand Mesa over Scofield Pass and Crested Butte, in the heart of the ski country as you follow the Colorado and Continental Divide Trails into Evergreen. I wish I was there myself this afternoon. 
At Denver, the ADT divides and becomes the northern and southern Midwest routes. The northern Midwest route winds through Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; the southern Midwest route leaves Colorado and the Air Force Academy and follows the tracks and wagon wheel ruts of thousands of early pioneers through Kansas and Missouri as well as settlements and historic places in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky until the trail joins the northern route in Cincinnati. 
West Virginia is next, then Maryland and the C&O Canal. This leads to Washington, DC, where the trail passes The Mall, the White House, the Capitol, and then heads on to Annapolis. Finally, in Delaware, the trail reaches the eastern terminus at Cape Henlopen State Park and the Atlantic Ocean. 
Between the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, one will experience the most spectacular scenery in the world, thousands of historic sites, lakes, rivers and streams of every size. The trail offers an opportunity to discovery America from small towns, to rural countryside, to large metropolitan areas. 
When the President signs the legislation into law, a 10-year effort will have been achieved. The American Discovery Trail will become a reality. The more people who use it, the better.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my good friend, the Senator from California, the amendment which would strike the provisions of the bill to divide the ninth circuit into two separate circuits of more manageable size and certainly more manageable responsibility. 
The division of the ninth circuit is warranted for three very important reasons: its size and population; its caseload; and its astounding reversal rate by the U.S. Supreme Court. Who holds the ninth circuit court accountable? It is the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Let's talk about size and population. I have a chart here which shows the magnitude of the area covered by the ninth circuit. The ninth circuit is, by far, the largest of the 13 judicial circuits, encompassing nine States and stretching from the Arctic Circle in my State to the border of Mexico and across the international date line. That is how big it is. 
We are not against California or Nevada. What we want is a recognition of timely judicial action. 
Population: The second chart I have shows the number of people served by the ninth circuit. Over 49 million people are served by the ninth circuit, almost 60 percent more than are served by the next largest circuit. By the year 2010, not very far away, the Census Bureau estimates that the ninth circuit's population will be more than 63 million, a 43-percent increase in just 13 years. Talk about not doing anything rash. This population is increasing out of control. We better start doing something now. 
On the issue of accountability, Mr. President, and that is most important, the only factor more disturbing than the geographic magnitude of the circuit is the magnitude of its ever-expanding docket. The ninth circuit has more cases than any other circuit. Last year alone, the ninth circuit had an astounding 8,502 new filings. It is because of its caseload that the entire appellate process in the ninth circuit is the second slowest in the Nation. How do they explain that? As a former chief judge, Judge Wallace of the ninth circuit, stated: 
It takes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal in our court as compared to the national median time. 
Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger put it more succinctly when he called the ninth circuit an `unmanageable administrative monstrosity.' 
Let's look at this reversal rate which I want to talk to you about, because there is the issue of accountability. Our responsibility of judicial oversight demands action now. Unfortunately, this massive size often results in the decrease in the ability of the judges to keep abreast of legal developments within this jurisdiction. The large number of judges scattered over a large area inevitably results in difficulty in reaching consistent circuit decisions. This judicial inconsistency has led to continual increases in the reversal rate of the ninth circuit decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
During the last Supreme Court session, the Court reversed 19 of the 20 cases that it heard from the ninth circuit. That is an astounding 95 percent reversal rate. How do they explain that? They don't. It is embarrassing, I would think, for the judges. 
The Supreme Court holds the circuit accountable to the tune of a 95 percent reversal rate. It's about accountability, Mr. President. 
Here is the relative ninth circuit reversal rate: 95 percent in 1996; 83 percent in 1995; 82 percent in 1994; 73 percent in 1993; 63 percent in 1992.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe the Senator from California indicated, Mr. President, that new California judges would have a 50 percent increase in caseload, and the Senator from California indicated that would not be enough judges. I wonder if she meant to say that, in the new ninth circuit, there would be 63 percent new cases and 53 percent judges, and in the twelfth circuit, there would be 37 percent new cases and 42 percent judges, which are the figures that we have from the committee, which hardly reflect a 50 percent increase in the caseload.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we consider funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, I would like to raise the issue of Clean Air Act carbon monoxide violations in my home town of Fairbanks with the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee. 
As the chairman knows, Fairbanks has one of the highest rates of temperature inversions in the world. When such inversions occur, pollutants from any source in the area are trapped at extremely low altitudes. For example, it is not uncommon to see the smoke from house chimneys trapped directly above a house rather than disbursed in the atmosphere as in other cities nationwide. 
While I would have preferred that the EPA not go forward with a bump-up on the rating of Fairbanks' air from moderate to serious, I recognize that this bill is not the place to accomplish that goal. I would like to point out that in the past 20 years, Fairbanks has reduced its violation days from 160 to as low as 1 last year. It is these last violations that are causing difficulties for communities nationwide. However, Fairbanks may never be able to prevent several violations per year due to its unique and extreme cold weather. It is my hope that the EPA would work with Fairbanks to develop strategies to mitigate the pollution that is so severely magnified by the extreme cold weather of my hometown.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Ketchikan, AK, just north of the Canadian border in southeast Alaska, has recently suffered an extreme economic blow due to changes in Federal forest management policies. It is a town of just a few thousand people, and the loss of 406 jobs due to the closure of one of the town's major industries, a pulpmill, severely disrupted the community. 
The need for economic revitalization in Ketchikan is great, but the available opportunities are limited. One potentially important opportunity is provided by a local shipyard, Ketchikan Ship and Drydock. However, the ability of this yard to contribute to the local economy is limited without a significant upgrade of its ability to handle a variety of vessel sizes. 
It is my understanding that the subcommittee report on this appropriation recognizes similar situations in other areas by suggesting that the Economic Development Administration consider proposals which meet its procedures and guidelines. 
Would the distinguished managers of the bill, my friends from New Hampshire and South Carolina, agree that if the EDA receives a proposal for the Ketchikan shipyard which meets its procedures and guidelines, the EDA should consider that proposal and provide a grant if the latter is warranted?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the Government of Canada failed to act responsibly to quickly restore order and the rule of law during the recent blockade of the Alaska State ferry, the motor vessel Malaspina. I am pleased to be joined in this measure by the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and the senior Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton. 
Mr. President, the amendment responds to this illegal blockade, in which a large number of Canadian fishing vessels joined forces to prevent the Malaspina from departing from Prince Rupert, BC, from approximately 8 a.m. Saturday morning until approximately 9 p.m. on Monday. 
The actions of these Canadian fishermen was a clear violation of international law which provides for the right of free passage, and continued Monday in violation of a Canadian court order against the blockade, issued on Sunday. Obviously, Canadian authorities had a difficult task, but the reality is that they failed to take timely action to disperse this illegal demonstration. Indeed, they delayed even serving their own Canadian court's injunction against the blockaders. 
This incident caused distress, financial harm, and inconvenience to some 300 passengers, primarily American passengers, on board the vessel, and to the State of Alaska that operates the system, and to companies which had consigned freight shipments to the vessel. While the Canadian fishermen claimed their action was in response to a fishing dispute, the blockade of this vessel went far beyond any fishing dispute into a very dangerous area, and created an international incident. 
There is little difference, in reality, between this blockade and the interruption of traffic on a major international highway such as New York's Route 81 to Montreal. The Alaska Marine Highway System is part of our U.S. Interstate Highway System. Operating money for the Malaspina and other vessels in the system receive funding through ISTEA, our national highway legislation. Any vehicles that can traverse the interstate highways of Alaska can be accommodated in the MV Malaspina. It carries approximately 105 cars, vans--you name it. So, it is an official part of the U.S. National Highway System. Moreover, Mr. President, this ship was also carrying the U.S. mail. 
This resolution will put the Senate on record in opposition to this and future illegal attacks on the U.S. transportation network, and specifically the Alaska Marine Highway System. It calls upon the President to do whatever is necessary and whatever is appropriate to ensure that the Government of Canada takes steps to guarantee that illegal actions against American citizens will not be allowed. It also calls on the President to assist American citizens who were harmed by this illegal action to recover damages from those responsible and/or from the Canadian Government. 
Yesterday I spoke with Canada's Ambassador to the United States. He apologized for the burning of the U.S. flag by one of the fishing vessels--an unfortunate incident. On the 
other hand, even at that time, more than 2 days after the beginning of the blockade, the Ambassador was not able to confirm to me that his government had the necessary commitment to take appropriate steps that may be necessary in such illegal actions. He indicated that he would attempt to find out what action would be considered if the vessels didn't voluntarily depart the area. 
I am still awaiting the call, although the issue has since been resolved. Ultimately, it was the fishermen themselves who decided to remove that blockade, not any formal action of the Canadian Government in enforcing, if you will, the Canadian court order. Indeed, the Canadian Minister of Fisheries, who met with the fishermen yesterday, was quoted in the press as saying he would not even ask the fishermen to cease the blockade. 
I know emotions run high. I very much value our relationship with our Canadian neighbors. But an unlawful act such as this, where United States commerce is affected, United States mails are affected, the orderly transportation of United States citizens is affected, and the Canadian and the British Columbian justice systems fail to take immediate action to terminate the illegalities, was very disappointing to those of us in Alaska and the United States. 
I know the administration views this matter seriously. I know they have under consideration certain steps that may be necessary to protect U.S. interests. I believe the Senate should show its support for the President in this matter and that is exactly what the resolution does. 
It specifically encourages using United States assets and personnel to protect United States citizens exercising their right of innocent passage through the territorial seas of Canada from such illegal actions or harassment, until such time as the President determines the Government of Canada has adopted a long-term policy that ensures such protection. That could include escort by the U.S. Coast Guard, if necessary. 
Second, it says we should consider prohibiting the import of select Canadian products until such time as the President determines that Canada has adopted a long-term policy that protects United States citizens exercising the right of innocent passage through the territorial seas of Canada from illegal actions or harassment. 
Third, it suggests the possibility of directing that no Canadian vessel may anchor or otherwise take shelter in United States waters off Alaska or any other State without formal clearance from United States Customs, except of course in the case of storms or other emergencies. 
Fourth, it reflects that the President might find it appropriate to say that no fish or shellfish taken in sport fisheries in the Province of British Columbia may enter the United States. 
Last, it suggests enforcing U.S. laws with respect to all vessels in Dixon Entrance, including the waters where jurisdiction is disputed. It is my hope these actions will not be necessary, and that we will get the necessary assurances from the Canadian Government. 
Many say this is a fishing issue. Mr. President, the fishing issue is paramount but that can only be resolved through negotiations. It is fair to say of the last negotiation, that the Canadians saw fit to walk out and have not been back since. It is my hope those negotiations will resume soon, but that takes two parties to begin. 
In any event, I ask my colleagues for support on the Senate resolution. 
Mr. President, It is my intention, with the permission of the floor manager, to ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment from the Senator from New Mexico to strike section 630 of this legislation. Section 630 addresses substantive issues regarding the energy efficiency requirements for Federal agencies under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. That act had many provisions designed to improve the energy efficiency of Federal facilities. Two are at issue here. First, there are so-called energy savings performance contracts [ESPC's]. These are a mechanism for use of private sector funds to finance Federal energy efficiency improvements. These are competitively bid. In addition, there are utility programs. EPAct also provided for Federal participation in utility demand management programs that are authorized by the State regulators. 
The ESPC's haven't been used as much as they could be. The ESPC's required new regulations, which DOE took a long time to issue. The contracting process was complicated and cumbersome. However, DOE is now entering into regional contracts for all Federal facilities, which is expected to speed up the contracting process. In the meantime, Federal agencies have been participating in utility demand management programs to reduce energy use. 
The language of section 630 is very broad--it prohibits participation in all utility demand management programs. Even more troublesome, it prohibits payment under existing contracts. This, despite the fact that there may be some services that only utilities can provide--an example is a meeting system that provides real-time pricing information. But today, I do not wish to debate whether or not this is the right thing to do. This change in a law that is within the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee. 
The promoters of the amendment have claimed that obtaining energy efficiency measures through sole source contracting--through utility demand management programs--is already against the law. This is not so. Section 152 of EPAct amended section 545 of National Energy Conservation Act to include the following language:

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment from the Senator from New Mexico to strike section 630 of this legislation. The provision that would be stricken by the amendment addresses substantive issues regarding the energy efficiency requirements that apply to Federal agencies under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The requirements addressed by this provision are complex and, along with many, if not all, of the energy efficiency provisions of EPAct, have resulted in quite a bit of controversy during their implementation. As chairman of the Energy Committee, I intend to investigate these issues thoroughly and address them legislatively, as appropriate. 
I believe that the supporters of section 630 have raised a legitimate concern that will probably require a legislative resolution. However, as I noted, these issues are very complex, and within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The scope of this section is very broad and its full impact is unknown at this time. Its impact on existing contracts is unclear, and it may, in fact, prohibit some activities that are appropriate and beneficial to the American taxpayer. We simply have not had the opportunity for the Energy Committee to evaluate this language and assess all of its implications, as it should. As such, I must object to their resolution in this piece of legislation on procedural grounds and would ask that my name be added as co-sponsor of the Bingaman amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the pending sense-of-the-Senate resolu- tion that China's most-favored-nation trading status should be revoked. This is the worst of all possible alternatives. Mr. President, you will recall that Teddy Roosevelt said speak softly and carry a big stick, well this resolution is just the opposite--it is speaking loudly, and carrying no stick. The traditional resolution of disapproval for MFN has already been defeated in the House of Representatives. So this vote has no force. In my view, that is the worst possible way to send a message to China. 
Much has been written that this year the debate over MFN is different, that the issues have changed, but I do not think the fundamental choice has changed: Do we choose engagement--striving to bring China into the international community on terms we support--or isolation--allowing China to enter the international arena on terms beyond our control. I think the answer is obvious. 
MFN should be renewed unconditionally not because it is a reward to the Government of China, but because revocation of MFN hurts the very people we want to help. We have many grave concerns with China ranging from the treatment of dissidents and Christians to weapons proliferation. But severing economic ties is not the right tool to address these issues. Revoking MFN only succeeds in hurting Americans, hurting reformers, and hurting the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
But what I have to say about linking MFN to Hong Kong's future is far less important than what the people of Hong Kong themselves have told lawmakers. Martin Lee, Hong Kong's leading democrat described revoking MFN as punishing Hong Kong. Miss Denise Yue, Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry, best described the threat of MFN revocation as double jeopardy, `[K]nowing that if China takes away their freedoms, the United States will respond by taking away their jobs . . .' Similarly, Hong Kong's Chief Executive designee Tung Chee Hwa has stressed that unconditional renewal of MFN is in the best interests of Hong Kong. 
So I think we should listen very carefully to what those who live and work in Hong Kong have said, rather than pretending we know better. 
This also applies to the Chinese on the other side of the strait--the people of Taiwan. This year, as in past years, the Government of Taiwan is quietly supporting the renewal of normal trading ties. One has only to look at investment in Southern China to understand that cutting economic ties between the United States and the People's Republic of China will have a significant and negative economic impact on Taiwan. Taiwan companies and individuals have invested more than $30 billion in over 30,000 enterprises. 
My colleagues should also take note that the board of the United States-Republic of China (Taiwan) Business Council, a collection of American companies doing business in Taiwan, unanimously adopted a resolution supporting renewal of MFN. The council noted that `renewing MFN for China is good for the United States in its business with China, with Taiwan, and with Hong Kong.' 
Supporters of Taiwan, and I put myself firmly in that category, should also look at the history of the United States relationship with Taiwan, before rejecting the claim that economic liberalization leads to political liberalization. 
This United States commitment to the people of Taiwan was indispensable to the development of the economic and democratic miracle that is Taiwan today. This was not always the case. Martial law lasted from 1950 to 1987. During that period, individual rights and freedoms were stifled and political opposition was silenced. Yet, today, once imprisoned opposition leaders such as Peng Ming-min have been released. In fact, Peng was the DPP's Presidential candidate in last year's March election. 
During this less than free and open period, the United States stood by Taiwan, maintained normal trading relations, and gave the Republic of China economic aid. Most historians agree that United States aid and investment served to enhance market-oriented economic reforms that contributed to rising living standards and expanded economic freedoms, and injected a liberalizing influence into Taiwanese society. But the transition to an open, democratic society took 50 years on an island of 20 million, and was the first democracy in 5,000 years of Chinese history. 
Of course, Taiwan's success also depended on a leadership decision to reform the political structure. We certainly cannot predict what direction the People's Republic of China leadership will take the 1.2 billion mainland Chinese, but we can follow the formula that has worked before. 
Hong Kong's and Taiwan's freedom and power as a model for China's future evolution rests on continued economic vibrancy. U.S. policy should strive to maintain confidence, not destroy it. 
I hope that next year we can have a more constructive debate over whether this annual exercise should be scrapped in favor of a deal to grant permanent MFN status for China if they make the necessary commercial concessions to enter the World Trade Organization. 
The yearly exercise of public handwringing over MFN renewal has proven a liability to a coherent China policy. MFN was never intended to serve as a weapon of punishment for every problem we have with nonmarket economies. Its original purpose of guaranteeing freedom of emigration from the former Soviet Union has been grossly distorted, and I would say without achieving any positive results. But there is a time for everything, and unfortunately now is not the time to push permanent MFN. 
Integrating China into the international community poses great risks and equally great opportunities. If we continue down the road of inconsistency and fail to deal honestly with the Chinese, in concert with our allies, and based on a clear understanding of the United States national interest, we will have failed the sacred trust of the Nation. 
The United States-China relationship is pivotal to the continued security and prosperity of Asia and America. We must ground that relationship in the solid foundation of the U.S. national interest--ensuring stability and security in Asia to limit the potential for conflict and tension and to provide fertile soil for democracy and economic prosperity. We must also work together with our Asian allies to design and raise its frame; their future is as much at stake as our own.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. At 10:40 a.m. Tuesday morning along the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, North Korean soldiers exchanged heavy gunfire with South Korean troops. This is accurately described as the most serious clash on the Korean Peninsula since a North Korean submarine full of special forces went aground off South Korea's coast last September. 
According to news reports, 14 North Korean soldiers crossed the military demarcation line and traveled 70 meters into the DMZ. South Korean border guards used a loudspeaker to order the North Koreans back. When the North Koreans failed to respond, South Korean soldiers fired some 200 warning shots in the air. 
The North Koreans responded by firing their rifles at the South Korean soldiers, who then directed fire at the North Koreans using rifles and machine guns. North Korean soldiers returned fire. And although reports are in dispute, it appears there was at least one mortar round fired by the North Koreans. 
The firefight lasted for over 1 hour before the North Koreans stopped firing and withdrew.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I like to talk today about the stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund which doubles both the pleasure of those who use outdoor recreation facilities as well as the money. The stateside matching grant program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund basically provides two for the price of one, and I will explain that a little further. The Land and Water Conservation Fund grant program, or the LWCF as it is known, has had a substantial long-term effect on our overall attitudes and policies toward outdoor recreation. The land and water stateside program has truly a unique legacy in the history of American conservation and recreation. 
When I say stateside program, I am talking about a State/Federal matching grant. What better way for the Federal Government to participate than matching local funds for public parks and recreation facilities. Local funds provide an opportunity for involvement and pride and responsibility by the communities at hand. 
The first legacy of this kind is the notion basic to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act that States must assume the leadership role as provider of recreation opportunities. It should not be left to an indifferent Federal Government headquartered in Washington, DC. It should start in the communities where the people recreate. 
From a historic perspective, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has contributed significantly to outdoor recreation. Through fiscal year 1995, a total of 37,300 projects had been approved to support the acquisition of open space for park land and the development of outdoor recreation facilities. The Federal share of $3.2 billion has been matched by State and local contributions, for 
a total investment of over $6.5 billion in local park and recreation. So when you take Federal matching with the State matching, you get two for the price of one. 
I think it also important to note from where the Federal share comes. It comes from OCS revenues; that is, off-shore oil and gas revenues. As a consequence, for those who are very sensitive about OCS drilling, I should point out that the revenue stream to provide the matching grants for the Federal share for land and water conservation comes specifically from OCS. If we do not have offshore oil and gas exploration, we are not going to have the money to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Last year, OCS revenues totaled over $3 billion. 
I believe, with advanced technology, we can safely pursue OCS activities off our shores and also provide a revenue stream for recreation through the Land and Water Conservation Act. The facts should not be lost on this body, the realization of just where these funds come from. 
Further, States have received over the years about 8,200 grants and counties some 4,800, while cities, towns, and other local agencies matched more than 24,000 grants. The facilities that the $6.5 billion investment has bought are those that are down your street, across your town, in the inner city, and virtually every nook and cranny of our country. The parks and facilities serve virtually every segment of the public. Millions of Americans have walked and jogged and picnicked, hiked, biked, fished, hunted, golfed, or played ball in at least one of these areas. These are the destination parks and facilities for families, campers, and hikers, areas where kids learn to play baseball, learn to swim, and really get an appreciation of nature. And those are the facilities in their neighborhoods and near their homes. 
Further, the statewide program is unquestionably one of the most successful programs established by Congress. The Americans for our Heritage and Recreation Coalition, consisting of a number of groups which banded together to seek reliable funding sources, concluded that the Land and Water Conservation Fund is `arguably the most important environmental program of this century' and that a reliable source of funding should be restored.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in campaigning for the Presidency of the United States, candidate Bill Clinton at the time stated: 
I will acquire new park lands and recreation areas with funds now available in the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund to increase opportunities for hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreation activities. 
Candidate Clinton said: 
I would increase funding for several programs. . . and reinvigorate the Land and Water Conservation Fund to make more funds available for the acquisition of public outdoor open spaces. 
And he also said: 
I would also make funds available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to help address critical infrastructure needs in State and local facilities. 
Unfortunately, I guess our President has overlooked it or was kidding because if you look at the administration's proposal for the stateside funding for the Land and Water Conservation Act which would address the critical needs in State and local facilities, there is a large zero. 
Secretary Babbitt, in May 1996, in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, is credited with stating that he is working on a proposal to take the Land and Water Conservation Fund off budget, so a full $1 billion a year can be spent on the parks. Reportedly, the Secretary said that the effort would not occur until the next year, meaning that it would be contingent on President Clinton's reelection. Well, it is now next year. President Clinton has been reelected. The administration, however, has been silent vis-a-vis the proposal for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
We have instead a proposal to use $315 million of the $700 million contained in the budget agreement for the purchase of the Headwaters Forest in California and a mine in Montana. We do not know an awful lot about the Headwaters Forest acquisition. We do know that the Headwaters Forest is 40 air miles from the nearest national forest. We know that access to the Headwaters Forest is extremely limited. We know that the agreement with the current landowner of the Headwaters Forest is contingent on a favorable ruling by the Internal Revenue Service. Getting a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service is a herculean effort, and I am not sure that the IRS knows how to basically spell the word `favorable,' but that is a subject for a statement for another day. The bottom line is that these projects have never ever been authorized by the appropriate committees of jurisdiction. No hearings, none whatsoever. No hearings have been held and no legislation has been introduced. This is from an administration that prides itself in the public process. Public process suggests legislation, suggests hearings, and action by the appropriate House and Senate committees. Neither of these have been proposed in the case of the acquisition of the area known as the Headwaters Forest in California or the area proposed for the mine purchase in Montana. 
This is very much like the recent land grab in the State of Utah. There was a process ongoing where the committees were discussing the merits of withdrawing 1.6 million acres of public land in Utah and putting that land in wilderness. While these discussions were occurring, the administration saw fit to invoke the Antiquities Act and, overnight, basically put this 1.6 million acres in Utah into wilderness over the objections of the Utah congressional delegation and Utah's Governor. The President's action occurred without any hearings, without any public process. And, ironically, the announcement came not in Utah but in front of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. 
Well, the media saw fit to not make an issue of it so not too many people in the United States reflected on the inconsistency between the President's promises and his actions. 
But, again, this is what is proposed in the budget agreement: the purchase of the Headwaters Forest in California and a mine in 
Montana--no hearings, no public participation in the process, simply an outright purchase. This is not the purpose of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
We do not know just what is their objection, relative to the procedure, but as the Senator who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the fact that the administration is circumventing the public process is certainly, in my opinion, inappropriate. 
What we do know is that the benefits derived from funding the stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund program are great. That is why we should take the $315 million and invest it in the State matching grant program because it will return over $630 million in benefits. 
Roger Kennedy, former Director of the National Park Service, perhaps put it best when he said,  
Without a doubt, the Land and Water Conservation Fund ranks highest among the most successful and significant conservation/recreation movements ever experienced in these United States. This State-driven program has resulted in much needed and highly beneficial public outdoor recreation opportunities for the benefits of all the people. More accessible park and recreation facilities have become a reality. 
and continue to become even a greater use and benefit to the Nation. 
Mr. President, it is very difficult to compare the relative value of expanding a wildlife refuge, say, in the Florida Keys, with the addition of acreage to a unique urban park such as the Presidio in San Francisco. It is difficult to compare the value of supplementing Federal holdings in Glacier National Park with a purchase of land, say, next to Gettysburg National Battlefield. But those are the types of decisions that are faced day-in and day-out by the Congress in determining priorities for funding under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
I, therefore, urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and those in the Senate to provide funding for the stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund Grant Program. In the absence of these grants, I fear local park and recreation services will fail to meet the ever-growing demands of the American public and the Federal Government will be asked to fill the void. It is a role the Federal Government cannot and should not play. The answer to this dilemma is simply the stateside matching grant of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Mr. President, I have already noted the action taken by the mayors of the Conference of Mayors in San Francisco relative to support of this program because it is so significant relative to community involvement and community responsibility. I urge my colleagues to reflect on that, as well as, again, on the statement from the Western Governors Council in support of this program. 
There is one other item I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues relative to action before this body. I ask unanimous consent, since no other Senator is seeking recognition, that I may speak for another 5 minutes on chemical weapons disposal.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to add another voice to this discussion, and another point that has not yet been addressed. In May of this year, I wrote a letter to Mr. Daniel Reifsnyder of the U.S. Department of State, transmitting my comments on the Draft Second U.S. Climate Action Report. In this letter, dated May 15, 1997, I reminded Mr. Reifsnyder that nuclear energy is responsible for 89 percent of all the carbon dioxide emissions avoided by U.S. electric utilities between 1973 and 1995 and that over 1.9 billion metric tons of carbon emissions have been avoided in the United States alone through the use of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy has made and can continue to make tremendous contributions in avoiding carbon emissions. Although the contributions of nuclear energy appear to have gotten little acknowledgment in the U.S. Climate Action Report, if we look at what is happening internationally, we see that other countries have not failed to take notice of the nuclear option. Specifically, France and Japan continue their reliance on nuclear energy for substantial percentages of their energy needs, and China has ambitious plans for developing its civilian nuclear program. The failure of this country to take a long term view and invest in nuclear research and development has the potential to damage not only our own civilian program, but our ability to observe and influence the programs of other nations.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from New Mexico regarding a section of the report accompanying the energy and water appropriations bill entitled `External Regulation.' This section addresses DOE's ongoing evaluation of the question of whether DOE's nuclear facilities should be subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I would like to clarify that this section of the report is intended to allow DOE to gather quantitative and qualitative information on external regulation to serve as guidance to the authorizing committees as they address this issue in the future.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I intended to offer an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that would have stricken the language that made it impossible for the Department to study alternatives to the methods we currently employ for disposing of chemical weapons. During the consideration of the Defense authorization bill last week, I offered an amendment to provide for a study. This amendment was readily accepted by the floor managers and was included in the final bill which the Senate passed overwhelmingly last Friday. Depending on the conclusions of the study, the taxpayers of this country could save somewhere between $3 and $5 billion. This is real money. Perhaps they could save much more in the cost of disposing of these chemical weapons. 
This was just a study. It did not mandate changes in the program at this time. It merely provided Congress with an opportunity to responsibly evaluate alternatives in the future. I think it is clear we need to take a fresh look at this program so we can responsibly evaluate whether safer and cheaper alternatives to the present system exist. 
In 1985, the Congress directed the Army to destroy our stockpile of obsolete chemical weapons. These are the nerve gases and the various other agents that are so deadly. The Senate took action and reiterated this commitment by ratifying the Chemical Weapons Treaty earlier this year, and we are in the process of disposing of those weapons. But the present system, I suggest, is not working the way it should. The present system is increasingly expensive, and a timeline for completion of the program is increasingly uncertain. 
If we look at the figures, according to the GAO, the 
program faces dramatically increasing costs. I am going to describe where these weapons are in a moment. The stockpile disposal program went from an initial estimate of $1.7 billion as the cost of disposing of these chemical weapons in 1985 to a current estimate of about $12.4 billion. So, as we begin to look at the cost of disposing of these weapons, why, the cost just simply goes out of sight. The nonstockpile program could cost an additional $15.1 billion and it is estimated now to take 40 years to complete. 
We have these weapons stored in various locations around the country. Clearly, we want to dispose of the weapons. But now they are telling us it is going to take 40 years to dispose of them. It is a hole out there we are going to pour money into for 40 years. The estimate is a minimum cost of over $27.5 billion. But, remember, that is up from what the original estimate was in 1985 of $1.7 billion. So we go from $1.7 to $12.4 to $15.1 to $27.5. And now we are talking about 40 years. 
These stockpiled munitions are, obviously, highly deadly. Their long-term viability is questionable. We simply cannot continue to postpone our responsibility to act on this program at this time. We have stockpiled munitions at nine sites, and here they are, Mr. President, with disposal facilities up and running at only two. The only two we have running are one out in the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Atoll, out there, about 600 miles south of Hawaii, and recently, Tooele in Utah is up and running. These facilities are costing well over $1 billion in Tooele, and the Johnston Island site is somewhere around $1.3 billion or thereabouts. 
It is interesting to note where we are. We are in Alabama, we are in Arkansas, we are in Colorado, we are in Maryland, we are in Kentucky, we are up here in Indiana, and, of course, we are in Umatilla, OR. Every State is sensitive, including the State of my friend, the Senator from Oregon. The reality is they want this removed from these various States where they exist. So the Department of Defense and the Pentagon and the appropriate committees have determined the best way to get rid of it is to build individual sites at each of the seven or eight--or actually potentially nine--sites, at a cost of over $1 billion, and, once the material is disposed of, that terminates the facility because it is not beneficial for anything else. 
However, it is interesting to note a couple of facts. In the Johnston Atoll, most of the material that is being incinerated there and disposed of came from NATO. It came from Europe. It was shipped across the ocean. Some of it came from Guam. That facility is functioning. It is underway. There is a prohibition about it taking any more. I can understand the sensitivity of the delegation from Hawaii, but, again, as we look at this catch-22 that we are in, I am just wondering, is it necessary that we build six new plants? Or, can we somehow look at some other alternatives? Is there a way to incinerate this at sea? We have built incinerating barges and facilities before quite successfully. Is there an advanced technology? What the Senator from Alaska has proposed is a study, a study to see if there is another and more beneficial return for the taxpayers of this country for the disposal of this weaponry. 
In Oregon we have the adjacent coastline. In Aberdeen--in several of these areas we are not too far from the water. But each is very concerned about shipping this material across another State to get it to a place where you can dispose of it. So we are in this round-robin here. Nobody wants the stuff. Everybody wants to get rid of it. Nobody wants it to cross their State line. Nobody wants to take any more. Nobody wants to accumulate it and reduce the cost. So we simply sit here and watch the costs go up to $27 billion, we watch the time extended to up to 40 years, and we are being irresponsible by not allowing a study. 
That is what my amendment would have done. It would have been to allow a study. However, because there is a prohibition even against a study, the conference and/or the committee itself is refusing to accept my amendment, which I can understand, given the sensitivity. I can understand how the process works around here. But I think we need to highlight how irresponsible we are in just ducking this issue and hoping that it will be resolved on somebody else's watch. 
We have stockpiled these munitions at nine sites. We cannot, by laws that we passed, transport these munitions. So, you know, the alternative is to build these sites at more than $1 billion each at the same time we continue to face permitting problems at every Federal site, every local level at the other seven sites, and a start date for construction seems to be extended on and on and on. The logic of the present disposal system really escapes me, and, as a consequence, I offered the amendment so we could take a rational look at what we are trying to accomplish with regard to this problem. 
This again, Mr. President, is just a study. But in order to take a rational look at the program, it is imperative that all aspects of the program be considered so we can best evaluate how to proceed. 
I hope the conferees on this bill will consider their 
responsibility and reconsider the Senate language which permits us an opportunity to take a second look. It does not demand that we do anything. It is not that we ship anything, not that we do not build these, it simply says, `Is there another, a better, a more efficient, cost-savings way?' I think there is. To suggest we are going to eliminate even the ability to take a look at this program, I think is terribly irresponsible on the part of those who bear the responsibility of addressing this, because this is just a study. What is the harm in looking at the problem? 
I had proposed striking the prohibition against the study. We could always ask the inspector general for a study, and probably will. But I did want to take an opportunity to present before the Members the reality. This is something we cannot hide. We cannot overlook this. We have a responsibility to address it. We are spending huge amounts of money, and the public should recognize just what our alternatives are and face up to the fact that this was created as a consequence of decisions made in the national defense interests of our Nation. We created this terrible nerve gas. I have seen the canisters it is in. I have seen how they dispose of it at Johnston Island and the manner in which it is taken into chambers where the explosive charge is removed, the gas is incinerated in one chamber in a closed cycle and the explosive material is taken in another chamber and incinerated. This was the development prototype. 
But, here we are today faced with the inability to even look at a better way of disposal because of the sensitivity of this issue and the concern, if you do a study and you find a better way, it might suggest you might have to move it, and, therefore, you would have to move it across another State, and they don't want that to happen. So leave it where it is, simply build the plants and get on with it and spend God knows how many billions of dollars in the process. 
So, you might say the Senator from Alaska is a little sensitive to the prohibition to even allow a study and an evaluation of a better way to meet our obligations to dispose of our chemical weapons. 
You might say, `What in the world is the Senator from Alaska doing in this area?' Under the responsibility as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have spent an awful lot of time on the merits of moving high-level nuclear waste across the United States at various sites over an extended period of time. Hundreds and hundreds of shipments have moved safely without incident. I am suggesting that we have the technology to move this lethal material to a place to dispose of it that is appropriate, even perhaps in a self-contained facility offshore that could contain the physical process of disposal at a much less cost. 
With that, Mr. President, I simply make an appeal to my colleagues to recognize the extent of our responsibility to successfully dispose of our chemical weapons that have accumulated over a long period of time in a manner that is most responsible to the taxpayers, as well as safe, by using American ingenuity and technology. 
Seeing no other Member on the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize and direct a land exchange which will greatly benefit the community of Sitka, AK. This bill will: ensure that an important water system now currently under an easement will be conveyed to the city of Sitka in order to provide its residents with an assured water supply into the future; provide for a spectacular inholding encompassing approximately 50 acres on Admiralty Island to be added to the Admiralty Island National Monument; extinguish a reversionary interest on land owned at Sitka by the Alaska Pulp Corp. In return for the extinguishment of the reversionary interest, the corporation will convey the 50-acre inholding on Admiralty Island to the Forest Service to be included in the monument, as well as the water system lands to the city of Sitka. 
Mr. President, Admiralty Island is an area with outstanding conservation values. The land exchange authorized in the bill I am sponsoring will ensure that this private inholding is included in the monument and in the wilderness area as appropriate. 
This exchange is supported by the city and borough of Sitka, and the city administrator has requested me to sponsor this legislation and expedite the exchange. 
This exchange is truly in the best interests of all involved. The U.S. Government even comes out ahead on value. Recent appraisals for the various lands and interests exchanged show that the Admiralty Island land is valued at more than the reversionary interest which will be exchanged. As a condition of my legislation, the corporation is required to waive its right to any compensation for this difference in value. 
In summary, as a result of this exchange the Admiralty Island Monument land ownership pattern will be consolidated, the city of Sitka will receive valuable lands in fee ownership on which parts of its water system are located, and the corporation will be free of a problematic reversionary interest in its property. As a bonus, the Federal Government realizes a net benefit in the value of the exchange. This is a sound deal in the best interests of all parties. 
It is my hope that this legislation can pass this body and the Congress in the near future.

The hearing will take place Wednesday, July 23, 1997, at 9:30 a.m. in room SD-366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, DC. 
The purpose of this hearing is to broadly examine three aspects of natural gas issues into the next century. Specifically, the committee will want to look at world energy supply and demand to 2015, what percentage of that will be filled by natural gas and how this could be impacted by other large scale energy projects, such as nuclear, that are being developed in Asia. Second would be to explore the role of Government in large scale gas projects in foreign countries, what type of assistance the U.S. companies competing for overseas projects receive from the U.S. Government and what can be done in the United States to make American gas more competitive worldwide. Third would be to examine the emerging technologies in gas field development that are making natural gas more economical to market.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, today is the first day of testimony in the Senate Governmental Affairs special investigation of the 1996 Federal election campaign contributions. There is, of course, but one purpose to this investigation. That purpose is to review campaign financing practices during the 1996 election to determine whether Federal laws were violated. 
I think it is fair to state that Federal campaign laws in question are relatively straightforward. 
It is illegal under U.S. election law for a noncitizen to contribute to campaigns; 
It is illegal for anyone to contribute to a campaign in someone else's name; 
And, it is illegal to solicit campaign funds on Federal property. 
Yesterday, at the opening of these hearings, Chairman Thompson announced exceedingly alarming evidence of violations of these Federal laws. The gravest of these violations is an alleged covert plan by the Chinese Government to subvert the 1996 United States election process. 
I note, Mr. President, that was headlined in the Washington Post this morning. 
The chairman indicated that the plan implemented a series of alleged illegal efforts by high members of the Chinese Government to influence United States policy by giving substantial sums of money. The intent had to be clear: To cultivate relations with the White House to influence foreign policy. 
Two key figures in the committee's investigation are John Huang of the Lippo Group and Charlie Trie, a Macao-based campaign fundraiser. Between Huang and Trie, nearly $4 million in questionable funds were raised. Over half of those funds have already been determined to be improper contributions and have appropriately been returned by the Democratic National Committee. 
This allegation goes to the very heart of the workings of our Government, and questions must be answered. 
First would be: What efforts were used by foreign nationals to influence U.S. policy? 
Second, to what extent was the U.S. political process infiltrated? 
Third, ultimately, was the United States compromised at any particular time? 
Additionally, these hearings will focus on the disturbing use of President Clinton's perquisites of the Presidency as a fundraising tool. 
Even though Federal law precludes campaign fundraising on Federal property, the committee has revealed the following information. 
During the 5 years that President Clinton has resided in the White House, an astonishing 938 guests have spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom. 
This figure is an unprecedented escalation of past Presidential practices. 
Presidential historian Richard Norton Smith stated that there has `never been anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of the White House for fundraising purposes * * * it's the selling of the White House.' 
On March 15, 1997, the White House counsel, Lanny Davies, stated, `It's fair to say these additional functions at the White House were for the purpose of encouraging support for the President's campaign, including financial support.' 
These overnight guests at the Clinton White House donated at least $6 million to the Democratic National Committee. 
Additionally, President Clinton hosted some 103 Presidential coffees. Guests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon and a Chinese businessman who heads an arms-trading company, donated some $27 million to the Democratic National Committee. 
White House officials have denied that such events were planned with the intention of raising specific amounts of money. However, President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes--who will testify before the committee--recently turned over a large number of documents that show figures for both expected and actual donations from nearly every White House coffee. 
Here's a comparison. President Bush hosted one Presidential coffee. No money was raised. And I am told the cost was $6.24 cents. 
The accuracy of that I will leave to the historians. 
But, finally, Mr. President, on March 11, 1997, this body voted unanimously to hold this investigation. 
I commend Chairman Thompson for his commitment to Congress and to the constitutional duty of the oversight process; that is, to provide the American people with a fair, unfiltered, and bipartisan view of the 1996 campaign practices. The American public deserve no less. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me explain very briefly the amendment that I put before the Senate. This amendment would direct the Department of Defense to conduct a study of alternatives to our present approach to chemical weapons disposal. Depending on the conclusion of this study and its evaluation, there is a potential savings to the taxpayer, somewhere in the area of $3 billion to $5 billion, and perhaps much more, in the costs of disposing of these weapons. 
The Chair might wonder why the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is interested and involved with this issue, and to what degree does he have expertise in this area that falls under the auspices of the Department of Defense and under the Defense authorization bill. The Chairman would respond, Madam President, by noting that, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I spend a great deal of time and energy in the area of nuclear waste and nuclear waste disposal and the transportation of nuclear waste. 
I might add that there has been moved globally about 25,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste throughout the world. We have, currently, in some 80 reactors in 31 sites in the United States, high-level nuclear waste that we are contemplating at some time moving to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. So I think the qualifications for a contribution to the area of disposing of chemical weapons is appropriate in the body of the amendment. This amendment simply calls for a study. It does not mandate changes in the program at this time, but will provide the Congress with an important and needed opportunity to responsibly evaluate alternatives to our chemical weapons disposal program in the future. 
Surprisingly enough, there is no authority to evaluate alternatives at this time for the Department of Defense. It was my hope this amendment would be accepted by the floor managers. 
I think it is noteworthy, Madam President, that prior to the Senate's ratification of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the United States did adopt the policy that we would dispose of our chemical weapons in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. As most of my colleagues know, the disposal process is now underway, but it is becoming clear that we cannot afford to continue this program as it is currently constructed because of the costs. 
According to the General Accounting Office, the costs of the stockpile disposal program have escalated seven-fold, from an initial estimate of $1.7 billion to a current estimate of $12.4 billion. The costs of the nonstockpile program, which consists of the location and destruction of chemical weapons ordinance that was disposed of through burial or other means in the past, could cost an additional $15.1 billion and take up to 40 years to complete. 
Well, that is a total of about $27.5 billion to dispose of our chemical weapons. However, the GAO indicates that both the costs and the disposal schedules are highly uncertain and that it will likely take more time and likely take more money to get this job done. 
Well, as a consequence of that dilemma, Madam President, I think the program needs a fresh look, a new comprehensive evaluation by the program managers in the Department of Defense. 
Today, we have stockpiled chemical weapons stored at 9 locations. On the chart on my right, one can see that we start out with the Johnston Atoll, an island in the Pacific, roughly 700 miles southwest of Hawaii. We have another in Tooele, UT. Umatilla, OR; Pueblo, CO; Pine Bluff, AR; Anniston, AL; Blue Grass, KY; Aberdeen, MD, and Newport, IN. 
The chemical consistencies of the weapons stored there are abbreviated here by GB, which is a sarin nerve agent, and HD, which is a mustard blister agent, and VX, which is a nerve gas agent. 
Now, I have had the opportunity to visit the facility at Johnston Island on two occasions in the last 3 years. The chemical weapons are stored in capsules that look like hundred pound bombs. And within the bomb itself, or the casing, we have two components. One is an agent that is separate and distinct from the other nerve gas agents, and there is a triggering mechanism. Of course, the chemical reaction takes place when the two are mixed, or the exterior shell is punctured or broken. It is rather revealing to contemplate the terrible consequences of this type of weaponry, Madam President. It was explained that these can be fired from a Howitzer in ground activity, exploding perhaps 300 or 400 feet in the air, and the mist of the vapors, upon contact with the skin, will take a life within 30 seconds. Now, when you see this stored, you come to grips with the reality of the devastation of this type of weaponry and the necessity of proper disposal. 
It is also important to recognize how it got there because this stuff wasn't made at Johnston Island. It was shipped there from Europe, and some was shipped from some of our bases in the Pacific. It was shipped under the observation of the Army Corps of Engineers. It was shipped safely and met the criteria for shipment, which was evaluated to ensure its safety. 
So it is important to keep in mind in this discussion that these weapons we are now disposing of at Johnston Island, for the most part, were weapons that were part of the NATO capability, shipped from Germany, and have been safely transported to Johnston Island and are under the process of being destroyed. 
Now, at Johnston island, we have this capability for weapons demilitarization and incineration. This complies, as it must, with all applicable environmental laws, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. It is a superbly safe, state-of-the-art facility. It is also very expensive. This plant cost approximately $1 billion. 
What they have there are chambers where they take these things that look like bombs with the chemical in them and they actually take, in parts, the Chamber--that is, the inner Chamber, remove that, and put it in an area where they are able to dispose, through heat, of the volatility of the particular chemical agent. The other part goes in another Chamber and is burned at a very high temperature in an enclosed cycle process. So there is nothing that gets into the atmosphere. 
Now, we have recently opened another $1 billion facility in Tooele, UT. The theory is that we are going to have to build some seven more of these plants, capable of disposing of this chemical waste at each of the locations where stockpiled chemical weapons are stored. So while we have operational facilities at Johnston Atoll and Tooele, UT, we are prepared to put in seven more at a billion dollars each, simply because we are prohibited from even considering shipping this to safe disposal sites already on line. 
As I said, we have a perfectly functioning facility on 
Johnston Island, which has been operational for a number of years. Should we move or even consider moving chemical weapons to Johnston Island and dispose of all of them in that plant we have already built? The answer clearly is no. There are objections from California and objections from Hawaii. Nobody wants this to happen in their own backyard. These States that have the chemical weapons stored are in kind of a catch-22. They don't want them there anymore. If they want to get rid of them, they have to build a plant at a cost of over a billion dollars, as opposed to the alternative of shipping them to one or two sites. 
Well, the answer to this $5 billion question is simple. Under current law, the Department of Defense cannot move chemical weapons across State lines. In fact, they can't even study the concept of transporting the munitions to an existing plant and thus build fewer plants. So if you look at the practicality of where we are, we are of one mind set. Reality: If we want to get rid of this stuff, we have to build seven plants rather than move the stuff because we have a law that prohibits us from moving these agents across State lines for disposal at one or two plants. 
In other words, the Department of Defense can't even think about saving money by having this process occur in just a couple of plants instead of--well, it would be a total of nine. My amendment is designed to allow the Department of Defense to study the transportation issue, as well as whatever other approaches might be available to help bring down program costs consistent with the safe disposal of these chemical weapons. 
My amendment does not repeal the provision in the 1995 defense authorization bill that prohibits the movement of chemical weapons munitions across the State lines. 
At this time, we are only seeking a study to identify and evaluate options. This study will assess lifecycle costs as well as risks. We are not moving beyond the study phase because I, for one, will await the results of the study before reaching any firm conclusions. 
But I have a hunch--and it is more than a hunch--that we can save money by reassessing this process. I am not suggesting it should go to any one place. But the reality is that we are designing a framework here for disposal in seven new additional sites which still need to be built. Given that we have two state of the art, fully operational facilities at Johnston Island and Tooele, UT, is it really necessary that we need to build seven additional sites? Or can we consolidate this process, perhaps with one site on the east coast and one site in the middle of the country? Our technical people have proven the competency of disposing of this, as we have had this process underway at Johnston Island and Tooele for some time. We seem to be so paranoid over the fact that we have this stuff and we are caught, if you will, in a dilemma of, well, if we want to get rid of it, we have to build a plant where it is stationed because nobody wants to see it moved across to someplace else where it can be disposed of. But nobody addresses what the experts tell us relative to the ability to move this stuff safely. We moved it safely from Germany to Johnston Island, it can be done and has been done. To suggest that we can't move it 400 or 500 miles by putting it in the type of containers that will alleviate virtually any exposure associated with an accident, I think, sells American technology and ingenuity short. We can move chemical weapons in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and we can save a lot of money by reducing the number of facilities that we are committed to build. 
So I urge the Senate to adopt my amendment. Again, I urge my colleagues to reflect on the reality that this amendment does not mandate any changes in the program. It will not mandate the movement of any chemical weapons from one place to another or remove the prohibitions to move weapons across State lines. It would merely allow the Department of Defense to study alternatives and report back to Congress by March 15, 1998. I know of the sensitivity of Members whose States are affected. But I ask them to consider the merits of a study to evaluate, indeed, whether we can move some of this to some places and reduce the number of facilities that we are going to build at a billion dollars a crack. What are we going to do with these facilities when the weapons have been deactivated and destroyed? We are going to destroy the facilities. I urge adoption of the amendment. 
Madam President, if I may, it is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment at the appropriate time. The floor managers can address it at their convenience.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation designed to end an impasse that we've endured for far too long--the stalemate over the Ward Valley low-level radioactive waste facility and efforts to implement an important Federal law--the low level radioactive waste policy amendments. 
I am doing this today because of documents that have recently come to light under the Freedom of Information Act and due to the continuing differences between the words spoken under oath by a Presidential nominee before my committee and his actions to date. 
For more than 10 years, the State of California acting in complete accordance with Federal law and in cooperation with responsible Federal agencies, has been attempting to open a low-level radioactive waste repository at a Mojave Desert site in Ward Valley. 
The long, tortured process costing more that $40 million has included a statewide search resulting in the selection of a virtually unpopulated desert valley; two environmental impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act; two biological opinions under the Endangered Species Act; and judicial review including the California Supreme Court. 
From the outset, the State has been dogged by the lawsuits and protests of a small fringe group of activists. 
But in the end, California has met every test. 
Ward Valley was found to be safe, and the State issued a license containing more than 130 carefully developed safety and environmental stipulations. 
Consistent with its own independent evaluations, the Department of the Interior agreed to sell the land to California for the Ward Valley site in January 1993. 
But shortly thereafter, the Department of the Interior abruptly reversed itself, demanding a series of discretionary studies and reviews that, 4 years later, still have no end in sight. 
Specifically, the Department of the Interior asked the National Academy of Sciences to review seven technical issues related to the site. 
In May 1995, the Academy's report was released. The report was highly favorable to the site selection and each of the seven issues. As a consequence, Interior Secretary Babbitt indicated that he intended to transfer the site. 
Two more months passed. 
On July 27, 1995, the President's nominee to be the Deputy Secretary of the Interior, Mr. John Garamendi, appeared before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and testified under oath, that the Ward Valley issue `will be satisfactorily culminated shortly * * * and I believe it should be.' 
With that testimony in mind, I recently reviewed documents made available under the Freedom of Information Act. 
With the benefit of those documents and other evidence of the systematic delay fostered by the Department of the Interior to block Ward Valley, I have reached the sad conclusion that Congress must intervene to end this stalemate. 
Before I go into the disturbing history of this issue and the content of the documents uncovered by the Freedom of Information Act request, some background is important. 
There is a tremendous difference between low level radioactive waste and the spent fuel issue the Senate has been debating over the past 2 weeks. 
Spent fuel, of course, is the high level waste from nuclear power reactors. 
Low level radioactive waste, on the other hand, is composed of items such as medical gowns, biomedical wastes, filters, resins and similar wastes generated from cancer treatment, biomedical research, and other activities. 
Low level radioactive waste is generated during cutting-edge research that may help us find a cure for AIDS. 
Low level radioactive waste is generated from the development of new drugs and cancer therapies. 
Low level radioactive waste is generated by the high tech and biotech industry in the quest for new products and services that will be at the foundation of our 21st century economy. 
While it also includes waste from nuclear power production, Congress wisely placed specific limits on the levels which are a State responsibility. 
When the Senate was debating the fate of high-level spent fuel, we clearly had a situation where the State of Nevada opposed a repository. The Governor of Nevada opposed it. 
But the low level waste issue is vastly different. Governor Wilson of California supports Ward Valley. 
The State of California has been working on plans open a low level waste repository in California for the past decade. 
They have done so in complete accordance with Federal law, which assigns responsibility for disposal of a specified portion of low level radioactive waste to the States. 
Governor Wilson understands that thousands of jobs in California, particularly among the high-tech and biotech industries, absolutely depend on having dependable access to a safe, secure facility for low level radioactive waste. 
Governor Wilson understands that countless lives might be saved through the cancer breakthrough or AIDS cure that the use of radioactive materials might bring. 
Governor Wilson also understands that low level radioactive waste is currently being stored at hundreds of urban locations all across California. 
It's being stored in basements and in parking lot trailers. 
It's being stored in warehouses and temporary shelters. 
It's on college campuses, in residential neighborhoods, and in hospitals. 
And as long as the waste is in these temporary locations in populated areas, it is subject to accidental radioactive releases from fire, earthquakes, and floods. 
Governor Wilson is understandably concerned about the health and safety of Californians. He is frustrated by the delays California has faced in trying to get this facility open. 
So am I. 
I am frustrated by the fact that the President's nominee to be the Deputy Secretary of the Interior, Mr. John Garamendi, appeared before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on July 27, 1995 and testified under oath, that the Ward Valley issue should and would be quickly resolved. 
After that testimony, seven months passed. 
Nothing happened. 
On February 15, 1996, Deputy Secretary Garamendi indicated that `new information' related to a different low-level radioactive waste site at Beatty, Nevada, 
required further testing at the Ward Valley site and the preparation of yet another Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). 
Literally one day before his announcement, the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey said that linkages between the Beatty site and Ward Valley were `too tenuous to have much scientific value.' 
But the Deputy Secretary ignored the Director's scientific advice. In a public news conference, Deputy Secretary Garimendi indicated that the additional testing would take about four months, and that the preparation of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) would take about a year. 
On August 5, 1996, months after we expected the testing to be complete, an official of the lab Interior selected to perform the testing said, `Interior Department officials have yet to submit a work plan . . . on the testing they want done.' 
During this same time frame, Interior Department officials were distributing documents to the public containing factually incorrect information taken verbatim from Ward Valley opponents, even though accurate information was readily available from the Department of Energy. 
It now appears that Interior made no effort to check the facts with DOE with respect to the veracity of the information it was providing to the public. 
Recently, the Governor of California made me aware of documents he obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These documents reveal the following: 
Despite the understandable lack of radiological expertise resident in the Department of the Interior, the Department has made no effort to communicate with the federal agency with primary expertise and jurisdiction in the matter--the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The professional, non-political, radiological experts of the Department of Energy have indicated that: `Interior's concern that the [Ward Valley] facility lacks an environmental monitoring system has no basis in fact;' the Department of the Interior is attempting to subvert the National Academy of Sciences recommendations with respect to the timing of the tests and nature of the tests to be performed; the Department of the Interior has understated the costs and the time required for the conduct of the tests; and 
the tests the Department of the Interior has outlined will result in additional litigation regardless of their outcome. 
Mr. President, these documents are plain on their face. 
But they are particularly troubling since they show the vast difference between the words spoken by Mr. Garamendi in his confirmation hearing, and the actions he has taken since his confirmation. 
Let's again review the facts: 
Deputy Secretary Garamendi testified under oath that the Ward Valley issue would be, and should be, quickly resolved. 
He then called for additional testing that did not conform to the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences, creating a false linkage in the public's mind between the Beatty site and the Ward Valley site, despite the fact that his own USGS Director said that such a linkage could not be justified by the science. 
Deputy Secretary Garamendi spread misinformation about the composition of the radioactive waste stream in Department press materials supplied by project opponents, making no effort to check their veracity with the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or any other agency with expertise in such matters. 
Deputy Secretary Garamendi persistently failed to get the testing underway, which he later blamed on the threats of a lawsuit that were not, in fact, made until long after the time he said the tests would be complete. 
Indeed, the Department of the Interior has designed a process specifically intended to foster further delay. 
Mr. President, over the past month or so there has been a new twist that is frankly the straw that breaks the camel's back. 
The State of California, in its continuing efforts to achieve a compromise, has agreed to perform additional testing pursuant to the National Academy of Sciences guidelines prior to the federal land transfer. 
Let me make this clear: California has always agreed to do the additional testing . . . the issue of dispute is that Interior insisted the testing be done prior to the land transfer, while California and the National Academy of Sciences said the testing would be best accomplished after the land transfer. 
So California has now agreed to perform additional testing prior to the land transfer. They have clearly made efforts to compromise. 
I received a letter from Deputy Secretary Garamendi, dated February 27, 1997, which exclaimed that the delays at Ward Valley have gone on long enough, and that welcomed the decision by the State of California to undertake additional testing. 
When I saw that letter. I thought to myself: Finally, this issue will be resolved. 
I was shocked by what happened next: 
The BLM produced an administrative determination, allegedly two years old that nobody had ever seen, that will not permit California to undertake the testing that Interior insists must be undertaken prior to the land transfer! They have California in a `Catch-22.' 
BLM informed the California Department of Health Services that they could not proceed with the testing without a new permit from the BLM and yet another biological consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with respect to the Desert Tortoise. 
The BLM based this requirement for a new permit on an `administrative determination,' allegedly issued two years ago, which limits surface disturbance associated with pre-construction testing. But further examination revealed several points about this document: 
This old administrative determination was unknown to the California Department of Health Services, U.S. Ecology, and even the local BLM District Office until weeks ago. 
The local BLM office is unable to provide any evidence that this `administrative determination' was provided to any of the parties whose actions it supposedly limits. 
The administrative determination is absurd on its face. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the 90 acres of surface disturbance associated with the construction and operation of the Ward Valley facility will not jeopardize the desert tortoise or its habitat. Moreover, under current BLM guidelines, ten acre mining operations on other BLM land would not trigger the need for a biological consultation if certain desert tortoise protection measures were incorporated into the plan submitted to BLM. Indeed, five acre mining operations would not even require the applicant to submit a tortoise protection plan for approval. Yet, it is BLM's sudden contention that less than 5 acres of surface disturbance associated with testing will require yet another full biological consultation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Clearly, Mr. President, this latest obstruction, and the reasons cited for it, make no sense in the context of the various other permits and administrative determinations that have been previously granted at the site. 
The fact that this administrative decision suddenly surfaced in the midst of state planning to undertake the new tests is highly unusual--perhaps even worthy of investigation by the Inspector General. 
Mr. President, earlier this year I asked the General Accounting Office to investigate this matter. That investigation is now underway. At this very moment, GAO auditors are reviewing documents in the District BLM office in California and at Department of Interior headquarters here in Washington. 
The GAO report will not be complete until July 15, but let me simply say that their preliminary findings appear to agree with my understanding of the facts. 
What we are seeing at the Department of the Interior is a blatant display of bad faith and obstructionism with regard to California's efforts to implement Federal law through development of the Ward Valley site. 
I am particularly distressed by this, particularly in light of the words spoken by Mr. Garamendi at his confirmation hearing. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would convey the BLM land at Ward Valley to California as soon as a check for the fair market value of the land plus $100 is tendered to the Secretary of the Treasury, after the State of California formally tenders a promise to conduct the additional testing as outlined by the National Academy of Sciences. 
It's a simple bill. California agrees to do the testing outlined by the National Academy of Sciences, California gets its site, and the taxpayer gets fair market value for the land. 
I am willing to consider alternative approaches, but my bottom line is a quick and satisfactory resolution to this issue by qualified experts rather than political activists. 
I am willing to entertain negotiated compromises. 
I am willing to entertain alternative legislative approaches. 
I am not willing to entertain further delay. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me share a story that I find particularly rich in irony: 
Interior Secretary Babbitt, while the Governor of Arizona, was deeply concerned about the difficulty of the Federal Government to provide for adequate low-level radioactive waste disposal sites. He was asked by the National Governors' Association to chair a task force to look into the problem. 
The Babbitt task force recommended that the responsibility for low-level radioactive waste management be given to the States. In 1981, Governor Babbitt wrote that `the siting of a low level nuclear waste facility involves primarily state and local issues that are best resolved at the government level closest to those affected.' 
There was another Governor at the time who was active in the National Governor's Association and supported this approach: The Governor of Arkansas. His name was Bill Clinton. 
Congress listened to these Governors, and passed the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act which gave the States the responsibility for low level radioactive waste management. 
California is the first State to license a facility under the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. 
And who are the Federal authorities who are today frustrating California's attempt to follow the law and open its site? 
None other than Mr. Babbitt and his Deputy at the Department of the Interior, himself a former California state official. 
What an irony that former State officials would declare a State unworthy of trust in carrying out its congressionally assigned duties and responsibilities. 
What a difference a few years in Washington can make.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I offer a very simple bill with the hope that it can receive expedited consideration in the Senate and be sent over to the House of Representatives for further consideration. 
Last year Congress authorized a program to explore the feasibility of integrating hydrogen fuel cells with systems to produce hydrogen from photovoltaic production or solid waste through gasification or steam reforming. This program is outlined in title II of Public Law 104-271, the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. 
The program was originally authorized through 1997 and 1998, with funds to remain available until 1999. 
It has since become clear that the program will require a longer period of time to put into place. Accordingly, this bill simply extends the authorization through fiscal year 2001, with funds to remain available until September 30, 2002. 
For those who are unfamiliar with the promise of hydrogen energy systems, let me simply add that hydrogen is widely regarded as an important potential energy carrier with the potential to join electricity as a key component of a future sustainable energy system. Unlike coal, oil, or gas, hydrogen cannot be directly mined or produced--it must be extracted from hydrogen-rich materials such as natural gas, biomass, or even water. While there are significant technical and economic barriers that prevent the near-term, widespread use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, the eventual promise of hydrogen is compelling. Thus, Congress and the Department of Energy has placed a high priority on hydrogen energy research and development. 
I urge that my colleagues support the bill.

This legislation makes technical changes to both the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA]. Most of the provisions are similar to those contained in H.R. 2505 passed by the House last year. These changes are the direct result of more than three days of hearings consisting of 14 panels and more than 155 witnesses, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held throughout Alaska during the last Congress.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield myself the balance of the time on our side. 
Mr. President, is there any question about whether this is a tax increase or not? Let's recognize what the Joint Tax Committee has said. They said it is a tax increase. It raises $686 million. If that isn't a tax increase, I don't know what is. What we have here, Mr. President, is not a new proposal, but a punitive proposal that was offered earlier this year and rejected by the Finance Committee, rejected by the House Ways and Means Committee, and it should be rejected by the full Senate. 
When you strip away all the rhetoric, this issue boils down to whether or not we are going to place a $700 million tax increase on the domestic mining industry. This proposal, as it stands, will speed up the departure of the mining industry from our shores. 
Let's look at this chart briefly. It shows what is happening with employment in the mining industry for metal, iron ore and copper. Let's look a little more closely at metal mining, which includes gold, silver, lead, and zinc from 1980 to 1995. In 1980 there were 98,000 jobs; by 1995 that had dropped to 51,000 jobs. In copper, it went from 30,000 jobs in 1980 to 15,000 in 1995. These numbers show what is happening to the mining industry in this country. What will happen if we place an additional $700 million in tax burden on them? They have to sell their gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc at the world prevailing price, not the price in the United States. So where are the good-paying jobs going to go? They are going to go to Canada, Latin America, and Indonesia. 
We pride ourselves on cutting taxes and yet this amendment would throw a $700 million tax increase at the American mining industry. That is what the Bumpers amendment would do. It adds $700 million to the cost of producing minerals in the United States. Every Member of this body can figure out for themselves what effect this would have on the American mining industry. If you can't produce your product for a profit, for the price that is offered, you are out of business, that is what happens. 
Finally, Mr. President, let's make no mistake about it, this amendment is not about depletion on lands obtained under the Mining Act of 1872. The amendment is about the law itself. This is just an overt attempt to gain negotiating leverage on the industry. The U.S. mining industry agrees with Senator Bumpers, as do I, that this law is long overdue for overhaul. Let's sit down with the administration and reform the 1872 mining law, but let's not impose a punitive $700 million tax on the industry merely to gain negotiating leverage at the bargaining table. As a consequence, I urge my colleagues to oppose this punitive tax and vote against waiving the Budget Act. 
Mr. President, at the conclusion, I am going to raise a point of order that the amendment is not germane under section 305 (b)(2) of the Budget Act.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the tax cut bull that forms the heart of the second reconciliation bill. 
I want to take this opportunity to commend the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, for their efforts in ensuring that the Finance Committee's bill was reported with strong bipartisan support. I hope the spirit of bipartisanship that permeated the committee's work will extend to our debate on the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, during this past week, we considered the first budget reconciliation bill which was designed to slow the growth of Federal spending and to stop the hemorrhaging of the Medicare Program. And we successfully achieved both goals while at the same time making a commitment to boost funding by $16 billion to enable more children in America to obtain health insurance. 
The tax bill we are considering today builds on that achievement by earmarking $8 billion from increased tobacco taxes for expanded children's health insurance. With this unprecedented $24 billion commitment of funds for children's health insurance, I believe the Senate has made an investment in the health of the children of America that should alleviate the anxieties and fears of millions of parents about paying for the health care of their children. 
What is even more remarkable about the reconciliation bills we are considering this week is that at the end of the process, we will have set this Government on course to finally achieve a balanced budget. While I believe the tax cuts contained in this bill provide much needed financial relief for the vast majority of working Americans, I believe our greatest achievement is balancing the budget. 
What that means is that when this agreement is fully implemented in 5 years, the Federal Government will no longer have to borrow to keep this Government operating. Most importantly, the balanced budget will give us the opportunity to finally begin paying down our enormous $5-plus trillion national debt. 
Mr. President, on Monday, the world's financial markets were reminded of the enormity of the American Government's debt and the impact that debt has on the global marketplace. When Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto suggested that he was tempted to sell off portions of Japan's American debt portfolio to stabilize the yen/dollar exchange rate, markets plummeted throughout the world. On Wall Street, we saw the Dow Jones average drop 192 points, the second largest point decline in exchange history. 
Although markets recovered after Japan's Finance Minister dismissed the idea that Japan would dump it's Treasury securities, the lesson is unmistakable. The security of our economy can never be assured so long as this country continues to run deficits and pile up billions in additional debt. As long as we must turn to world markets to finance Government spending, our economy's health is always in danger of being held hostage to the political whims of foreign governments and speculators. 
That is why it is so important that we balance the budget and begin to pay down the debt. And that is why these reconciliations bills are vital to our Nation's economic security. 
Mr. President, the tax bill before us provides much-needed relief for the hard-working middle-income families who have not seen their tax burden reduced in 16 years. Despite what some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may allege about this tax bill, the lion's share of the income tax cuts--81 percent--will go to families earning between $12,000 and $62,000. 
This bipartisan bill will reduce the taxes paid by every low- and middle-income family with a child by $500. For a family with three children under 13, their tax burden will be reduced by $1,500. That's $1,500 that the family will have available to pay off bills, buy clothing for their children or spend as they see fit. 
A provision in the bill requires families with children between the ages of 13 and 17 to invest their $500 children's tax credit in an educational savings account. While I think it is important that we do as much as we can to encourage families to save for college, I think it is inappropriate for us to require families to establish these accounts. I will support an amendment that will debate this provision from the bill. 
The bill also provides more than $30 million in tax relief for families that are facing enormous college education bills. And it encourages economic growth and savings by reducing the capital gains tax and expanding individual retirement accounts. 
I also applaud the changes the committee made to the estate tax, with the goal that family businesses should be kept together rather than split apart in order to pay estate taxes. In fact, Mr. President, it is my hope that we can fundamentally change, if not eliminate, the estate tax with what can only be called confiscatory tax rates. Although we have not been able to achieve that result in this bill, I think that should be one of our goals when we consider fundamental tax reform in the future. 
Mr. President, the items I have just noted represent the highlights of the bill. What is again worth mentioning is how we were able to craft this bill. We did it with input and good debate between Republicans and Democrats on the committee. There was no rancor. We were not partisan, we tried to work within the confines of the budget agreement negotiated by our leadership with the White House. 
I would hope that that spirit of bipartisanship will continue as we debate this bill since I think we can all agree that the goal of providing tax relief for hard-working Americans and encouraging savings and investment are in the best long-term interests of our Nation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. With reluctance, I ask support of this amendment, and obviously it has been done. But I want to make the point that the provision in the current bill is one that we have all committed to, and that is of having the strategic petroleum reserve and the reality that we are addressing it with the crisis on the budget. That is not the purpose. The Akaka amendment provided a purchase mechanism after 2002. 
I think it is the right policy for this Nation, and we are only talking about $13 million a year. I think that is a small price to pay for energy security, but nevertheless recognizing the circumstances, why, I reluctantly ask support.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I have listened to my good friend from Arkansas embellish one of his favorite subjects, and that, of course, is the American mining industry as we know it today. 
I think it is fair to say that we have had, with the minority, a continuing, ongoing effort to try and bring about changes in our mining law--meaningful changes that are supported by the industry, meaningful changes that are supported by the minority. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to generate a resolve of many of these issues. But I think it is fair to say that the attack today proposed by my friend from Arkansas is not just an attack on the percentage depletion allowance, but, in reality, it is an attack on the American mining industry as we know it today. 
Now, I don't know about my friend from Arkansas coming over here, but I didn't run into anybody in the Halls. I didn't run into any lobbyists. Nobody has talked to me. I venture to say that if you walk out now, you won't run into any either. 
What we are looking at here is a matter of equity for an industry that is very important to our Nation, to our security interests, who must compete in a worldwide marketplace. We are either competitive or we are not. 
For the information of my friend from Arkansas, the value, in 1995, of the combined contribution of the mineral industry to Arkansas was $744 million. So when he says `they don't pay one red cent,' well, they contributed $744 million to the economy of Arkansas. In Alabama, it is $2 billion; in Arizona, it is $9 billion; in Texas, it is $7 billion; in New York, it is $8.3 billion. So when you say they don't pay anything, let's look at the working men and women in the mining industry today, and let's look a little more closely at reality. 
What is proposed by my friend from Arkansas--and he is right, it is a punative proposal, as he has been working at it for 9 years and he is committed until the day he leaves to work on it. I admire that spirit. But he is not telling you the whole story. There was a proposal by the administration earlier this year to do away with percentage depletion for this industry. And the important thing, Mr. President--and I would like my friend from Arkansas to acknowledge the reality of it--it was rejected by both the Finance Committee in the Senate and the House Ways and Means Committee, and it should also be rejected by the full Senate. 
When you strip away the rhetoric--and there is lots of it around here--on this matter, the issue boils down to one simple question: whether this body wants to go on record now in support of a nearly $700 million tax increase on the domestic mining industry. We talk about tax bills, we talk about tax breaks, we talk about stimulating how much more earnings the average family member can make and take home and save. But this proposal by my friend from Arkansas would tax America's mining industry an additional $700 million--and this is a domestic industry, mind you. Well, I think it is fair to say--and I think most of you would agree--that the Treasury will never see anywhere near $700 million from this proposal, because this latest assault on the industry will simply speed up one thing--the departure of the mining industry from our shores. 
This is a worldwide market. You compete or you don't compete. Now, the continuing decline of this industry is reflected on the chart I have on my left. As my colleagues can see, jobs in this industry have been declining dramatically. Let's look at it. Metals make up the gold, silver, lead, and zinc production. The others are in iron ore and copper. In 1980, we had 98,000 jobs; today, we have 51,000 jobs. This is the gold, silver, lead, and zinc. That is not to assume we are not using as much gold, silver, lead, and zinc. We are. We are importing it from other countries. Why? Because we are not as competitive in the world marketplace. 
Iron ore. In 1980, we had 21,000 workers. In 1995, we had 9,000. Where has the industry gone? It has gone to South America, South Africa. That is the reality we live under. Now, does my friend simply want to tax this industry another $700 million and drive it offshore? That is what is going to happen, make no mistake about it. 
The copper industry. In 1980, 30,000 jobs; today, 15,000 jobs in the United States 
It isn't that we don't have the minerals. We are not competitive in an international marketplace. My friend from Arkansas simply ignores that reality. He never mentions it. It is always they are getting a free ride. He doesn't mention the jobs that are created in each State or the contribution associated with what that prosperity means to the families. 
I think it is important to point these things out. These are accurate figures. This is the condition of the industry today. It competes worldwide. The jobs, Mr. President, that have disappeared are good-paying jobs. Make no mistake about it, these are not the MacDonalds minimum-wage jobs. The average yearly wage for miners is nearly $46,000, one of the highest wage levels of any segment of America's workers. That doesn't include the benefits provided for these workers. 
What does the Senator from Arkansas propose to do with these workers if you tax the industry that much more? Are these people going to be retrained? They are going to be out of a job. They are going to be on welfare. You know where these jobs are going to go. They are going to go to Latin America, Canada, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Central Asia. 
For example, gold mining exploration budgets have been dipping in the United States from a high of $149 million in 1992 to $120 million in 1996. But at the same time spending in Central and South America has increased more than five times--from $28 million in 1992 to $145 million last year. These are investments that could have and should have been made in the United States but for the hostile environment that this industry, which is a basic industry in the United States, faces at home. 
If this tax increase is approved, we will merely hasten the further decline of this domestic industry, for instead of using capital to invest in exploration and development in new sites in the United States, the mining industry will be forced to abandon new projects at home. It will have to close marginally profitable mines with the loss of hundreds, if not thousands of permanent good-paying jobs. 
Mr. President, the underlying predicate of this amendment, I think, is fatally flawed for it assumes that mining operations on Federal lands are cost-free. That is what my friend from Arkansas said. He said `not one red cent' did they pay for it. Nothing is further from the truth. Mining operations on Federal lands are not cost-free. It is a myth that patenting of land under the Mining Act of 1872 is somehow an easy event; that it simply is as easy perhaps as going out and writing a check to the Federal Government. That is not reality. 
The reality is that the exploration process leading to the discovery of valuable mineral deposits can cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars per claim just for the drilling, the sampling, and the expense associated with proving up that claim. 
I also note that in some cases mineral patent applications can contain as many as 500 claims per application, and the cost of processing a single claim can run $35,000 to $40,000 to $45,000. Multiply that by 400 or 500 claims. What do you have? You have $19 million in costs merely for processing claims. So when the Senator from Arkansas says they are not `paying one red cent,' that is not reality. 
Moreover, the time required to explore land and permit it before mining begins has increased dramatically, with a concomitant increase in the cost of mining. The average time for simply permitting new mines, as my friend from Arkansas is well aware, on Federal land has increased from 1 year to 3 to 5 years. And over the course of the last 4 years it has averaged close to 5 years. 
Where is it going to be in another few years? At some point in time you are going to overload this. They are not going to be competitive in the domestic market. Where are they going? They will go where they have to go to survive, and that unfortunately is outside the United States. 
Once the companies have passed all of the hurdles, a company 
then faces the daunting capital costs that are associated with bringing a modern mine on line. 
This isn't like the chicken industry. This is an industry that is volatile relative to costs. Costs are not necessarily controllable in the mining industry because you run into different types of production exposure. Some of it is very, very deep. Some of it can have water in the mines. There are many, many unknowns associated with that. And the biggest risk is that you develop a mine and you have no assurance that your price is going to stay stable. The price fluctuates dramatically. But you have made a tremendous capital investment, and you are risking this capital relative to your belief that you can operate an efficient mine, an efficient operation, and control costs. But the unknowns are very, very high. 
In my own State, we recently opened a mine called the Fort Knox Mine which began operations outside Fairbanks. The company invested nearly $375 million in capital before a single ounce of gold had been mined, or refined, on that project. 
So they don't pay a red cent. They put up $375 million in advance on the supposition that they would be able to generate a reasonable return. Now the price of gold has dropped to a point where their margins are within a couple of dollars. That is the reality associated with that kind of a business. 
I think my colleagues will agree that there is no free ride when it comes to the cost of exploration, acquisition, development, and processing in the industry--whether on Federal or private land. Yet, the amendment before us assumes little or no costs to the industry when mining on Federal land. 
Mr. President, the rationale for the percentage depletion allowance is it recognizes the unique nature of resource depletion by providing a realistic and practical method for the creation of funding necessary to replace the diminished resource. 
Moreover, percentage depletion reflects reality. This is a reality unlike in the chicken business. It is a reality that when the mines are exhausted, the companies must replace the depleted deposits of mineral resources, which are more difficult and in many cases more expensive to develop. These new deposits, because of lower grade ores, could create more difficulty in mining and development. They could be more expensive to operate. 
So where do you go after you deplete your mine and when the economics are that you can't generate a recovery? You go find a new one to stay in business, and hopefully it will be of the quality of the last one. But you have no guarantee. 
Hence, the justification for the percentage depletion allowance, as it responds to the unique nature of mineral deposits, provides for realistic and practical methods of reflecting the decreasing value of a mine as the mine is depleted. That is what it is all about. It helps companies maintain the capital necessary to make future investments for replacement of mineral resources. 
I would also note that minerals are commodities whose prices are set, as I said, by the world marketplace. With an increase in mining costs with the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance, what are you going to do? You can't pass it on to the purchasers in the form of higher selling prices. You either absorb it and take a loss and ultimately if your losses are too high, you go out of business. 
Mr. President, I would also point out that mining companies commonly package mining rights from a variety of sources into a single operation. For example, a large open-pit mining operation may include private property acquired through homestead laws, patent and mining claims, unpatented claims, States lands, and so forth. 
The repeal of percentage depletion--as proposed by my friend from Arkansas--from those mining rights which originate with the mining law of 1872 would require a complex system, so complex that we would have to track every single shovel of ore on the mining site. In other words, some of it would be from lands that originated through private property, homestead laws, unpatented 
claims, State lands. How do you sort that out? What will likely be the result is that the depletion allowance would apply to a shovel of ore from one location but not a shovel of ore from an identical ore body 10 feet away. 
That is simply absurd. But that is the solution that is suggested in this amendment. 
Mr. President, I think there is no doubt that percentage depletion for minerals in mines on Federal lands is clearly appropriate tax policy. But I would suggest to all of my colleagues that this amendment is not about depletion on lands obtained under the Mining Act of 1872. As I indicated in my opening statement, this amendment is about the act itself. This is really just another attempt to gain leverage on the industry by attacking the depletion allowance. 
Remember, Mr. President, by adopting the proposal in the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, we would be going on record as supporting nearly a $700 million tax increase on America's domestic mining industry. 
I can categorically state, Mr. President, that the U.S. mining industry agrees, they agree with the Senator from Arkansas, that the mining law of 1872 is substantially due for an overhaul. And we have passed reforms, ultimately to see them vetoed by the President. But I continue to work to see that this law is reformed. I continue to work with my friend from Arkansas and my colleagues on the other side to accomplish such a result, and we have been doing it for the last several years. The industry has supported the concept of a 5-percent net proceeds royalty, a fair market value for land--a fair market value for land--a permanent maintenance fee, and the earmarking of revenues generated from mineral production on Federal lands to create and fund abandoned mines and cleanup programs. 
These are the things that are mentioned by my friend from Arkansas. He is concerned about abandoned claims and the cleanup. We provide for that in our proposed legislation. The Senator from Arkansas makes quite a point of the wide variance in royalties. What he doesn't point out is that the royalty agreements on private lands are just that. They are agreements. Those agreements are made between two parties. The determination of what the costs are to be allocated out is something that the Senator from Arkansas doesn't look into. He just simply says, `Well, there is a 10-percent royalty here. There is an 11-percent royalty here. And the 5-percent royalty is not applicable.' You have to go into what the royalty consists of. A 5-percent net proceeds royalty is fair. It is one that I support. A number of my colleagues basically support substantial changes in the 1872 mining law which we are attempting to address and hope to have before this body yet this year. 
There are a couple of other interesting things, Mr. President. The administration has never sought to develop compromise legislation that reforms the 1872 law while offering the U.S. mining industry the economic ability to develop Federal mineral assets. That is a fact. This amendment, as with the administration's identical budget proposal, is clearly designed to bring the industry to its knees by putting a $700 million tax on the industry. Remember, as we reflect on the merits, that this matter has been studied and gone into in great detail by both the House and the Senate--the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. Both have said, no, this increased tax on the mining industry of $700 million is not justifiable. 
So it is acknowledged we want to overhaul the 1872 mining law, but that is not what we are debating today. 
What we are debating today in this amendment is an amendment that would simply kill the domestic mining industry in this country, make no mistake about it. As you look at the merits of an adequate royalty, it has to be based on consideration of comparisons that are real. Just what is the negotiated in and out of a higher royalty figure does not necessarily represent the return to the Government agency. This is modeled exactly after the royalty program that is currently operating in one of the most prosperous States for mining, and that is the State of Nevada. 
My colleagues from Nevada I see are on the floor. I am sure that they will point that out. 
So, in conclusion, let us recognize where we are on this. This is a $700 million tax proposal on our mining industry, our domestic industry. 
One final point I would like to bring up is the matter of germaneness. This amendment is not germane. This amendment does not belong on this bill. At the appropriate time a point of order will be made. I urge my colleagues not to support a waiver of the point of order. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the utility industry is undergoing drastic change as a result of deregulation. 
I know that municipal utilities are concerned about the tax-exempt status of their outstanding debt if they enter the competitive market. I also know that investor-owned utilities are concerned about municipal utilities using their tax-exempt debt and their tax-exempt status to gain an unfair competitive advantage. In addition, there are a host of issues relating to how electric cooperatives will fare in the emerging competitive marketplace. 
I believe that we need to re-examine the Tax Code to determine how best to ensure a level playing field in the era of electricity deregulation and competition. 
Because of the importance of this issue to consumers, investors, the electric power industry, and to our economy, as I told Treasury Secretary Rubin in an April 22 letter, I believe this is a matter for Congress, not the IRS, to decide.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues that 20 years ago today, a truly historic event occurred in my State of Alaska that had much to do with the shaping of the character of our State probably as much as the majestic and unique parts of our State, whether it be in the mountains or glaciers. 
On June 20, 1977, at 10:06 a.m. at Prudhoe Bay, AK, the crude oil discovered on the North Slope 9 years earlier began to flow. It began its journey south some 800 miles to the ice-free port of Valdez through the Trans-Alaska pipeline. That first trip, which now takes about 5 days for the oil to move, took over 1 month to complete and marked the culmination of the largest private construction project ever undertaken in the history of North America. 
Since that time, every citizen has benefited from this marvel of American engineering, but few really understand how significant this feat was and how much it has contributed to our Nation. The pipeline took 3 years of construction. 
The total cost was about $8 billion. The initial estimate was just under $1 billion. However, in today's dollars, that would equate to about $22 to $25 billion. It was truly a marvel, one of the engineering wonders of the world. It took 2,215 State and Federal permits to proceed. Today, it is estimated to take over 5,000. Approximately 70,000 people were used as a work force; over 3 million tons of materials were shipped to Alaska for construction; 73 million cubic yards of gravel were used; 13 bridges, ranging from 177 feet to 2,295 feet had to be constructed going across the Yukon River; 834 rivers were crossed; three mountain ranges as well. 
Since that time, Mr. President, that pipeline has been subject to earthquakes, it has been subject to bombing, dynamite has been wrapped around it, it has been shot at so many times too numerous to count--but it has withstood those rigors of Mother Nature as well as mankind. 
While there was a terrible accident associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, which was of course due to negligence on behalf of those who were operating that vessel, the Prince William Sound is cleaned up today, and it is continuing its contributions as one of the most productive bodies of water on Earth. From the standpoint of the renewability of the fisheries and marine resources of the area--I do not mean to belittle the significance of that tragedy--but Mother Nature has a way of cleansing, and it was helped by a good deal of funding, commitment and expertise from Alaskans and those outside. But the fact remains, this pipeline continues to contribute a great deal to the economy of this country. 
Certainly much of the permitting process, and to a large degree the continuity of maintaining quality and environmental concerns, are a responsibility of the Federal Government as well as the State government which watched over the construction and the operation and made sure it was done responsibly. But those groups did not stand in the way of construction. 
Since the pipeline first flowed on June 20, 1977, the pipeline has produced and provided the United States with over 25 percent of the domestic crude oil produced in the United States and about 10 percent of total U.S. daily consumption of crude oil, to give you some idea of the significance of this particular and unique all-American pipeline. 
So, as a consequence, as we look at our situation today, this pipeline has contributed significantly to U.S. energy independence and, I might add, energy independence that is in serious jeopardy. 
Consider this for just a moment, Mr. President. In 1994, domestic flow production dropped to 6.6 million barrels a day, the lowest since 1954. National demand has increased to more than 17.7 million barrels per day, the highest level since the mid-1970's. The United States imported 51 percent of its oil in 1994. Today, we are importing a little over 52 percent, but according to the Department of Energy, U.S. dependence on foreign oil is expected to rise to nearly 70 percent by the year 2000. 
If not for the trans-Alaska pipeline, we might have already reached 70 percent imported oil. How much higher would our gasoline prices be without that pipeline? How much more likely would we be putting our children and grandchildren in harm's way on foreign soil to protect our domestic interests if we were importing more than 70 percent of our oil? Because, make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the Persian Gulf conflict was about keeping the flow of oil for the benefit of the world. 
We have always had an environmental concern over the pipeline. It was predicted that this pipeline, going through permafrost, which is frozen ground, and being a hot pipeline carrying warm oil, would cause heat generation and melt the permafrost, and, therefore, the pipeline would continually go further and further down, to fulfill perhaps a self-propelling prophecy that was suggested it would end up in China some day. Didn't we always know as kids, if you went down far enough, you would end up in China? Well, clearly that has not happened, Mr. President. 
The pipeline operates in permafrost. The hot oil flows through the pipeline, but the pipeline was clearly engineered to withstand that. It was suggested that this pipeline across 800 miles of Alaska would cause the animals, the wildlife associated with it, be it the polar bear, the grizzly bear, the brown bear, the black bear, the caribou, or the moose, to somehow have a fence they could not cross. The facts are, at the pipeline and the buried sections, the animals browse on it in the early spring because the small amount of heat generated causes the grasses to come up first, and it has become a sight and attraction. We see the caribou in their migration standing on top of the buried pipeline because there is more wind there and there are less opportunities for mosquitoes. So to suggest that it has somehow restricted the natural flow of wildlife certainly has not occurred. 
One can bottom line it and simply say the predictions of the environmental groups who said this was going to be some kind of environmental disaster have not occurred. It has been successful. It has done its job, and continues. 
To suggest it has not had its share of problems or there have not been mechanical failures and there have not been human failures--of course there have. I have always supported stringent oversight of the pipeline. We have been working with the Joint Pipeline Office and the Department of Transportation, and the effort has been successful. 
But every now and then we find opponents of development in Alaska who are looking for a cause, the cause of membership or cause of dollars or perhaps they bring up some of the young attorneys from Harvard or Brown to do missionary work in Alaska 
by representing one or another of the environmental groups. I think we have some 62 in Anchorage now. 
They need a cause. And one of their favorite topics, when things are slow, is to come out with a report that somehow the pipeline is in peril, somehow the pipeline is not being operated in the most efficient manner from the standpoint of the public interest. 
First of all, Mr. President, those who own the pipeline, the major owners--ARCO, Exxon--produce petroleum. Their interest is moving oil, moving oil safely, moving oil economically. To do anything less than that would be detrimental to their own interest. 
The State of Alaska maintains an oversight, the Federal Government maintains an oversight. But nevertheless, we continually see reports that purposely mislead the public about the Trans-Alaska pipeline. 
Those of us in the Senate know that if you do not have your electric code book up to date--and there are 25,000 or 30,000 separate entries--you can be classified by an agency as having 25,000 or 30,000 violations. It does not mean that your code book has not been updated during the last year for any number of reasons. 
So we have had critics of the pipeline from time to time issuing reports intended to portray some of these problems as standard operating procedure for pipeline management rather than an exception. Of course, it generates for those particular organizations contributions and in some cases generates membership. But these claims are in stark contrast to recent oversight reports by responsible State and Federal agencies tasked with the oversight responsibility. 
In 1995, the U.S. Department of Transportation audited the Office of Pipeline Safety to determine its effectiveness in ensuring the Trans-Alaska pipeline operations minimize risk to life and property. The audit concluded the operation `is effectively monitoring and inspecting [the pipeline]. Also, when violations were identified, OPS took enforcement actions against Alyeska' and made corrections. 
In August of 1995, at the request of Congress, the GAO completed an audit of the pipeline operators and their response to identified deficiencies. The report concluded that `Alyeska has taken substantive actions that, if carried through to completion, appear to be adequate to correct the problems.' 
Last year, the Joint Pipeline Office concluded that Alyeska has implemented its revised quality control for the pipeline sufficiently to allow its full approval. 
So, Mr. President, these are the responsible agencies and current reports we have on hand. We have no reason to doubt their accuracy. 
Finally, Mr. President, Alaska truly is a great State, a great big piece of real estate. We have many great assets, including our people and the resources that we have. On this date, I would like to especially recognize the role the Trans-Alaska pipeline has had in shaping our State and the benefits it has provided to this Nation's energy and natural security interests. 
Finally, Mr. President, on July 18-20, I am going to be leading a number of our colleagues to Alaska to look at the issues related to resource development of Alaska's Arctic, specifically the Trans-Alaska pipeline and other areas where truly the wealth of North America is coming from the Arctic. 
I remind the Presiding Officer that Alaska just happens to be the only State with any Arctic in it. So as part of that trip, we will take a close look at the marvels of the Trans-Alaska pipeline, what it has meant to this Nation. I look forward to leading this group, and I encourage my colleagues to join with me on this important trip. 
Finally, in conclusion, on the 20th anniversary of the Trans-Alaska pipeline, I would like to congratulate those workers who operate and have operated this pipeline for the last 20 years against tremendous odds, extraordinary climactic conditions, and have done it in a manner of recognizing that American technology and ingenuity and can-do spirit can just about overcome any adversity and any particular challenge of the time. 
The successful operation of the Trans-Alaska pipeline for the last 20 years, I think, has proven that indeed the men and women who are associated with the pipeline and the Alyeska crew are certainly up to the task. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that would increase dramatically cooperation between the Congress and Department of State on issues relating to Taiwan. 
There have been a lot of problems over the last few years relative to Executive Branch-Congressional dealings with regard to Taiwan. We had a situation back in 1993, I think, when President Lee of Taiwan attempted to overnight in Hawaii on a flight from Taiwan that was traversing the Pacific Ocean to a Central American destination. Unfortunately, that was not handled very well, and I think that it reflected poorly on U.S. hospitality. I recognize the sensitivity of the issue, but, nevertheless, I think most Americans agree that it was poorly handled by the State Department. 
The administration, at that time, refused to work with the Congress on this issue until 1994, when an amendment which I offered went to a vote and prevailed. 
More recently, some in this Chamber might remember the controversy created by the selection of the Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, Director James Wood. 
It is important to note that this directorship is not a formal ambassadorial position. It is our recognition of the uniqueness, if you will, of the existence of Taiwan that the President selects a Representative to Taiwan. 
Mr. James Wood resigned from his position on January 17, 1997. There were various charges and countercharges with regard to foreign contributions during the election campaign, and the legitimacy of that I will leave to the investigators. However, a 
February 10 Los Angeles Times story quoted a U.S. investigator as saying the variety of allegations constituted the `most bold and blatant' example veteran State Department officials could recall of the abuse of a diplomatic post. 
I am not going to argue the merits of Mr. Wood. But the Senate knows very little about Mr. Wood or any other official with direct responsibility for Taiwan affairs, because they do not come before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for confirmation. 
In the case of Mr. Wood, it is not for lack of effort on the part of the Senate. My very good friend and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, is very familiar with the lack of consultation between the State Department and Congress over Mr. Wood's appointment. After receiving information from outside sources regarding the qualifications of Mr. Wood for this sensitive post, both Senator Helms and I asked the State Department to allow us to have a meeting with Mr. Wood before his appointment. For reasons that have never been made clear, the State Department did not arrange the meeting prior to the appointment. Instead, Mr. Wood's appointment was announced while, I believe, the chairman was on the floor debating the 1995 version of the very same bill we are debating today, regarding State Department Authorization. 
It is important to note that our request for consultation was certainly consistent with the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, which is a very unusual but workable agreement. The TRA requires the Committee on Foreign Relations to oversee the implementation of the act and the operations and procedures of the American Institute in Taiwan. I repeat that. The act itself requires the Committee on Foreign Relations to oversee the implementation of the act and the operations and procedures of the American Institute in Taiwan. 
Now, `procedures' certainly suggests an oversight on the Director. Furthermore, then Secretary of State Vance at that time assured the Foreign Relations Committee in a letter to then Chairman Frank Church that--and I quote--`the names of prospective trustees and officers will be forwarded to the Foreign Relations Committee. If the Committee expresses reservations about a prospective trustee, [the Department of State] will undertake to discuss the matter fully with the Committee before proceeding.' 
Well, that is fine. The only problem is, the State Department did not seem to be able to get around to it. So what I am proposing is that the Senate more formally assert, or reassert, I should say, itself into this process by passing my amendment, which would require--it is very important now, Mr. President, we get this--require the coordinator for Taiwan affairs, a position that now exists at the State Department, to simply be subject to Senate confirmation. 
The administration would maintain the flexibility of the appointment, but we would have the opportunity for confirmation. 
So let me make it clear. Although I would have liked to propose an amendment that would have made the AIT Chairman and AIT Director subject to Senate confirmation, I have been advised that because of the particular and unusual nature of the American Institute in Taiwan, it would violate the Constitution to make these officers subject to advise and consent. 
Instead, therefore, I am trying to at least get more accountability from the State Department in our Taiwan policy. It has nothing to do with the sensitivity between Taiwan and PRC. This has to do about Senate perogative to have consent and accountability associated with the process. After all, Taiwan is our eighth largest trading partner. It is an important ally. I think we should have someone at the State Department who is more accountable to the Congress as we move forward on important issues like Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I just had a conversation with the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, relative to the reasons why I have offered an amendment which would require that the Foreign Relations Committee confirm the coordinator of Taiwan affairs at the State Department. 
As the Chair is aware, the Taiwan Relations Act requires the Committee on Foreign Relations to oversee the implementation of the TRA and the operations and procedures of the American Institute in Taiwan. And, furthermore, then Secretary of State Vance assured the committee in a letter to then Chairman Frank Church that `the names of prospective trustees and officers will be forwarded to the Foreign Relations Committee. If the Committee expresses reservations about a prospective trusteer, [the Department of State] will undertake to discuss the matter fully with the Committee before proceeding.' 
The Secretary of State assured me that she will put into a formal letter that the State Department will agree to consult with the Foreign Relations Committee prior to appointing any director or chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan. The letter will, of course, be directed to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. A copy will be given to the minority, as well as to me, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright agreed to refer, specifically, in her letter, to the assurance that Chairman Frank Church received from Secretary of State Vance regarding the intent and interpretation of the committee's role under the Taiwan Relations Act. 
So as a consequence of that assurance, Mr. President, and with thanks to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I think that Secretary Albright has met my concern by assuring the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee that, indeed, the State Department will put into writing its agreement to consult with the committee prior to appointing the director or chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan. As we all know, and the concern we have is that, previously, the appointments took place before the consultations took place. That will not be the case. I thank Senator Biden for his role in taking the first call from the Secretary and, again, I appreciate Senator Helms' indulgence in providing me with the time to come to the floor, as well as to talk to the Secretary. As a consequence of that, Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to chat a little bit about recreation in America today and announce that Great Outdoors Week for 1997 began on Monday of this week. 
From America's vast forests to her mighty rivers, to her majestic mountains, plains, and valleys, there is the recognition that this Nation is truly blessed with national and natural beauty beyond comparison. As a consequence, it is no wonder that our Nation and our national consciousness are defined in no small part by the great outdoors that we all enjoy. 
Coming from my State of Alaska--which is, at least as far as I am concerned, America's premier outdoor State--I have lived near and experienced some of nature's greatest handiwork. I have fished, hunted, sailed, hiked, and camped in probably the best places on Earth. 
So it is with great pleasure that I come before my colleagues to announce Great Outdoors Week for 1997. 
The recreation community is in Washington this week to host a number of activities to remind those of us inside the beltway that outdoor recreation is a good thing for people, for communities, for the economy, and for conservation. Great Outdoors Week will bring together many people and groups who really care about America's great outdoors. Federal, State, and local officials, recreation enthusiasts, outdoor media, recreation associations, and the recreation industry will all take part in the events scheduled for this week. 
I met last night with the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association--the manufacturers and the suppliers of recreation vehicles. There were some 250 to 300 people in the Russell rotunda at a very, very outstanding reception to kick off Great Outdoors Week for 1997. 
Mr. President, as on outdoorsman and chairman of the Senate committee with responsibility for our Nation's public lands, I am also going to take an active role in the other events scheduled for this week. 
The work of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources touches the lives of Americans in many ways but few ways more visible than in our oversight of the Nation's great outdoors. Great Outdoors Week really gives us an opportunity to focus on the value of recreation in our lives, and how we can do a better job of encouraging people of all ages to enjoy America's natural and national splendor. 
The great outdoors is the main focus of our national recreation initiative. The acronym is REC, and it stands for three goals: reinvigorate, enhance, and conserve. 
To reinvigorate and rebuild our national parks, forests, and other Federal lands that provide diverse recreation opportunities. 
To enhance the visits Americans make to our public land legacy through improved access, facilities, and services. 
To conserve America's natural resources that provide recreation opportunities, particularly through wildlife habitat restoration and protection. It also includes areas in our urban centers with strategies to protect open space, rivers, lakes, and to link parks and trails. 
Last year, we passed the largest parks and conservation public lands bill that has passed this body since the 1940's. Containing 119 pieces of legislation, the bill increased park boundaries, designated historical trails and wild and scenic rivers, protected sensitive lands, and benefited virtually every State in this Nation. 
It also protected the Presidio in San Francisco, one of the finest recreation areas in our country, by establishing a new management system which takes advantage of private sector expertise, contribution, and finance. 
It will also create the National Recreation Lakes Study Commission. This is a nine-member panel which will examine the demand for recreation at federally managed lakes and reservoirs and help develop plans with the private sector to maximize recreational opportunities. A report is due next year, and we may write legislation to increase opportunities in this area. 
Thankfully, after I wrote to the President last week, he told me that he will name the remaining four members of the nine-member commission this week so that they can get down to work. 
On April 25 of this year, we held a seminar on outdoor recreation trends and benefits. 
This Wednesday we will hold an oversight hearing on the stateside program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We will hold additional oversight hearings on other aspects of the outdoor recreation capabilities. At least one of them will be a field hearing out West. The committee report, hopefully, will follow. 
Putting our heads together, we can decide what the Federal Government can and should do to reinvigorate, to enhance, and to conserve America's outdoors. 
Our national parks--our Nation's crown jewels--are losing some of their luster. We need to ensure that all Americans can enjoy and be proud of our parks system for years to come. 
We have at least an $8 billion backlog in unfunded projects and programs. 
Yellowstone needs about $300 million in road repairs. 
Yosemite needs $178 million in repairs after January's floods. 
Each year, another 1 percent of the National Parks Service roads fall from fair to poor or failing. 
We are working to leave a legacy everyone can be proud of--a new, reinvigorated, world-class National Park System. 
Mr. President, an expanded fee demonstration program, major concession reform, a bonding initiative, and additional private-sector sponsorships are all under consideration in this Congress. Our system of parks includes State and local parks as well. Capital needs of State and local recreation systems for 1995-99 are over $27 billion, according to the National Recreation and Parks Association, but we have a problem. The stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund has been shut down. 
Over 30 years ago, in a bipartisan effort, Congress and the President created the Land and Water Conservation Fund referred to as the LWCF. It is funded primarily by offshore oil and gas revenues which now exceed $3 billion. My committee has authorized land and water conservation funding to the year 2015 with an annual ceiling of $900 million. 
The LWCF stateside program promotes a unique partnership among Federal, State, and local governments. It provides matching grants that enable State and local governments to create recreation facilities, parks, and playgrounds. Because they are matching grants, they double the impact. 
The stateside LWCF program has helped finance 37,500 national parks and recreation projects--campgrounds, trails, playgrounds, recreation centers, and gyms. It has also helped in my State of Alaska. We have had a number of very effective State and local parks which received a stateside LWCF grant. The demand continues to increase. As a matter of fact, in fiscal year 1995 over $600 million was requested. 
But I want to explain very briefly, Mr. President, that the recent balanced budget agreement between that the administration and the congressional budget negotiators provided $700 million over 5 years for the Federal side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. That is the portion of the fund used for land acquisition by the Federal land management agencies. The administration wants $315 million of that to buy Headwaters Forest and the New World Mine. This is not what LWCF was designed to do. The remaining $385 million, according to the administration, would be spent for Federal land purchases. That is hardly a State matching program. This means the stateside matching land and water conservation fund program would still remain unfunded. 
So what would Americans get for their $700 million? More Federal land acquisitions over the next 5 years chosen by politicians in Washington, DC, rather than the people. State and local recreation projects, the ones closest to the people, get nothing, and that is too bad because those are matching funds and we get twice the bang for the buck. We need to save the stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund program and I have asked appropriators to provide some money to keep the matching grant program alive. 
When Congress authorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund, it had two parts. One part dealt with Federal acquisitions. The other provided matching grants for State and local governments to purchase and develop parks and recreation facilities. The administration is trying to abolish the second half, and Congress should simply not let that happen. In fiscal years 1996 and 1997, Congress and the administration simply zeroed out those funds. 
Mr. President, let me show you a couple of charts, and I will conclude my remarks. This chart shows the Land and Water Conservation Fund authorizations and appropriations. As one can see, the stateside LWCF appropriations in green have dramatically decreased. Of course, the authorizations have gone way up. What we have here is a dropoff from 1983 to 1995 down to 1996 where there is zero money provided for stateside LWCF matching grants. That is probably the greatest single significance of what the Federal role is. It is in matching, if you will, so that Federal appropriations can come on and the priorities can be addressed in an appropriate manner that represent the will and attitudes of States and local communities. 
There is just one other chart that I want to show, and that is the receipts. Where does the money come from? It comes from a dedicated fund, the Outer Continental Shelf areas where revenues now exceed more than $3 billion a year. There is very little from recreation fees. There is some from the motor fuel tax and surplus property sales. The funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund comes from offshore revenues, but the Appropriations Committee has seen fit to use those funds for other expenditures. 
So, Mr. President, during Great Outdoors Week and every other week of the year, I ask that we all remember the value of outdoor recreation to Americans. We are blessed with a great natural bounty. It is our duty to conserve it. As a consequence, I urge my colleagues to reflect on the necessity of having a meaningful stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund program which would provide matching grants benefiting the States and allowing the priorities at hand to be met. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to advise my colleagues that yesterday, unfortunately, we were not in morning business so I could not make this statement, but yesterday marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 1897 Organic Act which created the Forest Service. On that day, June 4, 100 years ago, Congress passed the Forest Service Organic Act which allowed the first on-the-ground management of the forest reserves. 
Prior to this date 100 years ago, forest reserves totalling approximately 17 million acres had been established in 1891 and 1893. In the spring of 1897, another 21 million acres of forest reserves were added to the system. This latter addition was the result of a Presidential Commission on National Forests established in 1896. The commission included notable scientific and conservation leaders at that time. 
However, the addition of the second round of reserves was sufficiently controversial that Congress moved in early 1897 to attach an amendment to the 1898 general appropriations bill to eliminate the reserves and transfer the 21 million acres back into the public domain for disposal. Outgoing President Grover Cleveland pocket vetoed the bill on his last day in office. This created a situation in which the Government had no money to operate and the new President, William McKinley, quickly called Congress into an extra session on March 15, 1897, to reconsider eliminating the reserves. 
In this special session of Congress a compromise was framed which took the form of the Forest Service's 1897 Organic Act and which restored the 21 million acres of forest reserves. I think it is rather ironic, Mr. President, as we consider today various and sundry conflicts over salvage riders and the management of various forests, including the Tongass National Forest in my State, that 100 years ago Congress had the same kinds of conflicts. But the national forests that we have today serve as a living testimony to our ability to resolve those conflicts. 
My understanding is that other Members will join me today, Senator Smith and probably Senator Craig, with regard to further statements on the significance of this particular date, June 4, 100 years ago, 1897, and further elaborate on the circumstances and conditions of the forests and the transition that has occurred in that 100 years. 
However, I think it noteworthy that there are many changes in the names, many changes in the boundaries of the national forests in the years that have followed that event 100 years ago, but the basic land areas that were set aside in the Western States between 1891 and 1907 are still with us today. From 1907 until today another 44 million acres have been added to our national forests, mostly in the Eastern States. These lands, for the most part, were old, worn out farms, lands that were cut over, but today represent some of the most important forested recreation and timber producing areas that we have in the Eastern United States. 
The Organic Act of 1897 allowed for the organization and active management of the reserves by forest rangers rather than no management at all, which had been the case from 1891 until that time. The well-known and revered Gifford Pinchot was hired on June 25, 1897, and he recommended the adoption of three basic goals for the management of the forest reserves. The first was permanent tenure of forest land; the second was continuity of management; and the third was the permanent employment of technical trained foresters. Because the tradition within the Department of the Interior was to hire political appointees rather than technically trained foresters, Pinchot was successful in 1905 in securing the transfer of the forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture 
where it is today. 
I think it is a little bit ironic that today the new Chief of the Forest Service is a political appointee who most recently served in the Department of the Interior. Nevertheless, technically sound management continues within the Forest Service. 
The major section of the 1897 act was a statement of reason for establishing the forest reserves. The act stated, `no public forest reservation should be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the reservation, or for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessity of citizens of the United States.' Let me repeat that: `securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessity of citizens of the United States.' That was the purpose. 
Mr. President, for the most part of 100 years of management of the reserves, the Forest Service has relied extensively upon the double provisions of water flows and timber. Today, however, with ecosystem management as the Forest Service envisions it, improving and protecting the forests seems to have taken the forefront. I, for one, believe that all three criteria are important to assure that we can continue the balanced, predictable, and sustainable management of our national forests. 
One interesting difference from the way the world seems to work today is the way the Forest Service was able to complete the implementation regulations for the Organic Act by June 30, 1897. Today it is difficult for the agency to produce regulations in 25 months, let alone get the job done in 25 days, which is what they did in 1897. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Organic Act, which established the philosophy of active management of the forest reserves, the first national forest timber sale occurred in the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota in 1899. This sale was offered in the spirit of the then recently passed Organic Act because Gifford Pinchot believed that the science of forestry could be applied to manage the forest reserves on a sustainable basis. 
We will be displaying a photograph as I speak. I think it is noteworthy, Mr. President, to recognize the significance of what this represents, because I have here for my colleagues' attention an enlarged photograph of the first timber sale that occurred in the United States on national forest lands. This is how it looks today, Mr. President. I think you will agree that this photograph shows a healthy, well-managed forest, which 100 years later confirms Pinchot's belief in forestry and the renewability of the resource. Since the time of that first sale, forestry and forest practices have progressed exponentially, reflecting modern knowledge and technologies and a heightened concern for ecology and all of the ecological functions of the forest. 
This picture is an actual portrayal of the area in question today. This area in the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota was cut in 1899. I am going to have an easel put up so that during the remainder of my remarks it can be viewed. 
Finally, Mr. President, the Organic Act of 1897, although modified many times by the Congress, set the standards for the management of the national forests for an entire century. The vast national forest lands were set aside, and they are still in existence to this day. Controversy about the management of those forest lands, of course, continues, much as it did a century ago. The national forests are still under attack from some quarters. Management is being pressured to change. Special-interest groups are highly polarized. But the fact is that there are national forests, and I think it speaks well that 100 years ago a young country with vast resources would save and manage millions of acres for the people, and that is just what we have done. Were we less forward-thinking people then, as some people seem to believe we are today? If we were, there would be nothing left to argue about. But that is not the case. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, for the most part, the legacy of the Forest Service for the last 100 years has been responsible stewardship by dedicated professionals within the Forest Service. 
Finally, as a commemoration of today's anniversary, I am sharing with each of my colleagues a most important book on forest ecology called `Pacific Spirit: A Forest Reborn.' This book, which was written by Dr. Patrick Moore, is going to be given to each Member of this body. Dr. Patrick Moore is a forest ecologist and is one of the cofounders of GreenPeace. That is a rather interesting reference. Here is a cofounder of GreenPeace writing a book on forest ecology--`Pacific Spirit: A Forest Reborn.' It is interesting that Dr. Moore now advises the Forest Alliance of British Columbia, an industry-sponsored organization in Canada. Some Members might think it ironic that I would send my colleagues a work by a former GreenPeace activist and founder of GreenPeace. But Dr. Moore sums up his position in this way:  
As a lifelong environmentalist, I feel the need to speak out because I cannot agree with claims made to the world by some of my environmentalist colleagues about the total destructive impact of forestry in general and clear-cutting in particular. 
It is the final irony today, I guess, that it takes a founder of GreenPeace to speak to us on the proposition that clear-cutting has value and is an adequate and recognized means of timber harvesting. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleague, Senator Baucus of Montana, the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act of 1997. 
The vast potential of telemedicine technology is clearly under-utilized. I believe that the answer to growing concerns regarding access and affordability of quality health care services in rural America is telemedicine. Let me describe just a few of the difficulties of rural health care in my home State of Alaska and explain why telemedicine is our long-awaited answer. 
Alaska encompasses 586,412 square miles. It is one-fifth the size of the contiguous United States; 120 times larger than the State of Rhode Island; and larger than the three largest States in the union combined. If a map of Alaska were superimposed on a map of the lower 48 States, Alaska would touch South Carolina, Mexico, California, and the United States-Canadian border. In short, Alaska has 1 million acres of land for every day of the year. 
Geography is another defining characteristic of Alaska. My State has a climate characterized by significant season fluctuations in temperature and precipitation and a topography characterized by mountains, wetlands, forests, and rugged coastlines. 
Communities and villages are scattered throughout the vast regions of Alaska. And though Alaska contains 586,412 square miles, it only has 12,200 miles of roads. Vast areas are completely unconnected by roads, with access only available by airplane, boat, snowmachine, or dogsled. 
Meeting the health care needs of these communities and villages is a daunting task. Residents have difficulty due to geography, lack of providers and poverty. Although excellent medical facilities and tertiary care centers are available in Anchorage, direct connection to these facilities from most of the State is not possible other than by air transportation. Consequently, geographically, 74 percent of the State is in medically underserved areas. 
Telemedicine is the cost-effective and practical answer to the Alaska dilemma. Currently, there is an exciting project underway known as the Alaska Telemedicine project. This consortium of Alaskan health care providers and telecommunication carriers has been diligently working to unite health care in Alaska. This project has successfully united the Native health corporations, military medical facilities, and public and private hospitals of Alaska. 
The fragmented nature of health care delivery in Alaska and Alaska satellite-based narrow-band telecommunications infrastructure, along with the geography and climate of Alaska, make Alaska an ideal place for the Alaska Telemedicine project to flourish. 
In 1995, the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA], pursuant to a mandate in 42 U.S.C. 1395(b)(1) which directs HCFA to establish demonstration projects that explore innovative methodologies of Medicare cost-savings, developed a telemedicine Medicare reimbursement project for rural America. Five demonstration sites were established in four States: Iowa, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. The purpose of these programs was to investigate Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine in rural locations. 
Unfortunately, the HCFA study of rural telemedicine contains a glaring omission: The study does not include any sites in rural Western locations. The omission of the rural West, which contains extremely remote and frontier locations will result in a deficient and likely inaccurate study for rural telemedicine. 
Our legislation will expand the HCFA project to better represent rural America. A site in Alaska and in Montana will be included. Montana, like Alaska, experiences significant difficulties in providing health care services in rural areas. Montana's five independent telemedicine projects that have formed a united alliance will also be included in the HCFA project. 
Mr. President, the goal of telemedicine Medicare reimbursement is to ensure that the elderly of America who reside in inaccessible rural areas will be allowed to have access to quality health care in the most cost-effective manner--via telecommunication networks. Establishing Medicare reimbursement stabilizes telemedicine technology, and will likely lead to widespread coverage of telehealth services by private insurers. 
Senator Baucus and my bill, will merely expand the current demonstration project conducted by HCFA. By this expansion, the HCFA study will better represent rural telemedicine in the Nation. I ask that my colleagues support the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act of 1997.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have listened to some of my senior colleagues reminisce on their relationships with our good and dear friend, Senator Thurmond from South Carolina. 
As a new Senator coming into this body in 1981, I recall my first meeting with Senator Thurmond. It was in the elevator. I felt a very firm, strong grip on my upper arm. As I turned around, he said, `How you doing, Son?' I think, without exception, every time I have been in the elevator with Senator Thurmond I have had that tight squeeze--`How you doing, Son?' 
So it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues in honoring our dear friend. 
May 25, 1997--the longest serving U.S. Senator in our Nation's history, a remarkable individual who has unselfishly dedicated his entire life to the service of others. 
Being from Alaska, the newest State in the Union, a State that has only been around for about 39 years, I have found Senator Thurmond to be most understanding of our issues with regard to development. He comes from the school that suggests that those who are elected from their State ought to have a pretty good handle on what is in the best interest of their State. I think his logic follows that, if the folks back home think otherwise, well, they are going to get new representation. I have respected him for his support these 17 years that I have been in the Senate. 
Perhaps one of the most memorable and lasting recollections I have of Senator Thurmond is during the years when I was chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee. You know Senator Thurmond, as it has been stated, landed behind enemy lines in a 
glider. He was a volunteer. That was the Normandy D-day invasion of the 82d Airborne Division. But he went on to earn 5 battle stars during World War II, 18 military decorations during his distinguished military career. He was made a major general of the U.S. Army Reserves. In working with him during the years on the Senate Veterans' Committee, I found him to be the most significant contributor toward the recognition that we can never do enough to meet our obligation to our veterans, those who did so much and gave so much. 
But his balance was that while we can never do enough, we have to do a better job with what we have to keep up with the changing needs of the veterans and do more and get more input from the veterans' organizations and accepting the responsibilities associated with our obligation to meet our veterans' needs. He has been honored many times by various veterans groups for his contribution. 
But I particularly look back to the days when we worked together in meeting our Nation's obligations to our veterans and his contribution in that regard. 
I think one of the interesting things, in recognizing the contributions Senator Thurmond has made and continues to make, is his humble beginning as a teacher. He has taught us all, but he began his teaching career back in South Carolina in 1923. He wrote the South Carolina school attendance law. He worked hard to increase pay for teachers and longer school terms. I think it is noteworthy that even today he sends congratulatory certificates to every graduating South Carolina high school student. 
Senator Thurmond continues to teach us today, and he will again in the next century. He has really taught us all in this institution. 
I am honored to call him a friend. I am pleased to rise today in tribute to this great man, this great American, who has become synonymous with this great institution. 
Senator Thurmond, we honor you, and we are particularly appreciative of your leadership and teaching which has served us all. Thank you, my friend. I look forward to our continued relationship. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Today, Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the senior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] in introducing this important bill. It is intended to break down a barrier that Congress created 111 years ago, and which has long since ceased to make sense. 
Opening that door will create a path to thousands of new jobs, to hundreds of millions of dollars in new economic activity and to millions in new Federal, State, and local government revenues. Furthermore, Mr. President, that door can be opened with no adverse impact on any existing U.S. industry, labor interest, or on the environment, and it will cost the government virtually nothing. 
There's no magic to this; in fact, it's a very simple matter. This bill merely allows U.S. ports to compete in the business of offering homeport services to the cruise ship trade. 
The bill amends the Passenger Service Act to allow foreign cruise ships to operate between U.S. ports. However, it also very carefully protects all existing U.S. passenger vessels by using a definition of cruise ship designed to exclude any foreign-flag vessels that could conceivably compete in the same market as U.S.-flag tour boats, ferries, or riverboats. Finally, it provides a mechanism to guarantee that if a U.S. vessel ever enters this trade in the future, steps will be taken to ensure an ample pool of potential passengers. 
Mr. President, this is a straightforward approach to a vexing problem, and it deserves the support of this body. 
As my colleagues know, this bill is very similar to S. 668, a bill I introduced just a few weeks ago. The major difference is that that bill applies only to cruise ships operating in Alaska, and this one applies nationwide. Other differences include the fact that my original bill sets a 5,000 gross deadweight ton cut-off for vessels seeking to enter the coastwise trade, and this one uses a 4,000 ton limit. This bill also requires foreign vessels operating in the U.S. trade to effect repairs in U.S. shipyards. Both of these differences are positive, in my view. 
The change in tonnage will encourage U.S. ports to compete for business from some of the smaller vessels in the luxury cruise ship fleet, which continuing to protect existing U.S. tour vessels in the 100-ton class. While there are a few riverboats in the area of 3,000 tons, none of these operate in the open ocean cruise ship trade, and the bill contains other protections specifically for these U.S. vessels. 
The requirement for U.S. repair will assist in creating and maintaining even more U.S. jobs. From the standpoint of the cruise ships, it simply calls for the continuation of what is already a common practice among vessels that need work while visiting a U.S. port 
Mr. President, it isn't 1886 anymore, and it is time to change the current law. These days, no one is building any U.S. passenger ships of this type, and no one has built one in over 40 years. Instead of protecting U.S. jobs, the current law is a job losing proposition, as it prohibits U.S. cities from competing. That is absurd. 
The cash flow generated by the cruise ship trade is enormous. Most passengers bound for my State of Alaska fly in or out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, but because of the law, they spend little time there. Instead, they spend their pre- and post-sailing time in a Vancouver hotel, at Vancouver restaurants, and in Vancouver gift shops. And when their vessel sails, it sails with food, fuel, general supplies, repair and maintenance needs taken care of by Vancouver vendors. 
According to some estimates, the city of Vancouver receives benefits of well over $200 million per year from the cruise ship trade. Others provide more modest estimates, such as a comprehensive study by the International Council of Cruise Lines, which indicated that in 1992 alone, the Alaska cruise trade generated over 2,400 jobs for the city of Vancouver, plus payments to Canadian vendors and employees of over $119 million. 
This is a market almost entirely focused on U.S. citizens going to see one of the United State's most spectacular places, and yet we force them to go to another country to do it. We are throwing away both money and jobs--and getting nothing whatsoever in return. 
Why is this allowed to happen? The answer is simple--but it is not rational. Although the current law is actually a job loser, there are those who argue that any change would weaken U.S. maritime interests. They seem to feel that amending the Passenger Service Act so that it makes sense for the United States would create a threat to Jones Act vessels hauling freight between U.S. ports. Mr. President, there simply is no connection whatsoever between the two. 
Then there is the suggestion that this bill might harm smaller U.S. tour or excursion boats. Mr. President, that is also untrue. The industry featuring these smaller vessels is thriving, but it simply doesn't cater to the same client base as large cruise ships. The fact of the matter is that there is no significant competition between the two types of vessel, because the services they offer are in no way comparable. The larger vessels offer unmatched luxury and personal service, on-board shopping, entertainment, and so forth. The smaller vessels offer more flexible routes, timing, shore excursions, and other opportunities. 
There is one operating U.S. vessel that doesn't fit the mold: the Constitution, an aging 30,000-ton vessel operating only in Hawai. This is the only ocean-capable U.S. ship that might fit the definition of cruise vessel. I have searched for other U.S. vessels that meet or exceed the tonnage limit in the bill, and the only ones I have found that even approach it are the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen, both of which are approximately 3,360 tons, and both of which are 19th century-style riverboats that are entirely unsuitable for any open-ocean itinerary such as the Alaska trade. Further, the bill specifically prohibits any foreign vessel from participating in the intra-coastal trade served by these riverboats. 
Mr. President, I will not claim that this legislation would immediately lead to increased earnings for U.S. ports. I can only say that it would allow them to compete fairly, instead of being anchored by a rule that is actively harmful to U.S. interests. That alone makes it good public policy, and I look forward to my colleagues' agreement and support.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the additional $700 million appropriation for the Land and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF] included in the balanced budget agreement. While I commend the President and congressional leadership for recognizing the importance of the LWCF, I have concerns that this additional appropriation will not be spent on the priorities for which the LWCF was established. 
I urge congressional appropriators not to use this additional LWCF money on a handful of large projects, including the acquisition of Headwaters Forest in California and the New World Mine in Montana. Those projects were identified as priority land acquisitions by politicians, not by Federal land managers. Rather, I urge the appropriators to spend this additional LWCF money as the Land and Water Conservation Act directs on the hundreds of priority land acquisitions and local recreation projects identified by Federal land management agencies and the States. 
As originally envisioned, the administration planned to acquire the Headwaters and the New World Mine through land exchanges. Now, under the terms of the budget agreement, these lands would not be acquired by land exchange but by purchase. 
Mr. President, this change sets a horrible precedent. It is bad public policy, and the Congress should not be a partner in this land grab, as now proposed. I also fear that these land grabs, which do not involve public participation and which are inconsistent with land management plans, may become the norm as opposed to the exception. 
Recently, the President announced the creation of the 1.7 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. He made the same sort of promises from Arizona that he made in Yellowstone when he spoke about the controversy surrounding the New World Mine. The Utah National Monument lands contain 176,000 acres of school trust lands that contain approximately 1.54 billion dollars' worth of coal deposits which, if extracted, would fund the Utah school systems. The President indicated that other Federal lands in Utah would be made available, and the schoolchildren in Utah would not be hurt by the creation of the National Monument. There are apparently no plans to complete land exchanges in Montana or California, and the taxpayers are going to take another hit for Presidential promises. One only has to wonder what we are going to do to make the schoolchildren of Utah whole. If we begin by fully funding the acquisitions at Headwaters and the Mine, how do we ignore Utah when the President decides to just buy them out. This is not how Congress intended for the Land and Water Conservation Act to be used. 
Over 30 years ago, in a remarkable bipartisan effort, Congress and the President created the LWCF. The LWCF provides funds for the purchase of Federal land by the land management agencies--the Federal-side LWCF program--and creates a unique partnership among Federal, State, and local governments for the acquisition of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities--the State-side LWCF program. The LWCF is funded primarily from offshore oil and gas leasing revenues which now exceed $3 billion annually, and has been authorized through the year 2015 at an annual ceiling of $900 million. 
However, LWCF moneys must be annually appropriated. And, despite the increase in offshore oil and gas revenues, the LWCF has not fared well in this decade. Expenditures from the LWCF have fluctuated widely over its life but have generally ranged from $200 to $300 million per year. In the 1990's, total appropriations to both the Federal and State sides of LWCF steadily declined from a high of $341 million during the Bush administration to $149 million in fiscal year 1997. 
Most significantly, all of the fiscal year 1997 appropriation was for the exclusive purpose of Federal land acquisition. In 1995, Congress and the President agreed to shut down the State-side LWCF program. For fiscal year 1998, the President has requested $165 million for Federal land acquisitions and only $1 million for monitoring previously funded State-side projects. The President did not request any funds for new State-side projects. 
Mr. President, I believe the additional appropriation provided for in the budget agreement presents a significant opportunity to right those misguided decisions on the use of the LWCF. 
The State-side of the LWCF has played a vital role in providing recreational and educational opportunities to millions of Americans. State-side LWCF grants have helped finance well over 37,500 park and recreation projects in all 50 States, including campgrounds, trails, and open space. 
The availability of these outdoor recreation facilities is critical to the well-being of Americans. People who participate in outdoor recreation activities, whatever the activity, are happier and healthier. Recreation is an important component of our economy. Moreover, while trips to our National Parks create experiences and memories which last a lifetime, day-in and day-out, people recreate close to home. In fiscal year 1995, the last year for which the State-side LWCF grant program was funded, there were nearly 3,800 applications for State-side grants. 
Unfortunately, there was only enough money to fund 500 projects. The demand for those local recreation resources is increasing. 
That is why stateside LWCF grants are so important. Stateside LWCF grants help address the highest priority needs of Americans for outdoor recreation. At the same time, because of the matching requirement for stateside LWCF grants, these grants provide vital seed money which local communities use to forge partnerships with private entities. In the absence of the grants, I fear local park and recreation services will fail to meet the ever-growing demands of the American public, and the Federal Government will be asked to fill the void--a role the Federal Government cannot, and should not, play. 
At the same time, the Federal land management agencies have identified, through their planning processes, the lands they would like to purchase for inclusion in the Federal estate. Again, the purchases would be made with LWCF moneys. The lands often are in holdings in national parks or forests. Or, they may be lands with unique characteristics which the Federal land managers believe should be owned by the Federal Government. Interestingly, neither Headwaters Forest nor the New World Mine meet these criteria. Rather, both the Headwaters Forest and the New World Mine, have been labeled as Federal land priorities according to the politicians, not to the professional land managers. 
The budget agreement, as interpreted by the Clinton administration, would ignore hundreds of prioritized projects and focus on a handful. The $315 million the President would like to spend on Headwaters Forest and New World Mine could be spent on hundreds of park and recreation facilities throughout the Nation. Would the American people rather own 5,000 acres in California and a mine in Montana, or park and recreation facilities Americans can enjoy on a daily basis? 
Why should Congress bail out the administration because it could not fulfill the terms of deals it made on its own for the acquisition of Headwaters Forest and New World Mine? 
Once again, when he announced each of those deals, the President promised the lands would be acquired through land exchanges. We stand ready to work with the President on land exchanges to accomplish his priorities in Montana and California. But this should be a process where the President and Congress work together. Instead, those who have been waiting for years for the Government to acquire their lands, as they were promised when we incorporated private lands into national parks and forests, will just have to wait. Moreover, children throughout urban America may not have a park to play in or bike trail to ride on because their money was spent on the old growth redwoods in California and the New World Mine in Montana 
We have held no hearings on the New World Mine. There have been no hearings on Headwaters. Congress has not been a participant in this process. In fact, most of us know little about the two proposals. On the other hand, we know quite a bit about the stateside of the LWCF. All of our constituents and all of our States have benefited from new greenways, trails, scenic pathways, bicycle trails, parks, recreation facilities, ball parks, open spaces, and the list goes on and on and on. 
Mr. President, I encourage my friends on the Appropriations Committee to seriously evaluate the President's proposal in light of the priority projects that could otherwise be funded under the LWCF. We have an opportunity to save and enhance a program that has proved to be beneficial to all Americans. Let us weigh the pros and cons, and be mindful of the dangerous precedent we will set if we just swim merrily along with the President into his ocean of land acquisition. 
Unfortunately, the majority of city kids will never see the Headwaters or the site of the New World Mine. But a majority of city kids will see and be able to experience the results of the LWCF if properly applied. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will address one of the major complaints of Internet users--the proliferation of unsolicited e-mail advertisements, junk e-mail, or so-called spam. 
Mr. President, in the span of 5 years, an entirely new method of commerce and communication--electronic mail on the Internet--has spread around the world. Along with the benefits of this revolutionary technology, there are some negative byproducts that can only damage the integrity of this new communications medium. 
Because of technological advances, Internet e-mail has also become a very inexpensive means of distributing endless e-mails solicitations that not only annoy but can also defraud recipients. Moreover, the growth of junk e-mail can clog e-mail distribution networks and overtax the ability of service providers to distribute legitimate communications. 
With a minimal equipment investment, any individual or business has the capability to transmit unsolicited advertisements to thousands of people nationwide each hour with the click of a mouse. As technology advances, thousands will turn into millions, and junk e-mail could overwhelm cyberspace. 
Junk e-mail is known in the trade by the derisive term of `spam.' Based upon the content of many of these e-mails, I'd be insulted if I were an employee of Hormel, the creator of the real Spam. 
Mr. President, not only is junk e-mail an annoyance, but for many Americans, especially citizens living in rural States like Alaska, there is a real out-of-pocket cost they must pay to receive these unsolicited advertisements. When an on-line subscriber in rural Alaska or Montana, logs on to a network server, such as America OnLine, to check to see if there is e-mail, the subscriber often must pay a long distance charge. If there is no e-mail in his on-line mailbox, the subscriber's long distance charge may only cover 1 minute. However, if there are 25 messages in his mailbox, 24 of which are unsolicited e-mail ads, his long distance charges could triple or quadruple. 
So what the rural on-line user is forced to do is to pay for the privilege of receiving junk e-mail and then having to waste his time hitting his delete button to empty this junk out of his mail box. 
Mr. President, we ought to do something to end this practice. In 1991, Congress passed the Automated Telephone Consumer Protection Act that contained a provision which banned unsolicited fax transmissions. In the bill I am 
introducing today, the Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Choice Act of 1997, I have not chosen to take such a sweeping and unilateral approach because the Internet is about choices, not outright bans. 
What my bill does is to require the use of the word `Advertisement' in the subject line of any unsolicited commercial e-mail, along with the sender's real address, real e-mail address, and telephone number in the body of the message. This requirement will empower Internet users to filter out messages that they do not want to receive. 
Spam generators who refuse to abide by this requirement could face legal action from private citizens, state attorneys general, and/or the Federal Trade Commission. FTC or state action could result in civil penalties of up to $11,000 per incident and, more importantly, cease and desist orders. Private citizens bringing suit could recover $5,000 plus reasonable attorney's fees. 
Internet users can also choose not to unilaterally block all unsolicited commercial e-mails. Instead, they can send removal requests to specific mailing lists with further transmissions required to end within 48 hours. 
Moreover, Internet Service Providers, such as America Online or Microsoft Network, would be required to filter out all e-mails with the word `Advertisement' in the subject line when a consumer so requests. Large service providers would have 1 year, from the date of enactment, to implement this requirement. Smaller Internet Service Providers would have 2 years to meet this requirement. Internet Service Providers would also be required to cut off service to those who use their services to send out unsolicited commercial e-mails in violation of the provisions of the act. 
Mr. President, I want to point out what this bill does not attempt to do. It does not ban unsolicited commercial e-mails as some have suggested. I have not chosen an outright ban because I support the business practices of those who flood inboxes with sales pitches for worthless vitamin products and multilevel marketing schemes. Quite the contrary, I abhor such solicitations. 
But I do not want to set a precedent in banning commercial speech on the Internet. Although these unsolicited advertisements are annoying, I do not believe that is a basis for an outright ban. A better approach is to simply ignore them by filtering them out. If enough Americans choose to filter out such e-mail messages, I seriously doubt that anyone will bother to send out such e-mails in the future since the cyberspace market will no longer be there. 
I would also note that this bill does not impact automated mailing lists, e-mails between friends, or e-mails between businesses and their customers when there is a preexisting business relationship. 
Mr. President, the Internet is about choices, not bans. The Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Message Choice Act of 1997 should restore to consumers and businesses the right to be free from endless e-mail solicitations. It will be up to the consumer to decide if he or she wants to receive such messages. That is the way I believe Americans want it. They don't want government telling them what they can receive, but they want right to decide for themselves. 
Mr. President, as I said earlier, this is a very new technology and it is not my intention to hinder it's development nor interfere with legitimate commerce transacted on the Internet. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that resolves this problem.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to inquire of the managers regarding the impact of the resolution now being considered by the Senate. 
My question relates to the legislative intent of the resolution as it relates to the nuclear waste fund and specifically regarding its impact on S. 104 passed by the Senate on April 15, 1997. What is the impact of the budget resolution on the provisions of S. 104 and the Nuclear Waste Fund?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in March, the House of Representatives--in a bipartisan manner--overwhelmingly voted 295-136 to end the horrible procedure known as partial birth abortion. That strong endorsement for the ban came in the wake of a confession by a prominent proponent of abortion who admitted that he lied through his teeth when he said that partial birth abortions were very rare and only performed in the most dire of circumstances. 
On February 27, 1997, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, an association of over 200 abortion providers, recanted his earlier statements that partial birth abortions were used only in extreme medical circumstances. Fitzsimmons admitted that: In actuality, 5,000 partial birth abortions are performed every year as an elective procedure on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along. 
Fitzsimmons justified his lie by saying that he just went out there and spouted the party line. The party line Fitzsimmons referred to, of course, is the party line agreed on among the Washington-based pro-abortion groups. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton justified his veto of this ban by spouting the same party line lies--that this procedure is medically necessary in certain compelling cases to protect the mother. 
Mr. President, here is the truth about partial birth abortions: 
According to reputable medical testimony given before this Congress by partial birth abortion practitioners, partial birth abortions occur as many as 5,000 times a year. They are used predominantly for elective purposes and are seldom necessary to safeguard the mother's health or fertility. 
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop confirmed that President Clinton was misled by his medical advisors and stated that `In no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described as partial birth is a medical necessity for the mother.' 
Other physicians agree: In a September 19, 1996, Wall Street Journal editorial, three obstetricians declared that `contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility.' 
Here's another truth: Partial birth abortions are violent. The procedure is one in which four-fifths of the child is delivered before the abhorrent process of killing the child begins. Sadly, throughout this procedure, the majority of babies are alive and may actually feel pain during this ordeal. Ms. Brenda Schaffer, a nurse who observed the procedure, made this moving statement before a congressional committee:  
The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall. 
The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp. 
Mr. President, it's not easy to discuss this topic, but unfortunately, those are the stark and brutal realities of a partial birth abortion. My good friend and colleague Senator Moynihan declared that the practice of partial birth abortions is `just too close to infanticide.' 
Mr. President, the vote today is not an issue of pro-life or pro-choice--it's an issue of putting an end to an inhumane procedure. This infant is within inches from being declared a legal person in every State of the Union. The time has come for this body to legally protect that person. 
During the last Congress, a ban on partial birth abortion failed because of misinformation. This year, may the truth prevail. As we in Congress and the President finally hear the truth about this procedure--that it cannot be defended medically nor morally. 
I ask my colleagues to look into their consciences to make the right decision: To ban this painful, unnecessary, and morally offensive procedure of terminating the life of a viable child.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to express my support for this emergency supplemental appropriations legislation that will provide much needed relief to citizens in 33 States who have lived through some of the most catastrophic weather emergencies we have ever witnessed in this country. And this legislation also provides much needed funding for our brave service men and women who are keeping the peace in Bosnia. 
We have spent the entire week on this legislation and its successful completion is a tribute to the leadership of the new chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my distinguished senior colleague and close friend Ted Stevens and his staff for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. 
 Mr. President, not only will this legislation provide important financial relief to citizens in hundreds of communities, but it will ensure that we will not see a repeat of the shutdown of the Government that occurred in 1995. And it removes the arbitrary policy of the Interior Department which would terminate the 130-year-old policy that allows States to continue to have access across public lands. 
I want to congratulate Senator Stevens on the passage of this, the first legislation reported by the Appropriations Committee under his chairmanship. I look forward to working with him on many more appropriations bills and am certain that the leadership he has demonstrated on this bill will be repeated several times over in the years to come.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Arkansas. But the Senator from Arkansas says that this is not an emergency, and, as a consequence, this particular provision that is in the appropriations supplemental should not be here. Well, he is absolutely wrong because this is an emergency. It's a raid on the Western States of this Nation. The reason it is a raid, Mr. President, is because we are going to change the rules all of a sudden. Why are we changing the rules? Because the Secretary of the Interior doesn't want the States to continue to have the rights that we have had for 130 years. We have had a law for 130 years, a law that ensures access across public lands, which specifically addresses that there was some kind of a highway, some kind of an access in existence prior to October 21, 1976. 
Now, the Secretary of the Interior proposes to take this authority away from the States and give it to the Federal Government. That is why it is an emergency. We are fighting for survival. Here is a picture of my State of Alaska. I hope the Senator will take a good look at it, because here is Alaska today, Mr. President--a State with 33,000 miles of coastline. You can see our highway system here. We had one new highway built in the last 20 years, the Dalton Trail, which parallels the pipeline. This is an area one-fifth the size of the United States, Mr. President. 
If the motion to strike prevails by the Senator from Arkansas, our traditional access routes will be eliminated. Let me show you a map, Mr. President, of the State of Arkansas. There is the highway system in Arkansas, Mr. President; it's a fully developed State. It has been a State of the Union for over 100 years. My State has been in existence for 39 years. Here is a map of Arkansas today--roads all over the place. They are necessary for the economy of the area. I don't take issue with the road system. These roads came about in the development over a long period of time in the State, as we would anticipate. So there we have the basic issue. 
The Senator from Arkansas says that virtually any access across public land would be provided if indeed this portion that he wants to strike remains in the legislation. Well, let me tell you, as chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over R.S. 2477, I'll just say that the rights-of-way are the future vitality of our State. 
Despite all the rhetoric that has been made about this provision, it simply amounts to a tightening of a permanent moratorium placed on the Federal Government last year. It is that simple. What we want to do is keep in place the law as it has been for 130 years, keep the departmental regulations as they have been codified since 1932, I believe, and again in 1974. 
Now, the only thing that has changed in this debate is the level to which the administration will go to provide scare tactics to influence this process. Let me state here that I find some of the rhetoric coming out of the Interior Department concerning this provision absolutely reprehensible. 
I have a copy of a letter the Secretary of Interior sent to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee last week. At best, this letter shows an alarming ignorance of the history, topography, and the economy of the Western States. At worst, it shows the level of deceit that this administration is evidently willing to go to in order to mislead the American public about this issue. 
Now, in this letter there is a claim that a provision in this bill will create some 984,000 miles of new highways in Alaska, based on a 1923 Alaska law creating section-line rights-of-way. That is a fallacy, Mr. President. This is in a State--my State--which currently has just over 13,000 total miles of roads, along with the marine highway system. Alaska has a population of about 600,000, a budget deficit, and the last road built in Alaska cost more than $6 million per mile, down from Whitehorse to Skagway, the U.S. portion. 
If you take the miles the Secretary is talking about in his scare letter, you would have to spend just roughly $6 quadrillion 
to build these proposed roads in our State--more money than even the current administration could even dream up in taxes. 
The Secretary contends that this is going to happen because the section-line law exists in Alaska. Here are some facts about that. The State has had a section-line law on the books since 1923. That is the one correct statement in Secretary Babbitt's letter. The State has had the ability to assert section lines since 1923. There are no current rights-of-way based on section lines in Alaska. The State has never filed a section-line right-of-way. We have the right, but we also have the self-discipline. According to the Governor's office during last year's hearing, the State has no intention to ever file a section-line right-of-way. The fact is, section lines have little or no practical application as transportation corridors in Alaska due to the difficulty of the terrain. 
Second, the Secretary also states:  
My efforts over the past several years have been directed to establish a clear, certain, and fair process to bring these claims to conclusion . . . the public will be poorly served by Congressional action that has the effect of rescinding the Department's current orderly manner of proceeding to deal with the right-of-way claims. 
I find that statement interesting, considering what the Secretary wrote us in 1993, which was: 
I have instructed the BLM to defer any processing of R.S. 2477 assertions except in cases where there is a demonstrated, compelling, and immediate need to make such determinations. 
So, in fact, the administration's orderly process of dealing with these claims is to take no action whatsoever. 
Well, Mr. President, the fact is, if an R.S. 2477 was not in existence on October 21, 1976, it will not and cannot, by definition, be created now. This is what the statement of my friend from Arkansas suggests will lead to simply an open and arbitrary selection of areas across public land. He said, `Just about anything, anybody, any excuse, will get you access.' It will not, Mr. President. It is misleading and it is inappropriate to suggest that. You must have had in existence on October 21, 1976, evidence of utilization of that area as a trail, as a highway, some kind of route. 
Let me show you what we have here, Mr. President. This is a map made in 1917, before Alaska became a State. What it shows here is rather interesting, because this is what this issue today is all about. It is about access, early access. The two definitive identifiers in red here are winter stage lines and U.S. Government winter U.S. trails to Fairbanks. We didn't have a highway system. These two large red routings were trails, winter trails. In the summertime, they were used as wagon trails. That was access into the interior. Today, these two represent highways. These greens are the R.S. 2477's that provide access routes across public lands, so that we can get from Fairbanks out to McGrath, we can get from Nome out to the gold fields, across public lands. 
Let me show you why it is so important in Alaska relative to having the assurance of access across public lands. This is Alaska. Every color you see is a Federal withdrawal, Mr. President. Take a look at it. Federal withdrawal. Now, how in the world are we going to get from the southern part of the State to the northern part of the State through all these colors, because the only area that the State controls are the white areas? We have to have access. This law gives us that access. That is why this is an emergency. It is an emergency because the Secretary wants to take that authority away. We have had the authority for 130 years. 
Look at what we have done with it, relative to highways in Alaska. We haven't wandered all over the place. We have 13,000 miles of roads. But we have to have access, and that is why it is so vital that this matter be addressed now. We have to have access down from Prudhoe Bay. We have a little, tiny corridor, 3 miles wide. This is all Federal withdrawal. How are we going to get east and west if we don't have this provision? We simply can't get 
there from here. So while it doesn't mean much from the standpoint of the constituents in Arkansas, who have a State that is fully developed with a road system that looks like this, we have a situation where it is the lifeblood and the future of our State to have the assurance that we are going to have access, because the Federal Government basically owns our State. 
The Secretary wants to take that authority away from us. The senior Senator from Alaska and I and the Senators from Utah are all sensitive to the realities associated with this. This is our lifeblood. We have to have it. It is an emergency. It is necessary now. The administration and the Secretary want to take the authority away from the States and give it to the Federal Government. We all know what that means, Mr. President. That means disaster. 
The fact is, again, if an R.S. 2477 was not in existence on October 21, 1976, it will not and cannot, by definition, be created now. So when we look at those old maps of Alaska, we have to go back and ascertain and prove that we have had a trail, we have had a sled dog trail, we have had a regular route of access. If we can prove that, then we have a right to public access across the land. That is what this issue is all about. It is a legitimate States rights issue. The only thing is, most of the States aren't affected anymore. But some of the Western States are, and it is our lifeblood. 
The problem, of course, is the prevailing attitude of the Secretary of the Interior, who basically controls public land in our State--his particular attitude toward allowing us--which we can do under current law--to get across those public areas. But that is going to be taken away. And as a consequence of that, Mr. President, we are at the absolute mercy of the Secretary of the Interior if the motion to strike by my friend from Arkansas prevails. 
I am not going to speak about what happened in Utah last fall. The Senators from Utah are here to state that. It is a perfect example of what happens when a small cadre of administrative officials take it upon themselves to decide how America's public lands should be used. I have worked with my friend from Arkansas for a long time. We have been able to work on many issues that we agree upon. But during that time, we have had different approaches to some issues. In 1995, a number of Western Senators, upset about the Department of the Interior's proposed regulations on R.S. 2477, sought to place the language in the proposed highway bill overturning the effect of the proposed regulations. 
Many of my colleagues will remember that the final passage of that bill was delayed until late in the evening until we could resolve the issue during the day. The Senator from Arkansas and I met to discuss the issue. We didn't come out with any finality about how to solve the R.S. 2477 debate. But we did agree for the time being placing a moratorium on the Department from issuing any regulations. That made sense. 
So in the 1995 national highway bill there appeared a 1-year moratorium on the department from issuing any rules or regulations on the issue. For the most part, this held the status quo, as it has been for the past, as I said, 130 years in terms of R.S. 2477 right-of-way. 
I, along with a number of Western Senators, introduced Senate bill 1425 last Congress to set out an orderly process by which people can submit their right-of-way claims to the department to seek formal recognition. My friend from Arkansas opposed that, and in the end we agreed upon compromise legislation that passed out of the committee. The compromise legislation placed a permanent moratorium on the Government by stating, `No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal Government pertaining to the recognition, management, or validity of a right-of-way pursuant to Revised Statute 2477 shall take effect unless expressly authorized by an act of Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this act.' 
It is this language that was placed in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act, and is law today. We agreed to only prevent final rules and regulations in the hope that the Department would work on developing a more reasonable recognition process that could be submitted to Congress for approval. Unfortunately, it has been about 8 months now since that legislation passed, and there is no indication that the Secretary has any intention of submitting regulations. Instead, what the Secretary has decided now to do is to shred the longstanding departmental policy regarding R.S. 2477 regulations and replace it with his own. That is why this is an emergency now. It is the lifeblood of the Western States who are still developing and need access, and need the assurance that we will be able to cross public land as long as we are able to prove that we have traditionally used that access route prior to 1976--a wagon trail, a snow machine trail, a dog sled trail. And it doesn't mean much in New York. It doesn't mean much in Arkansas. But in Alaska that is how we can get there from here. We simply have to have that assurance. 
The real difference between the provision in the bill before Congress today and the permanent moratorium passed last year is that there is less likelihood that the administration will be able to find a way to skirt around congressional intent with this provision. 
Mr. President, in my State these were coveted promises that we were advised would be available to us when we accepted statehood--that we would have the opportunity to access across public land based on traditional utilization, trails, rights, and so forth. 
To make the statement that almost anywhere indiscriminately one could claim a route across public land, or parks, or recreation areas is absolutely absurd. The only areas, again, that have any justification for consideration under R.S. 2477 are the historical areas of use prior to 1976 across unreserved public lands. 
So, Mr. President, as we conclude this debate, I encourage my colleagues to dismiss the rhetoric suggested by my friend from Arkansas who is, obviously, carrying the weight of the Secretary of the Interior. But when he makes statements that just about anybody or any excuse is justifiable in coming across public land is unrealistic. When he suggests that this is no emergency and should not be on the appropriations supplemental, he is wrong because it is an emergency. They are going to take this away from us by administrative fiat. That is the bottom line. 
So here we are today, Mr. President, responsibly; 13,000 miles of road, an area one-fifth the size of the United States. This action by the Secretary of the Interior would eliminate the right 
that we have as a State, and the commitments that we had coming into the Union, to have the assurance that we would have continued access across public land. 
So I encourage my colleagues on this vote to recognize the significance of what this means to Western States. This was a promise made by the Federal Government--a commitment that they are proposing to take away. It is unrealistic. It is unjust. 
This belongs in here because we need the continued assurance that we will have an opportunity, and in an orderly manner, to pursue, if you will, access that was guaranteed when Alaska became a State and when other Western States came into the Union. 
I yield to the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Utah for yielding. I would like to highlight, specifically for the benefit of my friend from Arkansas, who is back on the floor, what this debate is about. It is about what a highway is. 
Looking at the State of Arkansas, it is quite clear what a highway is. A highway is, as indicated on the highway map of the State of Arkansas, extended networks of access across the State, traditionally used for recreation, commerce, and so forth. The question we have here before us is the definition by the Department of Interior, how they are defining a highway. In 1988, the Department, after months of discussion and consultations with the Western States, developed its official policy on the R.S. 2477 right-of-way. That policy worked in conjunction with the States, as they defined historically what a highway was. I will quote this definition, because this is what this debate is boiling down to: 
A definite route on which there is free and open use for the public. It need not necessarily be-- 
And this is the key. 
It need not necessarily be open to vehicular traffic, for pedestrian or pack animal or trail may qualify. 
It does not have to be for an automobile; pedestrian, pack animal, trail may qualify. That is where we have been in this debate up until now, and that is why it is appropriate that this be in here, to ensure that we will have that definition as opposed to what the Secretary of Interior has arbitrarily proposed in changing it. 
He proposes to state that, through an action used prior to October 21, 1976, `by the public for the passage of vehicles [cars] carrying people or goods from place to place.' That is the change. That is the significance. He is doing this arbitrarily. He is saying that no longer is pedestrian access or pack trail or wagon trial adequate. It must be vehicles. 
Mr. President, in 1917 they did not have very many vehicles in Alaska. We do not have very many today. But the point is, we have trails. We have to have the right, as evidenced by those trails, as we look at the restrictions that Federal withdrawals have placed on our State. And here they are, Mr. President. How in the world are we going to get across Federal lands? All these colors--the brown, the green, the cream--these are the Federal holdings in the State of Alaska. The only thing that belongs to the State that we have access through are the white areas. 
The point I want to make is, how in the world are we going to get a highway across from the Canadian border to the Bering Sea without crossing Federal land? We cannot do it. How are we going to get north? How are we going to cross all these Federal areas 
without this basic right that we had when we became a State 38 years ago? We are simply not going to be able to do it, unless we have this law that states specifically that the interpretation of a highway is for pedestrians, pack animals, to qualify. Because, Mr. President, if you look again at Alaska today, this is our highway network. That is where we are. That is our highways, 1,300 miles. We have a road north-south to Seward, a road over to the Canadian border. We have nothing to the west--absolutely nothing. This is an area one-fifth the size of the United States. 
My point is, under the law as it is currently stated, you must have proof of a traditional route across public land, prior to 1976, to qualify. The Secretary proposes to change that. He would say you have to have had a road. That eliminates Alaska. It eliminates much of Utah, and several other Western States are affected. That is where we are. 
I am reading from a definition of `highway.' 
The term `highway' is the generic name for all kinds of public ways. Whether they be carriage ways, bridle ways, foot bridges, turnpike roads, railroads, canals, ferries, navigable rivers, they are considered highways. 
But that is going to change under this definition. So, clearly what we are talking about is keeping in place the law that has been for 130 years in the departmental regulations as they have been codified since 1932, and again in 1994. 
The fact is, if R.S. 2477 was not in existence prior to October 1976, it will not and it cannot be, by definition, created now. So there is no threat here to public land. There is no threat to the parks. This is all a smokescreen. 
The reality is, we will simply be assured of having the rights-of-way across public land that we were promised as opposed to it being taken away. So I urge my colleagues to recognize the significance of what this inclusion means, why it is appropriate that it be there, why it is an emergency right now, and why I encourage all Members to reflect on the significance of this. The motion proposed by the Senator from Arkansas should be stricken, because it simply does not belong in the sense of his offering the amendment to strike this section. 
So, I see my friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, is seeking the floor. I yield the floor at this time, other than again to remind all my colleagues, what we are trying to do here is keep in place a law that for 130 years has provided us with the protection, the assurance that we would be able to cross public land if, indeed, we had valid proof that we had used the routes prior to 1976. So we would have the assurance of being able to proceed with the orderly development of our State. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend. 
I wonder if the Senator from Arkansas feels it is appropriate that the Secretary of the Interior arbitrarily has gone ahead and changed the definition of what a highway was. Is it right for the Secretary to take a previous policy that was worked out in conjunction with the States where there was a definitive highway definition in the historical terms--and I quote--`as a definite route or right-of-way that is freely open for all use, it need not necessarily be open to vehicular traffic, or a pedestrian or pack animal trail may qualify'--and as a consequence, isn't it true that this was the policy of the Department of the Interior until earlier this year when Secretary Babbitt, behind closed doors--not a public policy; behind closed doors, without consultation--unilaterally changed this definition? And isn't it true that the new definition now reads, `a thoroughfare used prior to October 21, 1976, by the public for the passage of vehicles carrying people or goods from place to place'? 
He changed the definition. 
Is that, I ask my friend from Arkansas, appropriate and fair and part of a public process, or, indeed, is that not a simple dictate by the Secretary who arbitrarily changes the interpretation of what was Federal law? Is that right, I ask my friend from Arkansas, and correct?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will respond relative to the issue that is before the Senate here, and that is the manner in which the Secretaries--Hodel on one occasion and, today, Secretary of the Interior Babbitt--have acted. 
First of all, as I indicated, Secretary Babbitt, behind closed doors, without consultation with Western States, unilaterally changed the definition. Don Hodel did not. Don Hodel worked out a policy in conjunction with the States defining a highway and its history, and it was done in consultation with the States. 
My friend from Arkansas should recognize that is a significant difference. This Secretary is moving on his own volition to interpret as he sees fit. The previous Secretary of the Interior brought in the Western States affected and they worked out a definition and a process. Now the definition has changed to any vehicles, and the appropriateness of that is what I question the Senator from Arkansas with regard to the motivation. 
It is here that one Secretary developed a public process.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Arkansas is aware of the circumstances under which the Secretary of the Interior initiated his arbitrary decision recognizing what the law says. I have a chart here. I will ask my friend from Arkansas relative to what R.S. 2477 says. The statute's authority grants right-of-way for the construction of highways over public lands not reserved for public use. We have defined, if you will, what it means as far as a highway is concerned.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is defined specifically under the law as pedestrian, or a pack animal trail may qualify. The Department's own regulations in 1938, state when a grant becomes self-effective. The grant refers to the section becoming effective upon the construction or establishment of a highway in accordance with the State law. That is the law of the land, the State law over public lands not reserved for public use. `No application should be filed under R.S. 2477, as no action on the part of the Federal Government is necessary.' That is the law. 
What Secretary Babbitt is doing is saying you have to file. He is changing and reinterpreting the law 20 years after it was repealed. 
I ask the Senator if that is not a correct interpretation of what this Secretary is doing. He is changing the law. He is saying you must file. The law says you don't have to file. 
Is not that correct? I ask my friend from Arkansas. Is he not redefining the law?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is what prevailing regulations stated during the entire time that the act was in effect. What this Secretary has done, unlike Hodel, who met with all the other Governors--let me add for the Record at this time the letter from our Governor dated January 29 to the Secretary. 
Dear Mr. Secretary: I wish to express my dismay about your issuance of a revised policy on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way determinations without consultation with the State of Alaska or, to my knowledge, other Western States. The department not only failed to seek comment or input from Alaska, it did not even pay the courtesy of informing the state that it planned such a revision. Further, the department did not even notify the state when it released the revised policy publicly. 
Don Hodel didn't do that. Don Hodel met, my friend, the senior Senator said, with a Democratic Governor of my State and consulted on the policy. He did it publicly in an open process. It was the input of the Western States that brought the withdrawn definition and policy together. This Secretary changed that definition and simply suggested that it be the passage of vehicle traffic, and that is contrary to the law.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we have gone on perhaps long enough on this, but there are a few things that need to be said relative to the debate that has just occurred. And while my friend from Arkansas indicated that we had repealed FLPMA, with regard to FLPMA, I think it is important the record reflect that under R.S. 2477 we established and have always maintained the basis for determining the right of public access across public lands. 
So that has been maintained in the law. I think it is further noteworthy to recognize that the Hodel policy recognized the historic use of a route. If it was historically a footpath, it was recognized as a footpath. If it was a wagon trail, then it was recognized as a wagon trail. If it was a wagon trail that was used in general commerce over an extended period of time, then it justified obviously inclusion under the concept of R.S. 2477. 
In summation, Mr. President, what is happening here I think is a result of what happened as late as last year in Utah where we had a perfect example of a small group within the administration taking it upon themselves to decide for all Americans how our public lands should be used. As the debate has indicated, those of us from Alaska are particularly sensitive, as we can speak from long personal experience on this topic. All of the experience teaches us that decisions affecting the use and classification of our public lands must be left in the hands of a public process, not one Secretary of the Interior who decides on his own as a consequence of actions within the Department, without a public policy, that he is going to change the procedure unilaterally and redefine what constitutes an adequate method of transportation across public lands, and that is what this Secretary did, unlike Secretary Hodel. 
Actions from this administration put the public's right to participate in the decisionmaking process, as far as I am concerned, on the endangered species list. 
Mr. President, allowing this administration, and that is what the proposal from the Secretary of the Interior does, to rewrite public land law use through the enactment of regulations is much the same as putting the fox in charge of the chicken coup. 
The reason we in Alaska are a little reflective upon this is the history of our State. In 1966, the Secretary of the Interior--we entered into statehood in 1959--Secretary Udall decided on his own to intercede in Alaska and simply stopped processing land selections authorized under the Statehood Act. We entered into the State of the Union with a commitment of 104 million acres. The land was being transferred to the State. He stopped the process. He did not ask anyone, just did it. In January 1969, he withdrew all public lands in Alaska from all forms of appropriation except mining claims--no public input, no congressional action. This was the so-called land freeze, superfreeze. A few other names which would be inappropriate in this Senate Chamber come to mind. 
It happened again in 1978, deja vu, this time with Jimmy Carter, who stepped in and decided on his own what was best for the management of our public lands, and using the 1906 Antiquities Act he created 17 national monuments. These monuments encompassed slightly more than 56 million acres of land, an area the size of the State of South Carolina. It did not stop there. This was followed in short order by Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus who withdrew an additional 50 million acres. In total that arbitrary action by the Secretary of the Interior withdrew 105 million acres. That is more than the entire State of California. All this land was withdrawn from multiple use without any input from the people of Alaska, any input from the public, any input from Members of Congress. 
I ask you, can you understand why we are sensitive? With all these actions held over Alaska's head, we were forced to cut the best deal we could. Twenty years later, the people of our State are still struggling to cope with the weight of these decisions. When they say you forget history, why, I say you are doomed by it, doomed to repeat it if you do not remember. So as long as we stand in this Chamber people will not be allowed to forget what happened when the public and the Congress are excluded from the public land management decisions. 
When my friend from Arkansas says that this does not belong in this legislation, that it does not belong because it is not an emergency, he is absolutely wrong. It is an emergency. This is an action arbitrarily proposed by the Secretary of the Interior now. It is contrary to law, and it has to be stopped. 
Mr. President, again, the fact is if R.S. 2477 was not in existence on October 21, 1976, it will not and it cannot by definition be created now. We have no problem with that. We want that to be the case. What we do not want is the Secretary to arbitrarily suddenly come to the conclusion that if vehicle travel has not proceeded over these routes prior to October 21, 1976, there is no justification for inclusion. 
So in closing, Mr. President, I wish that we did not have to address this issue at this time, but it is an emergency for the Western States. It belongs on the first legislative vehicle that we can get the attention of the Congress relative to taking action. I thought we put this to an end in a bipartisan manner last year when we enacted a permanent moratorium on future actions by the Department, but that was not good enough for the Secretary. So behind closed doors this Secretary has sought to disregard the spirit and the intent of our previous action. 
We have no other alternative, Mr. President, but to pursue this in a manner to continue to have available the viability of historical transportation routes that were in existence across our State, so that we can bring our State together, recognizing the huge amount of Federal withdrawal that is evidenced on this chart by the colored areas that represent all Federal withdrawals as compared to the white areas which simply address the State holdings. So one can readily see the necessity of having the option to establish, if you will, access routes across traditional 
trails that existed that were dog sled routes, or footpaths, that were used for commerce prior to that 1976 date. We simply have to have the assurance that that will remain as the law of the land and we can continue to allow, after our short 39 years of existence as a State, the development of our State, we can be bound together. That is why it is an emergency and that is why I commend my good friend and senior Senator for putting this in this legislation because there is no question it is an emergency of the highest nature in the State of Alaska and certainly affects the other Western States as well as we have seen the withdrawal of 1.6 million acres under the Antiquities Act in Utah by this administration. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to rise this afternoon to introduce a very important piece of legislation that I know the occupant of the chair will find interesting. It is called the Public Land Management Participation Act of 1997. 
This legislation is intended to put the word `public' and the populace back into public land management and the word `environment,' back into environmental protection. 
Passage of this act will ensure that all the gains that we made over the past quarter of a century in creating an open, participatory Government which affords strong environmental protection for our public lands are really protected. 
For those who thought that those battles were fought and won with the passage of the National Environmental Protection Act in 1969 and the Federal Land Policy Management Act in 1976, I have some bad news. There is one last battle to be fought. 
Standing in this very Chamber on January 20, 1975, Mr. President, Senator Henry `Scoop' Jackson of Washington State spoke to the passion Americans feel for their public lands. He said: 
The public lands of the United States have always provided the arena in which we Americans have struggled to fulfill our dreams. Even today dreams of wealth, adventure, and escape are still being acted out on those far-flung public lands. These lands and the dreams--fulfilled and unfulfilled--which they foster are part of our national destiny. They belong to all Americans. 
I quote and emphasize, Mr. President, `They belong to all Americans.' 
Amazingly--there exist today legal authorities by which the President, without the public process or congressional approval, can create vast land management units called national monuments, world heritage sites, and biospheric reserves. 
Special management units which affect how millions of acres of our public lands are managed. What people can do on those lands is also affected, what the future will be for surrounding communities. 
That is a powerful trust to bestow on anyone, even a President. 
On September 12, 1996, the good people of Utah woke up to find themselves the most recent recipient of a philosophy that says, `Trust us. We are from the Government, and we know what is best for you.' On that day, standing not in Utah but in the State of Arizona, our President invoked the 1906 Antiquities Act to create 1.7 million acres of national monument in southern Utah. 
Notice, Mr. President, he did not do this in Utah. He did it in Arizona. One can only assume he might have had some protests if he had done it in Utah. The withdrawal, however, took place in Utah. It created a 1.7 million acre national monument in the southern part of the State. By utilizing this antiquated law, the President was able to avoid--that's right, avoid--Nation's environmental laws and ignore public participation laws as well. With one swipe of the pen, every shred of public input and environmental law promulgated in this country over the past quarter of a century was shoved into the trash heap of political expediency. 
What happened in Utah last fall is but the latest example of a small cadre of administration officials deciding for all Americans how our public lands should be used. It is by no means the only one, Mr. President. As the Senator from Alaska, I have had a great deal of personal experience in this area. 
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter created 17 national monuments in Alaska covering more than 55 million acres of lands. That is an area about the size of South Carolina. He withdrew these lands, with the stroke of his pen--no public process, no hearing, no participation from the State. This was then followed in short order by Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus, who withdrew an additional 50 million. A total of 105 million acres, Mr. President. All this land was withdrawn for multiple use without any input from the people of my State, the public, or the Congress 
of the United States. With over 100 million acres of withdrawn land held over Alaska's head, like the sword of Damocles; we were forced to cut the best deal we could. Twenty years later, the people of my State are still struggling to cope with the weight of these decisions. 
I would not be here this afternoon if the public, the people of Utah and Congress, had not been denied a voice in the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. I would not be here if environmental protection procedures had not been ignored. 
But the people were denied the opportunity to speak. Mr. President, Congress was denied its opportunity to participate, and environmental procedure was simply ignored. The only voice we have heard was the President's. Without bothering to ask us what we thought about it, he told the citizens of Utah and the rest of the country that he knew better than we did what was good for us. 
Now, this is an administration that prides itself in a public process. There was no public process here, Mr. President. We had been debating for some time the issue of Utah wilderness. It was ongoing, but the President, for political expediency, took it upon himself to invoke the Antiquities Act. It has been a long time since anyone has had the right to make those kind of unilateral public land decisions for the American public. Since the passages of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act in 1976, we have had a system of law underpinning public land use decisions. Embodied with this law is public participation. Agencies propose an action, they present the action to the public, the public debates the issue. The public can then appeal bad decisions, the courts resolve the disputes, and the management unit is then created. 
Where was this public process, Mr. President, in the special use designation of 1.7 million acres of Federal land in southern Utah? The answer is clear: There wasn't any. Since the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, activities which affect the environment are subject to strict environmental laws. Does anyone believe there was no environmental threat posed by the creation of a national monument? 
Imagine how the sensitive natural features of the high desert environment would respond to the rhythmic pounding of unlimited hiking boots worn by legions of adoring visitors as they tromp through the area. Where is the NEPA compliance documentation associated with this action? There is not any. 
The creation of specialized public use designations such as national parks and wilderness areas are debated within the Halls of Congress, right here. These debates provide for the financial and legal responsibilities which come with the creation of special management units. 
Where are the proceedings from those debates? There aren't any, Mr. President. They simply don't exist because, in the heat of an election year, the administration determined that the public process, environmental analyses and congressional deliberations were simply a waste of time. 
Mr. President, either you believe in a public process or you do not; you can't have it both ways. If we can no longer trust the administration to involve the public in major land use decisions, then where does it fall? It falls right here to the Congress. 
Mr. President, the legislation which I offer today will require any future designations of national monuments, world heritage sites, or biospheric reserves to follow the public participation principles laid down under existing law over the past 25 years. No poetic images, no flowery words, no smoke and mirrors, just good old-fashioned public land management process. 
Before these special land management units can be created, my legislation will require that the agencies gather and analyze resource data affected by the land use decisions; full public participation in the creation of these units with all appeal rights protected; compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; congressional review and ratification, and Presidential signature. 
No longer will an administration be able to sidestep public participation and environmental reviews to further political agendas. Nobody--not even the President of the United States --should be above the law. 
The Public Land Management Participation Act will make all future land use decisions a joint responsibility of the public, the Congress, and the President--no more loopholes. 
I don't question the need for national monuments, world heritage sites, or biospheric reserves. Sometimes they are needed to protect historic treasures, natural resources, et cetera. But if they are to serve the common good, they must be created under the same system of land management law that has governed the use of the public domain for the past 25 years. 
There has always been a sacred bond between the American people and the lands they hold in common ownership. No one, regardless of high station or political influence, has the right to impose his will over the means by which the destiny of those lands is decided. This legislation reestablishes that bond.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Georgia recognizing the North Pole. 
First, let me say a few words about the effort of my good friend from Georgia in bringing to the attention of this body, as well as to the Nation, the importance of the Volunteer Protection Act. The issue before us is vital; it is a matter defending the noble act of personal sacrifice and contribution for the benefit and good of others. So I commend the Senator for his diligence, the time he spent on the floor, and the effort that has been made. And I look forward to supporting the effort for the Volunteer Protection Act which has been introduced by Senator Coverdell of Georgia. 
Let me just ask my colleagues to bear with me for a moment. As we know, this past week President Clinton and other prominent Americans appeared in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the city where our American heritage is rooted. What better place to come to for the recognition of voluntarism and what it means to this country, because those who founded our Constitution--our early efforts to formulate the principles of this country--were all volunteers. They were volunteers coming forward and contributing their knowledge, their expertise, their willingness to formulate a nation. So it was certainly appropriate that a summit on voluntarism was held in the city of Philadelphia during the past week. But what did this summit really accomplish? 
I am told there were balloons, streamers, speeches, and a lot of good photo ops. But, unfortunately, we have to look at the bottom line and ask what was accomplished? How much was 
accomplished? It brought the issue to the American people. But, specifically, what did we get out of it? Because I think the summit ignored the fact that, in order for the spirit of voluntarism to flourish, you must, first of all, have real reform in our American judicial system. 
What the Senate is basically doing today, and what we have been trying to do for the past 4 days--for the past 4 days--is not put on a highly publicized summit about voluntarism. We are trying to reform a justice system that deters voluntarism. 
I am pleased, after several days of procedural delay, we have finally begun debate on this important legislation. 
Mr. President, recent congressional findings reveal that our legal liability system deters voluntarism. In fact, according to the testimony given before a congressional committee last year, one in six volunteers withholds his or her services due to the fear of exposure to a lawsuit. That is the system that we have unfortunately devised. If that figure is applied to the number of volunteers in nonprofit organizations alone, we might see as many as 100,000 have had to decline to serve because of the fear of being sued. 
America's litigation explosion forces nonprofit organizations to spend an ever-increasing amount of time and resources preparing for and avoiding lawsuits. The American Society of Association Executives testified before Congress last year that the association's liability insurance premiums increased an average of 155 percent; one in eight nonprofit organizations reported an increase of insurance premiums of 300 percent alone. This has put some of our most revered nonprofit organizations at risk. 
For example, Dr. Creighton Hale of Little League Baseball reports that the liability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795, in the last 5 years. Because most leagues cannot afford such an expense, many operate without insurance. Some have, unfortunately, been disbanded altogether. The bill before us protects volunteers from liability unless they cause harm through reckless or criminal conduct. 
This common-sense approach legislation would put an end to tragic liability cases such a 1990 negligence case in which a Chicago jury awarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a car crash. Who was the negligent party? According to the jury, it was the estate of the volunteer--the estate of the volunteer, who gave his life attempting to save that boy. 
Here are just a few other examples of recent outrageous litigation which threatens voluntarism. 
In Oregon, a boy on a Boy Scout outing suffered a serious injury while playing tag football. The court dismissed the original lawsuit filed against the Boy Scouts, due to an insufficient nexus between the Boy Scouts and the youth's injury. The injured boy then decided to sue the volunteers who supervised the game. In one of the largest monetary verdicts in Oregon history, the jury found the two volunteers liable for $7 million. 
When a 10-year-old boy in New Jersey lost a fly ball in the Sun during Little League practice, the ball dropped and hit the boy in the eye. The boy's coaches were sued for negligence. 
In Oklahoma City, a member of an amateur softball league was so angered when he was ejected from a game that he drove away in a fit of rage and crashed his car. So what does the ejected player do? He files a suit against the umpire. 
According to William J. Cople, a Washington lawyer who is pro bono counsel for the Boy Scouts of America, `Volunteers have simply been swept away in the hysteria of litigation. . . . Suits are brought for almost anything, under any circumstances.' What good comes from these suits? Well, about all you can say is that they keep a lot lawyers in business. 
Mr. President, the bill we are debating will help put an end to such unwarranted litigation. This bill creates a system in which plaintiffs sue only for good reason and sue only those who are responsible for the damage. Such common-sense reforms will create an atmosphere which will nurture voluntarism. This 
legislation will foster the spirit of voluntarism, not just speak about it at a photo op. 
For centuries, volunteers in America have fed our hungry, sheltered our homeless, instilled values in our youth. Volunteers are vital, as we know, to our survival as a moral nation. It is time we gave volunteers something in return, and that something is this legislation that will protect them from frivolous and outrageous legal attacks that are the result of a judicial system in desperate need of reform. 
Finally, there is something else I believe we should do to encourage the volunteer spirit in America. This is to allow volunteers to get a more realistic tax deduction for their travel costs associated with charitable activities. Later today, I, along with Senator Cochran, will be introducing the Charitable Equity Mileage Act of 1997. This bill will increase the standard mileage rate of deduction for charitable use of an automobile from 12 cents a mile to 18 cents a mile. I think this bill should be unanimously supported by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Further, many of our citizens who volunteer for charitable activities do incur expenses for which they are not reimbursed. For example, when an individual uses his or her automobile to deliver a meal to a home-bound elderly individual or to transport children to Scouting activities, the volunteer usually pays the transportation costs out of his or her own pocket with no expectations of reimbursement. I believe the costs associated with charitable transportation services ought to be deductible at a rate which fairly represents the individual's actual costs. This is especially important for volunteers living in rural communities who have to travel long distances to provide community services. 
Congress, in 1984, set the standard mileage exemption deduction rate of 12 cents per mile for individuals who use their automobiles in connection with charitable activities. At the time the standard mileage rate for business use of an automobile was 20.5 cents per mile. In the intervening 13 years, the business mileage rate has increased to 30.5 cents per mile, but the charitable rate has remained unchanged at 12 cents per mile because the Treasury Department does not have the authority to adjust the rate. By raising the charitable rate to 18 cents a mile, my legislation, I think, restores the relationship that existed in 1984 between the charitable mileage rate and the business mileage rate. In addition, the legislation authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to increase the charitable mileage rate in the same manner as is currently allowed for business mileage expenses. 
All of us agree that, with the changing role of the Federal Government, we need to do more to encourage voluntarism in our country. The Volunteer Protection Act will do that, and so will the legislation that I am introducing. Volunteers who provide transport services should be allowed to deduct such costs at a rate which fairly reflects their true out-of-pocket costs, and this is precisely what the bill does. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me in sponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the past week, we have heard a great deal of discussion regarding voluntarism in America. In Philadelphia, President Clinton has been joined by former President Bush and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, in what has been styled a voluntarism summit. 
On the floor of the Senate, we have been attempting to move legislation, which I believe should not be controversial, that would protect volunteers from fear of legal actions resulting from their efforts. I would hope that the impasse over this bill could be broken and we could move forward on this important bill. 
In the spirit of encouraging more volunteer efforts in America, I am today introducing the Charitable Equity Mileage Act of 1997. This bill will increase the standard mileage rate deduction for charitable use of an automobile from 12 cents a mile to 18 cents a mile. I think this bill should be unanimously supported by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I reintroduced a bill that I introduced some years ago. I think it is a very important measure. It is a measure that will unlock and open a door that Congress has kept barred for over 100 years. By opening this door, we are going to create thousands of new jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity, and significant revenue for the Federal and State and local governments. Furthermore, that door can be opened with no adverse impact on any existing U.S. industry, U.S. labor interest, or on the environment. And it will cost the Federal Government nothing. 
There is no magic to this. In fact, it is a very simple matter. This bill allows U.S. seaports to compete for the ever-growing cruise ship trade, specifically to my State of Alaska, but all west coast ports, Tacoma, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and so forth, would benefit. Further, it would encourage the development of an all-Alaska cruise business as well. 
The bill I propose amends the Passenger Service Act to allow foreign cruise ships to operate from U.S. ports to Alaska and between Alaska ports. However, it also very carefully protects all existing U.S. passenger vessels by using a definition of cruise ship designed to exclude any foreign flag vessel that could conceivably compete in the same market as U.S.-flag tour boats, ferries, vessels that carry cargo, et cetera. 
Finally, it provides a mechanism to guarantee that if a U.S. vessel, a cruise vessel, ever enters this trade in the future, steps will be taken to ensure an ample pool of potential passengers. Specifically, it would require that foreign-flag vessels of greater passenger capacity will be required to leave the market upon the entry of any U.S. cruise ship. 
People say, don't we have U.S. passenger ships? We have one, just one left: the Constitution, that operates off the Hawaiian Islands. The last U.S. passenger ship that was built to cruise ship capability, was the S.S. United States, nearly 40 years ago. We are simply not in the cruise passenger business in the United States anymore, but foreign ships from the Caribbean are. They move to Alaska and the west coast of British Columbia in the summer, where they carry passengers between American ports and foreign ports, but cannot carry passengers between U.S. ports. What we are proposing is we simply allow those vessels on the west coast to carry passengers from west coast U.S. ports such as San Francisco and Tacoma, to Alaska, and on intra-Alaska voyages. 
This is a straightforward approach to a vexing problem that deserves support by this body. 
Let us look at the facts. The U.S. ports currently are precluded--let me emphasize this--U.S. ports are precluded from competing for the Alaska cruise ship trade by the Passenger Service Act of--when? Of 1886. That act bars foreign vessels from carrying passengers on one-way voyages between the U.S. ports. However, it is not 1886 anymore. These days, no one--no one is building any U.S. passenger ship of this type. And no one has built one in over 40 years. The S.S. United States was the last one. 
Let me again emphasize that it is not 1886 anymore. These days, no one is building any U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed, U.S.-built cruise ships of the type that are in the cruise business and sail out of Caribbean ports in the wintertime and out of Vancouver, 
British Columbia, to Alaska in the summertime. 
Because there are no U.S. vessels in this important trade, the only real effect the Passenger Service Act has been to force all vessels sailing to my State of Alaska to base their operations in a foreign port, namely Vancouver, British Columbia. 
In essence, Mr. President, what we have here is an act of Congress prohibiting U.S. cities from competing for thousands of jobs, and for hundreds of millions of business dollars. This is absurd. It is worse than absurd. In light of our ever-popular election year promises to keep the economy growing, I suggest it belongs to Letterman's top 10 reasons why Congress oftentimes does not know what it is doing. 
Can anyone argue with a straight face for the continuation of a policy that fails utterly to benefit any identifiable American interest, while actively discouraging economic growth? 
This is not the first time I have introduced this legislation. When I began the process, Alaska-bound cruise passengers totaled about 200,000 per year. By last year, 445,000 people, most of them American citizens, were making that voyage. This year's traffic may exceed 500,000 people. Almost all of those passengers are sailing to and from Vancouver, British Columbia, not because Vancouver is necessarily a better port, but because our own foolish policy demands it. 
I have nothing but admiration for my friends in British Columbia and the city of Vancouver. They have done a fine job. But we are simply spiting ourselves and our own U.S. interests and it is time we looked at this issue rationally. The cash flow generated by this trade is enormous. Most of these passengers fly in and out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington State, but because of this law they spend little time there. Instead they spend their pre- and post-sailing time in a Vancouver hotel, in a bus to Vancouver, at a Vancouver restaurant, a Vancouver coffee shop, and when their vessel sails it is loaded with food, fuel, general supplies, repair, maintenance needs taken care of--by Canadian vendors. 
There is nothing wrong with that, but this business could be in the United States. According to some of our estimates, the city of Vancouver receives benefits of well over $200 million a year. Others provide more modest estimates, such as a comprehensive study done by the International Council of Cruise Lines, which indicated that in 1992 alone, the Alaska cruise trade generated over 2,400 jobs for the city of Vancouver, plus payments to Canadian vendors and employees of over $119 million. 
If that business had taken place in the United States, in U.S. ports such as Tacoma or San Francisco, it would have been worth additional Federal, State and local tax revenues of approximately $60 million. 
I note that there is interest now in ports in South Carolina to offer sailings along the eastern seaboard. It is interesting to note also that we have already seen fit to exempt Puerto Rico from the Passenger Service Act, under less onerous restrictions than in this bill, so that foreign vessels are allowed to from the United States to the territory of Puerto Rico. So we have made these exceptions, they can work without destroying the fabric of our life, and there is no justification why this should not also be done for voyages from the west coast to Alaska. 
In addition to the opportunities now being shunted to Vancouver, we are also missing an opportunity to create entirely new jobs and increased income flow by developing new cruise routes between Alaska ports. 
The city of Ketchikan, AK, was told a few years ago that there were two relatively small cruise lines that were very interested in establishing short cruises within southeastern Alaska, and indeed, were interested in basing their vessels in Ketchikan. I am told such a business could have contributed as much as $2 million or more to that small community's economy and created dozens of new jobs, but because of the current policy, the opportunity simply evaporated. 
Why, Mr. President, do we allow this to happen? This is a market almost entirely focused on U.S. citizens going to see one of the most spectacular States of the United States, namely, Alaska, and yet we force them to go to another country, Canada, to do it. We are throwing away both jobs and money and getting nothing in return. Why is this allowed to happen? The answer is simple, but it is not rational. 
Although the current law is a job loser, there are those who argue that any change would weaken U.S. maritime interests. I submit that simply is not the case. For some inexplicable reason, paranoia seems to run deep among those who oppose this bill. They seem to feel that, by amending the Passenger Service Act so that it makes sense for the United States and would create jobs, somehow it is a threat to the Jones Act. That is not true. The vessels covered under the Jones Act haul freight, not passengers, between U.S. ports. They are required to be U.S. built, U.S. crewed, and U.S. documented, and because this protects an existing industry, we support that. But the circumstances for freight vessels do not exist for passenger ships. 
There is simply no connection whatsoever between the two issues. I have repeatedly made it clear that I have no intention of using this bill to create cracks in the Jones Act. This bill would actually enhance, not impede, opportunities for U.S. workers--shipyard workers and certainly longshoremen, not to mention hotel and restaurant workers, and many others who would have a great deal to gain from this legislation. 
The bill has been carefully written to prevent the loss of any existing jobs in other trades. As I have said before, Puerto Rico already enjoys an exemption from the Passenger Service Act. We looked at that exemption--which has worked successfully--and drafted this effort with even more care in mind. 
Finally, there can be no suggestion that this bill might harm smaller U.S. tour or excursion vessels built in U.S. yards with U.S. crews. The industry featuring these small vessels is thriving and doing well but simply does not cater to the same clientele and 
same base as the larger cruise ships. For one thing, the tour boats operating in Alaska are much smaller. The smallest foreign flag vessel eligible under this is Carnival Cruise Lines Wind Star, which is about 5,700 gross deadweight tons. It overnights approximately 159 passengers. 
By contrast, although the largest U.S. vessel in the Alaska trade is rated at 138 passengers, she is less than 100 gross deadweight tons. This means there is a vast difference between these two vessels. The small U.S. vessels should be protected from foreign competition, and our bill does that, but it does so with the realization that not all markets, and not all passengers, are the same. 
The fact of the matter is that there is no significant competition between the two types of vessels, because the passengers inclined to one are not likely to be inclined to the other. The larger passenger vessels offer unmatched luxury, personal service, onboard shopping, entertainment, gaming and so forth. The smaller vessels offer more flexible routes, the ability to get closer to the extraordinary natural attractions along the way and are able to get into the smaller communities. 
Now Mr. President, in the spirit of full disclosure, let me acknowledge that there is one operating U.S. vessel that does not fit the mold, as I mentioned earlier. That is the Constitution, an aging 30,000-ton vessel operating only in Hawaii. It was a U.S. flag vessel that was built years ago to operate in the United States. It went out of U.S. operation, into foreign flag service, then was refitted. It took action by Congress to allow it to come back into the U.S. trade. 
This is the only oceangoing-capable U.S. ship that might fit the description of a cruise vessel, but I question its ability to compete, certainly in the market with the newer cruise vessels. And I repeat, it is the only one. I searched for other U.S. vessels that meet or exceed the 5,000-ton limit in the bill, and the only ones I found that even approach it are the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen, both of which are approximately 3,300 tons and both of which are somewhat like 19th century riverboats. They can operate on the Mississippi and other large rivers, but are entirely unsuitable for any open-ocean itinerary. 
I cannot claim this legislation would immediately lead to increased earnings to U.S. ports. There are advantages of operating out of Vancouver--the sailing time to Alaska is shorter, and so forth. But I can say that it would allow U.S. ports--ports like Tacoma and San Francisco--to compete fairly for this lucrative business. 
Instead of being anchored by a rule that is actively harmful to U.S. interests, as I said at the beginning, this is only a way to open the door so we can look at what we are losing and look at what we can gain. 
We heard a lot of talk about growing the economy and creating jobs during the last years, and we all know that such changes are easy to talk about but difficult to accomplish. Here is a bill that opens up the door to thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars, and can do it without 1 red cent of the taxpayers' money. Isn't that worth thinking about? 
It has been 110 years since the current law was enacted, and it is time for a change.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in my State of Alaska the University of Alaska is the oldest post-secondary school. The university was chartered prior to statehood and has played a vital role in educating Alaskans as well as students from around the world. The expertise of the university has been in many areas, mining, agriculture, arctic and subarctic sciences. 
Additionally, the university has served as an important cornerstone in the history of our State. For example, the university housed the Alaska Constitutional Convention where the fathers of our statehood act carved out the rights and privileges guaranteed to Alaskan citizens. Further, Mr. President, the university is proud of the fact that it began life as the Alaska Agricultural and Mining College. However, Mr. President, what makes the University of Alaska unique is the fact that it is the only land-grant college in the Nation that is virtually landless today. 
As some of my colleagues know, one of the oldest and most respected ways of financing America's educational system has been from the land-grant system. This was established in 1785 and the practice gives land to schools and universities for their use in supporting their educational endeavors. in 1862, Congress passed what was then known as the Morrill Act, which created the land-grant colleges and universities as a way to underwrite the cost of higher education to more and more of America's young people. These colleges and universities received land from the Federal Government for facility location, and more importantly as a way to provide for sustaining revenues to those educational institutions. 
Mr. President, the University of Alaska received the smallest amount of land of any State, with the exception of Delaware that has a land-grant college. Delaware received about 90,000 acres. Even the land-grant college in Rhode Island received more land from the Federal Government than has the University of Alaska. Rhode Island received 120,000 acres. 
In a State the size of Alaska, about 365 million acres, we should logically have one of the best and most fully funded land-grant colleges in the country. Yet, to date, the University of Alaska only has about 111,000 acres. Unfortunately, without the land promised to Alaska under the land-grant allocation system in earlier legislation, the university is unable to share as one of the premier land-grant colleges in this country. 
Previous efforts were made in Congress to fix this problem. These efforts date back to 1915, less than 50 years after the passage of the Morrill Act, when Alaska's delegate to Congress, Delegate James Wickersham shepherded a measure through Congress that set aside potentially more than a quarter of a million acres in the Tanana Valley outside Fairbanks for the support of an agriculture college and school of mines. 
Following the practice established in the lower 48 States for the other land-grant colleges, Wickersham's bill set aside every section 33 of the unsurveyed Tanana Valley for the Alaska Agriculture College and Schools of Mines. 
Alaska's educational future at that time looked favorable. Many Alaskans saw the opportunity to set up an endowment system similar to that set up by the University of Washington in the downtown center of Seattle, WA, where valuable university lands are leased providing funding for the university's maintenance and upkeep as well as some capital projects. 
However, in Alaska's case, before the land could be transferred to the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, renamed the University of Alaska in 1935, the land had to be surveyed in order to establish the exact acreage included in the reserve lands. 
The section reserved for education could not be transferred to the college until they had been delineated. According to records at the time, it was unlikely given the incredibly slow speed of surveying that the land could be completely surveyed before the end of the current century. Surveying is still an extraordinarily slow 
process in Alaska's remote and unpopulated terrain. 
In all, only 19 section 33's, or approximately 11,211 acres, were ever transferred to the University of Alaska. Of this, 2,250 acres were used for the original campus, and the remainder was left to the discretion of the board of regents to support educational programs and facilities. 
Recognizing the difficulties of surveying in Alaska, subsequent legislation was passed in 1929 that simply granted land for the benefit of the university. This grant totaled approximately 100,000 acres, and to this day comprises the bulk of the university's total 111,211 acres of land--less than one-third of what was originally promised. In 1958, the Alaska Statehood Act was passed which extinguished the unfulfilled land grants. The university was thus left with little land with which to support itself and is thus unable to completely fulfill its mission as a land-grant college. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would redeem the promises made to the university in 1915 and put the university on an even footing with other land-grant colleges in the United States. It provides the university with the land needed to support itself financially and it offers the chance to grow and continue to act as a responsible steward of the land and educator of young Alaskans. It also provides a concrete timetable under which the university must select its land and the Secretary of Interior must act upon those selections. 
This legislation also contains significant restrictions on the land that the university can select. The university cannot select land located within a conservation system unit, land validly conveyed to the State or an ANCSA corporation or land used in connection with Federal or military institutions. 
Accordingly, Mr. President, under my bill, the university must relinquish extremely valuable inholdings in Alaska once it receives its second-tier State/Federal grant under section 6, of this bill. Therefore, the result of this legislation will mean, specifically, relinquishment of prime university inholdings in such magnificent areas as the Alaska Peninsula and Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, the Kenai Fjords National Park, Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve and Denali Park and Preserve. Mr. President, not only does this bill uphold a decades-old promise to the University of Alaska, it further protects Alaska's unique parks and refuges. 
Recognize, Mr. President, my bill requires the State to participate in the process, as well, under an option. Specifically, the bill would grant the university 250,000 acres of Federal land. The university would be eligible to receive another 250,000 acres of Federal land on a matching basis with the State, for a total of 500,000 additional acres. This would be at the option of the legislature, the Governor, and the university's board of regents 
Mr. President, the State matching provision is an important component of this legislation. Most agree with the premise that the university was shorted land. However, some believe it is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government to compensate the university with land, while others believe it is solely the responsibility of the State to grant the university land. The legislation I am introducing today offers a compromise, a compromise giving both the State and the Federal Government the opportunity to contribute, as well as provide the Government with valuable inholdings in Federal parks and preserves. 
With the passage of this bill, Mr. President, the University of Alaska will finally be able to act fully as a land grant college, and will be able to select lands that can provide the university with stable revenue sources, as well as provide responsible stewardship for the lands. 
This is an exciting time for the University of Alaska. The promises that were made 82 years ago could be fulfilled with this legislation, and Alaskans could look forward to a very bright future for the university and the many Alaskans who receive an education there.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1997. Enactment of this legislation is long overdue. 
Mr. President, the Public Utility Holding Company Act was enacted in 1935 to curb serious abuses by utilities that hurt consumers. Back then it was needed, but since then much has changed. As a result, PUHCA now does more harm than good. 
This legislation will eliminate unnecessary regulation. It will also streamline and make more effective the regulation that is still needed. By doing so, it will promote competition in the electric power industry without jeopardizing consumer protections. 
Over the past six decades, a comprehensive State-Federal regulatory system has been developed to protect consumers. In a nutshell, State public utility commissions regulate transactions that are intrastate in nature, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates those that are interstate in nature. State commissions perform their regulatory activities pursuant to State law, and the FERC performs it pursuant to the Federal Power Act. 
With the maturity of both State and Federal utility regulation, PUHCA is now at best superflouous, but in some instances it actually interferes with appropriate regulation. For example, the Ohio Power court case held that decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission under PUHCA preempt FERC's regulatory authority over utilities under the Federal Power Act. This legislation solves that problem by giving the FERC clear and exclusive authority to address matters within its jurisdiction and expertise. It will also enhance the ability of State regulatory agencies to do their jobs. In short, the streamlining of the regulatory system proposed by this legislation will not diminish needed consumer protection, and in several important ways it will actually enhance it. 
If the regulatory system created by PUHCA were necessary for consumer protection, then the regulatory burdens it imposes might be justified. But as everyone now acknowledges, PUHCA is not needed to protect consumers. As a result, regulatory costs caused by PUHCA are simply passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates without any offsetting consumer benefits. 
Congress has long recognized that PUHCA creates problems. In 1978, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act provided an exemption from PUHCA for certain types of electric power generators. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act gave additional exemptions to certain other types of electric power generators. These were Band-Aid fixes to PUHCA; needed, but not a complete solution. Fundamental reform of PUHCA is needed and is justified. The time is ripe to streamline and modernize the act. It is for these reasons that I am cosponsoring Senator D'Amato's legislation. 
Mr. President, there may be some who will try to use this legislation as a vehicle to restructure the electric utility industry, including to impose retail wheeling or to federally preempt State public utility commissions. I will strenuously resist any such effort. I have received assurances that Senator D'Amato is of like mind. This is not the place to do this. Retain wheeling and other utility competitive issues are not linked to the issues involved in PUHCA reform. Moreover, retail wheeling and other Federal Power Act matters are entirely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, not the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, to which this legislation will be referred. Electric utility issues are very complex, and they are very significant not only to consumers but also to this Nation's competitiveness and economic well-being. These kinds of changes cannot, and will not be made without careful and complete consideration by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of all aspects of the issues and questions they raise. That is why the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is now in the process of reviewing the factors that affect the competitiveness of the electric power industry. 
Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I am today cosponsoring this legislation and I hope that it will soon be on the President's desk for his signature.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me very briefly address the Bingaman amendment which I feel introduces some serious loopholes in S. 104's ironclad process toward a safe, central interim storage facility. 
The loopholes will be used, as they have in the past, to keep the nuclear waste where it is at 80 sites in 41 States, near schools and residential neighborhoods--right where it is today. 
The history of the nuclear waste issue has taught us some simple lessons we must heed: Any decision regarding nuclear waste that can be delayed will be delayed; any decision that can be ignored will be ignored. That is why we have spent $6 billion over 15 years, and the Federal Government is still unable to meet its legal and moral obligation to take the waste in 1998. 
I implore my colleagues: Let us not be fooled again. S. 104 is designed to make sure there are no trap doors. The chart that I explained to my colleagues yesterday attempts to make a decision, force a decision now, not leave us with a way 
out or a copout. 
I suggest to you that the Bingaman amendment as it is structured opens a loophole. It opens the process to political pressure. It invites indecision. It continues the legacy of failure that the Department of Energy's nuclear waste program is noted for. 
It would be my intention, Mr. President, to move to table the Bingaman amendment.  
Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to protect the taxpayer by making it clear that nuclear waste user fees cannot exceed 1 mill per kilowatt hour without specified congressional authorization. The spent fuel disposal program is paid for with a fee that is currently set to 1 mill per kilowatt hour. My amendment simply protects the ratepayer by making it clear that the user fee cannot exceed 1 mill without congressional authorization. DOE's own budget projections show that a 1 mill fee is sufficient.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the question before the body now is whether we want to leave the waste where it is, 41 States in 80 sites, or do something about the waste. Do we want the waste to move out again because of an inability to reach a decision? Where would it move? Nobody wants it in any of the 50 States. It would move out to the Pacific. God knows where it would move. Today we must make an important environmental decision which will lead to a safer future for all Americans. 
Currently, Mr. President, as I have noted, we have the waste stored in 80 sites in 41 States. This is in addition to waste stored at DOE facilities, and it is in our backyards across the land. Do we want that waste to stay there, or do we want to move it? That is the question. 
Every year that goes by our ability to continue to store nuclear waste at each of these sites in a safe and environmentally responsible way diminishes. Our temporary storage facilities were designed for just that--temporary storage. We have struggled with this nuclear waste issue for more than a decade. We have collected $13 billion from the taxpayers, but some are unprepared to meet the Government's promise to take the waste by 1998, next year. 
The administration's position would suggest that we are undermining the permanent repository program. They have not read the bill. The reality is that it is the only way to save the permanent repository program.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me remind you that the U.S. court of appeals has ruled that the Department of Energy has an obligation to take possession of the nuclear waste in 1998, whether or not a repository is ready. Damages for the Department of Energy's failure to perform are going to cost the American taxpayer tens of billions of dollars. 
Now, the administration says that S. 104 would effectively establish Nevada as a site for an interim storage facility before the viability assessment of Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository is completed. Well, they have not read the bill, Mr. President. S. 104 does not choose a site for interim storage before the viability assessment of Yucca Mountain is completed. If the viability assessment is positive, the bill provides that the interim storage facility will be constructed at the Nevada test site. If the viability assessment is negative, the bill provides that the President has 18 months and Congress has 2 years to choose another interim storage site. 
This bill, Senate 104, protects the public health, environment, and extends the schedule for siting and licensing. It requires environmental impact statements. It provides the interim facility will be licensed. 
It shortens the license term of the interim facility to 40 years; it balance State and Federal laws, preempting only those State laws that are inconsistent with the act; it provides that the Environmental Protection Agency will set standards for a permanent repository, based upon the National Academy of Science recommendation. 
So we have reached a crossroad, Mr. President. The job of fixing this program is ours. The time for fixing the program is now. Much progress has been made at Yucca Mountain. The 5-mile exploratory tunnel will soon be complete. If Yucca is found on unsuitable or is not licensed, it will be vital that we have a centralized interim site. I have a simple bottom line. We must chart a safe, predictable, and sure course to interim and permanent waste storage. There can be no trapdoors, Mr. President. I don't want to have to stand here next year or the year after doing this again. We have to ask ourselves, do we want to move the waste or simply leave it where it is? 
We can choose now whether the Nation needs 80 interim storage sites, or just one. The arid, remote Nevada test site, where we have exploded scores of nuclear bombs during the cold war, is a safe and remote location for a monitored interim site. The time is now. I think S. 104 is the answer. So ask yourself, do you want to leave the waste where it is, in 40 States at 80 sites? Or do you want to move the waste from your State to one location, and that is the Nevada test site? 
I reserve the remainder of my time for the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe we are waiting for another Member to come down to the Chamber. We have two more amendments, is my understanding. 
Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that no Member of this body intended, by any means, that last year's welfare bill would place the elderly and the disabled legal immigrants out of their residence and into the streets of this country. I am sure that when our President signed the reform bill, that certainly was not his intention. 
Since the bill was signed into law, many State Governors have attempted to address the concerns raised by my good friend from Minnesota. Many of the State's Governors and representatives have large budget surpluses that can be used to alleviate some of the potential problems that have surfaced. That is not in all States, by any means, but in those that have that capability, I think there is an appropriate expenditure suggested. In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has recently issued new guidelines that should facilitate citizenship applications by many 
elderly disabled immigrants. 
Mr. President, I am certain that Congress, working with the administration, State Governors, and other organizations, will surely come up with a solution that ensures the well-being and safety of all legal immigrants, especially the elderly and the disabled. This is not to suggest, however, that we are going to rewrite the historic welfare legislation we passed last year. As many colleagues stated on the floor last year, if and when unanticipated problems arise resulting from the welfare bill, we will address those problems in an appropriate fashion. 
There are some in this body who want to restore, piecemeal, the old AFDC welfare entitlement. That program has been unanimously adjudged a dismal failure. Piecemeal attempts to restore that failed system are simply not going to happen. I want to assure my friend from Minnesota that I am committed to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, along with the help of the administration and Governors, to ensure that necessary assistance is made available to resolve this unintended problem. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand amendment No. 43 to S. 104 is pending. 
Mr. President, let me go into the purpose of the amendment. It is establishing a fee cap and is a second-degree amendment to protect the ratepayers. These are the ratepayers who pay into a special fund and use and generate power from nuclear reactors. It is to protect the ratepayers who are the ones who ultimately pay the nuclear waste fee by making it clear that the nuclear waste user fee cannot exceed 1 mill per kilowatt hour without specific congressional authorization. 
The spent fuel disposal program is paid for with a fee collected from the consumers of nuclear energy. This fee is currently set at 1 mill per kilowatt hour. While the nuclear waste program has had problems, collecting sufficient amount of money from the ratepayers certainly hasn't been one of them. After all, we collected over $13 billion and have expended only $6 billion on a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. 
But we have a problem created by the fact that our budgetary system forces the program to compete against other DOE programs for funding even though this fee is earmarked for nuclear waste disposal. This situation has contributed to the problem where ratepayers have spent some $13 billion in the fund but have only received excuses in return. 
Our budget system also creates an incentive to use nuclear waste fund receipts to disguise the size of the budget. Senate bill S. 104 addresses these problems by providing for two fees. One is a user fee that is equal to the appropriations provided to the program. The other is mandatorily created that makes up the difference between appropriations and the current level of the fee which is 1 mill per kilowatt-hour. The user fee goes directly to fund the ongoing programs. The mandatory fee goes into the nuclear waste fund to continue to bill the balance to ensure there will still be money in the fund to deal with the waste even after the reactors stop operating. 
With that background, let me briefly explain what my amendment does. My amendment simply makes it clear that the user fee cannot exceed 1 mill without congressional authorization. This is designed to protect ratepayers. Critics will say perhaps that this is designed to protect utilities. But it is really the ratepayers who pay the fee, don't they? Certainly not the utilities. Some may argue that a 1 mill fee is insufficient to pay for both interim storage and permanent repository. DOE's own budget projections show that this is not the case. The 1 mill fee generates $630 million per year. 
Because defense waste will also be placed in the permanent repository, a portion of the cost, therefore, must be appropriated from the national defense budget account to the nuclear waste fee each year. In the last few years this has been some $200 million. That is a combined total of $830 million each year. Is $830 million per year combined with the roughly $6 to $7 billion in the waste fund today sufficient to fund both the permanent repository and the interim storage facility? This is a key question. According to the Department of Energy's own budget plan, the answer is yes. It is plenty. The fact is the budgetary provisions in the Department of Energy's own program plan assume an interim storage facility is named in 1998. 
To quote from the DOE plan, `Fiscal year 1999 through the year 2002 amounts for the program assume the enactment of legislation authorizing and siting an interim storage facility and providing appropriate funding arrangements.' So there we have it. DOE's own plan reflects exactly the same schedule for siting and constructing an interim facility as that set out in Senate bill S. 104. The Department of Energy's own plan shows that the cost of both the permanent repository and interim facility will range from $535 to $698 million per year. That is well under the $830 million going in the fund from the ratepayer contributions and defense appropriations. So lack of money is not the problem. But if changed circumstances or other factors make the cost of the programming to go up, then Senate bill S. 104 provides expedited procedures to consider a change in the 1 mill cap. 
Under Senate bill S. 104 the Secretary determines each year whether the DOE has collected too little or too much money. The Secretary then transmits his or her recommendations to Congress, and a joint resolution to raise or lower the fee is introduced and considered on an expedited basis. This is another way to ensure that this program will be adequately funded for its entire life. But by requiring Congress to act to raise the fee we protect the ratepayers, and that is the purpose of the language of Senate bill S. 104 and the amendment before us now. We carefully balance the needs of the program while protecting the ratepayers. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first of all, let me spend a little time thanking the efforts of Senator Bingaman from New Mexico for his efforts on this bill. He and his staff have worked very, very hard. I think what we have up to this point is a much better piece of legislation as a consequence of the efforts of 
Senator Bingaman and his staff. In the committee markup, as I recall, Senator Bingaman had amendments touching about eight different issues, and we were able to eventually accommodate the Senator from New Mexico on seven of those. We unfortunately could not accept all the amendments, but we certainly resolved to work with him and his staff and continue to do so as we debate the substitution, and the Bingaman amendment that is before us. 
I think we have made progress. Progress was made on licensing requirements for the temporary storage facility. Progress was made in the application of NEPA. Progress was made on leasing standards for a permanent repository. Progress was made on preemption of other laws, and certainly progress was made on nuclear waste fee requirements. 
I think it is fair that we agree that Nevada should be chosen as the permanent repository. I was a little confused in his statement where he implied that it was unfair that Nevada would necessarily be chosen as the last, I guess the last possible choice or the choice of last resort, or words to that effect. 
We have 50 States out there and nobody wants it. I have said time and time again, you can't throw it up in the air, it is going to come down somewhere. So I think it is imperative that we recognize that we have to choose a site, and that site is going to be objected to by the delegation from that State. 
We have chosen a permanent repository in Nevada, assuming that it meets the requirements. Yucca Mountain was chosen after looking at other sites, other sites in other States. 
Nevada is the preferred site for a repository. Nevada has been selected and, as a consequence, we have 5 miles of tunnel that have been completed there. We have expended $6 billion. We are committed, probably, by the time we are complete to spend up to $30 billion. So that is a given. I would say we agree Nevada should be chosen for an interim facility if the viability assessment for the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain is positive, and I think that is, more or less, the opinion of my friend from New Mexico. 
I think it is further apparent we agree that the President should have time to pick an alternative site, even in the event that Yucca Mountain is determined not to be viable as a permanent repository. 
We have come a remarkable distance toward total agreement. Unfortunately, we have this one area where we have not been able to agree and I think that is, of course,the substance of the Bingaman amendment. 
I think what we have here, in our opinion, and I tried to cite this early in our debate, is an effort to try and get this resolved informed by past debates on this subject and the history of the issue. If there is any way out of a conclusion to address the disposition of this waste, somebody is going to find it, Mr. President. 
We clearly see a lack of direction from the administration on this. I personally communicated in three specific letters to the President asking what the administration's position is. The administration, in all fairness, simply does not have a position. 
You can look at some of the rhetoric that has come out of some of the newspapers relative to the administration's position. It is kind of surprising to comment on whether they are a little bit naive or not well informed, but from the Thursday, April 10, Congress Daily, White House Council on Environmental Quality Chairwoman Kathleen McGinty said yesterday that the administration would be `loathe to consider' legislation that would force the Energy Department's hand in building the temporary storage facility before it knows the waste would be able to stay at Yucca Mountain. `Loathe to consider' legislation that would force the Energy Department's hand in building the temporary storage facility before it knows the waste would be able to stay at Yucca Mountain. 
That is totally inaccurate because if one looks at the schedule in the bill, in my substitute, if Yucca is viable by December 1998, a viability assessment will go to the President. March 1999 would be the deadline for a Presidential determination on viability. 
If there is no negative determination, the Nevada test site is determined to be the site. The reason for that is obvious. If we do not name a site, we are going to be drifting around here where we are today. 
April 30, 1999, the Secretary files licensing application with NRC. 
Approximately August of the year 2000, construction begins when the EIS is complete. 
No later than June 30 in the year 2003, fuel acceptance begins. 
Now, how can the administration interpret that this legislation would force the Energy Department's hand in building a temporary storage before it knows the waste would be able to stay at Yucca Mountain? 
Construction cannot begin until August in the year 2000. Somebody might say, `Well, Senator, what's the big deal here? Why not wait for Yucca Mountain to be done?' Well, we are told by the Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, that it will be the year 2015 before Yucca is completed, certified, licensed, and ready to take fuel. 
That is why, Mr. President. The `why' is that the time is now. We have a contractual commitment to take this waste beginning next year, 1998. We made a contract with the nuclear power industry. We have collected $13 billion from the ratepayers of this country. They are expecting performance, and the Government has not any capability. The Government is not going to be able to accept that waste. And the Government is going to be liable for damages. 
Every Member of this body has an obligation to minimize the Government's liability associated with those damages. That is what a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain is all about: expediting the process. So if there is anybody in anybody's office who is misconstruing the timing of this--Katie McGinty, of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, has somehow gotten an interpretation that we would force the Energy Department's hand in building a temporary storage facility before it knows the waste would be able to stay at Yucca Mountain. It is totally inaccurate; and that is an understatement, Mr. President. 
Let us talk about Yucca not being viable. 
If Yucca is not viable, September of the year 2000 would be the deadline for the President to designate a site. 
February of the year 2001 would be the deadline for Congress to approve a site. 
And if no site is designated and approved, the Nevada test site is the site. 
March 2001 the Secretary files a license. July 2002, construction begins. 
September 2005, fuel acceptance begins. 
So this is where Senator Bingaman and I have our departure. We feel we have to have a bottom line on this debate. We feel that we must firmly chart a predictable and sure course to a safe, interim storage facility and get it done now, not next year, not in 2 years or 5 years or 2001 or 2010 or 2011. I do not want to be standing here in another 4 our 5 years and have to find that we are still hung up on a decision. 
Congress dealt with this issue in 1982. We thought it had resolved the problem forever. In 1987, we had to deal with it again. At that time we were told we had resolved nuclear waste once and for all. 
This is the problem, Mr. President. This is the legacy of the program. If it is possible to delay a decision, a decision gets delayed. It has been in progress so far. If it is possible to push the decision off to somebody else's watch, that is what is going to happen. And that has been suggested time and time again. If the process is vulnerable to political pressure, then political pressure will be used. 
We have learned the hard way that any trap door left anywhere in the process inevitably, Mr. President, gets used. And it will happen in this case. Any weakness in the approach gets exploited. That is why we have spent $6 billion over 15 years and the Federal Government is still unable to meet its promise to take the waste in 1998. I implore my colleagues, let us not be fooled again. Let us face up to our obligation. 
Our bill, Senate bill 104, is destined to make sure there are no trap doors here, no copouts, no more delays. This chart shows our selection process. No matter what happens, the loop is closed. It is a box. Every decision leads to a safe, central storage facility. 
Let me explain to you this effort. Here we sit in 1997, as you see over in the left-hand corner of the chart, with the status quo. We have waste in 81 sites in 40 States. That is just the harsh reality. If we do not do anything, that is where it will remain. Your reactors may go down for lack of storage. Your waste is going to remain. 
If you want the waste to move, it has to be transported. That is a given. We can do that safely. We have transported 2,400 individual shipments. 
So let me follow the red line from next year when we are under contract, the Federal Government, to accept the waste. If Yucca Mountain is viable for a permanent repository, then we have one safe central storage site, it is over. That is one end of the square. 
Let us go up. If Yucca Mountain is not viable for a permanent repository, what happens then? Well, then the President can pick an alternative site. OK. And Congress will ratify it, and we come right back with a square box, one safe, central storage site. 
If the President does not select an alternative site; in other words, if the President says--`Well, I just won't act'--our bill deals with that possibility. If the President does not act, then where does it go? It defaults. It defaults to the Nevada test site. That is evidently a problem for my friend from New Mexico. 
But on the other hand, history of this matter suggests that if we leave it to the Bingaman amendment--and let me refer to the next chart--this is the exposure. And this is where Senator Bingaman and I part company, because, if Yucca Mountain is viable, we are fine. If Yucca Mountain is not viable, then the Secretary picks an alternative site. But if he does not, if he does not do that, no site is chosen and we are right back to where we are. We are leaving it where it is. Let me run through that again to make sure everybody understands it. 
This is the difference between the Bingaman and our particular approach with S. 104. If Yucca Mountain is viable, we have a central storage site, no problem. But if Yucca Mountain is not, the Secretary picks an alternative storage site. That is fine if 
he does--if he does--Mr. President. But if he does not, we are right back where we were. 
Look at the other chart. 
That is the difference between the two particular versions of this amendment. We give the President the authority to pick an alternative site. Congress ratifies the site, and we are all right. But if the President does not select an alternative site, it goes back to the Nevada test site. 
That is where we are, Mr. President. I think it is fair to say that our concern with the Bingaman amendment is that in our opinion it creates the trap door, it opens the process to political pressure. It invites indecision, and it invites pressures that will be apparent to do nothing so we will all be back where we are now, 40 States, 81 sites, reactors potentially shutting down because storage sites are filled up, and the stuff sits. It still is not moving. 
The Department of Energy tells us that the odds of Yucca Mountain being suitable as a permanent repository are good. I think that they used the odds currently of 90 percent. Well, that is pretty good around here. So the President's finding of suitability looks pretty good. But it is still at his own discretion. I ask all of my colleagues and those in their offices who listen, do you think the Senators, our good friends from Nevada, will try to influence the President's decision? Sure they will. They should. We acknowledge that. Wouldn't you if you were placed in that situation? 
If the President decides Yucca Mountain is not viable, not a viable site for a permanent repository, the need for an interim repository becomes even more desperate. The waste simply cannot stay where it is, Mr. President, in 80 sites in 41 States. We cannot afford to start closing nuclear plants that have run out of room for spent fuel because, remember, Yucca, if it is viable, if it is licensable, is not going to be ready until the year 2015. 
Under the Bingaman amendment, if the President were to determine that Yucca Mountain is not viable, then all the Secretary needs to do to prevent the designation of a central storage site is to simply fall back to another site; that is my point, leave the waste where it is. 
There is another area that I am concerned about in the Bingaman amendment, and that is even if the Secretary does pick a site, the tools provided to make that site a reality are somewhat limited. 
Of course, we know that the Secretary does not have the authority to withdraw land for an interim repository. The Secretary does not have the authority to condemn land for an interim repository. I am fearful, under Senator Bingaman's amendment, under this goal, we would not be able to reach our mutual goal, which is something where we are both on the same track. We want this waste to move. But we both want it to move now. 
With the loopholes in here, I am just convinced they would be used. With the U.S. court of appeals ruling that DOE has a binding legal obligation to take the spent fuel, Mr. President, I just cannot believe that we can accept more failures, more runaround, more delays. We cannot expose the taxpayer to the liability of more damages resulting from the court cases that are going to come up when we are not able to take this spent fuel next year. 
Mr. President, I do not want to settle for a failure.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are so close, yet so far away in our differences here. I think it is fair to say that when the viability assessment is completely at the discretion of the President, we would all agree that it is subject to political pressures. I think we all agree that we have an obligation to make a decision. We have agreed to withhold on a decision until the viability assessment is available. My friend from New Mexico has indicated a concern about the viability and the suitability. I am told that the suitability is 80 percent likely. Viability is 90 percent. Those are very high odds. 
The problem of how we resolve this and whether or not we are going to be delaying this action again, I think, has to be related to the fact that when we get the viability assessment, we either choose Nevada if it is positive, or give the President time to choose another site if it is negative. 
Only if we are unable to choose another site--only then--would it go to Nevada. That would imply that the President wasn't doing his job, and that Congress wasn't capable of doing their job. And I think we both agree that there would be a significant shirking of an obligation or duty. I am just fearful with the history of this that without some kind of closure that might happen. I believe my friend from New Mexico has stated that the only reason for putting interim in Nevada is if Yucca is permanent. But if Yucca doesn't pan out then we desperately need an interim site, and I think we need it quickly because Yucca is the year 2015 from being ready to accept waste. We have 80 sites in 41 States, and we have lawsuits coming on, and damages coming on. From the looks of this place, Congress doesn't make decisions very quickly. 
Let me just say one more thing with regard to delay. Although we may not know the ultimate site of an interim facility, there is one indisputable fact. We need a central temporary storage facility for our Nation's nuclear waste. If Yucca Mountain is viable then it makes sense to put the material at the Nevada test site. If Yucca Mountain is not viable, it will take 50 or 60 years of process at a minimum to find and license another permanent repository site under our present permitting process. We cannot leave nuclear waste at 80 sites around the country over this period of time. That is why the crisis is here. The spent fuel pools at nuclear reactors were not designed for long-term storage. 
Mr. President, in all due respect, Senate bill 104 was designed to make sure there were no trapdoors, and that no matter what happens this loop is closed. And this decision has to lead to a safe central storage facility ultimately at a permanent repository in Yucca Mountain. 
So, Mr. President, the decision is ours. The time is now. Let's not shirk this duty and this responsibility by leaving an open-end alternative that I guarantee will be used. 
Mr. President, I believe my time is up. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. In the course of deliberations on Senate bill 104, we have debated the merits of exclusions for a number of Department of Energy sites. Specifically, I am referring to exclusion from consideration for selection as the interim storage site for commercial spent nuclear fuel under the provisions of this legislation. Does the consent order we are discussing have any bearing on this question for Idaho?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) limit in any way the rights of contract holders, their ratepayers, or those agencies of the State governments that represent ratepayers, from enforcing any right they might have, including the right to hold the Federal Government liable financially, under the 1982 act and the contracts executed pursuant thereto. Section 101(g) is expressly subject to section 101(f), which makes clear that rights conferred by section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 or by the contracts executed thereunder are not affected by this bill, including section 101(g). To the extent that act or the contracts established a 1998 deadline and the DOE fails to meet that deadline, it is not the manager's intent that the substitute amendment in any way restrict the relief available to those damaged by the failure to meet the deadline.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. The intent of the committee in adopting the third committee amendment was to prevent the President from designating the Hanford Nuclear Reservation as the site of the nationwide interim storage facility for all civilian and spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from U.S. commercial reactors. This amendment is not intended to preclude steps that an individual utility, such as the supply system, might need to take to manage the storage of its own spent nuclear fuel.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
I very much appreciate the amendment from my friend from Minnesota, and I know of his interest in this matter because there is substantial amounts of spent nuclear fuel from reactors in Minnesota. I am sure the Senator from Minnesota is aware of the transportation route where high-level nuclear waste has been transferred across the United States, some 2,400 shipments, and I have a map here that shows the manner in which these shipments have occurred from 1979 to 1995. 
I think the Senator was out in his State Friday when we were talking about this. This chart shows that shipments of nuclear waste have been made over an extended period of time, all over the Nation. 
And during those 2,400 shipments there have been seven accidents. Most of those accident were minor ones. In the most serious accident, the tractor trailer swerved off the road to avoid another car that was out of control, turned over and the cask rolled off. But there was no leakage of radioactivity. The cask did not break. It was not perforated in any manner or form. 
As the Senator from Minnesota knows, this type of nuclear waste, while it is highly radioactive, does not go up in the air and vaporize or move with the wind currents or whatever. It has a tendency, because of its weight and denseness, to stay wherever it occurs. And these are high-level waste rods from the reactors. 
I think the intent of the Senator from Minnesota is parallel with my own intent. We want to safeguard, in every possible way, the transportation of this material. 
Here is an example of the type of truck and the cask. You can see the cask up on top. These have been designed to withstand any foreseeable accident of any kind that would be determined to be possible on a highway. In testing, they have been dropped. They have been hit by trains. They have been incinerated and so forth. I go into this detail, not to suggest there could not be some type of accident that would cause a penetration but, clearly, the best scientists, the best engineers we have have concluded that these casks have been designed in such a way as to survive real-world accidents and ensure the public safety. 
The concern the Senator from Alaska has, relative to the amendment offered by my friend from Minnesota, is how to determine just what is adequate, relative to training? I think, if you look at the safeguards we have attempted to put in S. 104, we have put in funding for technical assistance for emergency responders along the routes to be used to transport the fuel. The Wyden language, which we adopted, provided more detail. Rigorous provisions regarding route selection and training for emergency responders were included. We had left it to the Department of Transportation to choose the preferred routes. Again, considerations in route selection would include concerns over population, hazards, shipping time, and so forth. 
But I want to point out to my friend that this is nothing new. The only reason these other 2,400 shipments were not news is because nothing happened. These were in connection with moving high-level material from experimental reactors and other reactors around the country for disposition. So, to suggest that what we have had before was adequate is inconsistent, I think, with reality. The question we are looking at now is, Can we do everything possible to ensure that we have the safest possible transportation route and have made the maximum effort to protect public safety? It is also important to recognize that this plan is fully integrated with State notification, inspection, emergency response plans, as well as should it go through any tribal or native lands. 
It also grants at least $150,000 in State and tribal funding. I think this was something the Senator from Minnesota brought up in his debate. If there is no training, there are no shipments. That is a provision of our bill. We make it clear the Department of Energy cannot transport fuel under this act unless the technical assistance and funding required by the bill have been provided for at least 3 years prior to the shipments. As I understand the Wellstone amendment, it would add as a requirement that the Department of Energy make a formal determination that personnel along the routes have met acceptable standards of training for emergency response to accident. It does not provide additional training. And it requires the Department of Energy to make an official determination. 
My concern, and I am sure the concern of the Senator from Minnesota, is to get this stuff moved out of his State. That is a legitimate concern that he and others have, other States have, where this material is piled up. So we have to make sure we do not tie this process up in litigation so every State or every tribe or every local community could come in under a determination of 
adequacy. I am concerned here as to how I can meet the concerns of the Senator from Minnesota and still ensure that we have a viable and practical situation where this oversight does not throttle our objective here, and that is to move this material to an appropriate repository. 
I am concerned if this amendment is adopted as it is now, we might find ourselves tied up in litigation and it would not be that the DOE had or had not followed the Department of Transportation's regulations to the letter. I do not think it matters that the Department of Energy has followed the NRC regulations with care and precision. It might not matter the Department of Energy has integrated emergency response plans with all the State tribes. And it will not matter the DOE has provided funding for emergency responders. What will matter is we might have a lawyer along the way who has decided that a new volunteer fireman has not had acceptable level of training. The next thing you know, the Department of Energy is in court trying to prove that every individual firefighter along every single route has been trained to an acceptable level. I do not know how we are going to prove that. What is an acceptable level? That would be in the eyes of a court to determine. 
I just wonder if we might confer a little bit, or perhaps here on the floor, if the Senator wished, to discuss how we would address that concern of what is acceptable, because I think we both want to get there from here. I would defer to my colleague, on my own time.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Let me refer to a reality, and that reality is behind me in the chart, because all of us should recognize what is happening in the United States now. 
This is where nuclear fuel is moving. It is moving through all of the 48 States with the exception of Florida and South Dakota. Now, that is just a harsh reality. In this timeframe from 1979 to 1995, there have been 2,400 movements of nuclear material. They moved safely; they moved over the transportation system of our highways, as well as our railroads, as indicated in the red. 
This is a very dangerous amendment that would basically ensure that potentially no nuclear waste anywhere would move to any storage or disposal. 
Let me highlight what it does in the next chart, because in the next chart we have the locations of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in the United States. And in it is, Mr. President, 81 sites in 40 States. Is it safer to leave that waste in 80 sites in 40 States or move it? 
This is what this amendment is all about. This is a desperate tactic on the part of my good friends from Nevada who simply do not want the waste put in their State. That is the bottom line, make no mistake about it. 
But we have an obligation here. We have a problem here. We are either going to solve it by defeating the second-degree or we are going to be left with this situation that has been created over the last couple of decades. 
That is the harsh reality of where we are. This amendment grants to the Governor of a State the power to preclude any specific shipments of spent fuel or nuclear waste through that State to the temporary proposed shipment site in Nevada out in the desert. 
Let me show you where we propose to put this. We propose to put the temporary repository out in Nevada where we have had a series of tests for some two decades. I have the chart coming in. It is important that we grasp the significance of just what this amendment would do if they are successful in passing it. On the face of it, it may have some appeal, particularly to Senators like myself who have always been staunch supporters of States' authority to determine matters which are within their State borders. 
Now here, Mr. President, is where we propose to put the temporary repository. This is an area in Nevada used previously for more than 800 nuclear weapon tests over an extended period of time. The other option, Mr. President, again, if you look at the other chart, is leave it where it is. If we take action today to support the second degree amendment, we are killing any effort to address a problem that we have put off far too long. When I say `far too long,' Mr. President, we have contracted to move this waste next year from the reactors where it has been stored as it is exhausted from the nuclear powerplants, and the liability associated with this is going to be substantial. It is estimated to be somewhere between $40 and $80 billion. 
The appeal, as I said, that is perhaps of some significance, regulation of transportation of any type of hazardous materials across State lines, has long been one of the primary examples of appropriate exercise of Federal jurisdiction. I question the constitutionality of prohibiting the movement on highways, but that is neither here nor there. The principles of federalism on which this country was founded recognize that the States' authority to govern matters within their borders, must give way to Federal authority when an issue is one of national scope reaching beyond any particular State borders. Interstate shipments of hazardous waste such as spent fuel and other forms of nuclear waste clearly require a uniform framework of requirements that ensure safety but also insure that the shipments can reach their destination. 
Transportation of these materials is currently regulated under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, known as HAZ-MAT. That law is an intricate system for controlling hazardous materials and shipments across the United States. The HAZ-MAT system was adopted to uniformly regulate all materials regardless of type, and in each case regulation of these materials allows the States limited authority to conduct certain inspections and other activities related to the shipment. 
Never do the HAZ-MAT regulations, however, allow a Governor to veto the shipments altogether. That is what this second-degree amendment would propose to do. If each State were allowed to impose its own set of safety requirements, it would very likely prove impossible to move any hazardous material from one place to another. So the alternative is to leave it where it is. 
This amendment is even more restrictive than that. It would allow virtually a veto over any Federal shipments of nuclear spent fuel or other nuclear waste through any State whose Governor chooses to exercise the authority, even if all safety requirements are met. Again, Mr. President, I implore those that have questions about this to recognize that these Governors want to get this waste out of their State. That is what Senate bill 104 is all about, providing a place to put the waste. 
Now, my friends from Nevada, if they were able to prevail, we simply could not move the waste. Is that what the States want? Is that what the Governors of these States want? No, they do not want it left in their State. They want it to be moved to a safe place that has been proposed, which is, obviously, the desert out in Nevada. 
Now, this amendment would allow any single State to thwart a solution to a national problem, the very situation that was intended to be precluded by the Framers of the Constitution. Even though the original Senate bill 104 included adequate measures to guarantee safe transportation of nuclear spent fuel, we have accepted additional provisions in the substitution regarding safety and training, to assure safe shipments. 
It seems obvious that safety is not the real issue here. The real interest here and the real issue here is simply Nevadans, the Nevada Senators, do not want it in their State. I am sympathetic to that. But it has to go somewhere. This is the best place, out here in the desert, where, again, we have had more than 800 nuclear weapon tests over the last 50 years. That is the best place we have found in the United States. If we want to move it outside the United States, that is another matter. But who will take it? We do not have a place in the Atlantic to put it. People in the Pacific certainly do not want it. Scientists have said you can put it in the sea bed, perhaps, but that is not going to be a possibility. This is the possibility. This is all we are talking about. This is the crux of it. We either put it there or we leave it where it is. 
That is something in this debate that my friends from Nevada have really not addressed. We have a permanent repository out here under construction. That repository is 
not going to be ready until the year 2015. Our pools are filling up. We face a crisis relative to the ability of our nuclear industry to continue to generate the 21 to 22 percent of power that is generated by nuclear energy in this country, when their pools are filling up with the high level of waste that the Government committed 15 years ago to take and has to start taking next year. The reality is that some of those reactors probably will have to shut down because they are out of space. Somebody says, `Well, make more space.' The States have control of the licensing, and rightly so. Those pools where the high-level waste is stored were not designed for permanent storage. They were designed for temporary storage, until such time as the Federal Government would take the waste. 
You might say, why is the Federal Government so generous in just taking the waste? I remind the President that $13 billion has been paid to the Federal Government by the ratepayer, collected by the nuclear power companies, paid to the Federal Government by the ratepayers, and now the Federal Government is in breach of its contract. Some people around here say, `Well, that is no big deal. If you are going to contract with the Government, that is just an incidental.' I think that is a terrible precedent to take. 
The Government is in breach of the contract beginning next year. There are going to be damages. The taxpayer will pick it up. How big? I do not know. Mr. President, $59 billion was the last estimate for damages. We have to get on with this. The national interest of providing safe central storage of disposal of nuclear spent fuel could never, ever, be achieved if this amendment is adopted. I submit that this is the only purpose for which its proponents have offered it. 
Again, I refer to the chart. If you look where it is, it is all over. There are 80 sites in 41 States. If you don't want to leave it there, you have to move it. This second-degree amendment would prohibit you from moving it. It would keep it where it is. 
So, I implore all Senators representing the States that are affected here to recognize what this amendment would mean. This amendment really does not pass the straight-face test, if we are serious about resolving the nuclear waste issue. As a consequence, I think it speaks for itself. 
I am going to read for the Record an editorial that appeared April 8 in the Chicago Tribune. The headline is, `Honoring a Pledge on Nuclear Waste.'  
From the start of commercial nuclear power, Washington decided to make the storage of high-level radioactive waste a Federal responsibility. 
They are right. We did. We made it a Federal responsibility. We voted on it. We passed it. 
Fourteen years ago, Congress ordered the Federal Government to begin taking control of nuclear waste in 1998 and storing it at a permanent storage site in Nevada. 
Where? In Nevada, right there, out in the desert. 
Despite spending billions and extending deadlines, Washington won't be ready to accept any waste for another 10 years or so. 
As a matter of fact, it is the year 2015, according to the previous Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary. 
Meantime, the stuff keeps piling up at nuclear power plants in Illinois and around the Nation. 
The Senate this week can begin to correct this unconscionable malfeasance. It will consider a bill to build a temporary waste storage facility in the Nevada desert, about 100 miles from Las Vegas. It passed similar legislation last year, but not by enough votes to override a threatened veto by President Clinton, who agreed to oppose it if Nevada's Democratic Governor and two Senators supported his reelection. 
This is a quote from the Chicago Tribune, Mr. President. 
Well, it further states: 
The election is over, but Clinton again is promising a veto. Nuclear waste, he argues, shouldn't be shipped to a temporary facility until it's known for certain whether a permanent site can be built at nearby Yucca Mountain. Temporary storage, he contends, will drain funds from Yucca and make it likely the underground facility will never be completed. 
The Senate should end this political gamesmanship by passing the bill by a veto-proof margin. For national security and environmental safety, it makes more sense to have the waste stored in a well-protected central location than at scattered sites near major cities or bodies of water like Lake Michigan, which are filling up rapidly. It will also keep electricity users from shelling out twice for the waste storage. 
If Washington continues to slough off its obligation, it will be forced to build additional above-ground storage facilities at their nuclear plants and try to pass the cost on to the consumers. For more than a decade, ratepayers have chipped in billions to a private fund created by Congress to help pay for permanent storage facility, some of which has already been spent on research and study at Yucca. 
`A Federal appeals court'--this is important, Mr. President, because it is right on--`A Federal appeals court has ruled the Energy Department is contractually obligated to begin accepting the spent fuel next year. That deadline is unrealistic, but a temporary storage site should be designated so that the Government can begin receiving waste expeditiously. Someone in Washington must honor past promises and quit putting different decisions off on future generations, and the Senate can begin this week.' 
I think that is right on target. 
Now, I understand that there are those who have concerns about transportation of spent fuel to a central facility. That is why this bill has 12 pages of language providing transportation, training, and notification provisions. 
Let me read from selected portions of the bill, section (2): 
. . . not later than 24 months after the Secretary submits a licensed application under section 205 for an interim storage facility shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and affected States and tribes, and after an opportunity for public comment, develop and implement a comprehensive management plan that ensures safe transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from the sites designated by the contract holders to the interim storage facility site. 
Further, requirements: 
A shipping campaign transportation plan shall--

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I think it is appropriate that we move on to vote as soon as possible. But I would like to make a couple of points that I think are pertinent to the debate that is at hand. 
First of all, I think we have to recognize the premise that nobody wants to take the waste. On the other hand, I think we also have to recognize the reality of those who have the waste. Currently, we have in the State of Washington, at Hanford, a significant abundance of spent fuel, about 2,133 metric tons over here at Hanford. I have been out there. It is right on the edge of the Columbia River. These were the first graphite reactors; and the first generation of nuclear bombs that were used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were created there. 
The State of Washington has also, at that Hanford facility, 61 million gallons of liquid, high-level waste in 177 tanks. That is just the harsh reality. Savannah River, in South Carolina, 206 metric tons of high-level spent fuel, 33 million gallons of liquid waste. There is more that comes in every day. It comes from overseas and from our research reactors. How does it come? It comes through a transportation network, 2,400 shipments from 1979 to 1995. Every State has had shipments with the exception of Florida and South Dakota. 
So, when we talk about transportation, we have a transportation system. Why is it not news? Because nothing is happening. It is safe.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me point out to the Senator from Idaho, this is a typical cask that has been used since 1964 for shipping by truck transport. These are designed according to a very, very technical and highly engineered requirement that would associate itself with whatever the exposure is of a wreck, dropping from a high level. They have tested these. They have tested them with a railroad car at 60 to 70 miles an hour, dropping them from various levels. So the technology is here. 
These are the facts, as we look at this chart of where the waste is currently, and the position our friends from Nevada have taken, which is `Do not put it in Nevada, leave it where it is.' To highlight, again, the transportation chart, the one that shows the network, you just cannot reflect reality, and that is reality, 2,400 shipments. It has been safe. We have never had an accident that resulted in any exposure of any kind. We had a couple of minor trucking accidents, but clearly the cask withstood whatever the exposure was. 
Let me add one more consideration relative to where the significant areas of waste are. In addition to Savannah River and Hanford, at Oak Ridge, TN, we have 1 metric ton of spent fuel in storage and what we have there are some tailings and low-level waste as well. 
The Senator said it was not my State of Alaska that was affected, and that is true. But I would like the Record to note that we, in Alaska, at Amchitka, had the two largest underground nuclear explosions ever initiated and we are still monitoring those areas, relative to any waste that might be depleting into the landmass. 
So, the point I want to make here is that everybody shares in the concern of what we do with our nuclear waste. That is what this legislation is all about, what we do with the waste. 
There has been some discussion about what the damages, relative to the inability of the Government to perform on its contract to take the waste in coming years, what that might be. The lawyers are going to make that determination. But let us be realistic and recognize what the court said. The court ruled the Department of Energy had an obligation to take the spent fuel in 1998. And they promptly rejected the DOE's attempt to file a motion to dismiss. As a consequence, the Federal Government is clearly liable. 
How much are the damages likely to be? Again, that is like giving the lawyers a license to go after damages or full employment. The cost of the storage of spent fuel is estimated to be about $20 billion. That is the cost. That is the cost to the Government, when the Government fails to perform on its contractual obligation starting next year. The return of nuclear waste fees--they have to return what they collected from the ratepayers, about $8.5 billion. The interest on that for the last several years, as a consequence to it building up to $13 billion, is going to be somewhere in the area of $15 billion to $27 billion and the consequential damages associated could amount to an estimated shutdown of 25 percent of the nuclear plants due to insufficient storage--another $20 or $24 billion. 
I do not think there is any point, necessarily, to try to sharpen up the figures on what the damages are. Clearly there are going to be damages as a consequence of the Government's inability to respond to its contractual agreement. 
What I wanted to say, relative to the point of Nevada being the best place for this, showing the Nevada chart again, is we have had 800 nuclear weapons tests in this area for approximately 50 years. And the proposed location for the interim repository is here as well as, hopefully, the permanent repository that we spent approximately $6 billion on. We will probably spend as much as $30 billion to finally get it licensed. 
I have a couple of other comments relative to points that have been made, that I think need to be cleared up. I read a copy of the editorial in the Chicago Tribune of April 8. There was a reference to a possible association with regard to support for President Clinton, who agreed to oppose the legislation if Nevada's Democratic Governor and two Senators supported his reelection. That is obviously literary jargon, but, by the same token, I noted in the debate, time and time again, a reference that none of the environmental groups support this bill. Of course, I think it is fair to say the President received almost unanimous support from America's environmental groups relative to their particular policies. 
What we have here from the standpoint of the environmental groups is, many of them, their objective is to simply shut down the nuclear industry as we know it today. They do not accept the responsibility for picking up on where we would generate the offset of energy as a consequence of shutting down the nuclear industry. They do not give any credence to reducing greenhouse gases as a consequence of the contribution that nuclear energy can bring to lessening or eliminating emissions. 
No consideration is given to the reality that many of the nations that we compete with internationally are going to achieve their reductions of particulates and emissions as a consequence of moving toward nuclear power. France is already 98 percent nuclear power. Japan is actively moving into the area and they are beginning to reprocess. So I think it is fair to say as we stand still and debate on and on, endless discussions about the issue of what we are going to do with our waste, other countries are moving into advanced technology and reprocessing the waste. 
This particular second-degree amendment talks about States rights, and we are all sensitive to that aspect. 
However, the reality of States and the interest of States has to be addressed in the consideration of the major chart which shows where the waste is and the reality that we want to move this waste to one site. As a consequence of that, I think it is fair to note we have some inconsistencies relative to the statements that have been made by my good friends on the other side. 
There has been a reference that we all have to do a certain amount of sacrifice relative to States storing nuclear waste and nuclear waste fuel, and that certainly has been done by the State of Nevada. They were chosen for reasons unknown to me, but nevertheless chosen as the ideal site for nuclear explosions over those some 50 years. But there was a reference made that suggested that the transportation of nuclear fuel was an eminent right of a State to make a determination that it was or was not in the best interest of that State. But that concept defeats the logic of what we are attempting to achieve here, and that is to get it out of the States, to move it to one central repository. 
As far as the history of at least some Members of the Nevada delegation, let me again refer to action that was taken some time ago. Again, I refer to this picture of the Nevada test site, where the last underground explosion occurred in approximately 1991. Underground tests are still being performed there with nuclear materials being exploded with conventional explosives. 
During this time, the Nevada delegation, we assume, has not rejected that continued activity, but it is even more interesting to note that one of the Senators during his association with public service from Nevada supported storing nuclear waste at the test site. If you are going to support it, Madam President, you are going to have to get it there. So, if you support it, the realization of how you are going to move it across this network of States gets to the very crux of where we are in the second-degree amendment. 
Let me read a relative portion of the Nevada Assembly Joint Resolution No. 15, and this is a chart of the entire resolution dated February 26, 1975, and the appropriate portion:  
Whereas, the people of southern Nevada have confidence in the safety record of the Nevada test site and in the ability of the staff of the site to maintain safety in the handling of nuclear materials; 
Whereas, nuclear waste disposal can be carried out at the Nevada test site with minimal capital investment relative to other locations; 
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Assembly of the State of Nevada jointly that the legislature of the State of Nevada strongly urges the Energy Research and Development Administration to choose Nevada test site for the disposal of nuclear waste. 
This resolution passed the Nevada Senate by a 12-to-6 vote, aided by one of the Senators from Nevada, who is here today, and signed by the Governor of Nevada, Mike O'Callaghan. 
I do not know what has changed. The Nevada test site out there certainly has not changed. It is the same as it was. It still has a trained work force, and it still has an infrastructure for dealing with nuclear materials. The geology of the site certainly has not changed, and, obviously, some of the Senators thought it was the best place to store nuclear waste in 1975 or they probably would not have voted for it back then. 
So that is the reality relative to this issue, that nobody wants it, that it is stored in 80 sites in 41 States, and the answer is to move it to one safe site. If you do not move it, it is going to sit where it is, and that is not acceptable. As a consequence, we are at a time where it is imperative that we recognize that adoption of the second-degree amendment would simply kill the legislation, kill the bill and leave the waste where it is, and I do not think that is in the interest of the 50 States. 
Madam President, I propose to move to table the Reid-Bryan amendment.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the course of resolving the status of Senate bill 104 and recognizing that we have just concluded a vote and the vote was 72 to 24, and it was a tabling motion which would have, had it passed, invited every State Governor to prohibit the transfer and transportation of nuclear waste through those States, I will discuss a few States at random, Mr. President. I hope the Members in their offices will reflect on these charts because there are just a few States where the problem exists today. The point of this examination is to simply state that the alternative is to leave the waste in these States or provide an alternative. 
Now, again, I want to refer to the major chart which shows where the waste lay currently. There are 80 sites in 41 States. The commercial reactors, shut down reactors, spent fuel on site, commercial spent fuel, nuclear storage facilities, it is non-DOE reactors, it is Navy reactor fuel, it is Department of Energy--all in spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. That is where it is, Mr. President. 
The question is, Do we want to leave it there or do we want to move it? Now, the next chart again will attempt to show our experience in moving waste through the country because we have done it for an extended period of time. We have had 2,400 movements all over the country. As soon as the chart comes, it will show that it has moved through all States with the exception of South Dakota and Florida. 
Now, again the choice that we have relative to an alternative is leave it where it is. We have here the chart which shows the transportation routes of the waste moving across the United States, and it has not been a big deal. The reason is because there have not been any incidents. It has moved safely. It has been moving in containers subject to State and Federal law from 1979 to 1995. So to suggest that it cannot be moved safely or to suggest that we are suddenly thrust upon some kind of a crisis because we are about to move the waste to a temporary repository in Nevada--facts dictate otherwise. It is moved by rail, indicated by the red, it is moved by highway, as indicated by the blue network. Every State but Florida and South Dakota have escaped. That is the reality. 
As we look at the argument here, to a large degree, the transportation argument has little validity. This would be the same type of waste that we would be moving from our reactors. Where do we propose to move it? From all the sites I showed on the previous chart, to one site out in the Nevada test site used for over 50 years for more than 800 nuclear weapons tests. I have yet to have anybody come to the floor and suggest there is a better place. 
I recognize the reality that nobody wants it but we will look how this dilemma affects a few States. Take Connecticut, for example--and it is significant in Connecticut because nuclear energy makes up 70 percent of the energy that is produced in Connecticut--those ratepayers have paid $521 million over the last 12 years, or thereabouts, into a fund which the Federal Government has taken and put into a general fund for the specific purpose of taking Connecticut's waste. That was a contractual commitment. It is due next year. Connecticut should, under a contractual agreement, be relieved of its waste. The ratepayers have paid, as I said, $521 million. In Connecticut, there are four units, the Connecticut Yankee and the Millstone 1, 2 and 3. Those reactors have stored 1,505 metric tons of waste. It is stored in Connecticut. If this bill does not pass, it will stay in Connecticut. A portion of it is Department of Energy defense waste. 
Now, the significant thing here, Mr. President, is that Millstone 1 would be full by 1998. Now what does that mean? It means their storage, the pools adjacent to the reactors, will be full. What will they do? Either build more storage and get new permits, because the Federal Government is not going to be able to take it, or the other alternative is to shut down the reactor. Millstone 2 and 3 will be filled up by the year 2000. What will they do then? Shut down the reactor? Haddam Neck will be filled up in the year 2001. These are factual circumstances surrounding the state of the industry in Connecticut. 
Now, if I was representing Connecticut, I would want to get the waste out of there, because two things will happen. One is if this bill passes, the waste will get out. If it does not, the waste is not going to get out, and when these reactors shut down because storage is at capacity the waste is still going to be there. It will be sitting there until somebody does something with it. And to do something with it, you have to move it. Otherwise, it will stay there. 
Again, we have a location. I am sure my friend is getting tired of me showing the desert of Nevada where for 50 years we have had testing. 
Now, looking to another State, moving south a little bit, the State of Georgia. Now, Georgia is dependent 30 percent on nuclear power. The residents of Georgia paid $304 million into the waste fund. They paid that basically to the Government to take the waste. The Government cannot do it. We have four 
units, Hatch 1 and 2 and Vogtle 1 and 2. The waste stored in Georgia is 1,182 metric tons at the Savannah River site. The waste stored is 206 metric tons over on the South Carolina-Georgia border. Hatch 1 and 2 reactors will be filled by 1999, and Vogtle 1 and 2 will be filled by the year 2008. Again, we have a case where State ratepayers have paid it, and what have they gotten from the Federal Government? Nothing, other than a chance to continue to store their waste. How long? It is indefinite if this bill does not pass, because nobody can agree on where to put it. The alternative is to leave it where it is, and it will stay there after the reactors have shut down because we do not have anyplace to put it. 
Moving on, Mr. President, to Illinois. This is even a bigger set of realities. The State of Illinois is 54 percent dependent on nuclear power. You say `dependent'--what does that mean? It means 54 percent of the energy comes from nuclear power. There are alternatives, sure, coal-fired, oil-fired plants. They all cost money, all take permitting time. Illinois has paid into the waste fund, the residents have paid $1.36 billion, paid to the Federal Government to take the waste next year. The Federal Government will not do it, and they have 13 units in Illinois: Braidwood 1 and 2, Byron 1 and 2, Clinton, Dresden 2 and 3, LaSalle 1 and 2, Quad Cities 1 and 2, and Zion 1 and 2. They have 5,215 metric tons of waste in Illinois. A DOE research reactor is fueled there, with an additional 40 metric tons. A State that is 54 percent dependent. 
Looking at their reactors when they have to shut down, because the storage pools are filled: Dresden 3, the year 2000. Dresden 2, the year 2002. Clinton, the year 2003. Quad Cities 1 and 2, the year 2006. Zion 1 and 2, 2006. LaSalle, 1 and 2, 2013. Byron 1 and 2, 2015. Braidwood 1 and 2, 2019. That is a reality. What will Illinois do? Perhaps they will try and buy energy from other States, but that will deplete, if you will, the availability of supply. This is a crisis. 
This is the reality, that somebody else before this body had another plan to relieve, if you will, these States of the storage that is licensed. They cannot just store beyond their capacity. They store to their designing capacity. They are prepared to do that but they exceed that capacity in those years. And their ability to increase, that is going to be very, very difficult because for one thing the environmental community is opposed to any nuclear power generation and is going to object. They do not give any credit for the contribution that nuclear energy brings to air quality, including lessening emissions and reducing the greenhouse effect. It is one thing to criticize, but the environmental community has an obligation to come up with alternative and, their alternative is `no nuclear.' They like alternative energies, which I do, too, except they are not ready and they are not economic and are not here. 
In the meantime, the residents of Illinois are entitled to and will demand energy. What will happen in Illinois is they will have to shut reactors and maybe they will not have air conditioning. Maybe they will have brownouts. This is an obligation that we have in this body to address now because if you do not move it out of there it will stay, the reactors are shut down, and they are stuck with storing high-level energy that is not producing anything, not producing power anymore, and the dilemma is, well, that is a problem for Illinois. 
We have an opportunity to correct that today. That is what Senate bill 104 is all about--taking that waste. Remember, when you talk about transportation, to take it, you have to move it. We have moved it safely, and we can. 
Now, in the State of Louisiana, my good friend, Senator Bennett Johnston, whom I worked with so closely over the years on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--and I might add Senator Johnston supported this legislation the last time around because he is a realist and he recognizes we have a crisis. We have to address it. We cannot simply ignore it. The difficulty is we have to put it somewhere. That somewhere, unfortunately, is the desert in Nevada. 
In the case of Louisiana, the ratepayers have paid $135 million over 12 to 13 years. There are two units, River Bend 1 and Waterford 3. How much waste? Mr. President, 567 metric tons. When do they run out of capacity? Waterford 3, in the year 2002. River Bend 1, the year 2007. The State is 24 percent dependent on nuclear energy. You can say, well, why the hurry? Remember, we have been 15 years in this process now. Yucca Mountain, when completed, will not be ready until the year 2015, so if we do not address this today, there is no answer. We are just putting it off. 
Now, looking at Michigan, Mr. President. Ratepayers in Michigan have paid $510 million into the fund. 
There are five units: Big Rock Point, Cook 1 and 2, Fermi; 1,500 metric tons of high-level waste are stored there. This State, 26 percent, a quarter of the power, is generated from nuclear energy. Palisades goes down in 1992; Big Rock Point in 1997; Fermi 2 in 2001; Cook 1 and 2 in 2014. 
If I was from Michigan, I would be very concerned about the reality of two points. One, continuing to have a source of power within my State, which means my reactors have to continue to operate, which means I have to relieve my storage capacity. I would be very concerned. I would be very concerned about losing that power base and what I am going to do without it. I would be even more concerned if I didn't get some relief and I could not move it and it just sat there after my reactors shut down. That is what is going to happen in Michigan, and in every other State that is in a crisis relative to storage. As I have indicated, there are several. 
Let's look at New Jersey. The ratepayers in New Jersey have paid $382 million into the waste fund. What have they gotten for it? Absolutely nothing. The Federal Government promised in 15 years to have a sufficient repository ready by next year to take the waste. The citizens of New Jersey have acted in good faith. They paid the price. The Federal Government has not honored its commitment. They paid $382 million. They have four units: Hope Creek, Oyster Creek and Salem 1 and 2. They have 1,369 metric tons of waste sitting in New Jersey. Their only hope to get it out is to have a designated repository, designated in time to address reality. Reality is that Oyster Creek is in crisis now. That is full now. What are they going to do? Hope Creek will be full in the year 2007, Salem 1 in the year 2013, Salem 2 in 2018. New Jersey is 62 percent dependent on nuclear power. If I was from New Jersey, I would be pretty concerned about that. I would be pretty concerned about reality, pretty concerned about the Federal Government committing to its contractual agreement so that I could relieve my dependence before I have to shut down, and pretty concerned that, if I don't get it, I am going to be stuck with the waste in my reactor pools with no relief in sight and no generating capacity. I would say New Jersey is in a crisis. 
Well, let's go out West, to Oregon. It is a little less out there. Ratepayers in Oregon have paid $76 million. They have one unit, Trojan. Waste stored is 424 metric tons. Across the Columbia River from Oregon, which divides the two States, we have the Hanford site. Waste stored there is 2,133 metric tons. Trojan is closed for decommissioning. What does that mean? It means the waste is still there. I don't know whether the delegation from Oregon is satisfied to just leave it there. But unless we have a place to put it, it is going to stay there. We have proved that we can transport it throughout the country. I am sure that the State of Washington would not be anxious to take it. Hanford already has over 2,000 metric tons. So here, again, is a case of another State that acted in good faith. The ratepayers have paid in. The reactor is closed for decommissioning. There is no place, Mr. President, to take the waste. 
The last exhibit--and I could go on and on, but this gives you an idea of the crisis proportion we are in--the State of Wisconsin, the dairy State. Nearly a quarter dependent on nuclear power--22 percent to be exact. The residents paid $219 million into the waste fund. What do they have to show for it? Nothing. The Federal Government, when it takes this money, doesn't put it in escrow to have it ready to meet its obligation. It goes into the general fund. So what we would have to do now is appropriate funds to meet our obligation. Nevertheless, it has been paid in. There are three units: Kewaunee and Point Beach 1 and 2. About 967 metric tons are stored in Wisconsin. The status of the Point Beach 1 and 2 plants, I gather, is that they are full now. They have a crisis there right now. Kewaunee will be full in the year 2001. 
I don't know what the residents of Wisconsin know or whether they understand or whether they care. But Point Beach 1 and 2 is at capacity. They had to initiate some relief by dry cask storage adjacent to the reactors. This is something new and innovative that takes licensing. Well, you could say, `let's leave it there.' If you want it left in Wisconsin, then don't vote for S. 104. Kewaunee, in the year 2001. If I were from Wisconsin, I would want to move this stuff out. I would want the Federal Government to respond to the $219 million from the ratepayers. I would not want to run the risk of leaving it there. Now we are taking it out of the pools and putting it in areas adjacent to the reactor, dry cask storage. The State's electricity relative to its dependence is 22 percent. 
So, there you have it, Mr. President. Those are a few reasons why it is critical that we act now, a few reasons why it is critical that these States and the Members of this body from those States recognize that this offers relief from leaving it where it is and putting it out in the desert where we have a trained work force, we have security, we have the very real likelihood that the permanent repository is going to be determined to be there. But it is not going to be ready until 
the year 2015. So this provides the relief that is needed now, and it provides a responsible consideration relative to the necessity of a decision being made now. 
I think it is fair to say, finally, Mr. President, that to not act on this matter now is to not only disregard the responsibility we have here to minimize the risk to the taxpayers relative to the liability that is going to pile up next year when we can't take the waste, but I think it is also very important to recognize that we are doing a disservice to these States by not providing them with an alternative other than leaving the waste where it is, in 41 States at 80 locations. 
I wish there were some other way that we could put it in some other area that would not raise opposition. But I can tell you, Mr. President--and you have observed the debate--the reality is that whatever State we put it in, we are going to get a similar reaction--an extended objection from representatives of that State. Let's recognize the problem for what it is. 
Where, of all the places, is the best place to site a temporary repository? I will conclude by referring again to the area that has been polluted for 50 years with 800 nuclear weapons tests, an area that meets as many of the geological applications that are preferred relative to storage, both permanent and interim, of any that have been identified. So let's not wait any longer, Mr. President. I know there are a few more amendments that are pending on this legislation. 
I will conclude my remarks by thanking the Chair, and I will indicate that it is my intention to proceed through the remaining amendments with the cooperation of my good friends from Nevada. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will be very brief. There are a couple of points I want to make relative to the continued debate. One is the reference to the profits of the utilities. Most utilities are heavily regulated, and as a consequence the States have a considerable influence on determining the return on investment. I am not going to argue the merits of just what that return is. I think it varies within the industry, and it varies by the producer of power, their power lot, and it has to do with incurred debt and the ability to amortize that debt. But one thing that wasn't mentioned is that these utilities have provided reliable power to the residents of the individual States since they came online-- reliable power from a source that emitted no emissions, contributed nothing to greenhouse gases, and basically the cleanest source of power that we know 
today on a significant magnitude to maintaining air quality. So the environmental contribution by nuclear power from the standpoint of its emissions is really beyond compare. 
So let's acknowledge, indeed, that the utilities have done a job. They have provided power which is reliable and clean. Without them there is no considered replacement that has been identified. 
The issue of containers continues to come up. If we can ship high-level waste from Europe to the United States, military waste from Europe to the United States and to Russia--we watch the British, we watch the French, we watch the Japanese move waste from Japan to France for reprocessing and back--to suggest that we are not going to build safe containers is simply unrealistic. 
The point has been made that we are in some of these reactors storing our waste on site in casks on the surface suggests just one thing. We are preparing to basically leave it where it is, leave it with 41 States at the 80 sites, and that is the answer that the other side has for relief. Leave it all over the place. If it is safe enough to leave at a reactor in a cask on the surface, certainly it is safe enough to leave it out in the desert in an area where we have had 50 years of nuclear explosions, where we have a work force that is trained, security force, and so forth. 
So I just do not buy that argument. That is just an argument for leaving it where it is, and that is just not good enough. It is not good enough for the Senator from Alaska, it is not good enough for the States that are affected. 
If you look at the schedule, the viability assessment is anticipated to be completed by the end of next year. I am told the odds of that being favorable are about 90 percent. This is relative to a permanent repository at Yucca being completed. 
So when that viability assessment is done next year, we will begin to initiate the process of developing the EIS on the temporary repository. Then the President has to determine the viability. That is going to take place in 1999. If the Nevada test site is determined it will be determined at that date, approximately March 1999, and by April 1999 the license application will be presented to the NRC and we anticipate the EIS to be completed on the temporary repository by the year 2000. Construction can begin when the EIS is done. 
Construction would begin, we anticipate, when we get the license from the NRC, in roughly 2001, and we could accept the casks coming from the nuclear reactors into the temporary repository out in the Nevada desert no later than the year 2000. 
So there is the schedule relative to the timeframe under which we can begin to accept spent fuel into the Nevada desert temporary repository. The alternative to that--and that is what the other side would have you suggest--is to wait until Yucca Mountain is done, and that is the year 2015. 
We have a theme here that has been around for a long time and we continue, and it is here today and it is a legacy of broken promises. I think it is time that the Government start keeping its promises. It was 15 years ago that Congress passed a law that made a deal with America's electric consumers, and here was the deal. People who bought electricity from nuclear power plants would pay a small additional charge on their electric bills. In return, the Department of Energy would build storage and disposal facilities for used nuclear fuel from the nuclear power plants that supply 22 percent of our Nation's electricity--22 percent--second only to fossil fuels, coal. These facilities, as I have indicated, would be ready in 1998, at which time the Department of Energy would begin removing used fuel from the nuclear power sites. 
The consumers paid their money, but as it now stands the DOE is not going to hold up its end of the bargain. 
I think it is a travesty that we still are here today trying to get the Department of Energy to fulfill its responsibility to build a facility to manage this radioactive waste. In 15 years and nearly $13 billion in consumer funding for this program, it is pretty hard to see the progress that we have made. All consumers have in exchange for the billions of dollars so far is a legacy of broken promises from the Federal Government. Worse yet, the Energy Department says it cannot begin accepting fuel in the permanent repository until the year 2015, and that is if everything goes as planned. 
If you will bear with me, I would like to wander through the legacy of broken promises. Let us go back to 1984. This was a clear promise. Don Hodel, then Secretary of Energy, affirmed that the Energy Department is obligated to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants in 1998 whether or not a permanent disposal facility is ready. 
Nineteen eighty-seven, 3 years from 1984. Congress then designates Yucca Mountain, NV, as the only site to be evaluated--the only site to be evaluated. Congress, that is us, Mr. President. The Energy Department announces a 5-year delay in the opening date for a disposal facility, from 1998 to the year 2003. We went on from 1987 to 1989, another delay, another promise. The Department of Energy announces another major delay in the opening date for a permanent disposal facility until the year 2010 this time. 
Well, moving on; 1991 comes. We have mounting concerns. And the first sign of concerns appear over the Energy Department's ability to meet its obligation under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. So the State of Minnesota tells Energy Secretary James Watkins that it is highly probable that the Department of Energy will experience significant delay in meeting its obligation to begin taking high-level radioactive waste in 1998. 
May 1992. What do we have? More promises. Secretary of Energy Watkins tells Minnesota that the DOE is committed to fulfill the mandates imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The Department has sound, integrated program plans that should enable them to begin to receive spent fuel at an MRS--monitored retrievable storage--facility in 1998. 
December 1992, yet another promise. Energy Secretary Watkins acknowledges that attempts to find a volunteer host for an MRS facility have not succeeded. Another disappointment. He promises whatever is necessary to ensure that the Energy Department is able to start removing spent fuel from nuclear power plant sites in 1998. 
Well, moving on to May 1993, we get an affirmation from Secretary of Energy O'Leary that there is a moral obligation that the Department of Energy has to the electric utilities and their customers. And I quote: `If it does not have a legal obligation, then it has a moral obligation.' 
Well, I do not know whether you can make soup out of that. In May 1994, notice of inquiry. The Department of Energy publishes a notice of inquiry to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. The energy agency says in its preliminary view it does not have the statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or suitable storage facility. 
In May 1994, 14 utilities and 20 States sue the Department of Energy. A coalition of 14 utilities and public agencies in 20 States file separate but similar lawsuits seeking clarification of the Department of Energy's responsibility to accept spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998. 
April 1995. Here we go. Here is the Government's first acknowledgement of their policy. In April 1995, after starting this in 1984, 11 years, it comes out and says they have 
no obligation to take the fuel. Talk about a copout. They state that the Federal Government has no legal obligation to begin accepting high-level waste in 1998 if a repository is not open--according to the Department of Energy's interpretation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and its contracts with utilities. 
Fortunately, the court took another view. In July 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the Department of Energy is obliged to take fuel in 1998, and it is a legal as well as a moral obligation. So we finally got some action. That came out in July. 
In December 1996, the Department of Energy decides not to challenge the court ruling and admits failure and admits liability. The DOE acknowledges that it will not be able to meet its commitment to take waste in 1998. 
January 1997, the DOE's liability. Well, 46 State regulatory agencies and 33 electric utilities file new action for escrow of nuclear waste fees. That means they did not want them to go into the general fund anymore. They want this to go into an escrow fund so they will be available for the Federal Government to meet its obligation and order the DOE to take spent fuel in 1998. 
In March 1997 the court rejects the Department of Energy motion to dismiss before it is filed. The court tells the Department of Energy that a motion to dismiss would be inappropriate in this case and sets the case for damages and hearing of the merits. 
The Energy Department must have clear direction to develop an integrated system that will fulfill its obligation to manage the Nation's commercial and defense nuclear waste. S. 104 provides that by requiring construction of a central storage facility for used nuclear fuel and continued scientific investigation of a proposed repository at Yucca Mountain. The legislation also includes appropriate safeguards for the public and the environment at every step and provides consumers with a solution for the billions of dollars they have already paid into the program. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this comprehensive solution to one of the Nation's most pressing environmental issues and end the string of broken promises.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to call for a voice vote, but let me very briefly explain our position with regard to the action that is pending before the Senate. 
This provision requires the payment of a one-time fee due to be paid in fiscal year 2001. The one-time fee is the fee paid for fuel used before the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted. Most have already paid this fee. The timing of the payment was optional: Immediately or when the fuel was taken. If paid when the fuel was taken, then interest must be paid by the utilities. Most utilities that have not paid the fee put it in escrow, and this simply requires that the fee be turned over to the Federal Government so it can be used as an offset to the user fee implemented by S. 104. 
So the amendment simply corrects a technical issue with regard to the fee provision of the substitute. We had been previously advised by CBO that the provision had no Budget Act impact and, as a consequence, this action basically makes us in conformance with the Budget Act.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think, again, we have to address the question of informed speculation, and the reference made a few minutes ago by my friend from Nevada to what happened in Germany mixes apples and oranges. The issue was not spent fuel leaving Germany. It was vitrified waste coming back to Germany. There is a substantial difference. What happens in the vitrifying process is that they recover the radioactive material and mix it with a glass form. 
It is radioactive. There is no question about it. But to suggest, as my friend from Nevada would, that this is the same stuff as shipping spent fuel, that's the apples and oranges issue. 
I think what we have seen today proves my point, which is that nobody wants this. I am not being critical of my friends from Nevada. It doesn't make any difference whether it be the State of Michigan--and Vermont has been suggested as having one of the best types of granite-based rocks, from the standpoint of stability and geology. But I am sure if that were a selected site for a permanent repository, or temporary repository, we would have the delegation from Vermont right where the delegation from Nevada is. That is the reality of this. We have had representatives from the West exempt Washington, and for reasons that Washington says they are fed up, they have had enough waste. They continue to have waste, several hundreds of tons of waste, thousands of tons of waste. They don't want any more. The reason they don't want any more is there is no way to dispose of it. They are beginning to start a vitrification process. 
The same is true in South Carolina. They don't want any more. They have it there now. The reason they don't want any more is there is no way to dispose of it. They are vitrifying now. The vitrification is, for the most part, military waste. They are recovering liquid waste from the tanks. I have been out to Hanford and I have been to South Carolina. Now, we are seeing Tennessee. Tennessee has high-level nuclear waste stored there. Idaho does, too. I am kind of surprised we don't have every Senator down here exempting his or her State. That is one way to ensure that they are not going to get it. Then where are you going to put it if you can't put it in one of the 50 States? Are you going to put it on the Atlantic coast? No. Are you going to send it to Canada? They don't want it. You might be able to send it to Europe for a fee, I don't know. So you move to the Pacific. What do you have there? You have some islands. Maybe we have some Indian reservations that might be interested. But, undoubtedly, that would not be suitable to the State governments. We have Palmira off of the Hawaiian islands being mentioned from time to time. There is a group, as a matter of fact, that was promoting it--for a fee. They said they owned the island. They have islands in the South Pacific. Some of them are individual nations, and they have been interested in doing it, perhaps, for a fee. But that is a bit dangerous, Mr. President, because we are not sure what the proliferation capability might be in that kind of situation. 
So what has happened today on the floor of the U.S. Senate proves my point, which is that nobody wants it. So we have seen three States exempt themselves. The unfortunate part is that we are still left with our friends from Nevada. I was here when the decision was made to put a permanent repository in Nevada. Several of the staff members were there at that time. There was a Republican Senator from Nevada, who is not here anymore, perhaps as a consequence of that decision being made by that body to put a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. He fought valiantly, he fought hard, and he is not back here. He lost. That is just the reality of being honest with the facts. The facts are that we have to put it somewhere. 
Now, the Nevadans would have you leave it where it is. Well, there is a democratic process around here. Nobody ever said it was fair. I convey that in all humility, relative to the reality of what it means. But Nevada has had an extraordinary experience with nuclear weapons over a long period of time. It has been named as a permanent repository. The reality is that when that permanent repository is done, the waste at the 80 sites in 41 States will be transported there. It is rather inconsistent that we don't hear from our colleagues in Nevada the objection about the continued expenditure that is going into Yucca Mountain; $6 billion has been expended and 4 1/2 miles of tunnel is already done, and they continue to work on the tunnel and continue to spend money. And $30 billion is probably going to be expended before it is licensed and opened. That has some benefit. But what it really says is 
that the decision that was made by Congress many years ago to site the permanent site at Yucca Mountain, as it progresses, will become a reality and, indeed, Nevada will be the site of a permanent repository. 
Virtually everybody is in agreement that we need a permanent repository for our waste, unless we abandon our current policy of burying our high-level nuclear waste. It is kind of interesting because we are one of the few nations that continues to pursue burying waste with plutonium in it. The French and the Japanese recover it through reprocessing. That is how you get rid of the proliferation threat. But there is a mentality and a group of environmental organizations that simply think that that would foster and expand the nuclear power industry in this country and advance nuclear development. I am not here to argue that point today, Mr. President. But that is the harsh reality. We are still talking about burying it. The rest of the world is developing a technology that says it is too valuable to bury. We don't want the proliferation threat, so we reprocess it in MOX fuel and burn it in our reactors. We even have the technology in the United States at Palos Verdes. I was out there in Arizona. That reactor was built to take MOX fuel. We could do that. If there was ever a crack in the administration's armor relative to nuclear waste, it is their reluctant acknowledgment that they must begin vitrification of military waste in this country. Whether that will lead, ultimately, to the recovery of plutonium and putting that back in the reactors, we have yet to see. So we are proceeding under the tired old argument that we have to bury it. 
We are committed on that path, and we are going to spend $30 billion and we are going to put that site in Nevada when it is licensed. So we have a democratic process, we have 50 States, and we have to put it in one of them. Now, we talk about praying to the Lord and the comment that the President is likely to veto S. 104. Well, if anyone would ask the administration, as I have done--I have sent three letters to the President in response to the assertion that the administration doesn't approve of S. 104 --for what their proposal is, the truth is that they have no proposal. You have heard it. Leave it where it is. Leave it where it is until Yucca is done in the year 2015. 
I have extensively gone through an explanation of how many of our reactors would have to shut down, what percentage of the 22 percent total power generated by nuclear power contributes to this country. We have reactors that are shutting down now. We have some that will shut down next year. We are going to lose power in various States. Maybe we can temporarily put that high-level waste in casks on the surface. But, remember, these areas were not designed for permanent storage. These reactors are in areas of population. They weren't designed to carry long-term high-level waste in the adjacent areas surrounding them. 
This needs to be in one place, not 80 sites. Nobody has come up with a better site than the Nevada desert. So when we talk about the administration's plan, there is no plan. During the confirmation of Secretary of Energy PenAE6a, the best we could get was a commitment that the problem of disposal of nuclear waste was `in his portfolio.' Well, that is a gracious acknowledgment. Of course it's in his portfolio; he's the Secretary of Energy. We have had no input from the administration about what to do because the administration has yet to perform under the contractual agreement that is due next year. I suppose it is a stacked deck, if I could respond to my friends from Nevada. But it could be a stacked deck against West Virginia, or a stacked deck against Vermont, or a stacked deck against Alaska. But to leave it where it is, it is a stacked deck against 41 States. That simply is not an alternative, Mr. President. 
That is where we are in this debate today, and that is where we have been from the beginning. We wander in and out of concerns relative to casks. Good Heavens, if American engineering can't develop casks designed to withstand whatever the threat is--if the British, the Swedes, the Germans, the Japanese and the French 
can do it, we can do it. 
One more time, if I may, let me show you what has happened in this country. It speaks for itself. There is the transportation network, 2,400 shipments. Do you think those were shipped in rubber bands? Those were shipped, according to Federal and State law, in approved containers. To suggest that we don't have approved containers to ship out, we will get what we have to have. You are not going to build these containers and these casks until you have permission to move it. But these are moving now in approved vessels, just as they would be if they are placed in a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain; they would be placed in appropriate casks. They would either be within a cask, a transportation cask, and removed out there, or left in a double cask, or put in a semipermanent cask. 
So what we have here, Mr. President, is a lot of informed speculation, which I guess this place has an abundance of, whether it be spring, winter, or fall. But let's be honest with one another. Where we are in this debate is to either leave it where it is or move it to Nevada where, clearly, my friends don't want it moved. I admire their conviction, diligence and commitment. It is almost like they are willing to lay their lives in the path of whatever movement is occurring on this side. But, unfortunately, that is just the way it is because there is no other alternative. I believe my friend from Tennessee may want to speak a bit on the pending business. Am I correct in my assumption?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are somewhat optimistic that we are going to have a time agreement soon, and it is my understanding that the leaders are addressing that matter now, so I hope to have some information for Senators very soon. 
Let me make a few comments relative to accidents, which, of course, are of concern as we contemplate moving nuclear waste throughout the country. But let us take a look at facts because again we have been graced with a good deal of informed speculation. 
Let me refer first to the NEI fact sheet dated June 10, 1996, from the Nuclear Energy Institute, an objective evaluation on the question of accidents. The question was: Have there been accidents that exposed the public to radiation from spent fuel cargo? And the answer is on absolutely no occasion between 1971 and 1989 has any person been exposed to radioactivity or radiation from spent-fuel cargo or associated accidents. 
Let us talk about the accidents, Mr. President, because this is what it is all about. 
Seven accidents occurred in the movement of 2,400 shipments from 1979 to 1995 as indicated by the chart. None caused any release of radioactivity. The most severe of these, and it was severe, occurred in 1971 in Tennessee. We just heard from the Senator from Tennessee. We had a tractor trailer carrying a 25-ton spent-fuel shipping container swerve to avoid a head-on collision. It went out of control and overturned. The trailer with the container still attached broke free from the tractor and skidded into a rain-filled ditch. The container suffered minor damage but did not release any radioactive material. 
Now, how many chemical spills have we had where the tank car was broken open or spilled or punctured in some way? The difference between the two exposures are obvious. These are designed to withstand accidents, and they have. So again we can reflect on the rhetoric, but if we look at reality nothing is risk free, Mr. President, nor is nuclear transportation relative to high-level waste. 
A lot of people assume that if there is a penetration, there is going to be a calamity of some kind. Obviously, there would be radiation. But we have technology that addresses that radiation, just as it is addressed when the rods are taken out of the pools. You would think there is some magic here. These nuclear rods sit in the pools. What are in the pools? Water. They come out of the pools. They are exposed. They are placed in a cask. There is exposure there, but it is regulated and controlled. 
We have a statement by Mr. Robert M. Jefferson. Who is Mr. Jefferson? He was manager of the Transportation Technology Center at the Sandia National Labs in the early 1970's, distinguished in his knowledge and expertise on the matter of transportation of high-level radioactive wastes.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am just going to read the reference to the question of exposure on transportation. He is responding to the questions relative to his area of responsibility in cask design and transportation, and I quote: 
As a result of these efforts we reached the conclusion---- 
And this is the National Sandia Laboratories---- 
We reached the conclusion that transportation of spent nuclear fuel in casks designed to meet NRC standards evaluated and certified by NRC would never---- 
Now, this is something---- 
Would never encounter a transportation accident severe enough to challenge the integrity of the container. 
This is a pretty broad statement by a professional who stands behind his statement with his career. 
Would never encounter a transportation accident severe enough to challenge the integrity of the container. 
Some of these accidents, I am told, involved flat tires. Well, I am not going to get into all seven accidents. 
One other reference, and that is to the Japanese situation. 
Yes, there was a leak in the sodium liquid coolant associated with the Honshu reactor in Japan. That reactor is currently shut down. Again, like with all mechanical devices, accidents can occur. In this particular case the accident was addressed by a professional procedure. No one was exposed to radioactivity. And to suggest Japan is somehow abandoning its commitment to nuclear power defies reality. 
Outside of Matsue, Japan, is a place called Rekosha. The Japanese are committed to spend $24 billion. I went in the plant. I physically saw it. It is absolute state of the art--$24 billion to initiate a fueling, reprocessing mox fuel facility which would be the most advanced in the world. The reason the Japanese are pursuing this, they obviously have a great deal of sensitivity to nuclear radiation based on their unfortunate experience in the Second World War, but they feel nuclear power generation is appropriate for Japan. It addresses the concern they have over air quality, and it addresses an economic concern they have on dependence on oil from the Mideast. So they have made their decision, Mr. President. 
It is important that we keep facts in mind as we address where we are in this debate. Again, the debate boils down to my point: Nobody wants it. We have to put it somewhere. Unfortunately, Nevada seems to be the site that has been selected for the permanent repository. 
Mr. President, I am told that there is a colloquy pending which would, I believe, wind up our side's discussion for now. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. There are basically two types of storage. 
One is in a pool adjacent to the reactor which is temporary and, in many cases, that is full. At least one power company is beginning to store their fuel in casks on the surface, they simply have run out of space, and the Senator from Idaho is correct in his assessment that those facilities were not designed to be of a permanent or long-lasting nature, they were to be of a temporary nature pending the movement of that out to a central site.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct.

It is theoretically possible that there may be a determination that the areas are inadequate to store additional fuel and the reactors will have to shut down.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that the figure is in that range of $40 billion to $80 billion. There was a more precise figure. It was figured at about $59 million. I think it is important for the Senator from Idaho to note evidently there was a meeting recently between the Secretary of Energy and some representatives of the nuclear power industry where the Department of Energy offered to pay the nuclear power companies for storing the fuel at the sites of the reactors. 
It is my understanding the industry declined to accept or pursue that proposal any further because it would simply leave the fuel in those temporary areas and would not solve the problem of getting rid of the fuel. It would simply transfer, if you will, a funding mechanism. I think it is rather ironic the administration would make that kind of a proposal when, clearly, the intent of Congress is to provide a permanent repository or, as this bill provides, a temporary repository until such time as Yucca Mountain is predetermined to be suitable. 
So what they are doing is kind of, on the one hand, acknowledging their financial responsibility by offering to reimburse them, and acknowledging that they, in 1998, have to take title to the fuel but physically not wanting to take it because they have no place to put it. That is why I have been so critical of the administration's lack of any substantive suggestions on, as they opposed S. 104, what they are for, and they have yet to communicate to this Senator what they are for or what their proposal is relative to the immediacy of these reactors that are facing maximum capacity and potential shutdown.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct, and the reason for that is, it was felt it was necessary to either have Congress address the responsibility of a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain or the President designate it, and if the President chose not to designate it, it would be at Yucca Mountain. 
What we have attempted to do by this legislation is basically close the box so we simply could not walk out of here after a week of debate without a definitive solution to putting our waste, at least in a temporary repository, until Yucca Mountain is done. 
And we spent a great deal of time discussing and fashioning the bill and felt it imperative that we had to conclude some solid solution as opposed to simply finding ourselves going through an extended debate and leaving it where it is at 80 sites in 41 States.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am the first to acknowledge the probability of some 5 tons of nuclear waste being exposed to the air, the land, moving in whatever moisture that may take place in that arid area. But that is unlike the high-level nuclear waste that would be stored there in a temporary retrievable repository. That waste would be enclosed in casks designed to omit no radioactivity outside the cask. 
So I would point out to my friend that there is a significant difference when you talk about 85 tons of contained waste in many, many containers that are designed to hold it with no exposed radioactivity outside and 5 tons of nuclear waste that just went up. It is in the dust. It is in the air. And that is indeed unfortunate. I think it does express a difference.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the persuasive arguments of my friend from Arkansas who is a well-known lawyer. I happen to be a banker and not nearly as well known. But I know what a contract is. A contract is a binding commitment of performance. And the question that the Senator from Arkansas raises in his amendment is the sanctity of that contract. This is a subject of pending litigation. I think it is inappropriate to interfere in the sanctity of the Federal contracts. We have a fair administrative process. The courts are involved in this. I think it is important to look at a little history because the Department of Energy has been aware of its obligation since 1982. 
My reading of the Bumpers amendment suggests that it is essentially representing a determination now by Congress that the Department of Energy is faultless in its default. 
I think it is the court's job to make that determination. In my opinion, the Department of Energy has followed a consistent course of delay, a consistent course of avoidance including their failure to ask Congress for any additional funds or authority needed to meet the obligation. 
The Senator from Arkansas suggests that it is the responsibility of the Congress because Congress did not appropriate any money. I am not aware that the Department of Energy ever asked for any money. 
Let us look at the history because I hope that my colleague from Arkansas, when he clearly listens, will agree that this legacy of broken promises is something that is reprehensible relative to a responsible department addressing its contractual commitment. I think it sets, if you will, a norm on the issue of contracts. If a contract with the Government is not binding, it sets a pretty poor example, a pretty poor example for youth and a pretty poor example of how Government meets its obligations.

And that is what the court has done. And if the Senator will bear with me while I go through the history, I think he will agree.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would certainly agree with my friend from Kentucky, and I hope he will agree after a short review of the history that that is exactly what happens. 
Let me give you my version of the record because it goes back to a legacy of broken promises starting in 1984. We had a commitment, a clear promise by Don Hodel, then Secretary of Energy, affirming that the Energy Department is obligated to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from nuclear powerplants in 1998 whether or not a permanent disposal facility is ready. 
Now, we went on a few years and got into 1987, a 3-year delay. Congress then, this body, designated Yucca Mountain, NV, as the only site to be evaluated. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy announces a 5-year delay in the opening date for a disposal facility from 1998 to the year 2003. They did not ask for any money. They did not mention money. They simply announced a 5-year delay in the opening day. 
In 1989, another delay, another promise. The Department of Energy announces another delay in the opening date for a permanent disposal facility until the year 2010. We are told now, of course, by the most recent Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, that that cannot be ready until the year 2015. 
We went on in 1991 with mounting concerns. The first sign of concern appears over the Energy Department's ability to meet its obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The State of Minnesota tells the Energy Secretary, James Watkins, that it is `highly probable that your department will experience significant delay in meeting its obligation to begin taking high-level radioactive waste in 1998.' Nothing about money. 
So we move into 1992. More promises. Secretary Watkins tells Minnesota's DOE, and I quote, `The DOE is committed to fulfill the mandates imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The department has sound, integrated programs and plans that should enable us to begin spent fuel receipt on an MRS, a monitored retrievable, storage facility in 1998.' 
We move to December 1992, another promise. Energy Secretary Watkins acknowledges that attempts to find a volunteer host for an MRS facility have not succeeded. He promised to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the Energy Department is able to start removing spent fuel from nuclear power sites in 1998. 
I do not know what my friend would think of the moral obligation, but it is interesting to note that Secretary O'Leary in May 1993 affirms that the Energy Department `has an obligation' to electric utilities and their customers. `If it does not have a legal obligation, then it has a moral obligation.' That really does not mean much other than acknowledgement of just a moral obligation. 
But in May 1994 there was a notice of inquiry. DOE 
published a notice of inquiry to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. The energy agency says, `Preliminarily, it's our view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or suitable storage facility.' 
That is the first time they denied, if you will, that they had a statutory obligation to accept the spent fuel. 
Well, then we move over to May 1994 and 14 utilities and 20 States bring suit to the Department of Energy. A coalition of 14 utilities and public agencies in 20 States file separate but similar lawsuits seeking clarification of the Energy Department's responsibility to accept spent fuel beginning back in 1998. 
Then we go to April 1995. No obligation to take the fuel, the Department of Energy says. No obligation on the one hand. Previously, they said they did not have a statutory obligation. In April, they said the Federal Government has no legal obligation to begin accepting high-level waste in 1998 if a repository is not open, according to the DOE's interpretation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and contracts with utilities. Still no mention about funding. 
In July 1996 we have a different view, a very different view. In July 1996 the court ruled, and this is the U.S. Court of Appeals, that the Department of Energy's obligation to take the fuel in 1998 is a legal as well as a moral obligation. So there we have the dictate of the court, which I think addresses the concern of the Senator from Arkansas. 
In December 1996, the Department of Energy does not challenge the court's ruling and admits failure. The DOE acknowledges that it will not be able to meet its commitments to take the waste in 1998. 
In January 1997, the DOE's liability is addressed and 46 State regulatory agencies and 33 electric utilities file new action for escrow of nuclear waste funds and to order the DOE to take the spent fuel in 1998. 
In March 1997, the court rejects the Department of Energy's motion to dismiss before it is filed. 
So that is the last legal action. The court tells the DOE that a motion to dismiss would be `inappropriate in this case' and sets the case for damages for a hearing on the merits. 
Mr. President, a deal is a deal.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may make a correction regarding what I believe is the intent of my friend from New Mexico. It does not exclude a State, but it does exclude sites. My State of Alaska has had the experience of two underground nuclear explosions, the two largest that have ever occurred. That is the limitation of our experience. I cannot speak for Senators from the State of Washington or Oregon. Senator Wyden, as you know, felt very strongly about eliminating the Hanford site. He explained his rationale to me, that Hanford was still receiving substantial quantities of waste associated with reactors that had been cut up from the submarines, coming up the Columbia River. I hope he comes to the floor and speaks for himself, but on this matter he explained that he felt that Hanford had taken enough waste and Hanford is the largest current holder of spent nuclear fuel in inventory in tonnage, approximately 2,133 tons. Whether that satisfies the Senator from New Mexico, I do not know. 
Savannah River, SC, Senator Thurmond and Senator Hollings felt very strongly about the continued responsibility of the Savannah River facility to take additional waste, wastes coming in from Europe at this time, waste that is being vitrified. They have approximately 206 metric tons. 
At Oak Ridge, in Tennessee, Senator Frist and Senator Thompson have indicated their concern. They currently have 46 tons of spent nuclear fuel. 
Whether those sites can be construed as different, I think you could probably make a case, from the situation in your State--but I cannot speak for your State and I will not. The only thing I can say is this is spent nuclear fuel. The theory, as the Senator knows, of this process of everybody coming in and eliminating his State could progress on this floor. We could go through 47, 48, 49--whether we would get them all and come full circle, I do not know. But I can express that these sites have major cleanup operations ongoing, unlike other sites. The Department of Energy is spending literally billions of dollars to attempt to stabilize these wastes. I have been out to Hanford. I have seen the efforts out there to generate the technology, to get the destabilized waste out of the tanks. Some of those tanks are believed to be unstable and leaking. 
I have seen the efforts at Savannah to recover the liquid waste from the tanks. The spent fuel is in pools and corroding. I have seen that physically. They claim they have a priority. I cannot make that scientific judgment. But the Senators from those States are obviously concerned that these sites cannot handle the new job of dealing with more commercial fuel and continuing their obligation to clean up sites that have not been properly taken care of. So I think, if I can perhaps express the argument which I assume prevails among the majority of my colleagues who have spoken on this subject--I would welcome the rest of them to come down and speak for themselves. I reserve the remaining time on our side to accommodate those Members. 
Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens and myself, I am reintroducing the Fishing Industry Bargaining Act, a bill to allow antitrust immunity for certain cooperative activities involving domestic fishermen and processors. 
This bill will allow collective agreement between fishermen and processors. It is patterned after legislation adopted by the Alaska State Legislature, but which requires congressional action to fully take effect. 
Under existing law, fishermen are able to form associations for the purpose of collective bargaining with individual processors. This bill will allow them to work with similar associations of processors to establish first-wholesale purchase prices--that is, the prices paid to the processors for fish products, and ex-vessel prices paid to the fishermen. 
This is intended to counter the fact that prices currently are all too often set by first-wholesale buyers rather than producers. As a result, processors forced to accept a price set by their buyers are in turn forced to set ex-vessel prices based on the buyers' offer, rather than prices that respond fully to other market forces. 
I want to make it clear that this bill in no way would allow processors to associate solely amongst themselves to set either ex-vessel or wholesale prices. That is the kind of activity our current antitrust law is primarily designed to prevent, and this bill will leave that unchanged. Processors would continue to be prohibited from agreeing on prices unless fishermen participated in and were party to any agreement. 
What the bill will accomplish is to strengthen the position of the United States seafood industry generally--fishermen and processors together. In this, it would apply to fishermen and fish processors in all parts of the country, not just in Alaska. 
We look forward to a hearing which will air the views of the Alaska fishing industry and the fishing industry in other parts of the country, and urge prompt action by this Congress.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this begins our third day of debate on S. 104, the nuclear waste repository legislation, which has been introduced by myself and Senator Craig and a number of other cosponsors. This may not be a very exciting topic, Mr. President, but it is an important issue and it is an important responsibility for this body. 
What we have is a situation where, as the charts will show, at some 80 sites in 41 States this waste has been accumulating. The Federal Government agreed in 1982 to accept this waste by 1998. Well, 1998 is next year. Now, the site that has been suggested as being the best for the waste is out in the Nevada desert at the Nevada test site. 
Again, to refresh the memories of my colleagues, this is what the site looks like. It was used for over 50 years for more than 800 nuclear weapons tests. It is probably one of the more remote areas in the United States, but it is unique inasmuch as it has been a selected test site. 
Now, why this site? That is a legitimate question, and I know my colleagues from Nevada are very concerned about it being designated in their State. I am sympathetic to that. But the reality is that it has to be put somewhere, Mr. President. In the debate yesterday, my colleagues from Nevada claimed that during the development of our nuclear program, it was necessary to do our patriotic duty to designate an area out in the Nevada desert, and you might say their State was used for that purpose as a contribution to the effort to fight and win the cold war. 
I think it is fair to say, and the statement was made yesterday, that Congress chose that area to be studied for nuclear waste disposal for political reasons. Well, I don't know whether that is correct or not. It had to be somewhere. But Nevada is where we conducted nuclear tests, and where there is radioactivity from those tests. But in the debate yesterday, the Senators from Nevada indicated there was no rational, technical, or scientific reason for placing a spent fuel storage facility in Nevada. Well, I don't know any other place in the country where we tested 800 nuclear bombs. 
Now, it's also important to note that the Department of Energy spent over a billion dollars studying other potential sites before narrowing the list to three sites, including Yucca Mountain. Congress settled on Yucca Mountain in 1987. It indicated that it had a unique geology, and it tied in the reality that the Nevada test site had been used to explode nuclear weapons for 50 years. In other words, it said that from a geological point of view, it meets our expectations. Secondly, it is an area that has been used, and, therefore, it should be sufficient for this type of permanent repository. 
As we look at this test site, we should recognize that the last weapon was exploded underground there in 1991. Underground tests are still being performed with nuclear materials being exploded with conventional explosives, as I understand it, from time to time--all with the wholehearted support, I might add, of the Nevada delegation. In fact, not too long ago, one of the Nevada Senators supported storing spent fuel at the site. 
I have a copy of a resolution that reappeared, from the Nevada assembly; it's joint resolution No. 15. That is a copy of the resolution, Mr. President, dated February 26, 1975. I am not going to read the whole resolution, but I think it is important to recognize this:  
Whereas, the people of southern Nevada have confidence in the safety record of the Nevada test site and in the ability of the staff to site and to maintain safety in handling of nuclear materials. 
And, also: 
Whereas, nuclear waste disposal can be carried out at the Nevada test site with minimal capital investment relative to other locations. 
That is from the copy of the resolution that we have on the chart behind me. 
Therefore, be it resolved by the assembly and the State of Nevada jointly that the legislature of the State of Nevada strongly urges the Energy Research and Development Administration to choose the Nevada test site for the disposal of nuclear waste. 
Now, Mr. President, that was indicative of the attitude prevailing on February 26, 1975. The resolution was passed. It passed the Nevada Senate by a 12-6 vote, aided by the vote of one of our colleagues here in the Senate from Nevada, and it was signed by the Governor of Nevada, Mike O'Callaghan. 
Well, I ask, Mr. President, what has changed? That test site hasn't changed. It is still there. It still has a trained work force, still has an infrastructure for dealing with nuclear materials. The geology of the site certainly hasn't changed. Obviously, at least one of the Nevada Senators thought it was the best place to store nuclear waste in 1975, or he would not have supported this resolution. In my opinion, when you are all through with going through the areas in the rest of the States, it is still the best place. 
Where are we today? Well, we are still on our way--business as usual around the Senate, putting off decisions. We began this debate in the 104th Congress with the consideration of S. 1271. 
The Nevada Senators objected saying that the bill would gut environmental laws, allow unsafe transportation, and endanger the health and safety of Americans. We had objections from the administration saying that we were choosing Nevada as the site prior to the determination that the Yucca Mountain site would be viable as a permanent repository. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, we began this debate with the consideration of Senate bill 1271. The Senators from Nevada, of course, objected, saying the bill would gut environmental laws, saying it would allow unsafe transportation and endanger the health and safety of Americans. 
We had objections from the administration. They opposed choosing Nevada as the interim site prior to a determination that Yucca Mountain would be viable as a permanent repository. To address these concerns and others, we have attempted to adjust our bill. We began with Senate bill 1271, then a new bill, Senate bill 1936, and again with an amendment in the form of a committee substitute to Senate bill 1936. With each new version of the bill, we attempted to strengthen the public health and environmental safeguards as well as meet the criteria of Members who were concerned about these items. 
First, in an effort to address the administration's concerns, we made it clear that no construction of an interim facility would take place at the Nevada test site until Yucca Mountain was determined to be technically viable as a permanent repository. So let me make that clear. No construction would be initiated without the viability being determined. 
We have extended the time period in order to accommodate the reality that nothing moves very fast when you are addressing nuclear waste. 
With respect to concerns over radiation protection standards, we began with a 100-millirem standard which could not be reviewed by any Federal agency. The bill before us today allows the EPA to issue a stricter standard if it determines one is necessary. So we have tightened up on the radiation standards. 
With respect to the NEPA requirements, our latest version requires the Department of Energy and the NRC to fulfill the requirements of NEPA in conjunction with the operation of both an interim storage facility and a repository. Our first bill did not contain that requirement. So, again, we tightened it up with regard to NEPA requirements. 
With respect to concern about transportation safety, we have accepted transportation language offered by Senator Moseley-Braun of Illinois, Senator Wyden, and others. 
With respect to the preemption of other laws, we proposed language consistent with the preemption authority found in the existing Hazardous Material Transportation Act. Indeed, I think we have made substantial changes in the bill. What is before us today is far different than what we originally introduced as Senate bill 1271 in the 104th Congress. 
Despite all of the changes we have made, the opponents of this bill continue to object to the bill as if no changes were made. We have heard it referred to as `Mobile Chernobyl,' `emasculating NEPA laws' and `running roughshod over all environmental laws.' 
The emotional rhetoric that has been used fails to recognize the changes we have made in this bill and the charges that we have refuted. 
The suggestion has been made that the transportation is unsafe. We have shown how we have safely been moving fuel around for many years. I have some charts behind me to show that. Not only have we moved fuel, but fuel has been moved overseas. 
Here is a chart showing specifically fuel what is coming to the United States from other countries: Australia; it is coming from Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Canada. How does it get here? It moves. It is transported. And it is transported safely. The French, the Japanese, and the Swedes are moving spent nuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel is coming from Japan, going to France for reprocessing, being taken back to Japan, and being put back in the reactors. They have what they call reprocessing. They don't bury their waste. They put it back in the reactors and burn it. It combats proliferation. I am not here to argue the merits of that. I am simply showing that this waste does move, and it moves in transportation casks. 
We have heard it argued that transportation casks are unsafe. But we have shown that the transportation casks can withstand significant exposure to crashes, and can survive fires. We have shown the casks have been tested by a locomotive hitting them at the 90 miles an hour, or crash into a brick wall at 80 miles per hour, submerged in water, and bathed in fire. These casks are safe, and they are designed to survive any type of real world accident. We have the technology to do that. 
I also want to show a chart relative to the movement of waste throughout the United States, which I think is significant inasmuch as it reflects on the reality that we move a tremendous amount of waste throughout the United States. 
But here we are. In the years 1979 to 1995, there were 2,400 shipments across the United States through every State except Florida and South Dakota. I don't know how we missed those. But there are the transportation routes. So we have moved them safely. We have shown that our national labs have certified that the casks can survive any real world crash. 
We have heard statements that radiation protection standards are unsafe. We have shown how our standard is more protective than the current EPA guidance that allows five times as much. We allow EPA to tighten the standards further, if need be. 
It has been said on the other side that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board says there is no compelling technical or safety reasons to move fuel through a central location. 
We have shown that a more complete reading of the Technical Review Board's testimony--and their report--indicates there is a need for interim storage, and there is a need for Yucca if Yucca is determined to be a suitable site for the permanent repository. 
The other side has indicated we can delay this action until 
August 1998, at a time when a viability determination is made with respect to Yucca. 
We have shown that delay is what has gotten us into this situation in the first place. 
There is a court case which has already determined that the Federal Government is liable because of its delays and its inability to accept the waste. 
Eight months from now, when the Government is in breech of contract, then the courts are going to consider the damage that we face. 
We as legislators have a responsibility to protect the taxpayers. With each delay, the damage is going to mount. With each delay, the liability to the taxpayer will mount. With each delay, there will be a pressure to yield to even further delays. The call for delay is really a siren's song. It is a trap. It is an excuse for no action. 
Only yesterday I heard our ranking member, Senator Bumpers, suggesting that we could wait until August 1998 to deal with this problem. Well, it might sound reasonable at first. It has been so long now. But let's give it a little more thought. 
Will Congress deal with the nuclear waste issue in an election year with time running out in the 105th Congress? I think not. Will my friends from Nevada forego their rights to filibuster the bill at that time? I think not. As a practical matter, delay until August 1998 will slip to 1999. And, if we are waiting until 1999, why not allow the decision to wait for the license applications in 2001 or 2002? 
All the while we will be in violation of our contractual commitment. We will be increasing the damages. If we delay until 2001 or 2002, then why not delay until final licensing of a permanent repository is due in the year 2015. 
Let me refer you to the picture of where we propose to put this. This waste would be put in a temporary repository located at the Nevada test site, which was used for more than 50 years and over 800 nuclear weapons tests have taken place in that area. 
That is what we propose. It would be adjacent to the continuing development of a permanent site in Yucca Mountain. We have gotten nearly 5 miles of tunnel done now. The problem is that site is not going to be ready until the year 2015. 
I do not expect the changes we have made in this bill, along with the others, will necessarily satisfy all my friends on the other side. All the members of the Nevada delegation have appeared before the committee, and they have said they would oppose any approach that would bring nuclear waste to Nevada, so I do not realistically expect my good friends to change their minds. They are doing what they feel they must do for their State. But I do hope my other colleagues who have not expressed support for our bill will understand just how far we have already come to make accommodations and to reject the emotional rhetoric that has been heard so often with regard to this bill. 
We are starting this bill with 63 votes. That is what we had last year. It is no secret that we are seeking a higher number. So we are prepared to adopt amendments today to further address the concerns of some Members who have indicated concerns to the White House as well and to generally try to tackle all reasonable concerns that still may persist about the bill. We have developed this substitute amendment. We have worked closely with Senator Bingaman, and I commend him and his staff for their hard work. 
Let me go over the amendments very briefly, point by point. S. 104 sets the size of the interim storage facility at 60,000 metric tons. Opponents of S. 104 have charged that the large size of this interim storage facility diverts resources away from the permanent repository at Yucca. 
The Senators from Nevada have also incorrectly stated that it is our intent to make the interim repository the de facto permanent repository. Clearly, that is not the case. 
Our amendment allows the Secretary to set the size of the facility based on the emplacement. Initial capacity would be 33,100 metric tons. This adequately addresses charges made by the critics of S. 104 that the repository is too large, and it makes it clear that the interim facility can never be a substitute for a permanent repository. 
As we have said all along, the work at Yucca for the permanent repository will go on; it must go on. This provision in our substitute makes it clear that it has to go on.

<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend. Let me begin again. 
The administration's position states that S. 104 would `effectively replace EPA's authority to set acceptable release standards.' Our amendment, as I have stated earlier, places the EPA in a key role developing risk-based standards for the repository consistent with the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The administration position states that S. 104 would create loopholes in the application of the National Environmental Policy Act. 
We have answered that. A full EIS is required prior to placement of any waste in temporary storage or the repository, and our amendment requires the evaluation of transportation which S. 104 excluded. 
The administration also stated that S. 104 would `weaken existing environmental standards by preempting all Federal, State and local laws inconsistent with the environmental requirements of this bill and the Atomic Energy Act.' 
Our amendment completely changes section 501 of the bill. There will be full application of health and safety laws except where the local jurisdiction attempts to unreasonably stand in the way of the Federal mandate. 
The administration's position further states that S. 104 `would undermine the ongoing work at the permanent disposal site by siphoning away resources.' 
That is simply not true. Our amendment establishes a user fee which was specifically added to provide sufficient funds for the construction and operation of a central storage facility and continued work at Yucca Mountain. 
Finally, the administration's position states that `it would undermine the credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program by designating a site for an interim storage facility before viability has been assessed.' 
As I have said earlier, that is simply not true. Our bill specifically conditions the use of the Nevada test site as a site for a temporary storage until completion, until completion of a viability assessment for the repository at Yucca Mountain. We have attempted to mirror the administration's position on this issue, and I think we have. 
Mr. President, we have worked very hard to satisfy legitimate concerns of the administration and all Senators. We continue to remain open to suggestions. Our willingness to consider new approaches will not stop with the Senate passage of this bill. There will be consideration in the House, and there will be a conference. This is not the last word. We will continue our quest for compromise that is not only acceptable to a bipartisan majority of Congress but hopefully the President as well. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to again advise my colleagues of my thanks to Senator Bingaman for the efforts made to accommodate his amendments. I think we were able to accommodate seven of the eight. I would like to conclude by simply explaining the one that we could not resolve. 
As the Chair is aware, Senator Bingaman opposes our provision, and that specific provision is if the Yucca Mountain site fails as a permanent disposal site, if it fails in the sense of the licensing viability or suitability test, why, then the President must pick an alternative temporary site. Our position is that if we should get to this point, and it is very unlikely that it could occur, that Yucca would fail as a permanent disposal site, it would be the President's obligation to pick a temporary site. It would also bind Congress in approving the President's site. However, if Congress does not approve, or if the President fails to pick a site in 2 1/2 years, then we go back to the Nevada test site more or less as the default position. 
Senator Bingaman's position is a little different. He says if Yucca fails and the President picks a site, and, of course, Congress must approve, but if the Yucca site is not approved and the President does not pick, or Congress does not approve, then the waste would stay where it is, at 80 sites in 41 States, and it would stay there, well, until we developed a new nuclear waste program for the country. It could stay there basically, in his contention, for an extended period of time. 
We found that irreconcilable. We feel that in order to bring this to a conclusion, we have to structure the amendments in such a way as to determine, indeed, that if Yucca Mountain is not deemed to be an adequate site and if the President finds it necessary as a consequence of Yucca not being deemed an adequate site, the responsibility is the President's, with the approval of Congress, but if all proposed to duck responsibility, then clearly it comes back to the Nevada test site in default. And the rationale for that is obvious. Without closing the loop, we have left a loophole, and we would not see a satisfactory determination by the parties who must bear the responsibility. And the Congress and the Senate certainly share in that. 
So with that concluding remark, I yield and encourage the Chair to grant an equal amount of time to my good friends from Nevada. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will be on the bill beginning at 1 o'clock tomorrow. So I assume any Member can come over and speak on this or as if in morning business. With that interpretation, I am going to proceed for a few minutes more. Then that will be my conclusion, at least for today, relative to the topic at hand. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have reached an agreement to proceed to the bill, and, as a consequence, starting tomorrow at 1 o'clock, we will have to continue our debate. Many Members on our side have indicated an interest in coming over and being heard. 
There are a couple of points I want to make at this time that I think bear a little examination. The other side has indicated that his legislation, S. 104, is unneeded, that it is unwise, that it is unsafe. I just cannot accept that. 
First of all, to suggest it is unneeded disregards the obligation we have in a contractual commitment to take this waste in 1998. What good is a Government contract, for Heaven's sakes, if there is no intention, no desire to fulfill that contract? 
Mr. President, 16 years have passed. It is clear that the waste will not be taken in 1998 as promised. Yet, the Federal Government has taken from the ratepayers some $13 billion. And who has it been paid to? It has been paid to the Federal Government. And what has the Federal Government done with it? They have not held it in escrow. They have not held it in abeyance out there, ready to meet their obligation to take the waste in 1998. They put it in the general fund. Under the crazy bookkeeping procedures we have around here, it is going to take a significant appropriation to address this obligation. So, when the other side suggests that it is unneeded, I think we have to look a little bit deeper at the significance of a contractual commitment.

<DOCNO>105-murkowski-ak-9-19970408</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. MURKOWSKI. There has been a lot of criticism of the nuclear industry out there. What has the nuclear industry done? They provided a reliable source of power. They are the second largest supplier of power generation next to coal, 22 percent of our Nation's power. They are a dedicated group, highly technical people for the most part, dedicated to providing a reliable, safe source of energy for this country, for 22 percent of our dependents. They entered into a contractual agreement back in 1982. And where have we been since 1982? We have been here. We have been talking about it. We have been discussing, Yes, we have an obligation, but it is not due. It is due now, Mr. President. It is due next year. And we are not ready. 
So what are they supposed to do? The other side would suggest, do not do anything now. Put it off. Wait until some time in the future when we have a permanent repository. How much time do we have to wait? Where is the future? The Secretary of Energy says this repository is not going to be ready, a permanent one at Yucca Mountain, until the year 2015. What, do we have to wait another 18 years? That is what the other side would have you believe. 
What are the damages associated with the inability of the Government to fulfill its contractual commitment? There is full exposure, full employment for the lawyers. What we have around here is too much speculation. What we need are some facts. And the facts are that we have this stuff all over the country. The chart here shows where it is. We have the stuff spread in 41 States at 80 sites. We are proposing to address it and put it in one safe site. Where is that site? It is where we have held nuclear tests, out in the desert, for 50 years. So, when they say it is unneeded, I have to dispute that. First of all, it is needed because we are in violation of a contractual commitment that the Federal Government entered into in good faith. 
What did the court say about it? The court said the Government is liable. They said that last year. The Federal Government is liable to take that waste. If we do not take it, there are going to be damages. How much are the damages? Full employment for the lawyers, it is estimated at $59 billion. 
Nevada is where we propose to put it. We are going to put it in temporary casks, on the surface, until such time as Yucca Mountain's permanent repository is done. We are going to remove it from all these sites around the country and put it in one place. If that is irresponsible, and America's environmental community is 
opposed to it, then they must be for this. 
The other side makes an issue that no environmental group supports this legislation. What do they support? You and I know what they support. They support doing away with the nuclear industry in this country. That is their objective. And what do they propose, to make up that 21, 22 percent of our power generation? They do not want to address that. They say, `Wind power.' Fine, I am for wind power. Solar? Fine, I am for solar. You just cannot generate sufficient amounts with the technology we have. How about hydrogen? Let us go that route? Great. But you have to be in the real world. They want air conditioning, they want the lights to go on. And the nuclear power industry is contributing to this, almost 25 percent of our total energy. 
So, when they say it is unneeded, they are absolutely wrong. Do we want to shut down those nuclear plants because they are running out of storage space? They were licensed for so much space. You have seen pictures of those pools. You have seen the spent rods being stored there. That was not permanent storage. It was not designed for permanent storage. Everybody knows that. It was temporary, until such time as the Government could fulfill its contract. 
Did the environmental community and the folks who are down at the White House who are opposed to this legislation, who, I might add, have no position on this issue, do they want us to have blackouts on hot summer days? What do they propose in the future, if we do not address this problem of adequate storage on hand when our storage is filled in those pools? Do we want to default on our Federal obligation? I have already talked about that. And, remember, the courts have upheld the obligation of the Federal Government. 
What kind of precedent are we setting in this country for those who observe the way Government does business, to ignore the commitment to the ratepayers who have contributed with the expectation that the waste would be taken? 
The comment was made by the other side that interim storage in Nevada was unneeded and unsafe. Is it safe to continue to store this waste in the pools that were designed to hold that waste for a temporary timeframe? 
One of the Senators from Nevada says that the 100 millirem standard is unsafe. Let us talk about that, because those kinds of speculative arguments excite a lot of people. Again, it is speculation. 
The current EPA radiation protection guidance is 500 millirem, 500. EPA is considering making it 100 millirem, to even be more protective. So, the current EPA radiation protection guidance says 500, but we have it at 100 in our bill. Additionally, we provide EPA with the authority to proscribe a stricter standard if needed. As a consequence, to suggest our bill is unsafe defies reality. We are promoting the public health and safety with a higher standard, if indeed it is needed. 
We have heard it said that transportation is unsafe. We have shown that nuclear fuel was safely transported across the country every single day of the year, year in and year out, 2,400 shipments for 16 years, from 1979 to 1995, through every State in the Nation except South Dakota and Florida. It has been moving. Why has it been moving? It has been moving from all these different sites. It has been moving from universities that have test reactors, research reactors. It has been moving from military sites, from Navy sites. It has been moving, moving, moving, and we have not had any accidents. 
We talk about what kind of container is going to be involved. Obviously, it is going to be a safe container, the same kind that has moved this material in 2,400 shipments. So that is a bogus argument, to say it is unsafe. We have shown that casks cannot be breached with real world accidents. We have shown there has never been an accident involving the release of radiation. Of course, in Europe, in Asia, they move this stuff all over, all over the world. So, if you want to buy fear tactics, this is probably a good environment to buy them in because there are lots of them around here. 
A further statement was made relative to our bill being unwise. I have trouble with that. If it was wise enough, sometime ago, for us to decide that it made sense to develop a permanent repository in Nevada, at a cost of some $30 billion, which is not a sure thing, then why is it unwise to spend between $1.5 to $2 billion to build an interim that can handle the problem until the permanent is ready. If Yucca is not determined to be suitable, then we will have a place for the waste until another site is selected if we pass this bill. Either way, we will need an interim site. So this is a very wise, thoughtful approach. 
Much has been made in this debate about the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and what they have said. What the board has told us is that central storage is needed if Yucca comes on line, and that central storage is needed if it does not come on line. There may be disagreements about timing, but the end result is the same. We need interim storage, regardless of what happens with Yucca Mountain. 
We need it either way, Mr. President. Is it unwise to leave waste? Where are we going to leave the waste, with the status quo? That is what the other side proposes. 
Is it wise to leave waste at 80 sites in 41 States in pools that were not designed for long-term storage and to leave it there? How long? Until Yucca's done, 2015 or longer. One State, Connecticut, has guards and fences around the pools of nuclear waste in one of our Senator's neighborhoods, a Senator in this body. 
So when they say it is unneeded, unwise, unsafe, I suggest they look at reality and recognize there is, indeed, every reason to believe that it is safe to take it out of 80 sites in 41 States that we have safely transported across this country for over 16 years, and it is certainly needed because the pools are full and many of these reactors will not be able to be relicensed for additional storage, because they do not have any. They will have to shut down. 
So I encourage the administration and the environmental community, if you do not like this bill, then come up with an answer. I encourage the environmental community to recognize that as they address the legitimate concerns we all have over greenhouse gases, increased carbon emissions, where do we look for relief? 
We just had a significant portion of the French Parliament here. They were acknowledged. We had a 2-minute recess. They told me in the back they wished us well with our effort to bury our waste. In France, they do not allow you to bury your waste because it is valuable, because they have embarked on a technology called reprocessing where, through a MAX fuel process, they recover the waste associated with those rods that are stored in the pools and they recover the energy in a plutonium form and put it back in the reactor with enriched uranium. Who is addressing the proliferation threat? They are burning theirs. We are proposing to put ours underground. In the meantime we are like ostriches running around saying, `We can't do this, we can't do that.' 
What are the Japanese doing? The Japanese have taken the French technology which, incidentally, we developed initially when we had proposed to reprocess. We cannot reprocess because we have a policy against reprocessing. But the Japanese have expanded on an effort to be totally independent of imported energy in Japan. What does that do to their industrial economy? It makes it pretty secure. They are going to depend on nuclear energy. If there is any country that has had an experience with nuclear energy that is more sensitive, I do not know what it could be other than Japan. 
The Japanese are committed to a $20 billion to $24 billion project. I was up there last December. They are building a refueling, reprocessing, state-of-the-art facility. Do you know what they are doing now? They are sending their waste from their nuclear reactors over to France, the French are reprocessing, and the waste goes back vitrified. But they are going to do it themselves in Japan. They are going to recover the plutonium, put it back in the reactors and reduce the proliferation threat, because plutonium has value. 
I am not here arguing the case for that. I am simply stating what is happening in the real world with state of the art. France is 70 percent dependent on nuclear power. We cannot even figure out what to do with our waste. The last nuclear plant was built in this country in 1979, 1980. That is where we are. Nobody in his right mind would try and build one today, because the permitting process would simply make it unfeasible, if there is such a word, certainly noneconomic from the standpoint of generating a return. 
I can stand here on the floor of the Senate and predict that within 10 years, we will be going to Japan and we will be going to France for the advanced technology associated with disposal of high-level waste. What this administration has done is to allow in nuclear waste from other countries, but it will not address its obligation to the nuclear power industry to take its waste that it has collected the money for the last 16 years, $13 billion. 
So I hope some of the folks down at the White House reflect a 
little bit on the obligations that we have made commitments and the reality that we have not performed. It is easy to criticize the nuclear industry with regard to nuclear waste, but let's be realistic and let's recognize, again, that they have performed their obligation. Now they are asking the Federal Government to perform theirs. 
I want to conclude my debate today with a little reference on a portion of the statement that was made regarding the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board and the points made in that debate on the other side. 
My distinguished friends and colleagues from Nevada have in their statements, I think, misinterpreted or perhaps misunderstood some of the conclusions associated with the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. There has been an assertion that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board--which, as has been stated, is a panel of scientists appointed to review the Department of Energy's nuclear waste program--opposes the construction of an interim storage facility. The suggestion is they oppose it. This simply is not true, Mr. President. 
Following a February hearing on S. 104, I asked the chairman of the board the following question, and this is from the record:  
Those who oppose S. 104 have used the board's report as evidence that `technical and scientific experts' believe that a centralized temporary storage facility will not be needed. Is this the conclusion the board intended people to draw? 
The chairman responded: 
On the contrary, the board believes that a centralized storage facility will be needed---- 
Will be needed, Mr. President---- and the generic planning should begin immediately. Significant advantages can be derived from siting a storage facility adjacent to a repository. 
OK, adjacent to Yucca Mountain is what S. 104 proposes. The board did state, however: 
However, there are no compelling technical or safety reasons to move spent fuel to a centralized facility for the next few years. 
I think we have here some questions of timing. `The next few years,' the last time I checked, few meant two. In order to be able to move spent fuel in a few years--well, we started this process, and we have been, what, 16 to 17 years now trying to move this process along. We entered into a contract with the nuclear power industry to take it 16 years ago. Here we are today, 1 year away from a mandatory obligation to perform under a contract in 1998, and when is this one going to be ready? 2015. So we have 17, 18 years. 
The other side said we should not start now, or they interpret the board's interpretation to mean there is no compelling or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility in the next few years. If we started today in this process, which is what I hope we will do as soon as the Senate supports passage of this bill, we will not be able to start on this facility until we are into the year 2000. We all know that. So it is a question of timing. 
It is only natural that the board begin this process. This is a technical body. They probably have no concept of the lead time legislation must have before it can become law and can result in planned action. Again, 17 years on this process already. 
So as we move to the bill, I am willing to offer an amendment that would provide a new schedule for siting construction of the interim facility, recognizing 2 years is not going to do it. This is to take into account the passage of time since introduction of the original legislation. Mr. President, even before this amendment, in response to written questions, the chairman stated something else:  
The difference in timing between the board's recommendations and the approach set forth in S. 104 are not substantial. 
I think it is fair to say that my friends from Nevada have placed a good deal of faith in the board's judgment, but I would like to point out some of the board's statements that they won't tell you about. At the February hearing, Chairman Cohon stated that: 
The board believes that the risks associated with transporting spent fuel are very low-- 
Very low---- and are likely to remain very low even when the number of shipments increases. 
I hope that satisfies my friends from Nevada. 
While my colleagues have asserted that nuclear waste can stay just where it is, and that is the position they have taken, the board has stated: 
The board believes that one or more centralized spent fuel storage facilities will be needed somewhere if Yucca Mountain proves to be unsuitable for development as a repository. 
Where is somewhere, Mr. President? Somewhere is out here at the Nevada site that was used previously for more than 800 nuclear weapons tests over 50 years. That is somewhere. It has to go somewhere. Nobody wants it. This is someplace, contrary to the claims we heard today that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board does believe that temporarily centralized storage of nuclear waste is needed and transportation of spent fuel is safe. 
The last issue I would like to refute is a question of, well, why not wait until 1998? The administration says it objects to siting a temporary storage facility before 1998 when the viability assessment for Yucca Mountain will be completed. There have been those who asked, `Why can't we just wait for 1998 and pass the legislation then?' I think I have addressed that, but to anybody who has watched this process, the obvious answer is, it is going to take a few years, more than a few years. It has taken over 2 years since the first introduction of this legislation, and we are still debating on the Senate floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with respect to disposal of high-level nuclear waste, this Nation is today at a crossroads. The job and the responsibility of addressing the disposal of spent nuclear fuel from our Nation's powerplants--is an obligation of this body. The time for fixing the problem is now. 
There has been a lot of progress made. We have selected a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. That is already done. It is underway. We have expended about $6 billion, and that 5-mile exploratory tunnel will soon be completed. This is a positive commitment by the Congress to proceed with a permanent repository. We can build on this process. 
This bill, Senate bill 104, continues the site characterization activities for a permanent repository. 
Make no mistake about it. But this is an ongoing process. In the meantime, we have an obligation to take this waste next year, in 1998. Well, this Senator from Alaska and the majority of my committee are of the opinion that a contract is a binding commitment. 
The Federal Government, 16 years ago, entered into a contract with the nuclear industry to take this waste in 1998. We have no place to put this waste because Yucca Mountain isn't completed. We face penalties; we face litigation. It is estimated that the damages associated with the inability to fulfill the contractual commitment will run somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. That is an additional load on the taxpayers of this country. We need a temporary storage facility or we will continue to be storing this waste across the Nation for decades to come. 
Where is the waste? Well, let's look at this chart. We have commercial reactors represented on the chart. We have shut down reactors with spent fuel on sites represented on the chart. We have 110 of the commercial reactors, 110 reactors in about 41 States. We have 10 shut down reactors, represented on the chart. We have one existing site for spent commercial nuclear fuel storage on the chart, is in the State of Illinois. Non-DOE research reactors--we have 38 shown on the chart. We have naval reactor fuel up in Idaho, up in Washington, and in Georgia. There are 10 of those sites. Department of Energy-owned spent nuclear fuel sites, about 12, are indicated on the chart. 
So there is where we are. We have this stuff scattered all over the United States. We can choose now whether the Nation needs these 80 sites, or just 1--1 in the arid remote Nevada test site, where we exploded a series of nuclear bombs during the cold war, a site that has been determined to be safe. It is a remote location. It has been well monitored by an experienced work force and a security force as well. 
Now, if Yucca is licensed for a permanent repository, it will simply be a very easy task to move the spent fuel to the permanent repository from the interim facility this bill would authorize. Now, the problem is that Yucca isn't going to be ready until the year 2015. Some suggest, well, what happens if Yucca is not licensed or is found to be unsuitable? Will we need a centralized interim site anyway so that we will be way ahead of the game? The answer is, yes, regardless of what happens at Yucca, this is a step we should take and take now. 
Critics have claimed that we can't store waste safely, that we don't have the technology. Nature itself suggests that a geologic repository, which this bill supports, is the best long-term answer. Let me refer again to a natural geological nuclear waste repository that has been in existence for a long time. Such a repository is in Gabon, in Africa. There, approximately 1.8 billion years ago, at a place called Oklo, scientists have proven that naturally occurring, highly enriched uranium began a spontaneous nuclear reaction producing almost a ton of plutonium, as well as all of the other fission byproducts that occur in spent fuel from modern nuclear power plants. That is the history. That is a fact. It actually happened, under the watch of Mother Nature. Now, Mr. President, when it happened, it happened just a few feet beneath the surface. No geologists studied the site before the waste was `stored' there. There was no engineering barriers around the so-called spent fuel. However, scientists have proven that the plutonium and the other fission products did not migrate away from that site. There is nothing unique, Mr. President, about the geology of Oklo. This `experiment' shows that radioactive waste can be successfully contained within a geologic repository. Mother Nature did it 1.8 billion years ago. Now we are talking about the science, the technology, and the application of mankind in the process. Well, it certainly seems to be taking equally as long. 
When I said that we had designated Yucca as a permanent repository and that we spent some $6 billion in the process, and will probably expend as much as $30 billion, it is important to recognize what comes next. First, it has to be deemed viable. 
That means the scientific information gathered by 1998 will show that nothing is there that would disqualify Yucca Mountain for a permanent repository. That is done next year, in 1998. What are the odds on that? They tell us about 90 percent. 
The second factor is the suitability. Yucca Mountain must be suitable. It must be a suitable site for a permanent repository under the guidelines issued by the Department of Energy. When is that supposed to be completed? In the year 2001. What are the odds on that? They tell us about 80 percent. Then, of course, it has to be licensed, licensed by the NRC, who issues the license for a permanent repository. Well, for the date of that we can only rely on the former Secretary of Energy O'Leary, who indicated that would be about the year 2015. 
Talking about this waste brings us to the reality that we are going to have to transport it. You simply can't leave it at these sites. So let's talk a little bit about the transportation issue, because this is on the minds of many Members. This map accurately shows, from 1979 to 1995, the movement and transportation routes of 2,400 individual shipments of waste around the country. The interesting thing, Mr. President, is that they go through every single State of the 48, with the exception of South Dakota and Florida. All the States are represented here. That is the harsh reality. We have been moving this waste for 16 years. Why hasn't it been on the front pages of the papers? Because it has been a nonevent. It has moved safely. It has moved from reactors. It has moved from Navy facilities and from Army facilities, and it has been on railroads and on highways, and it has been under the auspices of the Department of Energy, and it has been safe. 
We have heard in this debate, primarily from my good friends from Nevada, that somehow this waste is a new threat that America has never faced before. That is just poppycock. Emotional statements have been made time and time again, suggesting that somehow the health and safety of 50 million Americans will be threatened. And there have been references to the unfortunate Chernobyl accident. That accident, as everybody knows, involved a graphite reactor without a containment building. Electricians were in there doing an operation they weren't supposed to be doing. They didn't have the training. They bypassed the safety procedures, took the reactor critical, and the results were very unfortunate. But it was human error, Mr. President. The graphite reactors are not the type that we have in the United States. Yet, this effort to try to address an obligation to our Nation's waste has been referred to as a `mobile Chernobyl.' 
Here is what we have been moving, Mr. President. Again, do we want to move it to one site in the Nevada desert now, as we wait for the development of our permanent repository? Or do we want to leave it for another 15, 16, or 17 years, actually, in the 80 sites in 41 States? No fatality, injury, or environmental damage has ever occurred in the United States because of radioactive cargo movement. That is just a fact. We have taken steps to ensure that the risk is as negligible as possible. 
Some of our friends would imply that if this bill doesn't pass, then nuclear waste won't be shipped on our Nation's roads. Well, that is simply not true, Mr. President. Let's take a look at the routes used--the routes used for 15 years, again, for the thousands of fuel shipments. Some say they didn't know the fuel shipments took place. Again, as I have said, that is because they are uneventful. Trucks carrying the casks have been in accidents, but the casks that contain the nuclear material have performed as designed. They have not broken open. The nuclear disasters that the Senators from Nevada have referred to, Mr. President, simply haven't happened. 
Now, we have heard claims that the number of shipments that would occur under Senate bill 104 is an unprecedented amount. Well, that is simply not true. We have our storage in our reactors in the cells adjacent to the reactors and the pools, and those are filling up. We need to relieve that congestion, and that is the whole purpose of the interim retrievable storage. We currently 
have about 30,000 metric tons of spent fuel in this country. But the French alone have shipped that amount of spent fuel all over Europe--for that matter, all over the world. This is not just history. It is happening today. It is happening all over the world. 
The Department of Energy, as a matter of fact, is transporting spent nuclear fuel all over the country and all over the world as we speak. Here it is in the country. Let's take a look at a chart of the world. Here we have it, Mr. President. There seems to be a double standard here when the Department of Energy claims that it cannot possibly fulfill its obligation to the U.S. electric ratepayers to take spent fuel. Why is it doing so in foreign countries? Well, here they are. In Europe, there is Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Australia, throughout South America, and Peru and Canada. We are taking this now under agreements that have been made. Where is it going? It is going to the Savannah River in South Carolina. This chart shows the actual times of delivery from 1996 to 2009. These are the countries to which we have committed taking their waste. So it is a double standard, Mr. President. Why are we doing it for foreign countries? We are not doing it for our own nuclear industry. 
You may ask why the taxpayers are paying for the Department of Energy to transport and store nuclear waste in foreign countries while American ratepayers are left out. All the countries in color on this chart ship fuel to the United States for storage at the Department of Energy facilities. It doesn't seem to be a mystery to some. But it is a mystery to me. Another mystery is why many of the same groups that most actively oppose resolving our domestic fuel storage problems were most supportive of taking nuclear waste from foreign countries. Think about it. We are taking waste from Russia--military waste--because we deem that lessens the proliferation threat. If they support taking nuclear waste from overseas, can the safety of transportation be an issue? One wonders why it is now. How can it be safe for the Department of Energy to ship spent fuel halfway across the world but not across a few States? They don't explain that very well, do they? 
Actually, if you look closer, you see that the Department of Energy transports nuclear waste across the United States. Let's take a look at a map of the United States. It goes into Hanford. It goes into Savannah; Hanford in the State of Washington. This shows the American research reactors at our universities. They ship fuel for storage at DOE facilities. They are scattered all across the country. The various universities are Ohio State, MIT, the University of Virginia, and Oak Ridge. We could go on and on. They are all across the country. That is why I contend that we have a double standard. 
Why does the Department of Energy pay to transport and store nuclear waste from foreign countries but won't do its own duty to the U.S. power reactors that have paid for the service? They have paid for the service. The ratepayers that depend on nuclear energy paid $13 billion to the Federal Government. Where is the money? It has gone into the general fund. It is not an escrow account. But there is a contract signed for next year. The Department of Energy will say that they take foreign fuel to help with the nonproliferation. That is all well and good. But spent nuclear fuel is spent nuclear fuel regardless of where it is. If transportation and storage is safe for some, why isn't it safe for all? 
I think this just proves the point that the obstacles to moving our Nation's spent fuel are political. They are not technical. We have moved it. We move it from our research reactors all over the country. We move it from other countries in the world and bring it to the United States to Savannah, and have been doing it for some time. 
My bill, and the committee bill, S. 104 of Senator Craig and others, provides the authority to coordinate a systematic safe transportation network to move spent fuel to a storage facility under Senate bill 104. The Department of Energy is required to use--`required'; it is not optional--to use NRC-certified transportation containers to transport fuel along special routes chosen by DOT radioactivity transport regulations and considerations set out in the bill. 
Let's take a look at how that is shipped because I think it is important to recognize the care that goes into this. This is a truck that is moving over the highways of the Nation probably today; moving some kind of fuel in a cask probably to the Savannah River site in South Carolina. It is moving safely. It is moving in a special container. These are probably spent fuel rods. They are radioactive. But by the same token, care and engineering technology has gone into this. I find it surprising to note that--and the comment was made in the debate that the environmental groups don't support this legislation. I find it further perplexing that these groups on the one hand are opposed as we all are to the increase in greenhouse gases yet the only current technology available to reduce it dramatically is nuclear energy. Our use of nuclear energy reduces more than 140 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, not to mention sulfur dioxide and various other pollutants. This is the contribution 
that nuclear energy contributes to air quality in this country. Some suggest that the opposition by the environmental groups is simply to shut down the reactors because they do not believe in or don't approve of nuclear energy or nuclear power. 
But they don't want to recognize that about 22 percent of our Nation's power is generated by nuclear reactors, and, if you reduce or eliminate the nuclear power industry in this country, you will have to replace it with something. It will probably be replaced with carbon fuels. And there is an emission concern there. 
So I say to those that are opposed to this legislation that they have an obligation to come up with something that answers the question of what we do with our spent fuel. I think that is what this bill does. 
Further safeguards have been taken in this legislation to provide that transportation cannot occur until the Department of Energy has provided specific technical assistance and funding to States affected by the transportation route, Indian tribes, and for emergency response planning along the transportation routes. That isn't what is done now. But that is what is required in the bill to make it that much safer. The language builds on what is an already safe system for transporting spent fuel in this country. As I have said before, the public has never been exposed to radiation from spent fuel cargo even in accidents. Between 1971 and 1989 the Department of Transportation tells us that there were seven minor accidents involving trucks carrying waste: Flat tires, and various other things. But no radioactivity was released in any of the accidents. That is because transportation canisters are designed to maintain their integrity during severe accidents. They have been used for thousands of safe shipments over the years. As a matter of fact, they were designing casks at one time when they contemplated flying the fuel. It was suggested that the technology existed for casks to be designed for a 30,000-foot free fall. And I am told that they could design it. 
Nevertheless, the canisters that are depicted here in the picture, the design approved by the NRC for spent fuel transport have demonstrated a remarkable ability to withstand falls of 30-foot drops. And these are tests that were made into a national unyielding surface. There was no penetration from a drop of 40 inches onto a steel spike; no penetration being engulfed in 1,475-degree temperature fire for 30 minutes; no penetration, submerged under 3 feet of water for 8 hours; no penetration. 
So, despite what you may hear, engineers at the national labs tell us that the test conditions that these casks are subjected to are much more rigorous than any that they would face in real, live accidents. 
These casks have been tested in some more rigorous ways. Probably it would be interesting to watch because they have been run into by locomotives, and crashed into walls at 70 miles an hour. If any of the Senators or the staff want to see the video of these tests we would be happy to provide them with the tapes to view and to keep. 
So I suggest that we face facts. The history of the nuclear waste shipments is that they are moving almost as we speak, continue to move, and will move tomorrow but they are not going to be carrying the waste that they were contracted for. They will be carrying other wastes from other countries from research reactors from our universities. And it fails me to know why we are excluding the waste that we contracted for 16-17 years ago to take next year, and we have no provision to take that waste. That is what this bill is all about. S. 104 provides safe transportation with a perfect record, and I think it makes it even safer. 
So as a consequence, that tells the story of the transportation system. 
Let's look very briefly at what we are proposing. This is the location for the waste storage at the Nevada test sites that we have used for the previous 800 nuclear weapons tests. That is what it looks like. It is a pretty barren area. You see some roads for access, and mounds where 800 nuclear weapons tests were made. Why 
was this area picked? Probably there are a lot of reasons. It is remote. That is certainly one. The weather is pretty stable out there. You can observe the testing very well. They had a trained work force. To some extent I suppose there was some economic reasons. But it is not my State, and it is not appropriate that I evaluate the rationale that went into it. But that is the site. 
When we look at all other factors and recognize that nobody wants to store waste, the fact that we have it in 40 to 41 States, and the fact that we are going to have to move it regardless of whether it is being moved to a temporary repository or eventually to a permanent one, the transportation factor is a given. 
So I hope that those that are concerned about transportation recognize a couple of things: One, they may have waste in their State already. It may be military waste. It may be naval waste. It may be waste from some other activity associated with their university, or they may have nuclear power. If you want it to stay there indefinitely with no action, then that is the status quo. And that is where we have been. But if you want to move it out of your State, you have to move it someplace. The question is where do you move it? 
We have determined that this is the permanent site for a nuclear repository. When that was chosen, it was chosen over potential sites in the 50 States. Why was it chosen? Because it was deemed to be, of all the sites that were evaluated, the best site with the highest likelihood of this being named the permanent repository when we get through with the process now underway. That is the process of viability, suitability, and licensing. Then it goes in there permanently under our policy. But the idea of moving now to accept this area for a temporary repository until we can complete Yucca Mountain is what this legislation is all about because it suggests that it would move in those casks by transportation routes, either surface railroad or highway, in these casks out to a pad, out in the desert where it would be monitored. And those casks would be held there so we can fulfill our contractual agreement as we recognized that the storage at our nuclear power generator sites are filled up. They would be moved out to this pad and be monitored until such time as the permanent repository is completed. 
On the chance that the permanent repository is not licensed and it doesn't get through this viability, suitability, or licensing, this bill provides that we still have an obligation to address a resolve. That would require the President then to find another site. We have gone through all the 50 States. If this one is not suitable for a permanent repository, it requires the President to find one. If he doesn't find one, he comes back and designates that this be the site. 
Now, some suggest there should be some other consideration. Maybe we should do something like the base closing procedure, where we name a group of qualified people to determine a site. The problem we have with this legislation is nobody wants to face the reality of making the decision now. They want to put it off. The administration does not want to have it happen on their watch. They would just as soon have it happen on another's watch. We could easily put this off to another Congress, but we are cheating the taxpayers because the liability for nonperformance of the contract is going to face us next year. The longer we keep that waste in violation of the contractual terms, the greater the liability to the taxpayer for nonperformance, because Government simply passes that liability on to you and me, and we pay for it. 
As I said, we have spent $6 billion here at Yucca. We are going to be spending about $30 billion by the time it is completed. We have been transporting waste fuel around this country for 16 years. We sit, today, with 80 sites in 41 States and we are even having some Members suggest that all they want from this legislation is the assurance that it will not be put in their State. I suppose we could go back to a 6th grade mentality--and pursue a series of amendments from virtually everybody, in all the 50 States with the exception of one. I would hope that would not happen. I would hope we can recognize our obligation as parliamentarians and address this with a resolve that suggests the way to move on this thing, and move now, is as proposed under this legislation, which would provide, after the viability is determined on Yucca Mountain as being a permanent site, which is anticipated sometime next year, to then allow a temporary repository to occur in the Nevada desert at the Nevada test site. 
If somebody else has a better suggestion for a response to the obligation we have now, why, I am certainly willing to consider amendments to the pending legislation. 
Mr. President, recognizing the time element that we have, I ask how much time remains on the side of the proponents?

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to be speaking this afternoon at some length on Senate bill 104. This is a bill that provides a comprehensive plan for the Federal Government to meet its obligations to provide a safe place to store spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to reflect on some of the background associated with nuclear waste and the status of our continued dependence on nuclear energy. 
First of all, let me refer to an article by Bertram Wolfe. Mr. Wolfe is a consultant at Monte Sereno, CA, and a former president of the American Nuclear Society. He suggests that by midcentury, the Third World population on this Earth will double from 4 billion to 8 billion people while the population of the industrial world will grow by about 20 percent, to 1.2 billion. He further suggests that unless we expect to see the majority of the world's people living indefinitely in dire poverty, we should be prepared for per capita energy use to rise rapidly with economic progress. Even if the Third World per capita energy use rises to only one-third of the United States level, that increase, in combination with the expected population growth, will result in a threefold increase in world energy use by the year 2050. 
He further suggests that if fossil fuels are used to supply these increased energy needs, we can expect serious deterioration of air quality and possibly environmental disaster from global climate change due to the greenhouse effect. In addition, increased demand for fossil fuels, combined with the dwindling supply, undoubtedly will lead to higher prices, slower economic growth, and the likelihood of energy-related global conflicts. 
I wonder if anyone in this Chamber would doubt that Kuwait's oil resources were a major factor in the United States willingness to take military action against Iraq. Unfortunately, alternatives to this scenario are few. Perhaps the future world energy use can be stabilized at a level much less than a third of present U.S. per capita use. Of course, that demand could be much higher. Perhaps solar or wind power will become practical on a larger scale. Perhaps fusion, or even cold fusion, will be developed. But as we enter the world's energy needs in the 21st century, we have to focus on one area that currently provides us with nearly 21 percent of our electricity in the United States, and that is nuclear power. Even conventional nuclear powerplants will face fuel supply problems in the next century if their use expands significantly, which is why we ought to consider the use of the advanced liquid metal reactor which can produce more than 100 times as much energy per pound of uranium as conventional reactors. 
The United States, as we know, has been a leader in the development of nuclear power technology and in the adoption of stringent safety standards. It is important to note that not a single member of the public has been harmed by the operation of any of the world's nuclear plants that meet U.S. standards. The Chernobyl reactor, which lacked a containment structure, did not meet U.S. standards. 
But the future of nuclear energy in the United States is now very much in question. Since 1973, all nuclear energy plant orders have 
subsequently been canceled. In 1993, U.S. utilities shut down three nuclear energy plants rather than invest in needed repairs. Of the 110 presently operating U.S. nuclear energy plants, 45 will reach the end of their planned 40-year lifetime in the next two decades. 
Mr. President, this is the wrong time for the Nation, and for the world, for that matter, to ignore nuclear power. Demand for energy will grow. Our options are limited. Ironically, environmentalists who have opposed nuclear power since the 1970's should have the strongest rationale for promoting nuclear energy. Like all large endeavors, nuclear power has its problems and it has its risks. But the problems of nuclear power do not look so bad when compared with air pollution, global warming, and the supply limitations associated with fossil fuels. Besides, the major drawbacks of nuclear power from cost to waste disposal are due more to institutional impediments than to technological difficulties. Considering the growth in energy demand and the risks associated with other energy sources, the benefit-risk ratio for nuclear power is very attractive. 
We recall that peaceful nuclear power development started slowly in the 1950's. But by the mid to late 1960's, commercial nuclear powerplant orders began to take off. And by the 1970's, 30 to 40 nuclear plants were being ordered each year. This outlook resulted from several factors. The first was that electric use was growing at a rate of about 7 percent per year, leading to a need for doubling of electric capacity every 10 years. 
Responding to some very negative public reactions to his company and the company's announcement that it would be starting up a new coal-fired plant in 1961, McChesney Martin, chairman of Florida Power and Light, promised never to build another coal plant. Shortly thereafter, Florida Power and Light submitted a plan to build a nuclear station in the mid-1960's. 
Mr. President, the Sierra Club became the major supporter of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California. This period of rapid nuclear expansion and environmental support of nuclear power ended in 1973 after the Arab oil embargo and the boycott. As a consequence of that, the rate of growth fell dramatically. As the years went by and the costs of crude oil continued to increase, we found a change in attitude. The surplus of oil distorted the Nation's perspective on energy in general and nuclear energy in particular. 
A number of environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, insisted that the Nation should hold out for ideal or risk-free sources, such as energy conservation, solar power, and wind energy. No one suffered from a shortage of electricity as the construction time for nuclear powerplants expanded a full 6 years--to 10 or 15 years, or even longer. These extended construction times have been ascribed to an even more complicated and inefficient regulatory system, and court delays resulting from suits brought by those opposed to nuclear power. In Japan and France, for example, where demand for electric energy continued to grow rapidly, new nuclear energy plants of U.S. design are today still being licensed and built in 4 to 6 years. 
First, I personally would question whether Congress would have tolerated the delays if the new electricity were truly needed. One of the results of the delays, however, was that the cost of building a nuclear plant in the United States increased dramatically, making nuclear power uncompetitive and unattractive to many investors. But let's look at the benefits. 
Although the rate of growth of electricity use declined after 1973, demand increased, as the economy expanded, to U.S. electric use, increasing 70 percent between 1973 and 1994. Coal generation doubled between 1973 and 1994, and today coal provides over 50 percent of U.S. electricity. The 74 nuclear energy plants that came on line in this period increased the nuclear share of electric generation from 4 percent in 1973 to more than 20 percent today, second only to coal. 
The other sources, for the benefit of the Members, are natural gas at 4 percent, hydropower at 9 percent, wood, wind, and solar 3 percent, and oil 3 percent. 
The added nuclear capacity allowed for the shutdown of oil-fired plants and permitted the utilities to reduce oil imports by some 100 million barrels per year. The substitution of nuclear or fossil fuel plants has reduced the present CO2 atmospheric emissions by 140 million metric tons of carbon per year--roughly 10 percent of the total U.S. CO2 production. 
Nevertheless, the United States still needs to reduce carbon production by an additional 10 percent to reach its goal of returning to the 1990 production level. In addition, replacement of fossil fuel plants with nuclear power has reduced nitric oxide emissions to the air by over 2 million tons annually, meeting the goal set by the Clean Air Act for the year 2000, and has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by almost 5 million tons per year, half the goal for the year 2000. 
The dilemma that we are in is a real one, because we are not able to store our waste that has accumulated as a consequence of our nuclear powerplants. As a consequence of that, we have not been able to move from a temporary storage to a safe, permanent storage. We have the temporary storage in the areas, in the pools, next to our reactors. But, as a consequence of that, we seem to face the situation where environmental Neros fiddle while Rome burns. The current generation of U.S. nuclear powerplants has performed remarkably well and an even better generation of new designs is ready. General Electric, in a partnership with Hitachi and Toshiba, has developed the advanced boiling water reactor. Construction of this reactor began in Japan in 1991, and the plant is already operating at full power. The ability to build and begin operation of a new design in less than 5 years is a testament to the quality of the firms that stand behind this. 
Experience with the U.S. licensing and court review procedures suggest that today it can take 2 to 4 times as long to construct a nuclear plant in the United States as it does abroad, with the exorbitant cost increases. 
Mr. President, this brings me to the point in the debate where I think it is appropriate to reflect on history. I am referring to an article that appeared in Scientific American in July 1976. 
Mr. President, let me just read an excerpt from that particular article, because I think it reflects on something that has been overlooked. That is the natural element of nuclear fission as we know it today.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it will be of interest for my colleagues to note that a high level radioactive waste experiment occurred some 1.8 million years ago in west Africa, in what is now the nation of Gabon, at a place called Oklo. The French were prospecting in their former colony for uranium for their developing nuclear program. Some 2 billion years ago, all the uranium on Earth contained some 3 to 4 percent uranium 235, and the rest is the normal level of uranium 238. But, because of natural radiation decay, all U-238 today contains only about 0.7 percent of U-235. U-235 is fissionable, and at about 3 percent enrichment can sustain a chain reaction. That means it can undergo fission. That is just what happened to the uranium in Oklo, approximately 1.8 million years ago. Some water seeped into the vein and began a slow chain reaction which continued for some several hundred thousand years, generating some 10 tons of radioactive waste, including almost a ton of plutonium. The reactor became dormant and scientists have now measured all the minerals at that site and they have shown that all the plutonium created at the site has decayed and that all the original radiation decay products of fission were recovered, close to the original natural fission reactor. This, altogether, released only a few feet from the surface. 
It is interesting to note the plutonium did not migrate away, even though there were no engineered barriers to prevent transport of the waste product. This natural experiment shows that it is 
difficult, if not impossible, for such waste to enter the biosphere. It clearly demonstrates that geological repositories can successfully isolate radioactive waste from the biosphere. There is nothing unique about the geology of Oklo. That occurred, as I have indicated, some 1.8 million years ago. 
As we enter the debate on a comprehensive plan for the Federal Government to meet its obligation to provide a safe place to store spent nuclear waste and nuclear fuel, I think it is important to refer to the historical natural occurrence that took place in Africa some 1.8 million years ago because it represents a phenomenon, if you will, that shows, indeed, a natural experimentation that resulted in no unfavorable outfall associated with the process. 
Getting back to where we are today, our Government entered into a contractual commitment to take the waste generated from our nuclear powerplants and provide a safe storage and disposition of that waste. That was some years ago. That contract is now due, for the Government to initiate performance, in 1998. As a consequence of the recognition of the inability of the Government to take that waste, on March 13 my committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported Senate bill S. 104 on a bipartisan vote of 15 to 5. 
As you will recall, last year a similar bill passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 63 to 37. The bill would provide one safe, central, temporary storage site at the Nevada test site or, if the Nevada test site is found to be inadequate, another chosen by the President. At the same time, S. 104 reaffirms our Nation's commitment to development of a permanent repository for nuclear waste. Why the Nevada site? We have been conducting nuclear detonations related to the weapons testing program in the Nevada desert for some 50 years. One can fairly conclude that the area has radioactivity. The area has been, time and time again, subject to underground explosions of various types. The area is well established with an adequate security capability and an experienced work force. 
Furthermore, when we get right down to this issue, we have to come to the conclusion that nobody wants the waste--not one of the 50 States. But clearly the experience in Nevada at the test site suggests that it is the best site that has been examined so far, and as a consequence we are committed to proceed with the effort to establish a permanent repository there. 
What S. 104 further attempts to do is to reaffirm our Nation's commitment to development of a permanent repository for nuclear waste, which is our ongoing objective. Over the past several weeks I have worked with many of my colleagues, notably Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, to address concerns that he has with the bill and other concerns. As a result of these discussions, I am prepared to offer an amendment that makes significant changes to S. 104. 
Let me comment a little further on this bill, because while this bill was resolved with a tremendous amount of work by the staff, what it really is is an effort to meet our obligation to take our nuclear waste in a timely manner and reduce the associated liability that is going to come from suits brought to the Federal Government for nonperformance of the contract. If someone has a better idea for this bill, or a better proposal to address the problem now, why, this Senator is certainly willing to listen and very likely accommodate it. 
But let me explain the amendment. The amendment, first of all, extends the schedule for siting and licensing an interim facility, specifically siting and licensing an interim facility. This means we can start the process that we have had underway for a long, long time. Further, this allows even more time for the progress at Yucca Mountain to be taken into account in siting the interim facility. It would provide that the interim facility will be licensed by existing NRC regulations with no exceptions. It shortens the licensing term of the interim facility to 40 years, so it puts a limit on how long it can be used, and provides that its capacity will only be that needed to fulfill the Government's 
obligation until a permanent repository is available. And it preempts only State laws that are inconsistent with the provisions of the act. This language is virtually identical to that in the Hazardous Waste Materials Transportation Act. 
These changes are significant, but do not harm the ability to reach the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is safe, central storage; safe, central storage of our Nation's spent nuclear fuels and waste. High level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear fuel is, today, continuing to pile up. It is piling up in 41 States at some 80 sites, and it is stored in areas that are populated; near neighborhoods, areas where schools are not too far away--you might say in the back yards of people across America. One example that comes to mind is the Palisades plant in Michigan, which is within 100 feet of Lake Michigan. Another is the Haddam Neck plant in Connecticut. My colleague from that State has observed that he can see the plant from his home. 
I refer to an editorial from the Hartford Courant that observes, `With the closing of the Connecticut Yankee plant at Haddam Neck, the issue of what to do with the State's high level nuclear waste has moved from the theoretical to the here and now. Experts say that Connecticut Yankee spent fuel could be stored at Haddam Neck for another 30 years, `another 30 years, Mr. President' if Congress fails to approve a temporary facility. Unfortunately, the hands of the clock cannot be turned back to a time when nuclear waste didn't exist. In terms of its disposal, a remote desert site in Nevada is simply the lesser of two evils.'

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the waste was supposed to have been taken by the Federal Government for safe, central storage by, as I said earlier, 1998. Will that happen, Mr. President? The answer is clearly no. No, because we have not addressed the problem; we simply put it off. 
Even though this $12 billion collection from American ratepayers to pay for this storage has gone into the Federal coffers, and even though a Federal court has reaffirmed that the Government has a legal obligation to take the waste by 1998, still, today, there is no plan for action. 
By 1998, 23 reactors in 14 States are going to be full. What are we going to do then? Are we going to shift over to some other power? We are going to have to do something. 
By the year 2010, 65 reactors in 29 States will be full. What are we going to do then? 
The conservative estimate is that 25 percent of our nuclear plants will not be able to build onsite storage and will be forced to shut down. That would mean the loss of over 5 percent of our Nation's electric generating capacity. When is Yucca Mountain going to be ready for a permanent repository? Not until at least the year 2015. What do we do in the meantime? Simply leave it there? Let the litigation mount up for our inability to honor a contractual commitment? How good is a Government contract if the Government can simply ignore it? Therefore, in the mind of this Senator, what this Nation needs and what S. 104 is all about is a temporary solution. 
When S. 104 passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it passed with a solid bipartisan vote of 15 to 5. Almost half of the members and all majority members voted in favor of the bill. Americans have waited too long for a solution to this environmental and public safety challenge, and there is absolutely no purpose to be served by waiting any longer. 
I am, of course, sensitive to the concerns of my colleagues from Nevada, but this is a legacy of our generation, and we have an obligation to address that legacy. To put it off to somebody else's watch, another Presidential administration, simply puts off a responsibility and an obligation that we have. We have an obligation to act, and to act in a timely manner, because we are going to be in breach of our contract next year. So there is a critical need to construct a safe, central storage facility to eliminate the growing threat to the environment and to the American people. 
As I said earlier, I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to attempt to solve the problems that they have with this bill. In the markup, we accepted several amendments from the Democratic side, and I am ready to work with other Senators on amendments they may have to improve the bill, because our goal is a responsible one. It is safe, central storage as soon as reasonably possible after 1998. We have offered, time and time again, to work with the new Secretary of Energy, Secretary Pena, and the staff at the Energy Department. During his confirmation, we pressed the White House to ensure that the Secretary has the portfolio to respond to this pressing problem, and they indicated that he did have that portfolio. 
Over the recess, the committee staff has worked on a proposed compromise. Senator Bingaman's staff has been very constructive in this regard. Much of what Senator Bingaman has proposed appears acceptable. However, the bottom line is the need for a predictable path, with certainty, to interim and permanent waste storage. We simply cannot leave trap doors that allow central storage to be delayed for decades. 
I want to refer to a chart to identify just what we are talking about relative to spent fuel and radioactive waste that is destined for geologic disposal. This chart on my right shows the United States, and for some reason or another they left Hawaii and Alaska off, but that is not uncommon around here. The brown areas show commercial reactors, and they are primarily in the Midwest--Illinois, 
Minnesota--and on the eastern seaboard. Those are some 80 sites where we are generating nuclear power at the present time. 
One of the things we have to keep in mind is, unless we find a way to take care of this waste--we are still going to have reactors, some of which have already shut down and have spent fuel in onsite storage--we will simply be storing spent fuel in shutdown reactors. Currently, we have, designated by the blue little pyramids, a number of shutdown reactors in Oregon, California, and a few in the Midwest. 
The next little block we have are the commercial spent nuclear fuel storage facilities. We have fewer of those. We have a couple of them in the Midwest. We have non-Department of Energy research reactors scattered all throughout the country, in blue. We have naval reactor fuel in Idaho, Washington, New Mexico, Georgia, and we have the Department of Energy spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste. I could go on and on with a description of this chart. 
One can quickly recognize that we have nuclear waste all over the country, and I am sure those in opposition to this bill will suggest that the best thing we can do is simply leave it there. I do not know, Mr. President, if that makes sense to you. It does not to me. Do we want this scattered all over the country when it simply makes sense to put it in one area where we have had testing for some 50 years, where we have an experienced work force, a security capability and the knowledge that we are proceeding with a permanent repository in that area of Yucca Mountain in Nevada? 
The fact is, as we proceed with Yucca Mountain in Nevada and the realization that might be completed by the year 2015, or thereabouts, the question is, why not move it, move it now, transport it now to a interim repository adjacent to the permanent site? 
Then one might say, `What happens if the permanent site does not become suitable?' Let me tell you a couple things about that permanent site, Mr. President. We have expended some $6 billion so far. It is estimated to cost some $30 billion by the time it is completed. So we are well on our way, assuming it is licensable and assuming that it receives the certification necessary. 
So you are going to hear the argument, if you move it out there and it is not suitable, then what are you going to do? Then you obviously are going to have to find someplace else to take it, and that is not going to be easy. By the same token, it has to go somewhere. There are 48 States on that map. It has to go somewhere. 
We have another chart that I want to bring up which shows what S. 104 is all about. If we look over at the lower left-hand corner, we find that in 1998, if we accept the status quo, we have 81 sites in 40 States. If we look over at the red arrow and find that Yucca Mountain is viable for a permanent repository, then we have achieved our objective, we have one safe, central storage site. 
What are we going to do if Yucca Mountain is not viable for a permanent repository? We are going to address our obligation. We are going to take that blue arrow right up to the top, and if Yucca Mountain is not a viable site for a permanent repository, then it requires the President to pick an alternate site. If the President refuses, we are not going to let the President off the hook. The President still has an obligation. If the President does not select an alternate site, the site defaults back to the Nevada test site. If the President picks an alternate site and Congress ratifies the site, then we have one safe, central storage site. 
The point of this chart is to show where we are trying to go with this bill, which is to address our responsibility and resolve this situation. This Senator, the chairman of this committee, is not going to accept amendments that penetrate the objective of this legislation, which is to address it and resolve it and do it now. So we have alternatives framed in this debate. 
The alternatives are a little more complicated, but we have the status quo, 81 sites in 40 States. That is a given. The red 
line says Yucca Mountain is viable for a permanent repository. If that is fine, we have one safe, central storage site. If the license application for Yucca Mountain is not filed, then we go back, if you will, and take the blue line--Yucca Mountain is not viable for a permanent repository--the Secretary picks an alternative storage site. If no site is chosen, it goes back to one central storage site. 
So what we have attempted to do here is address concerns of Members and still get the job done, because if we do not get the job done, we are going to waste several hours in debate and find ourselves not addressing the obligation we have to take this waste under the contractual commitment that we have. 
I am willing to be flexible in the shape of either one of these boxes, but the result must always be the same. We now have an opportunity for bipartisan action, and I think that we must seize that opportunity. I know that my friends from Nevada will object to the bill. They consider it probably a political necessity to oppose it. I can understand that. If it were not for Nevada, I am sure it might be Vermont where they have a lot of marble, or it might be Montana, where they have a lot of rock. The point is it has to go somewhere. 
There are going to be allegations that there is some bad science here. There are going to be efforts to try to scare us with references to `mobile Chernobyl.' That is an irresponsible statement, Mr. President. Everybody who has looked at Chernobyl knows it was not poor reactor design and human error that resulted in the accident. There was no containment building. The design was flawed, and not to United States or western standards. The technicians bypassed the safety systems, the reactor went critical, and we had a terrible accident. 
But to suggest that our bill is mobile Chernobyl is just simply irresponsible. What we are trying to do is accept an obligation, a legacy of our generation, and that is to properly dispose of this waste, and properly disposing of it does not suggest leaving it where it is. Those nuclear reactors and those pools that are being filled now were not designed for extended storage. They are reaching their capacity. 
Many in the environmental community see this as an opportunity to shut down a portion of the industry 
because any additional storage, once the storage is filled, will require additional licensing. Some of that licensing is going to be controlled by States. The States will attempt to block it by using various concerns, little of which have any scientific foundation. But nevertheless, they see this as a way to substantially reduce the contribution of nuclear energy to generate power in this country. 
Some will imply if this bill does not pass, nuclear waste will not be transported through this country. Well, let us take a little look at that. 
I have another chart here, because if one looks at the record, there have been 2,500 shipments of used fuel across this country in the last 20 years. It is just not history, Mr. President, it is happening today. The Department of Energy is transporting spent fuel from nuclear reactors all over the world into the United States virtually as we speak, by truck, by train, by barge, by boat. 
If you do not hear about this from the other side, there is probably a reason. And that reason is because these shipments have been and continue to be completely uneventful. They are shipped in casks that have been designed to address the emergencies forecast. In short, these spent fuel shipments, history shows, are safe. As a consequence, Mr. President, they are not news anymore. 
At our hearing in February, all four members of the Nevada delegation acknowledged there was no process and no level of scientific proof that would decrease their opposition. I understand that, Mr. President. I appreciate that. I know where they are coming from. They are coming from the reality that regardless of what State we are talking about, there would be an objection. But we have a responsibility, Mr. President. The objections are based on politics, not science. 
One of the Nevada Senators was in favor of sending high-level materials to the Nevada test site as a State legislator. He voted for A.J.R. 15 which was signed by the Nevada Governor in May 1975, which asked, in my opinion, the Federal Government to simply do just that. I think he was right the first time. It is safer, smarter, and cheaper to contain these materials at one location in the remote Nevada desert. 
The Nevada test site was used, as stated, for decades to explore testing of nuclear bombs and it helped win the cold war. And now it can help us win the war on radioactive waste disposal. 
High-level nuclear waste, as I have stated time and time again, Mr. President, is our legacy, and it is our obligation to dispose of it. It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to let dangerous radioactive materials pile up. Pile up where, Mr. President? Back in the 80 sites in 41 States. It is unwise to block safe storage in a remote area when the alternative is to simply leave it in the 41 States. 
Mr. President, this is a national problem. It requires a national solution. We need to pass Senate bill 104. 
I should comment briefly on the administration's attitude toward nuclear waste storage because it has been a rather interesting one. They have been content to simply ignore the problem as though they did not have one, as though there was no obligation to take the waste, and simply disregard the Government's contractual obligations. The American people, I think, deserve better. 
Safe nuclear storage should not be a political issue. It is a scientific and legitimately environmental issue. We need a solution now. And why I do not know, but the administration has again turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. 
In addition to threats in the environment and safety, 22 percent of our electric capacity is at risk now by not taking decisive action on what to do with the waste generated by our nuclear powerplants. 
Mr. President, starting in January 1998, taxpayers throughout the Nation, whether you use nuclear power or not, are going to be subjected to claims of billions of dollars in liability 
payments because our Government has not met its obligation to take that waste. 
There is a contractual commitment outstanding, Mr. President. The estimate of taxpayers' liability under a recent lawsuit blocked by States are estimated to run as high as $80 billion. How much is that per family, Mr. President? That is about $1,300 per family. You may say, what do you mean? Why are we subjected to liability if the Government does not take the waste? 
There was a contractual commitment, Mr. President, to take the waste beginning in 1998. The Government is not going to be able to take that waste, so there are going to be claims filed and there is going to be interest accrued. If they have to relocate it or expand facilities, there are additional costs. The last estimate I saw was about $59.9 billion. The estimate, as I indicated, could run as high as $80 billion. 
The cost of storage of spent nuclear fuel: That is about $19 to $20 billion. Return of nuclear waste fees: About $8.5 billion. Interest on nuclear waste fees: $15 to $27 billion. Of course, depending on the interest rate used. Remember the interest rate in December 1980? The prime rate was 20.5 percent. A lot of people have forgotten that, Mr. President. Consequential damages for shutdown of 25 percent of the nuclear plants due to insufficient storage, power replacement costs: Some $24 billion. I do not know what it is, but it is going to be full employment for all the lawyers certainly. 
Inaction is not an option. Inaction is simply irresponsible. That is why we have attempted to craft this legislation to address a reality that we are not going to be able to take the waste in a permanent repository until the year 2015. So this allows a temporary action to move the waste out so it is retrievable for disposition when a permanent repository is constructed. 
Mr. President, many of the opponents' claims, I think, have little foundation. If we look back, interim storage at the Nevada test site will not delay construction at Yucca Mountain. The type of construction we anticipate would be a concrete pad with a cask designed to hold the waste until a permanent repository is at hand. There will be a viability assessment that will occur before the interim site is built. The President will have a choice of interim sites after the viability assessment. 
This Nation faces a major decision, Mr. President: Either continue storing high-level radioactive waste materials at these 80 locations in 41 States indefinitely, for the next administration, for the next Congress, or the next Congress, and pay the claims and subject the taxpayers to more litigation, or more safely contain them in one centralized facility. 
I am indeed sorry that facility has to be in one State, but it simply has to be. So the option is clear and safer. It is safer and cheaper. And the time for action is now. 
Mr. President, I would like to refer to another chart relative to a misnomer that has been brought up time and time again. And it is a legitimate concern but it escapes a reality, and that is the issue of transportation. 
There has been 2,500 shipments of used nuclear fuel over the past 20 years. There has been no fatality, no injury, or no recorded environmental damage that has ever occurred because of radioactive cargo. I have a map here behind me that shows the routes for transferring used fuel. And this took place from 1979 to 1995, the routes used for 2,400 shipments. 
They cover from Washington down through Oregon, close to California, Montana, Idaho, Salt Lake, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, up and down the entire east coast seaboard, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee. I could go on and on but, Mr. President, I am sure that you will agree it is a pretty impressive transportation route. The map shows roads, rail lines. 
Some would say that they did not know these shipments took place. Maybe that is why they have become uneventful. There has been an accident with a truck carrying a cask, but the cask that 
contained the nuclear materials performed as designed. They have not broken open. They were designed for an accident of that nature. 
We currently have about 30,000 metric tons of spent fuel in the United States. The French alone have shipped that amount of spent fuel all over Europe, all over the world. The Japanese are moving spent fuel from Japan to France for reprocessing until they build their own reprocessing plant. 
This is not history, Mr. President. This is happening today all over our country and all over the world. There seems to be somewhat of a double standard why the Department of Energy claims it cannot possibly fulfill its obligation to the U.S. electric ratepayers and the obligation to take spent nuclear fuel. The Department of Energy is doing exactly that for foreign countries. 
Let me show you another map. Here are foreign research reactors throughout the world--Canada, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia. 
They may ask why American taxpayers are paying for the Department of Energy to transport, store nuclear waste from foreign countries while American ratepayers are subjected to a Government that refuses to honor its contractual commitments, refuses to take the waste. 
All the countries in color ship fuel to the United States for storage at the Department of Energy facilities. It seems to be a mystery. There are a lot of mysteries around here. If they support taking fuel waste from overseas, then you wonder if the issue of safety is really an issue. 
How can it be safe for the Department of Energy to ship spent fuel halfway across the world but not across some of our States? Well, let us take a little closer look because this is going to be the crux of a lot of the arguments. Let us look at what the Department of Energy does to transport nuclear waste across the United States. 
This map, Mr. President, shows America's research reactors. They are all over the place--all the red lines. Idaho National Engineering Lab in Idaho; University of Missouri, Missouri; University of Missouri, Columbia; Iowa State University; Purdue University; the University of Michigan; Ohio State University; Massachusetts, MIT; University of Lowell, Maine; Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center; 
Brookhaven National Labs; University of Virginia; University of Florida; Georgia Institute of Technology; Oak Ridge; Sandia National Laboratory; Los Alamos, and on and on and on, Mr. President. They are scattered all across the country. They move all over the country. 
What we have here is a double standard. Why does the Department of Energy pay to transport and store nuclear waste from foreign countries but will not do its duty for U.S. power reactors that have paid for the service? They do it for research reactors. The Department of Energy says they may take foreign fuel to help with nonproliferation. That perhaps is all well and good, but spent nuclear fuel is spent nuclear fuel wherever it is. If transportation storage is safe for some, why should it not be safe for all? 
I think this proves my point that I mentioned earlier. The obstacles to moving our Nation's spent nuclear fuel are political; they are not technical. Senate bill 104 provides the authority to coordinate a systematic, safe transportation network that requires the Department of Energy to use NRC-certified transportation containers to transport fuel along special routes. That transportation cannot occur until the Department of Energy has provided specific technical assistance to funding, to States, and to Indian tribes for emergency response planning across the transportation routes. The language builds on what is already a set system for spent fuel in the country. 
It is further interesting to note with this volume of traffic, some 2,400 shipments, the problem has never been exposure to radiation from spent fuel cargo, even in the fuel accidents between 1971 and 1989. The Department of Transportation tells us that only seven accidents occurred involving trucks carrying nuclear waste. There was no radioactivity released in any of these accidents. Why? Because transportation containers were designed to maintain their integrity. At one time they were designing transportation casks, and the objective was to have it so they would withstand a free fall from 40,000 feet, assuming there was an accident, and they were anticipating moving it by airplane, and the engineers claimed they could do that. 
Mr. President, we will have an extended debate on this issue in the coming days. As a manager of the bill, I will be sharing time with my colleagues on various statements, accommodating amendments and pursuing the debate with my colleagues from the other side. I think it is important as we reflect on reality that there is no excuse for continuing to delay this obligation any further. 
I have gone over the liability of the taxpayers. I have gone over the transportation that is in existence where we have moved nuclear waste around this country safely. And to suggest that we are somehow going to gain some significant benefit by putting off the decision is not supported by any logic or rationalization that would convince this Senator that there is any other action than moving forward on Senate bill 104, accommodating Members' amendments, with the idea of getting the job done. 
Getting the job done now is a responsibility for all of us for the future of nuclear energy in this country and the world. We simply cannot move forward in this regard, we cannot address our concerns over greenhouse gasses, which are increasing, without looking toward relief. Nuclear energy offers us that relief. We have the technology. We are seeing that technology move over to France and Japan. The bottom line is, unless we address the issue of a repository for waste that has been generated by the nuclear powerplants, we simply are going to be unable to meet our responsibility in this body relative to that contractual commitment that we made several years ago. This bill provides a responsible alternative. The time to do it clearly is now. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel] and the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] be added as cosponsors on Senate bill 104, to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, high-level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear fuel is piling up at 80 sites in 41 States. It is stored in populated areas, near neighborhoods and schools, in the backyards of people across America. 
An example is the Palisades Plant in Michigan, which is within 100 feet of Lake Michigan. Another is the Haddam Neck Plant, in Connecticut. A U.S. Senator has observed that he can see it from his house. 
Without objection, I would like to place in the Record an editorial from today's Hartford Courant that observes that `with the closing of the Connecticut Yankee Plant at Haddam Neck, the issue of what to do with the State's high-level nuclear waste has moved from the theoretical to the here and now. . . . Experts say Connecticut Yankee's spent fuel could be stored at Haddam Neck for another 30 years if Congress fails to approve a temporary facility. Unfortunately, the hands of the clock can't be turned back to a time when nuclear waste didn't exist. In terms of its disposal, a remote desert site in Nevada is the lesser of two evils.' 
The waste was supposed to be taken by the Federal Government for safer, central storage by 1998. Will that happen? The answer is `no.' 
Even though $12 billion has been collected from Americans to pay for storage--and even though a Federal court reaffirmed the Government's legal obligation to take the waste by 1998--there is no plan for action. 
By 1998, 23 reactors in 14 States will be full. By 2010, 65 reactors in 29 States will be full. 
A conservative estimate is that 25 percent of our nuclear plants will not be able to build onsite storage and will be forced to shut down. That would mean the loss of over 5 percent of our Nation's total electricity generating capacity. 
But Yucca Mountain won't be ready until at least 2015. Therefore, the Nation needs a temporary solution. 
That solution--S. 104--passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with a solid, bipartisan vote (15-5). Almost half the minority members and all majority members voted in favor of the bill. 
Americans have waited too long for a solution to this environmental and public safety challenge--we must not wait any longer. There is a critical need to construct a safe, central storage facility to eliminate the growing threat to the environment and to the American people. 
I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to solve any problems they have with this bill. We accepted several amendments from the democrat side. 
We continue to meet with Democrat Members and the administration to resolve remaining concerns. We will continue to work with new Secretary Pena and his staff at the Energy Department, now that the Secretary has the portfolio to resolve this pressing problem. 
Over the recess, committee staff will be available to work on proposed compromises which can be considered in April. Senator Bingaman has been very constructive in this regard. 
Much of what he is proposing appears acceptable. However, the bottom line is the need for a predictable path to interim and permanent waste storage. We simply cannot leave trap doors that allow central storage to be delayed for decades. 
We now have an opportunity for bipartisan action. Let's seize that opportunity. 
It is no secret both Nevada Senators will do what they feel they need to to derail this important bill. They consider it a political necessity to oppose it. 
There will be allegations that the science is bad and try to scare us with references to mobile chernobyl. They will imply that if this bill doesn't pass, nuclear waste will not be transported through this country. That is not true. The fact is that there have been 2,500 shipments of used fuel across this country in the last 20 years. 
This is not just history--it is happening today. Doe is transporting spent fuel from nuclear reactors all over the world into the United States, virtually as we speak--by truck, by train, by barge, by boat. 
If the Nevada Senators do not tell you about this, there's a reason. Its because these shipments have been, and will continue to be, completely uneventful. In short, these spent fuel shipments are safe, and they aren't news. 
At our hearing in February, all four members of the Nevada delegation admitted there was no process and no level of scientific proof that would decrease their opposition. This is about politics, and little about science. 
Senator Bryan was once in favor of sending high-level materials to the Nevada test site. As a State legislator, he voted for A.J.R 15, which was signed by the Nevada Governor in May 1975, which asked the Federal Government to do just that. 
I think he was right the first time. It is safer, smarter, and cheaper to contain these materials at one location in the remote nevada desert. 
The Nevada test site was used for decades to explode nuclear bombs. It helped win the cold war--now it can help us win the war on radioactive waste disposal. High-level nuclear waste is our legacy: Now it's our obligation to dispose of it. 
It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to let dangerous radioactive materials pile up at 80 sites in 41 States. It is unwise to block safe storage in a remote area when the alternative is to simply leave it in 41 States. This is a national problem that requires a national solution. We need to pass S. 104. 
So far, the administration's attitude toward nuclear waste storage has been to simply ignore the problem and disregard the Governments contractual obligation to take this waste. The American people deserve better. 
Safe nuclear storage should not be a political issue. It is a scientific and an environmental issue--and we need a solution now. Sadly, the administration has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. In addition to threats to the environment and safety, 22 percent of our electric capacity is at risk--22 percent. 
Starting in January 1998, taxpayers may have to pay billions of dollars in liability payments because the Government has not met its obligation to take waste. Estimates of taxpayers' liability under a recent lawsuit brought by States run as high as $80 billion. That's as much as $1,300 per American family. Here's how the damages break down: 
Cost of storage of spent nuclear fuel: $19.6 billion. 
Return of nuclear waste fees: $8.5 billion. 
Interest on nuclear waste fees: $15 to $27.8 billion (depending on the interest rate used). 
Consequential damages for shutdown of 25 percent of nuclear plants due to insufficient storage (power replacement cost): $24 billion. 
Inaction is not an option. Inaction is irresponsible. 
Many of the opponents claims are also irresponsible: Interim storage at the Nevada test site will not delay construction of Yucca Mountain. A viability assessment will occur before the interim site is built. The President will have a choice of interim sites after the viability assessment. 
This Nation faces a major decision: either continue storing high-level radioactive materials at 80 locations in 41 States indefinitely, or more safely contain them at one, centralized facility. 
The option is clear--it's safer and cheaper. The time for action is now.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, along with Senators Akaka, Domenici, and Kyl, I am today introducing legislation to address several issues associated with hydroelectric projects. 
Section 1 gives the State of Alaska jurisdiction over small hydroelectric projects 5 megawatts or smaller. Section 2 precludes the voluntary licensing of hydroelectric projects on fresh waters in the State of Hawaii. Section 3 provides an exemption from licensing for the transmission line portion of a hydroelectric project located in the State of New Mexico. Section 4 gives the FERC the authority to extend for up to 10 years the deadline for commencement of construction of hydroelectric projects. 
Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this bill are virtually identical to sections 7, 8, and 9 of S. 737 as reported in the 104th Congress. By unanimous vote, S. 737 was ordered reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (Report No. 104-77). On September 27, 1996, the Senate unanimously passed S. 737 (Senate Calendar No. 100). Unfortunately, just a few days later, on October 6, the House of Representatives went out of session not having acted on the Senate-passed bill. 
Sections 2 and 3 are of direct interest to Senators Akaka and Domenici, and they will speak separately on their merits. I will discuss sections 1 and 4, which are of direct interest to me. 
Section 1 gives the State of Alaska jurisdiction over hydroelectric projects 5 megawatts or smaller. It goes into effect when the Governor of Alaska notifies the Secretary of Energy that the State has in place a comprehensive process for regulating these facilities. The required process is modeled on the one contained in the Federal Power Act for the FERC. The authority granted to the State of Alaska would apply only to projects that are located entirely within the State. Moreover, these projects may not be located on an Indian reservation, a unit of the National Park System, a component of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, or a segment of a river designated for study for potential addition to such system. In the case of a project that is already licensed by the FERC, the project sponsor may elect to make it subject to State authority. Projects located on Federal lands are subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Federal agency having jurisdiction, and that Secretary may include such terms and conditions as may be necessary for the protection of the public interest. The provisions specifically provide that nothing preempts the application of Federal environmental, natural, or cultural resources protection laws according to their terms. 
Section 4 amends section 13 of the Federal Power Act to give the FERC authority to extend for up to 10 years the deadline for the commencement of a hydroelectric project. Under existing law, a project must commence construction within 2 years of the date of the issuance of the license. That deadline can be extended by the FERC one time for as much as 2 additional years, for a total of 4 years. If construction has not commenced at the end of the statutory time period, the license must be terminated by the FERC. Termination not only results in the licensee losing its investment of time and many tens of thousands of dollars to obtain the license, it also delays the construction of the project by requiring a new licensee to start the licensing process all over. 
In the past, 4 years was adequate time to commence construction. However, with growing uncertainty in the electric power market, it is proving increasingly difficult for licensees to obtain the power purchase contract necessary to secure financing so as to permit commencement of construction. This has resulted in a number of individual requests to Congress to legislatively extend on a case-by-case basis the commencement of construction deadline. During the 104th Congress, for example, 28 bills were introduced in the House and Senate to extend the deadline for individual projects. Acting on these individual requests proved to be very time consuming for the committee and for the Congress. Had this provision been enacted, all of these requests could have been accommodated administratively by the FERC. Hence, I am introducing this bill to give the FERC the generic authority to extend the deadline for the commencement of construction for up to 10 years. 
Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I am introducing this legislation along with Senators Akaka, Domenici, and Kyl.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I heard the comments expressed by my good friend, the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, relative to his concern and the concern of his State over the disposition of high-level nuclear waste that is in some 80 locations in 41 States throughout the country, and the inability of the current administration to address its responsibility and hence the responsibility of Congress to meet the contractual commitments made some years ago to take that nuclear waste next year, in 1998. 
The reality is that the ratepayers in this country have paid over that period of time some $12 billion which has gone into the general fund. And, as consequence, we are facing a reality that next year we are not going to be able to meet the obligation of taking that waste. So we can anticipate an opportunity for full employment for the lawyers that are associated with this issue because there is going to be a giant liability that is coming to the American taxpayer. It is estimated to be somewhere in the area of $40 billion to $80 billion. The current estimate is about $59 billion. But usually it goes up from there. This is the liability, or at least a portion of it, which the Federal Government will be subjected to as a consequence of its inability to perform on its contractual commitment. I do not take that lightly. As a consequence, as we address on the floor later on today the nomination of the Secretary of Energy, Federico PenAE6a, I think this is a significant question. 
I rise today in support of that nomination. I also rise to advise my colleagues that the delay in considering the nomination has not been about the nominee's qualifications. The nominee is qualified. The committee has held hearings on the nomination. We have investigated matters brought to our attention. We found him to be qualified and reported the nomination favorably on a 19-to-0 vote with one Member voting `present.' But there has been an issue, and that issue has been whether the new Secretary is going to have the ability, the flexibility, and the authority to work with Congress to solve the looming nuclear waste storage problem. As I indicated earlier, this waste is stacking up in our towns and in our communities near our homes and schools at 80 locations in 41 States. 
Some have said, `How important is nuclear energy?' Well, nuclear energy is contributing about 22 percent of the total power generated in the United States today. People look at power. They take it for granted. They expect it to work. It is always there. It is almost an entitlement. But it has to come from somewhere. It has to come from investment and from transmissions. It has to come from some kind of energy source, and nuclear is an important contributor. Nearly a quarter of the energy produced in the United States. But the waste, as a consequence of these nuclear power plants, has been stacking up. A Federal court has said that the Government must take that waste by 1998. 
As I have said before, Americans put $12 billion into the nuclear waste fund. What do we have to show for it? Nothing. The problem that is unique about this is that nobody wants it. Absolutely no State wants to have this waste. You can throw it up in the air. It has to come down somewhere. It will not stay up there. That is the basic problem. The States in question are running out of space. These are the States that have reactors, and the storage that they have is not permanent storage. It wasn't designed for long-term storage. It was designed for short-term storage. That space is filling up. As a consequence, they may have to limit the construction of new storage capacities. States might not license for new storage capacity. 
Mr. President, I ask for another 4 minutes under the time remaining on the 30 minutes that was given to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
The reality is that the final repository won't be ready until the year 2015. That is where we are; the permanent repository. We need that. But it will not be ready. 
We have a 50-50 chance of taking that waste. This poses an environmental and public safety challenge. I have indicated the risk to the taxpayers--currently $59 billion. Some electricity production may be shut down. 
Mr. President, we simply need the action now. However, we had a problem when the administration, in a communication by the Vice President, told a congressional leadership group this was not a matter that was up for consideration at that meeting. He inferred that we could leave the waste where it was until Yucca Mountain was built. 
After I heard about that statement, I postponed consideration of S. 104 and the vote on Mr. PenAE6a so we could begin a process of attempting to work with the administration to get this back on track. In a meeting with the White House Chief of Staff, Erskine Bowles, I asked him to empower the new Energy Secretary to work with us. I said the Senate cannot accept the Vice President's `leave it there' policy. I asked Mr. Bowles to send down a nominee who had flexibility. I have had several conversations with Mr. PenAE6a, Mr. Bowles, and the White House, and judging from those conversations and a recent letter from Mr. Bowles, it seems that the administration has now decided to choose dialog over the Vice President's stonewalling, which is the only way I can put it. I am glad to see that the new Energy Secretary will now have a portfolio to work with the Congress.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Stevens, Gorton, Burns, Craig, Kempthorne, and Senator Smith of Oregon, in introducing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997. 
Our legislation will create a new twelfth circuit comprised of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. This legislation will ease the current burdens of the ninth circuit, as well as effectively create a new northwest circuit that is historically, economically, culturally, and philosophically united. 
Mr. President, one look at the contours of the ninth circuit reveals the need for this reorganization. Stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border, past the tropics of Hawaii and across the international dateline to Guam and the Marianna Islands, by any means of measurement, the ninth circuit is the largest of all U.S. circuit courts of appeal. 
There is also no denying the ninth circuit's mammoth caseload. It serves a population of more than 45 million people, well over one-third more than the next largest circuit. 
Last year, the ninth circuit had an astounding 7,146 new filings. 
By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that the ninth circuit's population will be more than 63 million--a 40-percent increase in just 13 years, which inevitably will create an even more daunting caseload. 
We believe that this legislation is long overdue. Because of its size, the entire appellate process in the ninth circuit is the second slowest in the Nation. As former Chief Judge Wallace of the ninth circuit stated: `It takes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal in our court as compared to the national median time.' Mr. President, what this means is that while the national median time for filing a notice of appeal to final disposition is 315 days, the ninth circuit median time is 1 year and 2 months. 
Furthermore, the massive size of the ninth circuit often results in a decrease in the ability to keep abreast of legal developments within its own jurisdiction. This unwieldy caseload creates an inconsistency in constitutional interpretation. In fact, ninth circuit cases have an extraordinarily high reversal rate by the Supreme Court. During the Supreme Court's 1994-95 session, the Supreme Court overturned 82 percent of the ninth circuit cases heard by the Court. This lack of constitutional consistency discourages settlements and leads to unnecessary litigation. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing is not novel. Since the day the circuit was founded, over a century ago, there were discussions of a split. Nearly a quarter century ago, in 1973, the Congressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court of Appellate System recommended that the ninth circuit be divided. 
Additionally, the American Bar Association has adopted a resolution expressing the benefits of dividing the ninth district. 
Since 1983, Senator Gorton and many others in this Chamber have initiated legislation to split the circuit. 
There have been Senate hearings. In December 1995, Senator Hatch stated in a committee report that:  
The legislative history, in conjunction with available statistics and research concerning the Ninth Circuit, provides an ample record for an informed decision at this point as to whether to divide the Ninth Circuit . . . Upon careful consideration the time has indeed come. 
Furthermore, splitting a circuit to respond to caseload and population growth is by no means unprecedented. Congress divided the original eighth circuit to create the tenth circuit in 1929, and divided the former fifth circuit to create the 11th circuit in 1980. 
The legislation that I and my colleagues introduce today is the sensible reorganization of the ninth circuit. The new ninth circuit would embrace California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories. And the new 12th circuit would be comprised solely of States in the Northwest region. Most importantly, this split would respect the economic, historical, cultural, and legal ties which exist between the States involved. 
Mr. President, no one court can effectively exercise its power in an area that extends from the Arctic Circle to the tropics. The legislation introduction today will create a regional commonality which will lead to greater consistency and dependency in legal decisions. 
Mr. President, we have waited long enough. The 45 million residents of the ninth circuit are the persons that suffer. Many wait years before cases are heard and decided, prompting many to forego the entire appellate process. In brief, the ninth circuit has become a circuit where justice is not swift and not always served.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Stevens, introduce legislation that will more accurately reflect the appropriate Federal/State funding formula for Alaska's Medicaid Program. 
One-sixth of Alaska's population is eligible to receive Medicaid, and the population is growing. These Medicaid recipients are the needy children, pregnant women, disabled, and elderly poor of Alaska. 
Ever since the Medicaid Program was established in 1965, the Federal/State funding formula has failed to recognize the extraordinarily high cost of living that all Alaskans face. Under current law, the funding formula that is used to determine the Federal matching payment is based on a comparison between average per capita income in the United States and each individual State's per capita income. 
Under the current formula, the minimum Federal Medicaid match is 50 percent. The highest Federal match is 77.2 percent and is provided to the State with the lowest per capita income--Mississippi. By contrast, Alaska has a 50/50 Federal/State match based on the fact that it has the seventh highest per capita income in the United States, $17,961 based on 1993 data. 
However, many Federal programs recognize that per capita income, by itself, is not a fair measure of wealth. For example, a special Federal Government cost-of-living adjustment is provided to Federal employees in Alaska to reflect our cost differential. Other Federal formulas, such as the formula for the Federal School Lunch Program, Food Stamp Program, and certain housing programs each recognize and take into consideration Alaska's high cost of living. 
Mr. President, I recognize that Alaska's $17,961 per capita income suggests it is one of the wealthier States. However, when the 25 percent higher cost of living is factored in, the State looks far less wealthy. In fact, when Alaska's high cost of living is factored into the equation, it would 
appear that an Alaskan with an income of $17,961 lives at the same economic level as a person in Iowa with a per capita income of $14,399. Yet Iowa enjoys a 62/38 Federal/State Medicaid match. 
Why is Alaska's cost of living higher than the lower 48 States? The answer is primarily because of the high cost of shipping goods to Alaska. Almost everything of substantial size or volume comes to Alaska by water, and despite healthy competition among carriers, prices remain high due to the distance traveled and the fact that Alaska remains an importer of goods, not an exporter. That means most vessels are unable to carry a backhaul cargo that would lower the overall cost of the round trip. Moreover, because of an undeveloped road structure, most food transported to remote villages in Alaska rely exclusively on air freight. 
What this high shipping cost means is that it costs a family of four in Bethel, Alaska's largest rural community, nearly $30 more each week to feed their family, compared to the average family in the United States. And, it is these rural Alaska areas that have the highest number of Medicaid recipients. 
The present Medicaid formula is fundamentally unfair because it doesn't reflect these facts. What it means is that more people in Alaska are eligible for Medicaid, but the Federal match isn't adjusted accordingly. Basically, the current Federal formula gives us more Medicaid users and provides less money to pay for their services. to exacerbate this inequity--health care costs in Alaska are estimated to be 71 percent higher than the national average. 
The legislation we are introducing today, The Alaska Medicaid Equity Act, finally resolves this inequity. It adjusts the Medicaid formula for Alaska to factor in the State's high cost of living. Passage of this legislation would result in an estimated savings of $40 to $50 million for the State of Alaska Legislature. 
This adjustment was included in legislation that was reported from the Senate Finance Committee as part of the reconciliation bill that was adopted in 1995. However, that omnibus bill was ultimately vetoed for unrelated reasons. 
Mr. President, we in Alaska have endured this historic inequity for nearly a third of a century. I hope my colleagues will agree, the time to right this wrong is this year.

 Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this bill is very simple, yet it is extremely important to our Nation's energy security. This bill contains the authorizations for two vital energy security measures, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and U.S. participation in the International Energy Agency, which will expire at the end of this fiscal year. This bill would extend those two vital authorities, as well as several other important DOE programs, through 2002. 
For every year in recent memory, we have authorized this act on a year-to-year basis, and we have faced a potential crisis as these authorizations go unrenewed until the very end of the Congress. We always seem to end up facing a situation where the President does not have authority to withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if an energy emergency occurs. 
Further, if these authorities are not renewed, our Government does not have authority to participate in International Energy Agency emergency actions in an international energy emergency. There will be no antitrust exemption available to our private oil companies to allow them to cooperate with the IEA and our Government to respond to the crisis. These provisions are not controversial in and of themselves, but this bill has a tendency to become a vehicle to address concerns over unrelated issues. 
In an attempt to avoid the annual crisis, I am introducing legislation today that will renew these authorities for 5 years. The bill also provides for the leasing of extra capacity in our reserve facilities and changes to the antitrust exemption in the bill to comport with the policies adopted by the IEA at our request. 
Although it appears to be easy for some to disregard these dangers, recent events have underscored exactly how precarious this Nation's energy security is. Events in the Middle East clearly demonstrate the instability of the region that we rely on to supply the oil that keeps this Nation moving. 
The situation is only getting worse. Since the establishment of the Department of Energy, our reliance on imported oil has passed 50 percent, and is expected to rise to 71 percent by 2015. The OPEC countries are steadily regaining lost market share and it is projected to exceed 50 percent by 2000. The U.S. economy appears to be as exposed as it was in the early 1970's to supply disruptions and losses from monopoly oil pricing. We are talking about jobs and people's lives. In the face of these numbers, DOE has no real plan to stop our slide into near complete dependence on foreign sources of oil, and the President's budget contains a proposal to sell 67 million barrels of oil from the SPR in the year 2002. 
I am dismayed by a recent trend toward using the SPR as a piggy bank to pay for other programs. The oil in the SPR cost an average of $27 per barrel. We have sold it for anywhere from $18 to $20 per barrel. Buying high and selling low never makes sense. We're like the man in the old joke who was buying high and selling low who claimed that he would make it up on volume. 
In the face of our growing oil dependence, and the administration's proposal to sell oil from the SPR, I can't resist noting the administration's opposition to the production of our domestic oil resources. The administration does not support the domestic storage or production of oil. They do not appear to like the reality that this Nation will continue to need petroleum. However, reality doesn't cease to be reality because we ignore it. 
We have already invested a great deal of taxpayer money in these stockpiles. As proven during the Persian Gulf war, the stabilizing effect of an SPR drawdown far outstrips the volume of oil sold. The simple fact that the SPR is available can have a calming influence on oil markets. The oil is there, waiting to dampen the effects of an energy emergency on our economy. However, if we don't ensure that there is authority to use the oil when we need it, we will have thrown those tax dollars away. 
So, the first step is to ensure that our emergency oil reserves are fully authorized and available to dampen the effects of the most severe supply disruptions. We are talking about people's lives and jobs. The least we can do is try to limit the possibility that this measure will be held hostage to political ambition.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in this debate on the balanced budget amendment, I believe the Senate has lived up to its reputation as the greatest deliberative body in the world, bar none. We have spent nearly a month debating this measure and I want to especially commend the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his stamina and intellect in managing this measure. 
Now as the time for debate draws to a close, I hope all of my colleagues will reflect on the simple principle that we are attempting to incorporate into our Constitution. It is simply that one generation of Americans has no right to mortgage future generations to finance our daily spending habits. Think about it. 
There is one thing for certain, Mr. President. When the clock strikes midnight on December 31, 1999, and we enter the new century, America will have run deficits for 31 consecutive years and we will have a national debt of more than $6 trillion. 
If we are ever going to reverse that endless tide of red ink, if we are going to ease the economic burdens on our children and grandchildren, then as a matter of moral responsibility, we will adopt this constitutional amendment. If we don't pass the amendment this will truly be an American tragedy.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to inform the Senate of recent events which relate to the nomination of Federico PenAE6a to be Secretary of the Department of Energy. I would like to state up front, the issue is not Mr. PenAE6a's qualifications, the issue is whether or not Secretary PenAE6a will have the ability to work with Congress to solve the nuclear waste problem. As you know, I have been working for the past 2 years to find a solution to the Nation's nuclear waste storage problem. Currently, civilian nuclear waste is piling up in 41 States at 80 reactor sites and defense facilities around the country. 
We have waited many years for a solution--we cannot wait any longer. There is a critical need right now to find a safe central storage facility to eliminate the current threat to the environment and to the American people posed by existing storage. 
The administration's position has been that it would not support any nuclear waste legislation until Yucca Mountain has been found viable as a permanent repository. An event which was not scheduled to occur until late in 1998. This position completely ignored the fact that a Federal court had ruled that the Department of Energy was required to take title to the waste in January 1998. 
This administration's attitude toward nuclear waste storage is improper, irresponsible, and unacceptable. The American people deserve better. 
I looked forward to working with the new Energy Secretary in the post-election spirit of bipartisanship. Indeed, when Mr. PenAE6a testified during his confirmation hearing on January 30 that he would work with Congress to find a solution for nuclear waste storage, I was encouraged. 
I was hoping to open a real dialog with the administration to explore possible compromise. 
However, before the committee voted on Mr. PenAE6a, the summit between the President and congressional leaders took place on February 11. Because I was encouraged by Mr. PenAE6a's statements at his confirmation hearing, I asked Senator Lott to raise the nuclear waste issue at that meeting. It was already an issue which had broad bipartisan support in Congress. 
I was extremely disappointed when I received a report of what happened when Senator Lott attempted to raise the issue. The Vice President said words to the effect: `That waste is going to stay right where it is until we have a permanent place to put it.' He went on to say that he thought the meeting was to discuss items on which compromise was possible and nuclear waste was not such an item. 
I found that to be a totally irresponsible position on the part of the Vice President. It also demonstrated a complete insensitivity to one of our most urgent environmental problems and ignored the contractual commitment. The Vice President had categorically ruled out safe, centralized interim storage. He said `leave it where it is.' 
I had planned to go ahead with a markup of the reintroduced nuclear waste bill and the PenAE6a nomination the very next day, February 12, but I canceled that business meeting in an attempt to see if the new Secretary would have authority to work with Congress on the impending nuclear waste crisis. 
Again the issue was not Mr. PenAE6a's credentials, it was a question of would he have the power and authority as Secretary to work with Congress on the nuclear waste problem. 
During the following week, I requested a meeting with White 
House Chief of Staff, Erskine Bowles, to discuss this matter. That meeting occurred last Tuesday. 
I asked Mr. Bowles if there was any way the administration could start a dialog to find a responsible solution to our disagreement on the waste issue. Mr. Bowles said he would look into it and get back to me. The meeting was cordial and I had hoped productive. 
Mr. Bowles got back to me last Wednesday morning by telephone. It was a short conversation. I was told that there would be no discussions at all on nuclear waste until after Mr. PenAE6a was confirmed. Let me repeat that--no discussions at all on nuclear waste until after confirmation. 
This is the message from an administration which has had its head in the sand on this issue for 4 years. They have refused to discuss or take any kind of responsible position on this issue, yet they want me and the rest of the Senate to move forward on the nominee which will have responsibility over nuclear waste policy. 
A nominee, who when Secretary, would have absolutely no authority to even discuss areas of compromise. 
It's no wonder Secretary O'Leary waited until she was free from the administration to articulate her support for centralized interim storage. A CQ Monitor story last week reported `O'Leary blamed * * * opposition [to interim storage] on White House officials connected with Vice President Al Gore. She said they see the issue more in political than technical terms.' `You'll get more clarity from someone like me outside the system,' O'Leary said. Unfortunately, we cannot wait until the next Secretary leaves office before we hear his views on this subject. 
Safe nuclear waste storage should not be a political issue. It is a scientific issue and an environmental issue--and we need a solution now. Sadly, the administration has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. 
In addition to threats to the environment and safety, 20 percent of our electric generating capacity is at risk--20 percent. Starting in January 1998, there is a substantial likelihood that American taxpayers will either be paying for or be deprived of billions of dollars a year as a result of this administration's inaction. That's right, Mr. President, estimates of the Federal Government's liability under a recent lawsuit brought by the States run between $40-$80 billion. 
Inaction is not an option. Inaction is irresponsible. 
Mr. President, I have not asked the administration to change its position prior to Mr. PenAE6a's confirmation. I would like that, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I have identified areas where S. 104 can be modified to alleviate concerns. I am working with Democratic colleagues on the committee to address some of their concerns. I would like to have the same opportunity for dialog with the administration. 
Contrary to some White House leaks, that dialog has not been linked to any specific Alaska issue and it has not been about Mr. PenAE6a's qualifications. It has been largely about the administration's lack of a plan to accept the waste by 1998. Americans have paid $12 billion into the fund. 
I look forward to working with a Secretary of Energy who can work with me and other Members of Congress on the nuclear waste problem. It is very hard to explore compromise if one side won't talk. 
It is also hard if one of the sides ducks the issue for years, and won't take a position until it is forced to. 
The Vice President says no talk and no interim storage. Period. He says `Leave it where it is'--in 41 States. Other elements of the administration seem to want to be more cooperative. 
It took a meeting with Mr. Bowles, a lot of other conversations, and a couple delays in the confirmation vote to get them to focus on this important safety and environmental issue. The national news attention has also raised visibility. 
Now, they seem willing to face the issue. And they are beginning to sort out their real position. The current policy squabble inside the administration suggests it is finally facing up to this pressing issue. 
I received a letter from Mr. Bowles. It signals that the administration is willing to engage in constructive dialog; it comes close to finally articulating a policy; and it contradicts the Vice President's non-policy policy of leaving the waste where it is until the final repository is built. 
I am pleased to receive the letter. After 2 years, I think we finally may have a real dialog. The letter says Mr. PenAE6a will have the portfolio to talk and work with Congress.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, based on Mr. Bowles involvement and the good faith commitment by the administration to treat this as a policy and not a political issue, I am announcing the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will vote on the nomination Thursday at 9:30 a.m. 
We look forward to resolving our differences with the administration and moving forward with legislation addressing the nuclear waste crisis by the end of this month. 
I look forward to working with Mr. PenAE6a to stop the irresponsible policy of piling high-level radioactive waste at 80 locations in 41 States, near our homes and schools. 
Taxpayers are being exposed to billions of dollars in liability and American ratepayers are being cheated out of the $12 billion they have paid into the nuclear waste fund.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Stevens to introduce legislation that would resolve a dispute that has existed for several years between the IRS and native whaling captains in my State. Our legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to ensure that a charitable donation tax deduction would be allowed for native whaling captains who organize and support subsistence whaling activities in their communities. 
Subsistence whaling is a necessity to the Alaska Native community. In many of our remote village communities, the whale hunt is a tradition that has been carried on for generations over many millennia. It is the custom that the captain of the hunt make all provisions for the meals, wages, and equipment costs associated with this important activity. 
In most instances, the captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuck, which is blubber and skin. However, as part of the tradition, the captain is required to donate a substantial portion of the whale to his village in order to help the community survive. 
The proposed deduction would allow the captain to deduct up to $7,500 to help defray the costs associated with providing this community service. 
Mr. President, I want to point out that if the captain incurred all of these expenses and then donated the whale meat to a local charitable organization, the captain would almost certainly be able to deduct the costs he incurred in outfitting the boat for the charitable purpose. However, the cultural significance of the captain's sharing the whale with the community would be lost. 
This is a very modest effort to allow the Congress to recognize the importance of this part of our Native Alaskan tradition. Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that this provision would cost a mere $3 million over a 10-year period. I think that is a very small price for preserving this vital link with our natives' heritage.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe I have the unique distinction of being the only current Member of this body who has served in the U.S. Coast Guard, so as a consequence I rise today to pay tribute to three brave young men who perished early yesterday off the coast of Washington State. 
Petty Officer 2d Class David Bosley of Coronado, CA; Petty Officer 3d Class Matthew Schlimme of Whitewater, MO; and Seaman Clinton Miniken of Snohomish, WA, were serving aboard a 44-foot motor lifeboat stationed on the Pacific Ocean coast of Washington State's Olympic Peninsula. 
Early yesterday morning they took their vessel out to answer a distress call from two people aboard a sailboat in trouble in heavy seas. Tragically, the 44-footer capsized and three brave men died. Only one crewman, Seaman Apprentice Benjamin Wingo of Bremerton, WA, survived to reach the rocky shoreline and safety. 
Some of my colleagues have heard me address this body in the past to give tribute to successful rescues made by Coast Guard personnel in dangerous situations where they themselves were placed in serious jeopardy by their effort to save others. Most such rescues end happily. This one--tragically--did not. 
We pay formal tribute to those members of the military who fall in the line of duty while fighting our Nation's enemies. I hope the Members of this body will take just a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of these three young Coast Guardsmen. They, too, perished in the line of duty, fighting to protect human life. 
The Coast Guard motto, `Semper Paratus,' means `Always Prepared.' Sometimes, it means being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a very serious situation exists in our Nation that I would like to discuss with my colleagues today. It concerns the storage of nuclear waste that has been generated in conjunction with the operation of nuclear reactors that provide this Nation with about 22 percent of the power generation that we currently enjoy. Without this contribution from the nuclear industry, we would have to depend on some other form of generation to contribute that 22 percent. We would probably use more coal, perhaps more natural gas. The potential for developing more hydro is somewhat limited, based on the costs and the fact that most of the potential hydro sites have already been developed. I happen to be chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has the obligation to oversee our country's electricity industry. It is an industry that most Americans take for granted. We are used to plugging in the iron, plugging in the coffee pot, and having them work. We do not recognize and we do not really reflect on what is behind it--the people, the men and women working in the power generating business, the business of transmitting the electric energy, distributing it and making sure it works. 
In any event, in connection with the tremendous dependence we have on nuclear energy in this country--I might add, we are the largest consumers of nuclear generated energy of any nation in the world--I was staggered to read that the Senate-White House meeting which was held yesterday resulted in agreement on some issues, but no agreement to address the question of what to do with the nuclear waste generated by our power reactors. 
I think a headline should have read, `The Clinton Administration Simply Wants to Keep the Status Quo.' Keeping nuclear waste in the neighborhoods of our country, and the consequences of that, deserve some examination. This examination could start in your town, in your State, in your neighborhood. That is where it is being stored. High-level radioactive materials are piling up in 80 locations in 41 of our States. Onsite storage is filling up, and the States which control the ability of utilities to store nuclear waste on the reactor sites will have to address whether they want to increase onsite storage at the nuclear reactors, or whether they will give in to pressure to simply not allow any further storage beyond the limited amount of existing storage. 
Some see this as a way to shut down the nuclear industry in this country. By objecting to any increase in authority to store onsite, the reactors can be forced to shut down because there is no place to put the spent fuel. 
I have a chart which I am going to spend a few minutes on, because it shows the crucial nature of the problem. When the administration says, `We will just leave it where it is,' I suggest to you, Mr. President, that this is an unrealistic and unworkable alternative. By 1998, 23 reactors in 14 States will run out of storage space. What we have here are plants with adequate storage, and they are indicated in the light blue. You can see most of them are on the eastern seaboard. But in purple are plants requiring additional storage by the year 2010. These States all have plants in purple: California, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and all up and down the east 
coast. These plants do not have adequate storage to hold waste within the areas immediately adjacent to the reactors, and are going to have to petition the States to increase the authorization for nuclear energy waste allowed to be stored at those sites. In the green are plants requiring additional storage by the year 2015. They are primarily on the eastern seaboard and the Midwestern States, such as Illinois. 
So the point of this chart is to highlight that additional nuclear waste storage is needed in this country now. The bill we have introduced in our committee, S. 104, would provide a real solution to this crisis that is coming down the track. It is a train wreck that is coming. We have this material at 80 locations in 41 States. The Federal Government entered into a contractual commitment with America's ratepayers who depend on nuclear energy and the nuclear generation industry. In return for over $12 billion ratepayer dollars, the Government committed to take this waste by the year 1998. This is less than 1 year away; it is about 10 months away. The Federal Government has no place to put this waste and will default on its contractual commitment in 1998, when it is obligated to take the waste. 
There has been an effort to provide this Nation with a permanent repository. The government has a study program under way at Yucca Mountain, NV. We have spent $6 billion on this effort, but that facility will not be ready for 15 years, at the earliest. Secretary O'Leary said it may be 20 years. It may be longer. But the point is, we are looking at somewhere in the area of 2015 or thereabouts, and where in the world are we going to be able to accommodate this waste? Because we are not going to have a permanent repository then. We may never have a permanent repository, and I will talk about that a little later.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, the difficulty we have here with Yucca Mountain is not knowing whether we will ever get it licensed because it has to withstand a scientific analysis regarding any possible source of exposure--earthquake, volcanic activity, any leeching into the ground--for approximately 10,000 years. We do not know whether science can come up with that kind of certification. 
But, in any event, in order to try to make this case we have to proceed with the tunneling, and spend the money. However, we simply do not know whether it will ever be a permanent repository. But the idea of moving this waste from 41 States, 80 sites, to a place where we have had extensively studied certainly seems to make sense. If Yucca Mountain is determined to be permanent, we will have the waste there and ready to put in a permanent repository. If Yucca Mountain is not the permanent repository site, it will be dozens of years before another permanent repository site can be located and studied, and a central interim storage facility will still be needed. 
It is my understanding that the Vice President apparently was saying two things. The administration no longer supports any form of centralized interim storage. In the meantime, we can only conclude that their policy is, `Leave it where it is.' Leave it where it is. Ignore the problem. Put off the decision. Act like an ostrich--put your head in the sand. Let nuclear waste build up in 41 States, near the homes, near the schools. This is the administration's irresponsible and dangerous policy on nuclear waste storage. 
As I said, the Federal Government has a 1998 deadline. Taxpayers have paid billions of dollars only to have the Vice President say, `Leave it where it is.' 
I have another chart that I will refer to very briefly. These are the States where ratepayers have paid into the Federal Government's nuclear waste fund to provide for nuclear waste storage. The Federal Government did not hold this money in escrow. They put it in the general fund. They have spent it. 
The point is, there is $12 billion that has been paid in by the ratepayers for the Federal Government to take this waste in 1998. Virtually every State has bought nuclear power and paid into the fund. That is where the Government's contractual commitments really lay. 
Why is the administration simply saying no to any form of interim storage when Yucca Mountain has only a 50-50 chance of opening? Some who are on the fringes of the environmental movement think that this sort of foot dragging may help them close down the entire nuclear industry. Those people apparently have no responsibility for replacing that 22 percent of our power that we will lose. Twenty-two percent of our electricity, Mr. President, is generated by nuclear power. Even if all of the reactors shut down, we would be stuck with the utility waste and the defense waste still. We would not have an answer for what to do with it. If they shut down the industry, we still have the waste to dispose of. 
Mr. President, we won the cold war with the help of our 
nuclear deterrent. Now we have an obligation to clean up the mess. We can win the war on nuclear waste. Leaving it where it is is not an option, and 41 States are watching us. 
In addition to the nuclear waste of our power generators, we have nuclear waste that resulted from nuclear weapons development. I was at Hanford 2 weeks ago and went through the old plants that developed the plutonium to make the Hiroshima bomb, and those that made advanced nuclear devices. One must seriously consider what those facilities contributed to humanity and the burden they left. It is a responsibility that we must bear. Nuclear weapons brought the Second World War to an early close. There were lives lost; there were lives saved. The same thing is true regarding the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
No matter what your opinion regarding these matters, we have a legacy of nuclear waste. We have to address it. The responsible way to address it is to meet head on the obligations we have made. Under a contractual commitment, we have collected $12 billion from ratepayers and are committed to take that waste by 1998. 
The Government is not prepared to take the waste. This case is going to be litigated, and it will become a full employment act for the lawyers beginning in 1998. We have proposed in S. 104 to address it now by providing for the siting of an interim storage site, in the Nevada desert, or somewhere else the President and Congress may choose, until we have a permanent repository. 
Mr. President, we have to have a temporary central storage facility in this country. There is absolutely no question about it. But this administration chooses to ignore it. They want this problem to go away. They do not want to address it on their watch. I suggest, Mr. President, that this is irresponsible. I thank the President and wish him a good day and yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I counted it up the other day. This is my 17th year of having the honor to represent my State of Alaska in this body. During that period I participated in seven separate debates on this floor on this very singular issue, and that is the amendment of our Constitution to require that the budget be balanced. 
A number of years ago, several of us unloaded a big van on the steps of the U.S. Senate. In that van were mailbags. And in those mailbags were letters from our constituents in overwhelming support of an amendment to the Constitution that would mandate a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, in 1982 the Senate adopted the amendment but it failed in the House. Since then, the amendment has failed in every year that we have engaged in this debate. In the intervening decade and a half annual Federal spending has increased nearly $1 trillion and our national debt has quadrupled. 
Mr. President, through this debate, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have amply demonstrated the billions and trillions that we have been spending, and the meteoric rise of our national debt. I do not intend to repeat those numbers. As the 10-foot stack of budgets standing before me on the floor clearly show, for the past 28 years the Federal Government has been living on debt. I find that rather ironic, Mr. President, in view of the fact that you and I and our constituents back home have to balance, if you will, our checkbooks. But the Government goes through a process of lengthy debate and budgetary process of seeing what its revenues are, seeing what its expenditures are, and then whatever else it seems to need it is simply added to the national debt. 
Mr. President, I want to talk about the awesome responsibility that we have as stewards of this Nation to face up to the enormity of the challenge that we are facing in changing the way we govern and have been governing. 
Mr. President, American Government was transformed by the Great Depression. In response to this crisis, our then President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 ushered in the age of social activist government, one of whose tenets was that in times of economic stress the Government would actively intervene to restart the economy. Thus was born the age of peacetime deficit spending. 
Unfortunately, what has ensued in the intervening 64 years is that the Federal Government has become incapable of weaning itself from this addiction to deficit spending. Whether in periods of strong growth or modest growth, the Federal Government runs deficits. In fact, in only 8 years since the Depression has the Federal Government operated with a surplus. 
But even that fact is somewhat misleading for I would note that the Federal surplus in those 8 years was a mere $33 billion. Compare that with 56 years of deficits cumulating in a national debt of more than $5.2 trillion. 
Let me refer to the chart here on my left. I hope that the President can view this. It covers the next 4 years of the current administration with outlays in 1997 of $1.6 trillion to the year 2000 at $1.84 trillion. 
The significance of what is occurring here is we are having to pay interest on this accumulated debt. The interest is running $247 billion in 1997, $250 billion in 1998, $252 billion in 1999, and $248 billion in the year 2000. 
I used to be in the banking business and I can tell you that interest is like owning a horse that eats while you are asleep. It goes on and on, night and day and holidays. No day is exempt from the accumulation of interest. 
Here is our deficit, Mr. President: $125 billion, $120 billion, $117 billion, $87 billion. One can say that is good news. The deficit is declining. Let us look a little further. 
But I would note that if we did not have to pay interest on this accumulated debt, if we hadn't accumulated all of these deficits, we would not have to pay nearly a trillion dollars in interest in the next 4 years and instead of running deficits for the next 4 years, we would have a surplus. We would have a surplus of $122 billion this year, $130 billion in 1998, $135 billion in 1999, and $161 billion in the year 2000. 
My point is that at the end of this timeframe of 1997, through the year 2000, our outlays will have been a little over $7 trillion, our interest will have been just under $1 trillion--$997 billion. Our deficit that we are adding would be $450 billion. 
So, if you look at where we are today, at the end of this year our national debt is at $5.4 trillion. By the end of the year 2000, the national debt will be $6.3 trillion. 
So the increase in the national debt in the Clinton administration for roughly 8 years is projected to be $2.2 trillion. 
The significance of these figures is a bit startling, but the reality is if we were not strangled by $1 trillion in interest on the national debt in the next 4 years, we could run a surplus and we could give every American family a $2,500-per-child tax credit, not the $500 that is in the Republican proposal but $2,500. Or we could give every American family a $1,500-per-child tax credit and every American citizen a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. Or give every American a 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. 
That is the significance of the necessity of this legislation which will take away deficit financing and allow us to develop a surplus, do away with the interest and get a hold of this continuing national debt which does not go away until we reduce the deficit. 
Some say, well, why do we need a constitutional amendment to do it? My answer is rather simplistic, Mr. President. We have not had the self-discipline to do it ourselves. We could do it ourselves, but it has not been done. 
I say to my colleagues who have any doubt about the wisdom of this amendment: The evidence is overwhelming that without the discipline of a constitutional amendment, elected officials are incapable of fiscal management of the people's business, and it has taken the last 64 years to demonstrate this fact. 
Some say we can balance the budget without this amendment. I say, OK, prove it. There is nothing within our post-Depression experience to suggest that this is even remotely possible. Eight years out of 64 years with surpluses totaling $33 billion is hardly evidence that convinces me. Quite the contrary. It proves to me that we must have this amendment if we are ever going to end deficit spending as business as usual in Washington, DC. 
Mr. President, the first 10 amendments to our Constitution, collectively known as the Bill of Rights, are the seminal protections afforded citizens in a free society. They were adopted against the backdrop of the 17th and 18th century tyranny that the kings arbitrarily exercised over their subjects. 
The Founders knew that these rights--the freedom of speech, religion, and assembly--would not be guaranteed simply by congressional statute, for what one Congress grants, another can easily take away. That is why these fundamental rights are enshrined within our Constitution. That is why the concept of a balanced budget must also be added to the Constitution, for the evidence shows without any doubt that in this modern era of government, the President and Congress are simply incapable of balancing the budget except perhaps in rare and unique circumstances. 
When future historians review the history of 20th century American Government, I fear that the legacy we will leave behind will be an enormous debt that we have passed on to the citizens of the 21st century. When this new century opens in just 3 years, we will have accumulated a debt of more than $6 trillion, the carrying costs, as I have indicated, of which will be a quarter trillion dollars annually. 
Who is going to pay off that debt? Well, consider, Mr. President, that the largest surplus this Government has ever run was a mere $11 billion in 1948. In inflation adjusted dollars, that is equivalent to a surplus today of approximately $84 billion. 
If, starting in the year 2000, we could replicate our 1948 experience and have an annual surplus of $84 billion, the national debt of the United States would not be eliminated until the year 2073. That gives you some idea of the legacy we are passing on. 
In other words, under the most optimistic circumstances, the citizens who are alive for the first 75 years of the next century will be shackled with paying the debts their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents accumulated. And we all know it is unlikely we will sustain such large surpluses throughout the next century. More likely, it will take 100 years or more to pay off this debt, only if we start now. 
Can there be anyone in this Chamber who believes that the citizens in America who will be alive in the year 2097 ought to be 
saddled with paying the interest on the debt that we are accumulating today--money, I might add, that is not being used to finance long-term investments or jobs or inventory in this country but money that is being used to pay interest on the national debt. 
That is right; that is what we are doing. 
In my view, this amendment is an economic bill of rights for future generations of this country. It is equally as important as the Bill of Rights we now take for granted as the foundation for this great Nation. 
It finally will force Government to learn that it cannot borrow indefinitely. It rearranges the rules of Government as never before in our history, for it requires us to face up to the fact that we can only spend as much as we take in in revenues, as we dictate to our private citizens. And it stands for the proposition that building debt on top of debt is morally and fiscally irresponsible to Americans who have not even been born yet. That is what we are doing. 
The legacy of the 105th Congress must be that we, at the end of this century, have recognized the responsibility we have to future generations, that we will no longer buy now and put off paying indefinitely. The time is now to finally stand up and change the way we have been governing for the past 60 years. 
I thank the Chair for its attention. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Stevens, Inouye, Akaka and Thomas, am introducing the Korea Visa Waiver Pilot Project Bill of 1997.' 
This bill addresses the problem of the slow issuance of United States tourist visas to Korean citizens. Koreans typically wait up to 3 weeks to obtain tourist visas from the United States Embassy in Seoul. As a result, most of these spontaneous travelers decide to vacation in one of the other 48 nations that allow them to travel to their country without a visa, including both Canada and New Zealand. 
This legislation provides a carefully controlled pilot program of visa-free travel by small groups of Koreans to the United States. The program seeks to capture the Korean tourism market lost due to the cumbersome visa system. For example, New Zealand experienced a 2,400-percent increase in tourism from Korea after easing its visa requirements in 1993. 
The pilot program is designed to allow visitors in a tour group from South Korea to travel to the United States without a visa for up to 15 days. However, it does not compromise the security standards of the United States. The program would allow selected travel agencies in Korea to issue temporary travel permits based on applicants meeting the same preset standards used by the United States Embassy in Seoul. The travel permits could only be used by supervised tour groups. 
While the pilot project would allow small Korean tour groups to travel to the United States without visas, the project includes many restrictions. These are: 
The Attorney General and Secretary of State can terminate the program if the overstay rates in the program are over 2 percent. 
The stay of the visitors is less than or equal to 15 days. 
The visitors must have a round-trip ticket and arrive by a carrier that agrees to return them if they are deemed inadmissible. 
The Secretary of State should institute a bonding and licensing requirement that each participating travel agency post a substantial performance bond and pay a financial penalty if a tourist fails to return on schedule. 
The on-time return of each tourist in the group would be certified after each tour. 
Security checks will be done to ensure that the visitor is not a safety threat to the United States. 
This legislation's restrictions ensure that the pilot program will be a successful program, and one that I hope will entice more Korean tourists to visit the United States.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of this important resolution which expresses the sense of the Senate that further research is necessary to determine the benefits of mammography in women ages 40 to 49. 
Mr. President, I have been very involved with mammography issues in Alaska and have worked with my wife Nancy to promote access to this important diagnostic tool. I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the work my wife Nancy, and others, has promoted on behalf of the Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska. 
The Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska had its beginnings in 1974 when seven Fairbanks women decided that health care for women, especially in the area of breast cancer, should be made more accessible and less expensive for residents who live in remote areas of Alaska. In 1976, with very humble beginnings, the center opened its doors in Fairbanks, staffed and equipped by volunteers. The State granted the moneys for a GE mammography machine and a local bank loaned the basement of a drive-in branch for the clinic offices. Furniture, carpeting, and paint was donated by local merchants, and a nurse-administrator, radiologist, and two doctors volunteered their services. Breast examination was taught and recommended mammograms were provided free of charge. 
Today, the center, housed in a very spacious office, is staffed by an executive director, two office personnel, a certified mammographer, and a radiologist. The lo-rad mammography machine is one of the finest in the State. The center still maintains the policy of waiving a fee for women who cannot afford to pay or do not have insurance. 
With the unwavering support of the Fairbank community the center has been operating for 20 years with donations, insurance, and fundraisers by local service organizations. 
Three years ago, the executive director informed the board of directors that a new mammography machine was needed to keep up with advancing technology. Nancy and I offered to do a fundraising fishing event in southeastern Alaska to benefit the center. At that first event, Waterfall '94, over $140,000 was raised for the breast cancer center and completely offset the cost of the new state-of-the-art lo-rad mammography unit. 
Because of the overwhelming success of Waterfall '94, we decided to hold a similar event the following year to again benefit the center. Nancy, one of the original founders of the center, had long desired to have a mobile mammogram van to serve the Yukon River system villages, and the rural bush communities of Alaska. Waterfall '95 made that dream come true with a donation of $210,000 to the center. Waterfall '96 will benefit the center with an approximate $240,000 donation. Plans are already in place for the Waterfall '97 event with plans to incorporate prostate PSA tests, and to do cervical cancer checks as well. 
The Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska now visits remote bush villages along the river system and the highways with a 43-foot van equipped with a mammogram unit and darkroom with a film processor, two dressing rooms which double as bunks for the driver and mammography technician, a small reception area, and a bathroom which can accommodate wheelchairs. There is a hydraulic lift for wheelchair entry into the van as well. 
While most American women face a 1-in-9 risk of dying of breast cancer, Alaskan women face a 1-in-7 chance. Among Alaska Native women, cancer is the leading cause of death and breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer. Now there is no reason for these women not to learn about early detection. Julia Roberts, from the small village of Tanana, said it all when she came to the van for her exam. `I know it's important. I know if you catch it early you can probably save your life. I have three children and I want to see my grandchildren.' 
Mr. President, we need more fundamental research on breast cancer. And I strongly support further study to determine the adequacy and effectiveness of mammography for women in the 40-to-49-age bracket.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk for appropriate referral legislation dealing with the several issues of the territories of the United States and the freely associated States. This is legislation that is similar to measures reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources at the end of the last Congress and could not be considered prior to adjournment, although we had managed to work out the text with both the House and the administration. I want to acknowledge the contribution of the staff of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as the Resource Committee in the House as well. 
Section 1 of the legislation proposed will extend the agriculture and food programs that the United States provides for the populations on the atolls in the Marshall Islands affected by the nuclear testing program for an additional 5 years. 
The support program was initiated under the trusteeship and continued under the Compact of Free Association for a limited time period. Unfortunately, the atolls are not yet capable of fully supporting the populations, and an additional extension time is necessary. 
The amendment will also alter the program to reflect changes in population since the effective date of the compact. I visited many of these areas last year and certainly concur with the recommendations in section 1. 
Section 2 of the legislation would repeal a provision of law dealing with the American Memorial Park in Saipan that would permit the government of the Commonwealth to take over the park. While I think some transfer could be considered of the marina area if the Commonwealth were interested, I think that the actual war memorial and interpretive areas should remain under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service during the remainder of the lease. 
Section 3 of the legislation makes a series of technical amendments to permit each of the three educational institutions in the freely associated States to operate independently as land grant institutions rather than having to operate as a College of Micronesia. 
I visited that college and was very impressed with the dedication and the commitment of those who were responsible for education as well as the people of the area. They are very proud of that institution. I can tell you, Mr. President, there is a tremendous sacrifice being made to foster higher education in the College of Micronesia. 
These amendments, as we propose, reflect the new status of the representative Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands and were requested by the President of the College of Micronesia-FSM when Senator Akaka and I visited the campus last year. 
Section 4, hopefully, will resolve a different issue and one that is difficult for Guam relating to the disposal of real property that the Department of Defense no longer needs for military purposes. These lands were acquired by the United States for defense purposes after World War II when Guam had been liberated from occupation by Japan and while Guam was a closed defense area. 
We have the residents of Guam and their attitude where they have indicated that they are prepared to support the Federal Government of the United States as they are a territory, but did so with the expectation--in other words, the people of Guam expected that those lands, if no longer needed for defensive purposes, would be returned to either public or private ownership in Guam. 
The Department of Defense presently owns about one-third of Guam, although we have been able to return several parcels over the past few years. As part of the discussion on the Commonwealth, the administration had agreed to similar general transfer language, but when we considered this legislation last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service testified in opposition. The Fish and Wildlife Service, in testifying in opposition, said that they had a desire to acquire some portions for a wildlife refuge. 
I am going to talk a little bit about the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services' interest in acquiring this refuge because I think there is a lack of continuity that deserves some examination. 
I am not going to go into the curious presentation from the Service at our hearing or the question that they are unwilling to expend any of their own money on the eradication of the brown snake, which has virtually overrun the island, but only note they were able to block any agreement on land transfer previously. 
What I am proposing this year is a general transfer authorization for all lands except those within the proposed overlay that would be a refuge overlay that are identified on a map that is subject to transfer only by statute. That, hopefully, will release the other lands to Guam. 
No specific disposition is recommended for the other lands, and Congress will consider them on a parcel-by-parcel basis as they become surplus to defensive needs. This will allow both Guam and the Fish and Wildlife Service to make their case, assuming both want the lands, or anyone else. 
I note that Congress, not the Executive, has the plenary authority under the Constitution to deal with territories and with the disposal of Federal properties. So it is appropriate that Congress--Congress--decide on the disposition of these lands when the time is right. And I think the time is right. The people of Guam have waited long enough. 
I also note that this is the only method I can think of that will guarantee the Government of Guam an opportunity to participate in the process. I hope that the administration will support the public process. 
One of the inconsistencies here in this land that is in dispute, approximately 2,000 acres that is held by the Department of Defense--clearly the defensive requirements are no longer pertinent that necessitate the Department of Defense 
to hold this land. So it is basically surplus land. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in its interest in acquiring the land, the rationale is to protect the various species on the island and maintain a natural habitat. Some of the species may be facing endangerment. 
The inconsistency here is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's inability to address what is eradicating many of the species that are in decline and may be in danger. That is the brown snake. The island is virtually overrun with the brown snake. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuses to initiate any action to eradicate the brown snake, which is really causing the decline in various other species that are unique to the island. 
So I think it is fair to say that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been somewhat irresponsible in its obligation to address the perpetrator causing the decline of the various birdlife on Guam and other species because the ferociousness of the brown snake is such that it has really taken over the island. And they refuse to spend any of their own money. 
I had an opportunity to visit with the Governor of Guam. We had an evening at his residence. He brought several of the brown snakes in cages and gave us a little rundown of what the brown snakes were doing in overrunning Guam and the inability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to meet its obligation to address any type of control, of predator-type control, to reduce and eliminate this. 
So I think it is fair to say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has had its opportunity. They cannot justify taking land and just holding it in a habitat without addressing their obligation to try to enhance the species native to Guam by eradicating the brown snake. So until they come up with some kind of realistic program, I do not have much sympathy for their claim for further land. 
I think this land should go to the Commonwealth of Guam and be disposed of under the legislative jurisdiction by the elected people of Guam and get on with it. I intend to pursue that with a great deal of energy to ensure that we see that land transferred over to Guam for their disposition and designation as they see fit. I think they are the most appropriate ones to address some procedure relative to the concern of the brown snake and its continued expansion over the land mass of Guam. 
Section 5 of the legislation--I might add further, the Fish and Wildlife Service testified last year that they had 18 listed species on Guam. I am told that three are extinct and five more no longer occur on Guam. At the rate that the Fish and Wildlife Service is dealing with the brown snake, this will be probably the only refuge dedicated to an extinct species. 
I think that says something about the stewardship of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with regard to the unique species that were native to Guam, and now the brown snake has taken over and that seems to be taking care of whatever is left. But the Fish and Wildlife Service continues to, I think, neglect its responsibility. 
Moving on, section 5 of the legislation, Mr. President, makes a technical change in statutes dealing with drug enforcement to provide equal treatment for all the territories as we contemplated when the original act passed. 
Section 6 of the legislation would make two changes to the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands. The first would authorize the issuance of parity rather than priority bonds secured by the Rum fund--an authority generally available in the States; and the second would provide that the Governor would retain his authority when absent from the territory on official business, which is often the case. 
Section 7 of the legislation provides for an economic study commission for the Virgin Islands. I think the idea of a study on what the future holds is important and timely. I want to emphasize that I want this commission to focus directly and quickly on realistic economic alternatives that are helpful to the Virgin Islands and the Congress and not produce a theoretical tome to gather dust on a shelf. 
Section 8 clarifies the availability of assistance from the Public Health Service in the radiation related medical surveillance and treatment programs provided under section 177(b) of the Compact of Free Association in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to persons directly exposed as a result of the nuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands. 
We observed those areas when we were over there last year, as well as meeting with the people. I think this is an appropriate action. 
Section 9 would clarify that residents of the freely associated States who are lawfully admitted to the United States under the Compact of Free Association are eligible for assistance under certain programs. This assistance had been provided before the effective date of the Compact under the Trusteeship and subsequently until a particularly strained and convoluted interpretation by attorneys who demonstrated a questionable familiarity with English created a problem. As usual, the answer was that the interpretation didn't make a lot of sense and was contrary to past practice, but if Congress disagreed, it could clarify the law. Well I disagree and this language should clarify the law. One problem that was raised is that under current law, aliens are given a preference over United States citizens and that creates inequities in small areas like Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The answer, of course, is to treat residents of the freely associated States like United States citizens, not to fabricate a legal opinion to deny them benefits altogether. Section 9 would provide equal but not preferential treatment, and I think that is fully in line with our intent under the Compact in encouraging residents of the freely associated States to come to the United States for work and study. 
Section 10 would provide the consent of the United States to two amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as required by the Admissions Act for the State of Hawaii. This language was requested by the administration and is supported by the Hawaii delegation and I'm pleased to say by my colleagues, Senators Inouye and Akaka. 
Section 11 would provide for an economic study commission for American Samoa similar to that provided for the Virgin Islands. Like the Virgin Islands Commission, the Secretary of the Interior will be a voting member ex officio in recognition of his responsibilities. Given the unique cultural situation in American Samoa and the importance of land tenure and Matai rights, three of the seven members of the commission will come from nominations by the Governor. Unlike the Virgin Islands, American Samoa still relies on annual appropriations for both operations and infrastructure, and the commission is directed to focus on the needs in those areas over the next decade and look to ways to minimize that dependence. As part of its report, the commission is directed to provide an historical overview of the relationship between American Samoa and the United States and include copies of relevant documents in an appendix to the report. I want to emphasize that this is an overview and I do not want the commission to depart from its focus on what economic opportunities exist to replicate scholarly studies. There are certain constraints on economic development in American Samoa as a result of its status outside the customs territory of the United States, for example, and that needs to be noted. 
Mr. President, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources plans to hold a hearing on this legislation on February 6. I hope to be able to report the measure and have it considered by the Senate prior to the February recess. I hope that the administration will support this measure, although I know they dislike commissions and studies. I am not a great fan of them either, but from time to time a fresh look at a problem can be useful. I do not want these commissions to go beyond their limited life and I want them to produce something useful. I hope the administration will agree with the unique circumstances surrounding these provisions and the need for them. 
and recognize the obligation that we have to these areas under the Organic Act of Guam and the revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands and the Compact of Free Association Act that mandates an oversight and continued responsibility by the Federal Government.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last summer the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a ruling that confirmed something that many of us already understood. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide a safe, centralized storage place for our Nation's spent fuel and nuclear waste, beginning less than 1 year from today. 
This is a commitment that Congress and the Department of Energy made 15 years ago. We have collected $12 billion from the American ratepayers for this purpose. But, after spending some $6 billion, the Federal Government is still not prepared to deliver on its promise to take and safely dispose of our Nation's nuclear waste by 1998. Hardworking Americans have paid for this as part of their monthly electric bill. They simply have not gotten any results. 
So a lawsuit was filed and the court confirmed that there is, indeed, a legal obligation as well as a moral one. We have reached a crossroads. The job of fixing this program and this injustice is ours. The time for fixing the program is now. 
Today in this country, high-level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear fuel is accumulating at over 80 sites in 41 States, including waste stored at the Department of Energy's weapon facilities. It is stored in populated areas near our neighbors, near our neighborhoods, near our schools, on the shores of our lakes and rivers, in the backyards of constituents young and old across this land. Used nuclear fuel is being stored near the east and west coasts where most Americans live, maybe in your town and near your neighborhood. Used fuel is being stored in pools that were not designated for long-term storage. 
Some of this fuel is already over 30 years old. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue storage of this used fuel at each of these sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to let this dangerous radioactive material continue to accumulate in more than 80 sites all across the country, in 41 States. It is unwise to block the safe storage of this used fuel in a remote area away from high populations. It is a national problem that requires a coordinated national solution. 
Yesterday, on behalf of myself and 19 other cosponsors, I introduced the exact text of S. 1936 from the 104th Congress as S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This legislation was passed by the Senate last summer by a vote of 63 to 37. It sets forth a program that will allow the Department of Energy to meet its obligations as soon as humanly possible.

Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last summer, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a ruling that confirmed something that many of us already understood: the Federal Government has an obligation to provide a safe, centralized storage place for our Nation's spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, beginning less than 1 year from today. 
This is a commitment that Congress, and the Department of Energy, made 15 years ago. We've collected $12 billion from America's ratepayers for this purpose.

Hardworking Americans have paid for this as part of their monthly electric bill. But they haven't gotten results. So a lawsuit was filed, and the court confirmed that there is a legal obligation, as well as a moral one. We have reached a crossroads. The job of fixing this program is ours. The time for fixing the program is now. 
Today, high-level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear fuel is accumulating at over 80 sites in 41 States, including waste stored at DOE weapons facilities. It is stored in populated areas, near our neighborhoods and schools, on the shores of our lakes and rivers, in the backyard of constituents young and old all across this land. Used nuclear fuel is being stored near the east and west coasts, where most Americans live. It may be in your town. Near your neighborhood. 
Unfortunately, used fuel is being stored in pools that were not designed for long-term storage. Some of this fuel is already over 30 years old. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue storage of this used fuel at each of these sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to let this dangerous radioactive material continue to accumulate at more than 80 sites all across the country. It is unwise to block the safe storage of this used fuel in a remote area, away from high populations. This is a national problem that requires a coordinated, national solution. 
Today, on behalf of myself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Grams, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Helms, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Mack, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bond, Mr. Robert Smith, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Jeffords, I introduce the text of S. 1936, from the 104th Congress, as the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This legislation, which was passed by the Senate last summer by a 63-to-37 vote, sets forth a program that will allow the Department of Energy to meet its obligation as soon as possible. The bill provides for an integrated system to manage used fuel from commercial nuclear powerplants and high-level radioactive waste from DOE's nuclear weapons facilities. The integrated system includes construction and operation of a temporary storage center, a safe transportation network to transfer these byproducts, and continuing scientific studies at Yucca Mountain, NV, to determine if it is a suitable repository site. 
During floor consideration of S. 1936 last year, we received many constructive suggestions for improving the bill. The final version of S. 1936 passed by the Senate incorporated many of these changes. The most important provisions of the bill include: 
Role for EPA: The bill provides that the Environmental Protection Agency shall issue standards for the protection of the public from releases of radioactive materials from a permanent nuclear waste repository. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is required to base its licensing determination on whether the repository can be operated in accordance with EPA's radiation protection standards. 
National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA]: The bill complies fully with NEPA by requiring two full environmental impact statements, one in advance of operation of the temporary storage facility and one in advance of repository licensing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The bill provides that where Congress has statutorily determined need, location, and size of the facilities, these issues need not be reconsidered. 
Transportation routing: The bill includes language of an amendment offered by Senator Moseley-Braun, which provides that, in order to ensure that spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste is transported safely, the Secretary of Energy will use transportation routes that minimize, to the maximum practicable extent, transportation through populated and sensitive 
environmental areas. The language also requires that the Secretary develop, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, a comprehensive management plan that ensures the safe transportation of these materials. 
Transportation requirements: The bill contains language clarifying that transportation of spent fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act shall be governed by all requirements of Federal, State, and local governments and Indian tribes to the same extent that any person engaging in transportation in interstate commerce must comply with those requirements, as provided by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. The bill also requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance and funds for training to unions with experience with safety training for transportation workers. In addition, the bill clarifies that existing employee protections in title 49 of the United States Code concerning the refusal to work in hazardous conditions apply to transportation under this act. Finally, S. 1936 provides authority for the Secretary of Transportation to establish training standards, as necessary, for workers engaged in the transportation of spent fuel and high-level waste. 
Interim storage facility: In order to ensure that the size and scope of the interim storage facility is manageable in the context of the overall nuclear waste program, and yet adequate to address the Nation's immediate spent fuel storage needs, the bill would limit the size of phase I of the interim storage facility to 15,000 metric tons of spent fuel and the size of phase II of the facility to 40,000 metric tons. Phase II of the facility would be expandable to 60,000 metric tons if the Secretary fails to meet his projected goals with regard to licensing of the permanent repository site. 
Preemption of other laws: The bill provides that, if any law does not conflict with the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and the Atomic Energy Act, that law will govern. State and local laws are preempted only if those laws are inconsistent with or duplicative of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or the Atomic Energy Act. This language is consistent with the preemption authority found in the existing Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. 
Finally, the bill contains bipartisan language that was drafted to address the administration's objections to the siting of an interim facility at the 
Nevada test site before the viability assessment of the Yucca Mountain permanent repository site was available: The language provides that construction shall not begin on an interim storage facility at Yucca Mountain before December 31, 1998. The bill provides for the delivery of an assessment of the viability of the Yucca Mountain site to the President and Congress by the Secretary 6 months before the construction can begin on the interim facility. If, based upon the information before him, the President determines, in his discretion, that Yucca Mountain is not suitable for development as a repository, then the Secretary shall cease work on both the interim and permanent repository programs at the Yucca Mountain site. The bill further provides that, if the President makes such a determination, he shall have 18 months to designate an interim storage facility site. If the President fails to designate a site, or if a site he has designated has not be approved by Congress within 2 years of his determination, the Secretary is instructed to construct an interim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain site. This provision ensures that the construction of an interim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain site will not occur before the President and Congress have had an ample opportunity to review the technical assessment of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a permanent repository and to designate an alternative site for interim storage based upon that technical information. However, this provision also ensures that, ultimately, an interim storage facility site will be chosen. Without this assurance, we leave open the possibility we will find in 1998 that we have no interim storage, no permanent repository program and, after more than 15 years and $6 billion spent, that we are back to where we started in 1982 when we passed the first version of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. 
During the debate that will unfold, we will have the Senators from Nevada oppose the bill with all the arguments that they can muster. That's understandable. They are merely doing what Nevadans have asked them to do. Nobody wants nuclear waste in their State, but it has to go somewhere. Both Senators from Nevada are friends of mine. We've talked about this issue at length. They are doing what they feel they must do to satisfy Nevadans. But as U.S. Senators, we must sometimes take a national perspective. We must do what's best for the country as a whole. 
No one can continue to pretend that there is an unlimited amount of time to deal with this problem. The Federal Government must act--and act now--to ensure that there is a safe and secure place to put radioactive waste it is obligated to accept. 
Although the court did not address the issue of remedies, the court was very clear that DOE has an obligation to take spent nuclear fuel in 1998, whether or not a repository is ready. 
So far, DOE's only response to the court's decision has been to send out a letter asking for suggestions on how it can meet its obligation to take spent fuel in 1998. Finally, it is clear that we all agree on the question. Now is the time for answers. 
We have a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have one remote, safe, and secure nuclear waste storage facility. Or through inaction and delay, we can face an uncertain judicial remedy which will almost certainly be costly, and which is unlikely to actually move waste out of America's backyards. 
It is not morally right to shirk our responsibility to protect the environment and the future of our children and grandchildren. We cannot wait until 1998 to decide whether the Department of Energy will store this nuclear waste. We have received letters from 23 State Governors and attorneys general, including Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin, urging the Congress to pass, and the President to sign, a bill that provides for an interim storage site in Nevada. Congress must speak now and provide the means to build one, safe and monitored facility at the Nevada test site, a unique site so remote that the Government used it to explode nuclear weapons for 50 years, or another site designated by the President and Congress. 
The time is now--the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 is the answer.
