   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, I want to take this opportunity to comment about several of the provisions included in the bill. This bill contains many important health care provisions affecting both Medicare providers and Medicare beneficiaries. Accordingly, I am delighted that a final agreement has been reached with the White House on these provisions and that the measure is now ready for passage. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for his leadership and persistence over the past several months in moving this critically important legislation. On a personal note, I would be remiss if I did not say that I will miss my colleague and good friend BILL ROTH. I am very sorry that he will not be returning to the next Congress to continue the work on which he has labored for so many years.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan is correct. Additionally, as my colleagues are aware, the bill reauthorized the operation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and established and reinforced penalties for illegal manufacture, sale, and possession of certain illicit drugs.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as Senator LEVIN knows, the DATA bill includes a provision similar to one applicable for many years to both the Medicaid and Medicare programs, which makes clear that basic decisions about the way medicine is practiced are to be made by physicians and patients, not by the federal government.

   Mr. HATCH. I certainly agree with that. Indeed, such an interpretation is expressly prohibited by the language: ``Nothing in such regulations or practice guidelines may authorize any Federal official or employee to exercise supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided.''

   Mr. HATCH. I do agree wholeheartedly. I feel compelled to add, however, that as the Chairman of the Committee of jurisdiction, it was important to me to make certain that the bill in no way impedes the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] from vigorously enforcing the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, the DATA legislation is not intended to prevent the DEA from its historic role of prosecuting physicians for dispensing controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to offer my public thanks and appreciation to the Judiciary Committee's chief counsel and staff director, Manus Cooney, for all his dedicated work over the last 7 years he has served on my staff, and for his exemplary 12-year career in the Senate. 
   Manus has been my right hand. I want to state that for the RECORD so that 10 years from now his daughters--Caitlin, Claire, and Tara--will know why their father was hardly ever home for dinner. Let me say to them that, without his tremendous efforts, we could not have accomplished half as much for our country. 
   Let me also say to my colleagues that I know Manus was tenacious. Senators and staff alike always took it seriously when Manus was on a mission. Believe me, I got as many orders and assignments as you did. 
   Seriously, though, it was amazing to me how Manus always kept the faith--he believed in what we were doing and never gave up. 
   I am going to miss him. He will be leaving my office at the end of the year for a new, exciting opportunity to develop corporate strategy and to head Napster's new Washington office. He is the right guy for this job. He has the energy and the know-how to help Congress understand and connect with the complex and rapidly changing high-tech world. Manus is the kind of person who does not face the challenges of an unknown future with dread, but rather with enthusiasm. 
   So, as we close out this extraordinary 106th Congress, I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing appreciation to Manus for his loyalty and his tremendous contribution to the Senate and to public service. I wish him all the best in the future.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the Roman statesman, Cicero said ``Memory is the treasury and guardian of all things.'' I believe we as humans often take our ability to remember for granted. Throughout the past century, we have been blessed with many scientific innovations and discoveries. Large strides have been made in the medical area that have helped to improve the quality of life for all the people of the world. Memory is an essential function of our human experience. The loss of memory is certainly a tragedy. Thankfully, there are those who are conducting research who endeavor to understand the memory process and seek to solve memory disorders and loss. For instance, last year Congress appropriated $17.7 billion to the National Institutes of Health to fund scientific research. A portion of that funding is used for studies working to gain a better understanding of memory.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this consumer bankruptcy reform legislation is one of the most important legislative efforts to reform the bankruptcy laws in decades. I thank my distinguished friend and colleague from Iowa for his hard work on this, of course, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, and so many others, Senator BIDEN from Delaware. There are many others as well. 
   This is important. Before talking about the substance of the legislation, I personally thank the majority leader who has worked hard and tirelessly to keep this legislation on track despite the many obstacles that it has faced--I have to say phony obstacles at that. 
   Thanks to the majority leaders's commitment to moving this legislation, we now find ourselves in a position to weed out many of the abuses in the bankruptcy system and also to enhance consumer protection. 
   I also acknowledge and thank the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, who has worked with me and Senator GRASSLEY and others to reach agreement on many of the bill's provisions. 
   Most of all, I commend the original authors of the legislation, Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI, chairman and ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, respectively, for their hard work in crafting this much needed legislation and for their unrelenting commitment to making the development and passage of this bill a bipartisan process. 
   As I have mentioned, my praise also goes to Senator SESSIONS and Senator BIDEN, who have shown unwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this bill, and to the many other Members of the Senate for their hard work and cooperation. 
   I was deeply troubled by a comment made on the floor yesterday by a colleague from the other side of the aisle to the effect that this bill was written by Republicans and is being forced upon Senate Democrats. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am compelled to set the record straight on that point. The entire development of this bill has taken place in a bipartisan manner. In fact, throughout the entire process of consideration of this bill, beginning as long ago as the drafting stage, numerous changes suggested by the minority have been made. 
   It is no secret that in the informal conference process, we worked together with Senate Democrats. And with rare exception, the provisions that are contained in the final conference product were agreed to and were done with the full bipartisan cooperation and support of the Senate negotiators. Furthermore, in an effort to reach a bipartisan agreement and address concerns of the White House, we took issues that were important to many of us on the Republican side off the table. 
   For example, I agreed to remove from consideration a provision I had sought which would have prevented criminal check kiters and counterfeiters from collecting attorney's fees in lawsuits that they bring against debt collectors--I might add, multiple lawsuits that really don't make sense. Many others in the majority also made concessions and a good faith effort to resolve differences and move forward with the long overdue comprehensive bankruptcy reform. 
   Here on the Senate floor, the assertion was made that not a single organization that advocates for kids supported this bill. I simply cannot allow that kind of misrepresentation to stand uncorrected. In fact, there is tremendous support for this legislation from child advocates. 
   Let me give some illustrations. A letter from Laura Kadwell, President of the National Child Support Enforcement Association, representing over 60,000 child support professionals across America:  
   I'm writing to urge you to support the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000. NCSEA is committed to ensuring that both parents fulfill their responsibilities to provide emotional and financial support to their children--including honoring legally-owed child support obligations. The pending legislation will forward this goal significantly.  
   In a letter from Howard Baldwin, President of the Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council, an organization comprised of child support professionals from the private and public sectors west of the Mississippi River:  
   I would like to express our membership's unqualified support.  
   The resolution of the California Family Support Council, consisting of approximately 2,500 persons employed by  county and State agencies which administer the Federal child support program in California:  
   Now therefore be it resolved that the California Family Support Council *.*.* directs the president of the California Family Support Council to convey to the California congressional delegation and to the President its enthusiastic endorsement of the Bankruptcy Reform Bills.  
   How about a letter from Betty D. Montgomery, attorney general of the State of Ohio:  
   As the chief law enforcement officer for [Ohio], I stand committed to protecting our most vulnerable citizens [and this legislation] will further promote the objectives of our state and national child support enforcement program and further ensure that those families in need are protected.  
   A vote for this conference report will mean a vote to stop letting deadbeat parents use bankruptcy to avoid paying child support. It will mean a vote to stop paying lawyers ahead of children who rely on child support. I have worked with Senator TORRICELLI, the National Association of Attorney Generals, and the National Women's Law Center to improve current bankruptcy law with respect to child support and alimony. Currently bankruptcy law is simply not adequate. Frankly, I was outraged to learn of the many ways deadbeat parents were manipulating and abusing the current bankruptcy system in order to get out of paying their domestic support obligations. I am proud of the improvements we are making in this legislation over current law in terms of ensuring that parents meet their child support and other domestic support obligations in bankruptcy. 
   I have worked tirelessly, as others have--those I have mentioned--provision by provision, both last year and this year, to make this conference report one that dramatically improves the position of children and ex-spouses who are entitled to domestic support. No one who actually looks at what the conference report says can in good conscience say that this bill is not a tremendous improvement for children and families over current law. 
   This bill for women and children gives child support first priority status, up from seventh in line, meaning they will be paid ahead of the lawyers, if you can imagine that. It is about time. It makes staying current on child support a condition of discharge. It makes debt discharge in bankruptcy conditional upon full payment of past due child support and alimony. It makes domestic support obligations automatically nondischargeable without the cost of litigation. It prevents bankruptcy from holding up child custody, visitation and domestic violence cases. And it helps avoid administrative roadblocks to get kids the support they need. 
   It is a very important set of changes, without which we are going to be abusing children in the law. 
   That is not all. The conference report makes more improvements over current law for women and children. This chart shows that. It makes the payment of child support arrears a condition of plan confirmation. It provides better notice and more information for easier child support collection. It provides help in tracking down deadbeats. It allows for claims against a deadbeat parent's properties. It allows for the payment of child support with interest by those with means. And it facilitates wage withholding to collect child support from deadbeat parents. It does all of that. 
   I am also happy to say that the conference report prevents deadbeats from using the automatic stay in bankruptcy to avoid paying their support obligations. The bankruptcy reform stops deadbeat parents from abusing the automatic stay. 
   The conference report prevents deadbeats from using bankruptcy's automatic stay to avoiding child support with this legislation. 
   The automatic stay cannot be used to put a hold on the interception of a deadbeat parent's tax refund to pay support. 
   The automatic stay cannot be used to prevent the reporting of overdue support owed by deadbeat parents to any consumer reporting agency. 
   The automatic stay cannot be used to prevent the withholding, suspension, or restriction of driver's licenses, professional and occupational licenses, and recreational licenses when deadbeats default on domestic support obligations. 
   And suspending the driver's license of the deadbeat parent can be a very effective way of getting them to pay the child support they owe. 
   This is important stuff. It has taken lot of time to get this done. We will pass this bill. But if the administration doesn't accept this bill and it winds up vetoing it, it will be a tragedy. 
   These are just a few of the many improvements the conference report makes in this area as compared with current law. 
   I have had a long history of advocating for children and families in Congress and throughout my legal career. I support a conference report that puts child support first in line ahead of the lawyer's fees and that doesn't let debtors who owe child support turn their backs on children when they file for bankruptcy. 
   In another provision I authored, the conference report protects for the first time in bankruptcy education savings accounts set up by parents and grandparents for their children and grandchildren. 
   All things considered, it is pretty simple. A vote for this conference report is a vote for our Nation's kids. 
   Just look at the bankruptcy consumer provisions. A vote for this conference report is a vote for consumers. The legislation includes a whole host of new consumer protections that do not exist under current law, such as: 
   New disclosure by creditors and more judicial oversight of reaffirmation of agreements to protect people from being pressured into onerous agreements; 
   A debtors' bill of rights to prevent the bankruptcy mills from preying upon those who are uninformed of their rights; 
   New consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act, such as required disclosure regarding minimum monthly payments and introductory rates for credit carts; 
   Penalties on creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy; 
   Penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit plan payments in bankruptcy; 
   Credit counseling programs to help avoid the cycle of indebtedness; 
   Protection of educational savings accounts; and 
   Equal protection for retirement savings in bankruptcy. 
   You can't look at this bill and what it means to people in this country without realizing that this is a step forward. 
   A vote for this legislation is also a vote for families by preventing wealthy people from continuing to abuse the system at the expense of everyone else. 
   Under the current system, people with high incomes can run up massive debts and then use bankruptcy to get out of honoring 
   them. All of us end up paying for the unscrupulous who abuse the system. In fact, it has been estimated that every American family pays $550 a year in a hidden taxes as a result of these abusers. This legislation helps eliminate this hidden tax by implementing a means test to make wealthy people who can repay their debts honor them. 
   Let me make one thing absolutely clear. The poor are not affected by the means test. In fact, the legislation provides a safe harbor for those who fall below the median income. So they are not subjected to the means test at all. Again, only those above the median income are affected, and the means test could not deny anyone bankruptcy relief. It just requires those who have the means to repay their debts, based on their income, to do so. It is that simple. 
   A vote for the conference report also is a vote to stop allowing a few wealthy individuals to abuse the homestead exemption. The conference report tackles the problem of the homestead exemption. Although rare, that problem is offensive to those of us who work hard to make good on our debts. 
   The conference report reaches a compromise which targets the major abuse of bankruptcy by those who move to States with generous homestead exemptions purely in order to file bankruptcy and keep an expensive home. Although this reform provision does not go as far as some of us would like, without it we are back to business as usual with no improvement to current law at all. 
   A vote for this conference report is also a vote for families who work to  save for retirement. I mentioned earlier that the conference report contains my provision to provide equal treatment for retirement savings plans in bankruptcy. For example, the retirement savings of teachers and church workers are clearly given the protection in bankruptcy as much as everyone else. They deserve nothing less. 
   A vote for the conference report is a vote for our country farmers and the men and women who work hard every day in the face of many challenges. Without this reform package, family farmers lose out on the special bankruptcy protections they need in chapter 12. 
   I urge my colleagues to think for a moment about the children, the consumers, families, and farmers who will end up getting hurt if comprehensive bankruptcy reform is not enacted this year. I urge my colleagues to support and cast a vote for them and to support this bankruptcy reform. 
   I also urge the President of the United States to sign this bankruptcy reform into law.

   Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for his very intelligent question. There is no question that this bill will make dramatic changes in bankruptcy laws to the benefit of children, parents, families, farmers--just name them--in large measure because of the work of the distinguished Senators, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. TORRICELLI, and others, including our ranking member Senator LEAHY, and especially the distinguished Senator from Alabama. 
   The distinguished Senator from Alabama has been here just long enough to show how effective he is and what a perfect job he has done on the Judiciary Committee. I personally compliment the Senator. He has played a significant and noble role in this bill, as have others, but, in particular, I consider him one of the best lawyers, one of the best legal practitioners in this whole body. I am very proud of the work the Senator and so many others have done on this bill, without which it would have been much tougher for me as chairman of the committee. This bill has made a true difference in the lives of the children of this country. 
   If we don't have this bill put on the law books of this country, families, children, farmers, consumers, and others are going to be drastically hurt. Yes, no bill is absolutely perfect, but we have too many people at cross-purposes. But we have worked every day this bill has been in existence with our colleagues on the other side. That is why we have a number of them who are willing to support this bill, not only willing but enthusiastically do so. 
   We couldn't have come this far without the work of the distinguished Senator from Alabama. I have great respect for the Senator and I am grateful he is on the floor today. I am grateful the Senator is one of the people who is helping to make the case for this bill. There are good people on both sides of the aisle, good people who understand these important matters, good people who know that children are a focal point of much of this bill. 
   I thank the Senator for his question.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that H.R. 2415 is one of the most important legislative efforts to reform the bankruptcy laws in decades. 
   I would like to express my thanks to the people who have worked on this legislation. First, I want to acknowledge the Majority Leader, who has worked diligently to keep this legislation on its course. Thanks to his commitment to moving this legislation, we are in a position to eliminate the abuses in the current bankruptcy system, while at the same time, enhance consumer protections. 
   I also want to acknowledge the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, who has worked with me to reach agreement on many of the bill's provisions. In addition, I want to commend my colleagues, Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI, the Chairman and ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, respectively, for their hard work in crafting this much needed legislation, and for their unrelenting commitment to making the development and passage of this bill a bipartisan process. My thanks also goes to Senator SESSIONS and Senator BIDEN, who have shown unwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this bill; and the many other members of the Senate for their hard work and cooperation. 
   The compelling need for this reform is highlighted by the large number of bankruptcy filings we have seen over the past several years, which are particularly troubling because they have occurred during a time of relative prosperity for our Nation. Mr. President, the bankruptcy system was intended to provide a ``fresh start'' for those who truly need it. During the process of developing this legislation, I have remained committed to preserving a bankruptcy system that will allow those individuals to emerge from severe financial hardship. At the same time, I believe that individuals should take personal responsibility for their debts and repay them if they are able to do so. I believe the complete elimination of debt should be reserved for those who truly cannot repay their debts, not for those who simply choose not to repay. 
   This bipartisan legislation, authored by Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI, is carefully structured to achieve an appropriate balance between the rights and responsibilities of both debtors and creditors. If enacted, it will enable those truly in need of a fresh start to get one, and at the same time, reform current law to prevent the system from being abused at the expense of honest, hard-working Americans. Mr. President, again I would like to applaud the bipartisan efforts of my colleagues who have made this a broadly-supported bill that removes some of the abuses of the current bankruptcy system 
   while enhancing consumer protections. 
   I am particularly proud of the great strides this legislation makes in improving current law. The legislation includes my provision to prevent deadbeat parents from using bankruptcy to avoid paying child support. It includes my provision to protect educational savings accounts that parents and grandparents set up for their children and grandchildren. And, it includes my provision that ensures that the retirement savings of teachers and church workers are given the same protection in bankruptcy as everyone else. It includes my provision that prevents violent criminals and drug traffickers from taking advantage of bankruptcy at the expense of their victims. Specifically, when these criminals voluntarily file for bankruptcy, my provision protects victims by allowing them to move for dismissal of the bankruptcy case. The legislation also includes my provision that is designed to curb fraud in bankruptcy filings by putting in place new procedures and providing new resources to enhance enforcement of bankruptcy fraud laws. My provision requires (1) that bankruptcy courts develop procedures for referring suspected fraud in bankruptcy schedules to the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for investigation and prosecution and (2) that the Attorney General designate one Assistant U.S. Attorney and one FBI agent in each judicial district as having primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting fraud in bankruptcy. 
   I would like to take a moment to acknowledge a few people who have worked very hard on this legislation. On my staff, I particularly would like to thank the Committee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Manus Cooney, the counsels who worked diligently on this measure, Makan Delrahim, Rene Augustine and Kyle Sampson, and staff assistant Katie Stahl. On Senator LEAHY's Committee staff, I want to recognize Minority Chief Counsel Bruce Cohen, along with counsel Ed Pagano. On the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, I would like to thank John McMickle and Kolan Davis, counsels to Senator GRASSLEY, and Jennifer Leach, counsel to Senator TORRICELLI, for their tireless efforts and input. My thanks also goes to Ed Haden and Sean Costello, counsels to Senator SESSIONS. I also would like to express my gratitude to Senate Legislative Counsel, and in particular I want to recognize Laura Ayoud of that office, whose hard work made this bill a better product. Without the dedication and efforts of these loyal public servants, the important reforms in this legislation would not have been possible. Thank you.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the end of December, one of my charter staff members will be retiring. Joyce Newton has been on my staff since I took office as the Senator from Utah in January 1977. 
   As a freshman Senator, I was the beneficiary of Joyce's decade of previous experience as a caseworker for former Representatives Frank Horton and John Conlan and as a staffer at the Office of Management and Budget. 
   But, during these last 24 years, Joyce has helped countless Utahns with Social Security snafus, international adoptions, military transfers, and a whole host of other special needs and problems. Joyce has always been there to offer a sympathetic ear or to jump start a slow or reluctant bureaucracy. 
   Joyce has been known to come to the office in the wee hours of the morning in order to telephone an embassy halfway around the globe. 
   She has been known to telephone the same Federal caseworker three times in one day just to make sure a constituent's application was not buried under another pile of work resulting in a needless delay or missed deadline. 
   She has been known to go to bat for constituents even when the grounds for their congressional appeals were shaky. 
   And, Joyce has been tenacious. She has pursued cases as far as she could. If we were unsuccessful in resolving a constituent problem, it was never for lack of trying--it was only for lack of more avenues. 
   I remember the ``Books for Bulgaria'' project. How could we get literally hundreds of pounds of books to Bulgaria at little or no cost to be used by a nonprofit organization for educational outreach in that distressed country? This was not an easy problem. Joyce somehow managed to solve it. 
   I remember the young woman from England who needed specialized surgery to cure a rare condition that prevented her from walking. Doctors at the University of Utah had pioneered a new technique not available anywhere else, but various INS rules needed to be sorted out in order for her to come and remain in our country long enough for recovery and rehabilitation. There is a woman able to walk today because Joyce got it done. 
   I have always had complete confidence in Joyce. When she phoned an agency, she was phoning for me. No Senator or Representative can possibly do this work by himself or herself. It takes dedicated, caring, and competent people to work through the various redtape entanglements that often ensnare our citizens. 
   These constituent service staffers too often work in the background. They don't attend signing ceremonies. They don't meet with celebrities or national leaders. They don't have bills and photographs, 
   plaques or certificates on their office walls. Joyce Newton was one of these devoted individuals on Capitol Hill who labored quietly on behalf of the citizens of America. And, she got it done. 
   There are thousands of citizens in my State--seniors, children, service men and women, families, students--who may not remember Joyce Newton's name. But, they will always remember what she did for them. 
   We are sorely going to miss Joyce Newton on the Hatch staff. And, today I want to thank her publicly for all of her dedicated hard work over these last many years and wish her all the best in a much deserved, well-earned retirement.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I pay public tribute to Bob Lockwood, who is finally retiring. I say ``finally'' because he has tried to leave at least twice previously, and I successfully prevailed on him to stay. But, this time, it looks as if he is really going to do it. 
   Bob came to my staff after a long and distinguished career in the Army, serving in many capacities, including in Vietnam and on the Secretary of Defense staff. Bob has many credentials making him unique among military officers. He is a lawyer, an engineer, and an economist. He found an organization--the U.S. Army--where he could put all of these qualifications to work. So, when he wanted to establish a second career in public policy, I benefited from a man who could wear many hats. It will probably take three people to replace him. 
   Bob had the complex portfolios of defense and trade as well as business liaison. The amazing thing is that he is expert in all these areas as well as tenacious and unwilling to let any issue slide. There may be a few people at the Pentagon and at USTR who will cheer his retirement if only because Bob will not be around to bug them. On the other hand, I know firsthand that Bob is universally respected for his knowledge, his integrity, and his professionalism. He has big shoes that will be hard to fill. 
   Over the years, he has helped me to foster business development in Utah, to prepare for the landmark debates we have had on trade, and to protect our great Hill Air Force Base and other military facilities from ill-advised and politically motivated cuts and closures. I will always be grateful for his yeoman effort on these projects. Utah is better off today for his dedication to these major issues. 
   Bob has also turned into a real Utahan during the years he has worked for me. Traveling to our State often during the year, he fell in love with  Utah and the possibilities that abound there. At the end of the month, Bob will go from being my employee to being my constituent. 
   I wish him well as he is taking on the new challenge of retirement, one for which his wife may not be fully prepared. I know Bob to be successful at any project he takes on. I know he will drive his wife nuts if he stays home very much. But he won't. He is one of these guys who really works hard and makes every second of his life count. He is one of my dearest friends, and I love him.

   Mr. HATCH. I also want to say a word about Donna Day. 
   Donna has been on my staff for 15 years. She has been a loyal and efficient staffer, working diligently on data entry. I don't quite know how we will fill the hole left in our correspondence management unit when she retires at the end of the month. 
   If the personnel office at any organization were to write down the attributes of the perfect employee, the list would describe Donna Day. She has worked tirelessly over these 15 years on my behalf. She is never late, rarely absent, and always pleasant. It seems that Donna never has a bad day. We have always been able to count on her day after day, year after year, to do an important job consistently well. And, I don't believe I have ever heard her complain about anything--not even the deluge of letters, cards, faxes, and e-mails we received during some very high profile debates. 
   Frankly, it is hard to imagine walking into our mailroom in January and not seeing her there sorting mail or working at the computer. 
   I have been blessed during my Senate tenure to have had excellent staff, not just in my policy and senior staff positions, but in the support roles as well. Donna has been such a staffer, and I will miss her. 
   I want to thank her for her many contributions to my office, congratulate her on a well-deserved retirement, and wish her all the best as she moves on to the next chapter in her life. 
   I want her to know how much I appreciate her and her colleague Joyce and how much I love and appreciate Bob Lockwood. These people have proven that government workers work above and beyond, that they really make a difference in all of our lives, and that they are part of the reason why many in this country have a quality of life they would not otherwise have. 
   I am so grateful to these three people and for the service they have given to our country, to the Senate, to my constituents. It has been such a privilege to work with them. I say ``with them.'' They never worked for me. They worked for all of us. They worked with me. I don't think I would be nearly as effective had it not been for the work that these three wonderful people have done. I pay personal tribute to them.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be reading from these charts some of the provisions of current law for women and children. We developed these child support provisions with Senators TORRICELLI, DURBIN, and DODD on the Democrat side. We have worked very hard to accommodate both sides. 
   For women and children, we give child support first priority status--up from seventh in line--meaning they will be paid ahead of the lawyers. 
   We make staying current on child support a condition of discharge. 
   We make debt discharge in bankruptcy conditional upon full payment of past due child support and alimony. 
   We make domestic support obligations automatically nondischargeable, without the costs of litigation. 
   We prevent bankruptcy from holding up child custody, visitation, and domestic violence cases. 
   We help avoid administrative roadblocks to get kids the support they need. 
   Those are some of the things we are doing for women and children in this bankruptcy bill. 
   There are more improvements over current law for women and children. 
   We make payment of child support arrears a condition of plan confirmation. 
   We provide better notice and more information for easier child support collection. 
   We provide help in tracking down deadbeats. 
   We allow for claims against deadbeat parents' property. 
   We allow for payment of child support with interest by those with means. 
   We facilitate wage withholding to collect child support from deadbeat parents. 
   We make great strides against deadbeats. 
   Pro-consumer provisions: 
   New disclosures by creditors and more judicial oversight of reaffirmation agreements, to protect them from being pressured into onerous agreements; 
   A debtor's bill of rights, to prevent bankruptcy mills from preying upon those who are uninformed of their rights; 
   New consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act, such as required disclosures regarding minimum monthly payments and introductory rates for credit cards. 
   We provide penalties on creditors who refuse to renegotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy. 
   We have penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit plan payments in bankruptcy. 
   We have credit counseling programs, to help avoid the cycle of indebtedness. 
   We provide protection for educational savings accounts. 
   We give equal protection for retirement savings in bankruptcy. 
   This is a very good bankruptcy bill. We have worked hard to bring both sides together. It is something that is absolutely needed in this country. 
   I hope our colleagues will support us today in this motion to reconsider. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time in favor of Senator GRASSLEY.

   Mr. HATCH. I rise today with my cosponsors, Senators FEINSTEIN and BINGAMAN, in support of a sense of the Senate resolution to encourage the U.S. Government, through the State Department or other appropriate offices, to use its best efforts to open a dialog between former American POW's forced into slave labor in Japan and the private Japanese companies that profited from their labor. This is a very important issue to our veterans and I think they deserve our help. 
   On April 9, 1942, Allied forces in the Philippines surrendered Bataan to the Japanese. Ten to twelve thousand American soldiers were forced to march some 60 miles in broiling heat in a deadly trek known as the Bataan Death March. Following a lengthy internment under horrific conditions, thousands of POW's were shipped to Japan in the holds of freighters known as ``Hell Ships.'' Once in Japan, many of these POW's were forced into slave labor for private Japanese steel mills and other private companies until the end of the war. 
   Fifty years have passed since the atrocities occurred, yet our veterans are still waiting for accountability and justice. Unfortunately, global political and security needs of the time often overshadowed their legitimate claims for justice--and these former POW's were once again asked to sacrifice for their country. Following the end of the war, for example, our government allegedly instructed many of the POW's held by Japan not to discuss their experiences and treatment. Some were even asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. Consequently, many Americans remain unaware of the atrocities that took place and the suffering our POW's endured. 
   Following the passage of a California statute extending the statute of limitations for World War II claims until 2010 and the recent litigation involving victims of Holocaust, a new effort is underway by the former POW's in Japan to seek compensation from the private companies which profited from their labor. Let me say at the outset, that this is not a dispute with the Japanese people and these are not claims against the Japanese Government. Rather, these are private claims against the private Japanese companies that profited from the slave labor of our American soldiers who they held as prisoners. These are the same types of claims raised by survivors of the Holocaust against the private German corporations who forced them into labor. 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the claims being made by the former American POW's against the private Japanese companies. One issue of concern for the Committee was whether the POW's held in Japan are receiving an appropriate level of advocacy from the U.S. Government. In the Holocaust litigation, the United States appropriately played a facilitating role in discussions between the German companies and the victims. The Justice Department also declined to file a statement of interest in the litigation--even when requested by the court. The efforts of the administration were entirely appropriate and the settlement, which was just recently finalized, was an invaluable step toward moving forward from the past. 
   Here, in contrast, there has been no effort by our Government, through the State Department or otherwise, to open a dialog between the Japanese and the former POW's. Moreover, in response to a request from the court, the Justice Department did, in fact, file two statements of interest which were very damaging to the claims of the POW's--stating in essence that their claims were barred by the 1951 Peace Treaty with Japan and the War Claims Act. 
   From a moral perspective, the claims of those forced into labor by private German companies and private Japanese companies appear to be of similar merit, yet they have spurred different responses from the administration. Why? 
   Here in the Senate, we have been doing what we can to help these former prisoners of war. With the help of Senator FEINSTEIN, we have moved through the Judiciary Committee Senate bill 1902, the Japanese Records Disclosure Act, which would set up a commission to declassify thousands of Japanese Imperial Army records held by the U.S. Government after appropriate screening for sensitive national security information and the like. 
   The Senate is also doing what it can to fulfill our Government's responsibility to these men by including a provision in the DOD authorization bill which would pay a $20,000 gratuity to POW's from Bataan and Corregidor who were forced into labor. Such payment would be in addition to any other payments these veterans may receive under law--and thus would not compromise any of the claims asserted in the litigation against the Japanese companies. 
   The bill I introduce today, an expression of the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Government should attempt to facilitate a dialog, as it did in the German case, is a logical and appropriate extension of our other efforts. Ultimately, I do not know where we will come out on the precise meaning of the Treaty. Regardless of how the technical legal issues are resolved--which the courts will determine--in light of the moral imperative and interests of simple fairness, we must ask ourselves why shouldn't the United States facilitate a dialog between the parties? When is good faith discussion a bad idea? I think we owe this much to these brave veterans and their families. I believe a good faith dialog is the first step towards a just resolution that accommodates the various moral, legal, national security, and foreign policy interests which are at play. 
   I urge all Members to support this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to make some points that need to be made at the end of the session. 
   Here we are, running right up against election time, and we are being held hostage because the President of the United States wants to grant amnesty to up to 4 million illegal aliens, people who haven't played by the rules, haven't paid the price, who literally want to jump over those who have played by the rules and who belong here--this blanket amnesty all for the purpose of politics. 
   In fact, I heard one of the leading Democrats say: Boy, Telemundo and all of the Hispanic newspapers are really playing this up. 
   Well, that might be true in the Hispanic media, but I think Hispanic people in this country want fairness above everything else. I think they know what is going on here. They know darn well they are being played, and they are being played in a vicious way. 
   I once again urge President Clinton not to veto the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill the Senate passed on Friday. 
   President Clinton has threatened a veto because we did not include his so-called Latino Fairness Act. But we have included something much better than his Latino Fairness Act: the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, the LIFE Act. 
   This act reunites families and restores due process to those who have played by the rules. Our proposal does not pit one nationality against another, nor does it pit one race against another. Our legislation provides relief to immigrants from all countries, not just special countries. A veto of CJS would be a blow against immigrant fairness. But a veto would do far more than that. 
   A veto would cut off funding for some of our most important programs. The CJS appropriation allocates $4.8 billion for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and an additional $15.7 million for Border Patrol equipment upgrades. It provides $3.3 billion for the FBI and $221 million for training, equipment, and research and development programs to combat domestic terrorism. We are not playing around here. This is important stuff. I don't think it is right to be playing politics with the lives of immigrants at the end of the session just to obtain some cheap political advantage. 
   There is $4.3 billion allocated for the Federal prison system in CJS. That is money we need to run the prison system and to treat people with due process. Then we have $1.3 billion for the Drug Enforcement Administration. This is critical to our fight against illegal drugs in this country. There is $288 million for the Violence Against Women Act. That is legislation that I have strongly supported and that provides assistance to battered women and children through a variety of different programs. 
   Actions have consequences. If President Clinton vetoes this bill, he is putting the public safety and well-being at risk both at home and abroad, all in an effort to play wedge politics. The President's veto threats ring hollow because this appropriations bill provides many proposals to help immigrants. The President himself has stated he wants to ``keep families together and to make our immigration policies more equitable.'' 
   This is exactly what our LIFE Act that we have in the appropriations bill does. Had the White House proposed this during President Clinton's first 7 years in office, he might have been able to develop a mandate to grant amnesty to millions of undocumented aliens, aliens who have broken our laws. But no such mandate exists. 
   The American people need to know that the INS, the FBI, and the Border Patrol are being brought to the brink of a shutdown because President Clinton wants Congress to grant amnesty for up to 4 million illegal aliens, people who haven't played by the rules. 
   When we fought the H-1B legislation on the floor, many on the other side pointed out the difficulties of legal immigrant families. They pointed out that children needed to be reunited with their parents, that spouses needed to be reunited with their husbands and wives. I said I would try to do something about that. 
   We realized there was a problem with the late amnesty class of 1982 who qualified for residency under the 1986 Act. We said we would try to do something about that, and the LIFE Act does. The American people are a fair people. The LIFE Act will take care of 1 million people who either don't have due process or who need to be reunited with their families. It takes care of them first rather than granting amnesty to up to 4 million illegal people who haven't played by the rules, which is what the President wants to do. Fairness dictates that we not grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens when there are 3.5 million people who have played by the rules waiting to come to the United States. The President should remember this inequitable proposal and reconsider what he wants to do here. 
   Let me say a couple of other things. I have even let the White House know that to determine if there are further inequities we will hold hearings right after we come back at the first of the year, and we will find out what needs to be done to restructure INS, if necessary, to make sure they treat people with more respect. We will consider these people who President Clinton would like to help. But most of them are here illegally and without further information, we think they should not be jumped above or in front of these people who aren't here legally or who have been waiting in line to be reunited with their families. 
   We brought both sides together in this LIFE Act and brought a variety of  different people into this. But there are some people who don't want any immigration to our country. They may live in States that are overrun with illegal immigrants; at least some of them do. Others don't seem to care about any rules, and I suspect the President is in that category. But we have brought these people together in the LIFE Act to resolve the problems that were mentioned during the H-1B debate. By gosh, I think it is time for the President to sign this bill and get about doing the Nation's business. He should quit playing wedge politics with these issues that are highly inflammable and about which he can blame people in illegitimate and wrongful ways. 
   I have worked very hard, along with a number of others, to bring this about in a way that is equitable, fair, and takes care of those who first need to be taken care of, with promises to hold hearings to see if there are any others who need the help and fairness that we can grant. That is the best we can do this year. That is the best we can do at the end of this session. It is the best we can do in bringing people together. 
   I think we have done a good job getting it done, and I hope the President will go along with our proposal so we can continue funding the INS, the Border Patrol, the FBI, training and equipment research and development programs to combat domestic terrorism, the Federal prison system, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. We must enact the CJS Appropriations into law because it funds things that are absolutely critical to this country. Moreover, it makes it possible for 1 million people to get permanent residency, people who have been waiting in line, have paid the price, and played by the rules. 
   This is a front-page issue in the Hispanic media, but most Americans don't know what the President is trying to do because the mainstream media is not reporting this issue. The American people need to know what is going on here. I think it is a crass approach to play wedge politics at the end of this session, holding us hostage so we can't get home and campaign and do what we need to do. Right now, I would much rather be home in Utah than here in Washington. But as long as we have to be here, I am going to make these points to try to help all immigrants, including Hispanics to receive fair treatment by the INS and by our immigration policies. 
   I am a cochairman of the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force. I started it a number of years ago to make sure Hispanics are treated fairly and that Hispanic issues are given the attention they deserve. We have done an awful lot in this area, and I think the LIFE Act is a very good piece of legislation that will take us far down the road. Additionally, we have made a promise to hold hearings next year to see if there are any other inequities that need to be remedied. We will be glad to do that. 
   We have 535 Members of Congress and a wide variety of viewpoints. I think we have brought them together in a way that will work and solve some of these problems. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. I don't think it is. We have held a number of hearings. The Subcommittee on Immigration holds hearings, which is chaired by Senator ABRAHAM and the ranking member, Senator KENNEDY. We have been trying to do an agricultural bill, H-1B, H-1A. There are a whole raft of things we have been trying to do. We have also worked consistently on the committee with the INS, the administration, and the Justice Department to resolve problems. I work on them all the time.

   Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will allow me to respond, yes, there is another side of the story. I work on it all the time. A high percentage of people who come to my office have immigration problems. 
   I work very hard to try to resolve them. But for 7 1/2 years the administration has not raised this. We have had hearings on restructuring INS and straightening out some of the problems. But for 7 1/2 years, the INS has fought against the 1982 people who we resolved in this bill called the LIFE Act that is in this bill. 
   The Clinton administration INS has fought the 1982 class' efforts to get due process every year since I have been here. It is one of the things that I wanted resolved, we have resolved it with the LIFE Act. 
   With regard to 245(i), I would like to do more, to be honest with you. But that is a minor problem compared to bringing in before them people who basically are illegal and who haven't played by the rules.

And, now, as the 106th Congress is coming to a close, the hour has come to pay tribute to five distinguished colleagues--Senators with whom I have had the honor and pleasure of working. These gentlemen of the Senate have decided that it is now time to embark on a new chapter in their lives. 
   Each in his own way has left behind a part of their vision for America and has influenced the course of our country.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to the distinguished Senator from Idaho and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, and I would like to say that there is a real difference between the two candidates for President. I think we in America can say that the candidates running for President and Vice President are decent people. Their wives are good people. I know them all very well. The differences between them, however, are really stark. 
   I believe if you compare the Bush and GORE economic programs you will find that the programs of George Bush have much more justification than the other side. 
   We all know that these comments about reducing the national debt are just a front. We haven't seen that happen since 1994 when the first Republican Congress in decades took over. 
   The year 1994 was the first time in decades that we controlled both Houses of Congress and since then we have balanced the budget three times. We have paid down the debt $361 billion. By the end of next year it will be $ 1/2 trillion. That would not have happened had it not been for the first Republican Congress. 
   I remember as a Member of this body in 1994 when the President submitted the budget for $200 billion in deficits well into this century. President Clinton said at the time that nothing could be done, there was no way we could have anything but those deficits for at least 10 years. 
   Of course, we have shown that good fiscal discipline can literally balance the budget. I have to say what we are in right now is a mess. I think it will take George Bush and Dick Cheney to straighten it out. One of the things I like about George Bush so much is that he picked Dick Cheney, who, without question, is head and shoulders over most people who have served in Washington. Cheney is bright. He is extremely intelligent. He is extremely knowledgeable and has a lot of experience. He is honest to a fault, and he is straightforward. He is just the type of a person we need in government today. 
   When you have a $4.6 trillion projected surplus, it is pretty clear to me that taxpayers are being asked to pay too much in taxes. Frankly, Bush's approach is to set aside $2.3 trillion for Social Security; he has $1.3 trillion to give back to the taxpayers and use the other $1 trillion to pay down the national debt. 
   In order to have a $4.6 trillion surplus, we better pursue a wise economic approach. This economic approach has reduced the marginal tax rates from 70 percent down to 28 percent in 1986, and reduced capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent 3 years ago. We had to think seriously about balancing the budget during our battles for the balanced budget amendment. But the first Republican Congress in decades managed to balance the budget. And we also had a wonderful head of the Federal Reserve in Alan Greenspan, a Republican, who basically has done miraculous work. There is no question that Secretary Robert Rubin did a good job and helped to stabilize world markets. 
   In all honesty, if we want to keep this economy going, we have to realize that marginal tax rates have jumped from 28 percent in 1986 up to over 40 percent today. Of course, they are still 30 points below where they were when Ronald Reagan took office with double-digit inflation and double-digit interest rates. 
   I hope the American people realize we have to have a change in Washington or we are going to go back to the old ways of deficits, high interest, and high taxes. 
   I might also add that I get tired of this 1 percent business. Let's face it, the top 1 percent of those who pay income taxes pay almost 35 percent of the income taxes in this country. The upper 50 percent, which comprises people with incomes over $27,000 a year, pay 96 percent of all taxes. The bottom 50 percent pay around 4 percent of all taxes. Naturally, Bush wants everybody who pays taxes to receive some benefits from having done so. Those who earn less than $35,000 a year are going to have a 100-percent reduction in most cases. Since the average wage in Utah is $37,000, it is easy to see we are going to have a lot of people in Utah benefiting from the Bush tax cuts. If you make $50,000 or less, you  have a 50 percent or a 55 percent reduction in your tax burden. At $75,000, you have 25 percent. 
   I felt it necessary to make these comments because the differences between the two candidates are stark. I think both candidates are good people. Vice President GORE and his wife Tipper are good people. There is no question that Governor Bush is a very good person, and his wife, Laura, is a wonderful person. 
   The difference is philosophy. It is time for us to get the country going in the right direction. That is my view. 
   Mr. President, I make a few comments to discuss a matter of great importance to immigrants and to all Americans. 
   President Clinton has repeatedly threatened to veto the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations if it does not include his proposals for immigration amnesty for undocumented aliens, or in most cases, illegal aliens. He calls it the Latino Immigration Fairness Act. 
   The CJS conference report does far better than the Latino fairness bill that the President is advocating. This CJS Report includes provisions that will restore fairness to immigrants from all countries, including hundreds of thousands of Latinos. The CJS bill contains a proposal carefully crafted by myself and others and we call it the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, the LIFE Act. Our proposal has at its foundation a simple goal--to take a much needed step toward bringing fairness to our Nation's immigration policy by reuniting families and helping those who have played by the rules. Our proposal does not pit one nationality against another, nor does it pit one race against another. Our legislation provides relief to immigrants from all countries involved. 
   By contrast, the Clinton-Gore proposal would grant a blanket amnesty to millions of undocumented aliens--many or most of whom have broken our immigration laws. It also picks out specific groups of immigrants--namely, Central Americans--for special treatment. Unlike the Clinton-Gore proposal, our plan does not provide relief to those who have violated our laws at the expense of those who have played by the rules. Instead, it restores due process to a class of immigrants wrongly denied the ability to apply for residency nearly 15 years ago and expeditiously reunifies husbands, wives, and children of resident aliens. In other words, legal aliens. 
   It is important to bear in mind that at the same time the administration wants to grant amnesty to millions of people, it cannot even tell us how many people are waiting in line to come here legally. The administration's best guess on the number of immigrants waiting in line--a figure which is nearly four years old--is that over 3.5 million people are waiting to immigrate to the United States. Over 1 million of these applicants are spouses and children of permanent residents, 
   that we take care of in our bill. The others we will look at, but not in the context of this bill. No; instead, the administration proposes to move to the front of our immigration lines those who have violated our immigration laws. 
   That doesn't seem right to me. We have to focus our efforts on helping reduce this backlog in addressing any legitimate due process issues. Our proposal does these things to accomplish these goals. The first part of our LIFE Act creates a new form of visitor visa for spouses and children of permanent residents. Our plan puts our Nation's resources behind reuniting families, instead of processing amnesty applications. Eligible applicants would be allowed to reunite with their families residing in the United States, and work legally while awaiting a decision on the merits of their petitions. 
   Our proposal would allow approximately 600,000 over the next 3 years to come to the United States legally, ahead of schedule, to be reunited with their immediate families. 
   Second, the LIFE Act further strengthens family and marriage by permitting spouses of U.S. citizens married outside the United States to obtain visas allowing spouses to enter the United States to await immigrant visa processing. Before the Clinton-Gore White House proposes that we give residency to those who have broken our minimum immigration laws, shouldn't we first be in the position of letting the wives of our citizens into this country, those who are legal? 
   Third, the LIFE Act restores due process to immigrants who are wrongly denied adjustment of status because of an INS administrative error. 
   My proposal allows the late amnesty class of 1982 to pursue their legalization claims under the original terms of the 1986 Act. We restore fairness to this group of individuals that has spent over 10 years in litigation. 
   This portion of the LIFE Act would assist approximately 400,000 immigrants in the class of 1982 who have played by the rules and now deserve the chance to legalize their status in accordance with law. Our proposal is strongly supported by those who lived through this litigation and fought against the Clinton administration's INS for fairness--not the political interest groups that would prefer to divide our country over this issue. Members of the class of 1982 prefer our solution to the administration's. One member of the class recently pleaded:  
   We urge President Clinton to now call upon his INS to lay down its arms, to stop its decade-old battle to block our legalization, to comply with the numerous court orders we have won.  
   In short, our LIFE Act will help close to one million people who have been treated unfairly by our nation's immigration laws. 
   But Republicans have not stopped there. We recognize that there is a serious need to reform the Immigration and Naturalization Service in both its mission and its structure. We have complaints all the time about it. It is time to reform it. The INS should offer better service and a culture of respect for our newest Americans. Many Republicans and Democrats have worked hard toward promoting these broad goals. 
   Although we have yet to receive any written or formal response from the administration concerning the LIFE Act, we have presented the White House with language that says we should hold hearings and consider legislation that addresses the backlogs in applications for lawful permanent residency, furthers keeping families together, and addresses whether there are worker shortages in different sectors of our economy. Further, we have proposed that the Attorney General prepare a report to Congress no later than March 1, 2001, addressing facts relating to the administration's proposal. 
   Why do we need a report? Well, before the Congress is asked to proceed to grant separate treatment to different nationalities, or consider a blanket amnesty, I think it might make some sense to know how many people would be covered by the proposal. We have repeatedly asked for such information from the administration--they have yet to provide it. Let's be clear: the Clinton-Gore administration cannot even tell us how many people will be covered by their proposal. Why can't they tell us? Either they do not know the answer or they do know the answer but don't want the American people to know it. They would rather play politics with this issue. 
   I have no objection to seriously considering immigration reforms during the next Congress. I am chairman of the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force. I have worked very hard for Latinos throughout our country--frankly, throughout the world, and will continue to do so. But such major reforms should not be pursued in an election year rush to create wedge issues that divide, rather than unite Americans. Real INS reform requires that we proceed in a responsible way, after we know the facts. 
   Unfortunately, the President appears not to care about the facts. If he did care, he would not threaten to veto this important bill since a veto jeopardizes funding for some of our most crucial government programs. 
   This chart shows just some of the many programs funded by the CJS appropriations bill--programs which the President threatens to cut off funding for with his veto. The CJS appropriations bill allocates $4.8 billion for the INS. If those funds are cut off by that veto we are going to be in a bigger mess on immigration then ever before, as bad as some think INS is. It contains an additional $15.7 million for Border Patrol equipment upgrades. How will President Clinton explain to Americans that he wants to shut down the INS and Border Patrol in order to  force Congress to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens? What kind of a message does this send to the men and women of the Border Patrol who risk their lives doing their job each and every day? I would note that the Border Patrol officers oppose his amnesty proposal--or should I say the proposal of those on the other side. 
   This appropriations bill also contains $3.3 billion for the FBI, and $221 million for training, equipment, and research and development programs to combat domestic terrorism. How will President Clinton explain to the families of those killed in the U.S.S. Cole bombing that FBI agents may have to be brought home because he has cut off funding for the FBI in order to grant amnesty to millions of undocumented aliens who violated our immigration laws? 
   This appropriations bill contains $4.3 billion for the federal prison system and $1.3 billion for the Drug Enforcement Administration. How will President Clinton explain to the American people that funding for Federal prisons and drug enforcement and drug interdiction will be put at risk because he wants to grant amnesty to millions of people who have violated our immigration laws? 
   We do not even know how many millions because they will not give us the figures. I suspect the reason they will not give us the figures is because it amounts to more than 4 million people. 
   Let me just put another thing up here. At the end of this Congress, we got into an awful bind that threatened to stop us from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act--for which we allocate $288 million. This is the Biden-Hatch bill. We passed it 6 years ago, as I recall. It has worked very well to help Women In Jeopardy Programs, legal aid for battered women and children, and a whole raft of other things to help cope with the problems of violence against women. This all goes down the drain if the President vetoes this bill. It is a matter of great concern. Like I say, this bill allocates $288 million for the Violence Against Women Act Program, legislation that I strongly supported and helped to break free at the end of this Congress. 
   Does President Clinton want to cut off funding for assistance to battered women and their children in order to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens? It does not sound logical to me. I know we are weeks away from an election. I also appreciate the desire of the Clinton-Gore White House to play wedge politics. But I feel it is incumbent upon me to note this White House, indeed, some White House officials involved in this immigration effort, have a pretty poor record when it comes to letting political motivations cloud their judgment on matters, important matters of public interest and public safety. Let's not forget how the Clinton-Gore White House granted clemency to convicted FALN terrorists in order to, in their words, ``have a positive impact among strategic Puerto Rican communities in the U.S. (read voters).'' 
   The White House consciously targeted Puerto Rican voters and, it seemed to me, under the worst of circumstances and in the worst way. 
   Actions have consequences. If President Clinton vetoes this bill, he is putting the public safety and well-being at risk, both at home and abroad. He is doing this all in an effort to play wedge politics. The President's veto threats ring especially hollow because this appropriations bill provides many proposals to help immigrants. The President himself has stated that he wants, ``to keep families together, and to make our immigration policies more equitable.'' 
   This is exactly what my LIFE Act does. In order to get that done, I have had to bring together people with all kinds of varying viewpoints, from those who do not want any immigration changes at all to those others who do not care about immigration. 
   I believe in the Statue of Liberty. I believe this is a country that ought to be open for legal immigrants. 
   I believe we ought to do everything in our power to solve these problems. I am willing to hold hearings right to see if we have not covered some of the problems that need to be covered. More than 1 million people are going to be covered by the LIFE Act. We have been able to bring together both Houses of Congress, as far as Republicans are concerned, and I think a lot of good Democrats when they look at this will be very impressed that we have been able to get this much done. I cannot go beyond that because there are people who just will not go any further. 
   I am willing to commit to holding hearings right after the first of the year to determine what else needs to be done. I am not prepared today, without all the facts, without hearings, without knowing where we are going, to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and put them on the list ahead of those who need their spouses and families to be brought together. 
   When we fought these matters on the floor, there was a lot of anguish and whining by some on the other side that we were not taking care of families and children. I said we would try to do that and we have done it. 
   This bill does more than the President's bill, and it does it legally in the right way, giving preference to the people who have played by the rules rather than those who have not. 
   Most Americans descend from someone who came to this great country in the hope of pursuing a better life, in the hope of fulfilling the American Dream. I believe the American Dream is still alive and that we in Congress should try to serve as its custodians. For this reason, I believe it is not right to penalize families and to disadvantage those who have played by the rules. Indeed, I believe most current and future Americans--most Hispanics, most Asians, most Africans, and most Arabs--do not want to see people who play by the rules disadvantaged in an election year rush to help those who have not. And if you put the question to those the administration seeks to help, I think they would agree as well. 
   A veto of CJS appropriations and the LIFE Act would elevate political posturing above immigrant families and would place interest group politics over protecting the health and well-being of all Americans. 
   We have brought a lot of people together on this bill. I call upon the President to look at that. It is quite an achievement under circumstances that have been difficult for people such as myself. 
   It surprises me that the administration has suddenly called for urgent immigration reform for fairness' sake. It was 4 short years ago that the President eagerly signed the Illegal Immigration Reform Act of 1996. The President's current proposal stands the 1996 law on its head. Here is what the President said then about the 1996 Act in his signing statement:  
   This bill also includes landmark immigration legislation that reinforces the efforts we have made over the last 3 years to combat illegal immigration. It strengthens the rule of law by cracking down on illegal immigration at the border, in the workplace, and in the criminal justice system--without punishing those living in the United States legally, or allowing children to be kept out of schools and sent into the streets.  
   I think the President ought to live by those words, instead of undermining existing law through Latino fairness. Getting our LIFE bill together has taken a lot of effort on my part and on the part of others under difficult circumstances. We have been able to bring together people who almost always have difficulty with immigration laws. 
   Our proposal has something that will solve the 1982 problem of due process rights. Those people have not been treated fairly by the INS. The INS keeps appealing their cases even though they win them every time. We will solve that problem for them. 
   It solves the problem of reuniting minor children with their parents in this country. It does it in the best of ways, and it does it expeditiously. It solves the problem of bringing spouses together with their husbands and wives who are legal, and it will help close to 1 million people. That, to me, having worked on immigration matters over the last 24 years, is a pretty darn good accomplishment if we can get it done. 
   I do not want to have this process break down because politics are being played. I know there will never be an agreement to allow up to 4 million people who are illegal aliens into this country in preference over these three categories of people I have talked about, these 1 million people who deserve to be treated better. 
   I hope the President will listen to what I have said. I have not had a chance to personally chat with him, but I have talked with his Chief of Staff who is a good friend and decent  man and who I think, having served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for all those years on the Democratic side, understands how difficult these matters are to put together. 
   I believe it is time to resovle these problems. I have done my best to do it. This is as far as we can go now, but we make a promise to look into every issue that is raised in hearings as soon as we get back, assuming we are still in the majority. Even if we are not, I will cooperate in seeing those hearings are held in an orderly and intelligent way. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague made some pretty good points on fairness, except we asked ``is it fair,'' too. Is it fair to allow 3.5 million legal immigrants to be held in line so that we can take care of approximately 4 million illegal immigrants? That is the point I was making earlier in the day. Frankly, it is a matter I find of great importance.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was pleased that last Thursday the Senate unanimously passed S. 1854, the ``21st Century Acquisition Reform and Improvements Act of 2000.'' I originally introduced the bill last year with Senators DEWINE and KOHL, and we are hopeful that it will be enacted into law this year. I want to express my thanks to Senator LEAHY, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and to Senators DEWINE and KOHL, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, respectively, for their hard work and cooperation in developing and passing the bipartisan proposal that the Senate approved. The reforms that will be put in place upon enactment of this legislation are long overdue. Businesses, both small and large, as well as the antitrust enforcement agencies, have much to gain by its enactment. 
   As my colleagues know, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires companies contemplating a merger or acquisition to file a pre-merger notification with the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission if the size of the companies and the size of the proposed transaction are greater than certain  monetary thresholds. These monetary thresholds, however, are seriously outdated. They have not been changed--even for inflation--since the legislation was enacted more than two decades ago. 
   Because these monetary thresholds are obsolete, businesses today often are required to notify the Antitrust Division and the FTC of proposed transactions that simply do not raise competitive issues. As a result, the agencies are required to expend valuable resources performing needless reviews of transactions that were never intended to be reviewed. In short, current law senselessly imposes a costly regulatory and financial burden upon companies, particularly small businesses, and needlessly drains the resources of the agencies. Because of the unnecessarily low monetary thresholds, current law fails to reflect the true economic impact of mergers and acquisitions in today's economy. 
   In addition, after a pre-merger notification is filed, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act imposes a 30-day waiting period, during which the proposed transaction may not close and the Antitrust Division or the FTC conducts an antitrust investigation. Prior to the expiration of this waiting period, the agency investigating the transaction may make a ``second request''--a demand for additional information or documentary material that is relevant to the proposed transaction. Unfortunately, many second requests require the production of an enormous volume of materials, many of which are unnecessary for even the most comprehensive merger review. Complying with such second requests has become extraordinarily burdensome, often costing companies in excess of $1 million. Second requests also extend the waiting period for an additional 20 days, a period of time that does not begin to run until the agencies have determined that the transacting companies have ``substantially complied'' with the second request. This procedure results in many lawful transactions being unnecessarily delayed for extended periods of time, causing an enormous strain on the businesses, their employees, and their shareholders. 
   I am pleased that this legislation will rectify many of the problems with the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. First, the legislation increases the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, effectively exempting mergers and acquisitions that would not pose any competitive concerns from the Act's notification requirement. Such mergers make up over half of all transactions reported in 1999. Therefore, this legislation provides significant regulatory and financial relief for all businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones. In addition, the legislation indexes the threshold for inflation, so that the problem of an expanding economy outgrowing the statute's monetary threshold will not recur. 
   In addition to providing regulatory and financial relief for companies, another purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the Antitrust Division and the FTC efficiently allocate their finite resources to those transactions that truly warrant antitrust scrutiny. To that end, one of its main objectives is to achieve a more effective and efficient merger review process by eliminating unnecessary burden, costly duplication and undue delay. In order to accomplish this objective, this legislation directs the Assistant Attorney General and the FTC to conduct an internal review and implement reforms of the merger review process, including the designation of a senior official for expedited review of appeals regarding the scope of and compliance with second requests. Fortunately, these reforms will be implemented quickly because, under this legislation, the Assistant Attorney General and the FTC will have 120 days to issue the guidelines and make the necessary changes to their regulations and policy documents to implement the reforms, and they must report back to Congress within 180 days. 
   This legislation sets forth reforms to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that are long overdue. It provides significant regulatory and financial relief for businesses, while ensuring that transactions that truly deserve antitrust scrutiny will continue to undergo review. Again, I thank my colleagues who joined me in supporting passage of this legislation. In the waning hours of this Congressional Session, it is my intention to see this non-controversial consensus legislation enacted into law this year, and I will seek its attachment to one of the remaining ``must-pass'' vehicles. 
   Finally, I would like to recognize the hard work and efforts of several staff members of the Judiciary Committee who were instrumental in the successful passage of this legislation. On my staff, I particularly would like to thank the Committee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Manus Cooney, the lead counsels who worked on this measure, Makan Delrahim, Rene Augustine, and Kyle Sampson, and legal fellow Thadd Prisco. On Senator LEAHY's staff, I would like to recognize the professional skills and input of the Minority Chief Counsel, Bruce Cohen, and the Minority General Counsel, Beryl Howell. On the Antitrust Subcommittee, I would like to thank Peter Levitas and Mark Grundvig, who are Senator DEWINE's able counsels, as well as Jon Leibowitz and Seth Bloom, counsels to Senator KOHL, for their tireless efforts and input. Without the assistance and hard work of these loyal public servants, the important reforms in this legislation would not have been possible. Thank you.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment in the nature of a substitute is the product of negotiations between myself and Senator LEAHY, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI, the chairman and ranking member of the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee. It is my hope that the Senate will act speedily to pass S. 2915, with this amendment, and return it to the House for that body's approval. 
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have the responsibility to review the operation of federal court process and procedures. In doing so, I have strived to ensure that our federal judicial system is administered in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining a high level of quality in the administration of justice. The substitute amendment I am offering today includes numerous changes to our laws that the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts, believes are necessary to improve the functions of our courts. They are changes that I believe will help increase the efficiency of the federal judiciary, while ensuring that justice is served. 
   The amendment contains provisions that reduce unnecessary expenses and improve the efficiency of the judicial system. Specifically, it extends civil and criminal contempt authority to magistrate judges so that they can perform more effectively their existing statutory duties for the district court. It also authorizes magistrate judges (1) to try misdemeanor cases involving juveniles (cases that currently are tried in district court) and (2) to try all petty offense cases without first having to obtain the consent of the defendant. Making these changes will reduce caseload burdens on district judges, thereby permitting district judges more time to handle more serious crimes and more serious offenders. 
   The amendment also contains provisions that decrease the amount of time judges must devote to non-judicial matters. For example, one such provision raises the maximum compensation level paid to federal or community defenders representing defendants appearing before magistrate or district judges before they must seek a waiver for payment in excess of the prescribed maximum. Currently, payment in excess of the maximum requires the approval of both the judge who presided over the case and the chief judge of the  court. Because the last increase in the maximum compensation level was enacted 14 years ago, federal and community defenders are forced to seek payment waivers in a significant number of cases. As a consequence, judges are forced to spend more time acting as an administrator (attending to ministerial matters) and less time acting as a judge (attending to their civil and criminal dockets). The amendment remedies this problem. 
   In addition, the amendment contains a provision designed to address the growing trend of Criminal Justice Act (``CJA'') panel attorneys being subject to unfounded suits by the defendants they formerly represented. Under current law, CJA panel attorneys must pay their own legal expenses in defending malpractice suits brought by former clients. The result is a chilling effect on the willingness of attorneys to participate as CJA panel attorneys--a chilling effect that serves only to make the obtaining of adequate representation for defendants more difficult. Under current law, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts is authorized to provide representation for and indemnity to federal and community defender organizations for malpractice claims that arise as a result or furnishing representational services. No such provision, however, is made for CJA panel attorneys. The amendment rectifies this situation and provides CJA panel attorneys with the same protection afforded other federal defenders. 
   Importantly, the amendment contains provisions designed to assist handicapped employees working for the federal judiciary. These provisions bring the federal judiciary into alignment with the Executive Branch and other government bodies. 
   The amendment also contains a provision extending for four years the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court Police to provide security beyond the Supreme Court building and grounds for Justices, Court employees, and official visitors. Under current law, this authority will terminate automatically on December 29, 2000. Because security concerns of the Justices and employees of the Supreme Court have not diminished, it is essential that the off-grounds authority of the Supreme Court Police be continued without interruption. 
   I have touched on only a few of the provisions contained in this amendment. This amendment sets forth a number of other provisions designed to improve judicial financial and personnel administration, judicial process, and other court-related matters. Each of these provisions is intended to enhance the operation of the federal judiciary. It is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will agree to this amendment quickly, that the House will do likewise, and that this legislation will be signed by the President in short order.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the many long hours of work by my colleagues on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to develop this legislation. I admire the efforts of my friend and colleague, Senator COCHRAN. I believe we all owe him our gratitude for his leadership on behalf of our nation's agriculture industry, including its small family farmers and ranchers. I am well aware that putting these bills together is never easy and seems recently to be an almost thankless task. 
   There is much in this bill worthy of enthusiastic support. I am particularly pleased that the conferees have included a number of provisions that will  benefit farmers and ranchers in the West. 
   For example, the entire West will benefit from pasture and forage research that is funded by this bill. The information we obtain from this Utah State University program not only makes our livestock producers more efficient, but also contributes significantly to the health of our pasture lands in the West. 
   Another important contribution to research in the conference report is the funding for Utah State's Poisonous Plant Laboratory. The effort to fight noxious weeds in the U.S. will receive a significant boost as this important facility is finally upgraded. Some people chuckle when they see a program to fight noxious weeds. But, I can assure my colleagues that this is no joke. If you have ever seen a crop overrun with these weeds, you would know that we need to continue our research efforts to come up with safe and effective means to fight them. 
   The environment also benefits by this bill's continued funding for the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program. This is particularly important to farmers within the vast Colorado River Basin, who must shoulder much of the burden for minimizing agricultural runoff into the Colorado River. The Salinity Control program is good for farmers, good for the environment, and good for the fish species in the river. 
   Also important to Utah agriculture, Mr. President, is the funding this bill provides to compensate farmers for losses due to the infestation of grasshoppers and Mormon crickets. For the last couple of years, farmers in Utah and other Western states have faced one of the largest infestations on record. I am very pleased that Congress has seen fit to provide these farmers with relief. You wouldn't think that these little insects could do so much damage, but they do. This funding is important to those in my state who have suffered terrible losses. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I have often reminded my colleagues that Utah is the second driest state in the Union. Utah's farmers understand better than most that water equals life. For that reason, I am pleased that this bill will help to protect the Long Park Reservoir by providing technical and financial assistance to shoring up this important source of water. 
   Mr. President, these are just a few of the programs funded by the conference report that will benefit Utah's farmers. 
   I am also proud to say that I worked with Senator COCHRAN and Senator DURBIN to increase the amount of funds available in FDA's Office of Generic Drugs. When generic drug applications languish at FDA, it is the public that loses, and these additional resources will be a needed shot in the arm. They will enable the FDA to process these applications more quickly and get generic drugs to consumers faster. 
   This is a momentous piece of legislation, which is why I think it is unfortunate that it is being made a vehicle for an unrelated proposal that is poor policy and that would undoubtedly have been the subject of considerable debate should it have come to the floor as a free-standing bill. 
   Mr. President, I must register my severe reservations about the drug importation provisions that have been inserted in the Agriculture appropriations conference report. 
   I commend Senator COCHRAN for his attempts to improve some of the more egregious features of the controversial pharmaceutical importation provisions that have been slipped into this appropriations bill. But, these mitigation measures do not go far enough to correct what I consider the proposal's principal flaw. 
   My first and foremost concern about this proposal is patient safety. 
   I have been around here long enough to gauge momentum and count the votes. I know that the reimportation provisions have been wedged in a must-pass, year-end appropriations bill--one that forces me to choose between supporting a bill that does much to help Utahans and opposing a bill that contains one bad, albeit popular, idea. 
   But before we adopt this reimportation measure, which has not been the subject of a committee mark-up in either the Senate or House, let's at least stop for a moment and think about the type of risk we are placing upon the American people. 
   Although I do not see eye-to-eye with Congressman JOHN DINGELL on every, maybe even most, issues, I always respect his views. And, I recognize his many impressive efforts when he chaired the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee. In fact, it was the Dingell Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee's investigation into the foreign drug market that led to the enactment of the 1988 Prescription Drug Marketing Act. I was proud 
   to help shepherd this legislation through the Senate. 
   The good news is that the PDMA law helps prevent pharmaceuticals that are mislabeled, misbranded, improperly stored or shipped, beyond their shelf life, or even bald counterfeits from entering the United States from abroad. 
   The bad news is that the legislation we are being asked to adopt today will unravel essential elements of the PDMA, which currently controls importation of pharmaceutical products into the United States. 
   As the committee report accompanying the PDMA stated:

   Mr. HATCH. As this correspondence indicates, I am particularly concerned by the so-called non-discrimination clause that suddenly materialized, almost out of the vapors, and was added to the conference report at the last moment. 
   I would also note for the record that, prior to learning that such language was under development, I contacted Chairman COCHRAN and the majority leadership with a request that a rule of construction be added to these ill-advised importation provisions to the effect that the language be neutral with respect to intellectual property rights. 
   Imagine my surprise and disappointment to find that not only was my modest proposal, which was consistent with every version of the bill that passed both the House and the Senate up to that point, not adopted, but, instead, all too discriminatory ``non-discrimination clause'' incorporated in its place. 
   This provision states: ``No manufacturer of covered products may enter into a contract or agreement that includes a provision to prevent the sale or distribution of covered products imported pursuant to subsection (a).'' Make no mistake that this clause appears to take direct aim on some of the most traditional of American commercial rights such as freedom to contract and the freedom to license patent rights. 
   In the United States, manufacturers have great leeway in selling their goods. For example, in its 1919 decision, United States v. Colgate & Co., the Supreme Court noted it is a ``long recognized right of [a] trader or manufacturer to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.'' Moreover, this right is particularly strong when the seller holds patent rights which are derived directly from Article I of the Constitution. 
   As the language is scrutinized, I hear more and more questions being raised about the 
   potential conflict of these provisions with current law. 
   Mr. President, in some respects, this non-discrimination clause is a major assault on intellectual property rights. It hardly sends a strong signal to our knowledge-based industries that form the backbone of the new high-technology economy. 
   I serve on the Finance Committee where we had jurisdiction over trade matters. While at the point I have reached no final answers or conclusions about how the non-discrimination clause comports with the TRIPS provisions, I can tell you that I have a lot of questions. And I can tell you that we would be better off if, before we adopt this language, we took the time to work through some of the tough questions that this highly controversial clause raises with, for example, Article  28 of TRIPS. Neither the Finance Committee nor the Ways and Means Committee will have a meaningful opportunity to examine the trade implication of this language. 
   I can only hope that this language does not result in the importation of sub-standard and unsafe drugs along with a back door system of price controls. Wisely, this body has always resisted direct government price controls on high-technology products like pharmaceuticals. We stand today as the world's leader in pharmaceutical innovation. Let's hope that this bill does not undermine this achievement. 
   Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that we need to work together to make drugs more affordable for the American public--all of those in Congress with expertise in the policy areas that contribute to addressing this issue should be collaborating on a solution to high drug prices. This is not a simple matter, and a solution that looks simple and obvious could easily prove disastrous to both consumers and the research enterprise. 
   We must tackle this issue in a manner that doesn't threaten public safety, undermine the incentives for developing new intellectual property, and otherwise adversely affects U.S. trade interests. Frankly, I am concerned that these reimportation provisions, however well-intentioned, will not be able to met these tests. 
   I will support this conference report, even though I have very serious concerns about the provisions on pharmaceutical reimportation. I hope to work with my colleagues on all the relevant committees in the House and Senate on these many issues concerning pharmaceuticals and their importation into our country.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Utahn, William F.X. McConnell of Salt Lake City, a remarkable man with a remarkable story. I am not sure that in this retelling I can do justice to his sacrifices or of those who fought along side of him during World War II's campaign for the Rhine River. But, I think my colleagues would be interested in this history and would like to join me in paying tribute to the bravery of these men. 
   In December 1944, Bill McConnell arrived in France and was assigned to the 168th Engineer Combat Battalion. Shortly thereafter, Bill McConnell and his battalion fought in the terrible Battle of the Bulge. His battalion paved the way for an allied victory by removing road blocks and tank traps, building bridges under fire, and other perilous assignments. But, these were not the most harrowing experiences to which McConnell was assigned. The worst was yet to come. 
   McConnell and his battalion were called to cross the Rhine River, an assault as dangerous as it was important. He was told that this would be a simple assault, with plenty of support provided. At 2:00 a.m. on March 26, 1945, he boarded a row boat to cross the Rhine River into Germany. During the crossing, a bank of lights on the German side of the river were suddenly turned on, spotlighting the American soldiers. German tracer bullets fell like deadly rain upon them. The promised support from the American side never came. 
   While rowing, McConnell was hit in the wrist. Bleeding profusely, he continued to row. Shortly thereafter, several tracer bullets ripped through his thigh and knee. Continuing to row, he was hit a third time by an unidentified object on the side of his face and head. This blow knocked him into the water where he was miraculously saved by an assault boat returning from the German shore. Still without cover, the occupants of the boat were forced to debark and trudge through an active sewer line in order to escape the German gunfire. 
   For this act of bravery, Bill McConnell was awarded a well-deserved Purple Heart. In addition, he has been honored with the American Campaign Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Distinguished Unit Citation, European Theater of Operations with four battle stars, and the Belgium Croix de Guerre (War Cross). These medals stand as a symbol of his dedication. 
   But, Bill McConnell's battle since the war has been to keep this military history alive. While the battle at Remagen and other locations during the war to defeat the Third Reich have been well-chronicled in books and on film, engagements such as the Rhine crossing are still unknown to many Americans. 
   Since the war, McConnell has worked tirelessly in support of veterans organizations. Shortly after returning from the war he worked as a national service officer with the Disabled American Veterans. For 25 years, he served in the Veterans Administration Adjudication Division, in positions including senior adjudicator, chairman of the rating board, and adjudication officer. 
   For more than 40 years, he has been the American Legion member in charge of placing U.S. flags on graves for Memorial Day. He has served as past state commander in Utah of the Disabled American Veterans. He is the founder of the Salt Lake City chapter and national service officer of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, where he volunteers to help veterans with their disability claims. Clearly, he is one who has helped many. 
   There are thousands of World War II veterans just like Bill McConnell, who fought courageously for freedom. But, William F.X. McConnell is one who happens to live in my home state. He exemplifies the dedication of all American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines--past, present, and future--who have always been on watch to defend our country and its vital interests. 
   Today, I want to thank Bill McConnell for his service in uniform and for his service to our nation's veterans. This stand as his own monument. I am pleased to call the Senate's attention to his bravery in battle and to his many contributions to veterans.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with the imminent passage of the work made for hire legislation today, I believe a few comments are in order. Last year a technical amendment was included in the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999 which added sound recordings to the list of works eligible for, or considered as having, the status of works made for hire under the Copyright Act. Works made within the scope of employment or large collaborative works such as motion pictures are most often accorded the status of works made for hire, and the copyright for those works resides in the employer or the corporation doing the hiring, such as the movie studio. The status of sound recordings had been in some doubt because sound recordings did not obtain the status of copyrighted works until relatively recently, and, when added to the list of copyrightable works was not added to the list of works made for hire. 
   When the technical amendment was raised for consideration in the conference, our research indicated that the practice of the Copyright Office has uniformly been to register sound recordings as works made for hire. The technical amendment therefore seemed a reasonable codification of the ongoing practice at the Copyright Office, and was adopted. 
   Soon thereafter, however, it became clear that while the technical amendment aligned the code with long-time Copyright Office practice, it was not uncontroversial. Indeed many recording artists had believed that the work-for-hire clauses of their contracts were unenforceable because contrary to the copyright code: i.e., sound recordings are not listed as works made for hire. They view their contracts as operating as assignments or transfers of copyright. This distinction is important because under work-for-hire, the copyright is owned by the record company for the life of the copyright and the artists' rights are extinguished; under a transfer or assignment, the artist may recapture his or her copyright after 35 years and then either renegotiate more favorable terms with the same company or sell the remaining copyright to another label on more favorable terms. The basic premise of this recapture is that the initial assignment of copyright might not fully reward the unproven artist who is an unknown quantity in a risky business. Once the artist's commercial value is better proven an opportunity is given the artist to reap the rewards of his or her creations that have stood the test of time. That the assumptions of the artists and labels about the status of these works have been diametrically opposed might not have appeared until 35 years after the 1978 effective act of the current Copyright Act, but for this technical amendment. 
   What ought the status of sound recordings be then? Sound recordings can be something of a hybrid art form lying on a continuum between the individual author writing a song or book and the motion picture where possibly hundreds of employees collaborate on the final work. Sound recordings can be more like the former or the latter, depending on the circumstances. Because the facts can vary so widely--some albums are primarily the product of the producer, some of one artist, some of a group, many have hired musicians or technicians who contribute 
   but do so as part of their normal employment, some recordings are compilations of smaller recordings--it is not clear what general rule would be either most fair to all concerned or would most encourage the continued creativity of recording artists. Since it may take some time, and will require the input of all the affected parties, it seems reasonable at this time to undo last years' technical amendment without prejudice to either side in case litigation should arise later, while we explore whether a more comprehensive rule can be crafted. That is why we have made this change today, containing in the legislative language the congressional intent that neither enactment prejudice any future litigation. 
   It is my hope that the dialogue on this issue is beginning, rather then ending, with this legislation. I think it is important to avoid costly litigation if possible. And I believe it of paramount importance that artists are fairly compensated for the work they do. Without the creativity of the artist, the record companies would have nothing to market, and the audience would have nothing to enjoy. For the sake of the future of music, I hope that using new technologies, artists and audience can begin having a closer relationship, where artists are encourage to stretch themselves creatively and fans are enabled to enjoy artists' work more fully. I think a focused conversation on the relative roles of artists and label, as well as the artist's role in controlling their work in traditional and new media, can hasten that day. If the legislative roundabout on the work-for-hire issue concluded today can serve as such a beginning, then it has served a useful purpose. 
   I commend this legislation to my colleagues. At this time I also wish to thank my colleagues in the House and Senate who have supported this legislation, and the recording artists and labels who have worked together on this legislation and who will begin the task  of exploring what more comprehensive settlement we might reach with regard to the status of sound recordings under the copyright law, which will allow them to continue their creative works.

I do not think it is absolutely essential, however. I also believe some of the greatest judges we have had, on the trial bench, the appellate bench, and on the Supreme Court, never stepped a day into a courtroom other than to be sworn into law to practice.

   Mr. HATCH. That isn't the situation. 
   Now, I have to say, I appreciate my two colleagues from Iowa in their very earnest defense, and really offense, in favor of Bonnie Campbell. She is a very nice woman and a very good person. Personally, I wish I could have gotten her through. But it isn't all this side's fault. As the Senator knows, things exploded here at the end because of continual filibusters on motions to proceed and misuse of the appointments clause, holds by Democrats, by the Democrat leader, on their own judges, and other problems that have arisen that always seem to arise in the last days. 
   So I apologize to the distinguished Senator I couldn't do a better job in getting her through. But I agree with him, and I felt obligated to stand and tell him I agreed with him, that some of our greatest judges who have ever served have never had a day in court. I might add, some of the worst who have ever served have never had a day in court also. I think it is only fair to make that clear. But there are also some pretty poor judges who have been trial lawyers, as well. So it isn't necessarily any particular experience.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I get a little tired of some of these comments about judges when we put through 377 Clinton-Gore judges, only 5 fewer than Ronald Reagan, the all-time high. I get a little tired of the anguishing. 
   There has never been, to my recollection, in my 24 years here, a time where we have not had problems at the end of a Presidential year. Whether the Democrats are in power or we are in power, there is always somebody, and others--quite a few people--who foul up the process. But that is where we are. And to further foul it up is just not in the cards.

   Mr. HATCH. I would note that the Reagan and Bush nominations that Senate Democrats allowed to expire Congresses included the nominations of minorities and women, such as Lillian BeVier, Frederic Moreno, and Judy Hope. 
   I do not have any personal objection to the judicial nominees who my Democratic colleagues have spoken about over the last few weeks. I am sure that they are all fine people. Similarly, I do not think that my Democratic colleagues had any personal objections to the 53 judicial nominees whose nominations expired in 1992, a the end of the Bush presidency. 
   Many of the Republican nominees whose confirmations were blocked by the Democrats have gone on to great careers both in public service and the private sector. Senator JEFF SESSIONS, Governor Frank Keating, and Washington attorney John Roberts are just a few examples that come to mind. 
   I know that it is small comfort to the individuals whose nominations are pending, but the fact of the matter is that inevitably some nominations will expire when the Congress adjourns. I happens every two years. I personally believe that Senate Republicans should get some credit for keeping the number of vacancies that will die at the end of this Congress relatively low. As things now stand, 13 fewer nominations will expire at the end this year than expired at the end of the Bush Presidency. 
   Madam President, I rise today to express my pride and gratitude that the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 will pass the Senate today and soon become law. This important legislation provides tools that will help women in Utah and around the country who are victims of domestic violence break away from dangerous and destructive relationships and begin living their lives absent of fear. 
   I commend all of my fellow Senators and colleagues in the House of Representatives with whom I worked to ensure the Violence Against Women Act is reauthorized through the year 2005. The Republican and Democratic Senators and Representatives who worked to make sure that this legislation passed understood and understand that violence knows no boundaries and it can affect the lives of everyone. 
   This has been a truly bipartisan effort of which everyone can be extremely proud. Specifically, I thank Senator JOSEPH BIDEN for his unyielding commitment to this bill. His leadership and dedication has ensured VAWA's passage. I must say, though, that all along I remained more optimistic than he that we would pass this bill I promised him we would. 
   I want to take a moment to briefly summarize some of the important provisions in this legislation. First, the bill reauthorizes through fiscal year 2005 the key programs included in the original Violence Against Women Act, such as the STOP and Pro-Arrest grant programs. The STOP grant program has succeeded in bringing police and prosecutors, working in close collaboration with victim services providers, into the fight to end violence against women. The STOP grants were revised to engage State courts in fighting violence against women by targeting funds to be used by these courts for the training and education of court personnel, technical assistance, and technological improvements. 
   The Pro-Arrest grants have helped to develop and strengthen programs and policies that mandate and encourage police officers to arrest abusers who commit acts of violence or violate protection orders. These grants have been expanded to include expressly the enforcement of protection orders as a focus for the grant program funds. The  changes also make the development and enhancement of data collection and sharing systems to promote enforcement of protection orders a funding priority. Another improvement requires recipients of STOP and Pro-Arrest grant funds, as a condition of funding, to facilitate the filing and service of protection orders without cost to the victim in both civil and criminal cases. 
   Additionally, the legislation reauthorizes the National Domestic Violence Hotline and rape prevention and education grant programs. It also contains three victims of child abuse programs, including the court-appointed special advocate program. The Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement Grants are reauthorized through 2005. This direct grant program, which focuses on problems particular to rural areas, will specifically help Utah and other states and local governments with large populations living in rural areas. 
   Second, the legislation includes targeted improvements that our experience with the original Act has shown to be necessary. For example, VAWA authorizes grants for legal assistance for victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. It provides funding for transitional housing assistance, an extremely crucial complement to the shelter program, which was suggested early on by persons in my home state of Utah. It also improves full faith and credit enforcement and computerized tracking of protection orders by prohibiting notification of a batterer without the victim's consent when an out-of-state order is registered in a new jurisdiction. Another important addition to the legislation expands several key grant programs to cover violence that arises in dating relationships. Finally, it makes important revisions to the immigration laws to protect battered immigrant women. 
   There is no doubt that women and children in my home state of Utah will benefit from the improvements made in this legislation. Mr. President, this is the type of legislation that can effect positive changes in the lives of all Americans. It provides assistance to battered women and their children when they need it the most. It provides hope to those whose lives have been shattered by domestic violence. 
   I am proud to have worked with the women's groups in Utah and elsewhere in seeing that VAWA is reauthorized. With their help, we have been able to make targeted improvements to the original legislation that will make crucial services better and more available to women and children who are trapped in relationships of terror. I am proud of this achievement and what it will do to save the lives of victims of domestic violence. 
   In closing, I again want to thank Senators BIDEN and ABRAHAM, Congressman BILL MCCOLLUM, and Congresswoman CONNIE MORELLA for their leadership on and dedication to the issue of domestic violence. Legislators from both sides of the aisle in both Houses of Congress have been committed to ensuring that this legislation becomes law. I am proud to have worked with my fellow legislators to achieve this goal, which will bring much needed assistance to the victims of domestic violence. 
   Madam President, I am not just talking about violence against women legislation and the work that Senator BIDEN and I have done through the years to make it a reality. I actually worked very hard in my home State to make sure we have women-in-jeopardy programs, battered women shelters, psychiatric children programs, and other programs of counseling, so that they can be taken care of in conjunction with the Violence Against Women Act and the moneys we put up here. In fact, we hold an annual charitable golf tournament that raises between $500,000 and $700,000 a year, most of which goes for seed money to help these women-in-jeopardy programs, children's psychiatric, and other programs in ways that will help our society and families. 
   I believe in this bill. I believe it is something we should do. I think everybody ought to vote for it, and I hope, no matter what happens today, we pass this bill, get it into law, and do what is right for our women and children--and sometimes even men who are also covered by this bill because it is neutral. But I hope we all know that it is mostly women who suffer. I hope we can get this done and do it in a way that really shows the world what a great country we live in and how much we are concerned about women, children, families, and doing something about some of the ills and problems that beset us. 
   How much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, let me use 1 more minute, and I will make a couple more comments. I want to express my strong support for the underlying bill in this conference report dealing with victims of sex trafficking. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee, led by Senators BROWNBACK and WELLSTONE for much of this past summer, on the significant criminal and immigration provisions in this legislation. This is an important measure that will strengthen the ability of law enforcement to combat international sex trafficking and provide needed assistance to the victims of such trafficking. 
   I think we can all be very proud of this effort. 
   Before I conclude, Mr. President, I want to thank all of the committed staff members on both sides of the aisle and on several committees for their talented efforts to get this legislation done. 
   First, on Senator BIDEN'S staff, I thank Alan Hoffman, chief of Staff for his tireless commitment, as well as current counsel Bonnie Robin-Vergeer and former counsel Sheryl Walters. They are truly professionals. 
   On Senator ABRAHAM'S staff, I'd like to thank Lee Otis, and her counterpart on Senator KENNEDY's staff, Esther Olavarria. 
   On the Foreign Relations Committee, I'd like to express my thanks to staff Director Biegun and the committed staffs of Senator BROWNBACK and WELLSTONE, including Sharon Payt and Karen Knutson. 
   And finally, Mr. President, there are many dedicated people on my own staff who deserve special recognition. I thank my chief counsel and staff director, Manus Cooney, as well as Sharon Prost, Maken Delrahim, and Leah Belaire.

   Mr. HATCH. The sex trafficking conference report also contains legislation known as ``Aimee's law.'' The purpose of Aimee's law is to encourage States to keep murderers, rapists, and child molesters incarcerated for long prison terms. Last year, a similar version of Aimee's law passed the Senate 81 to 17, and Aimee's law passed the House of Representatives 412 to 15. 
   This legislation withholds Federal funds from certain States that fail to incarcerate criminals convicted of murder, rape, and dangerous sexual offenses for adequate prison terms. Aimee's law operates as follows: In cases in which a State convicts a person of murder, rape, or a dangerous sexual offense, and that person has a prior conviction for any one of those offenses in a designated State, the designated State must pay, from Federal law enforcement assistance funds, the incarceration and prosecution cost of the other State. In such cases, the Attorney General would transfer the Federal law enforcement funds from the designated State to the subsequent State.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would be happy to consider this issue after next year and examine the legislation's impact on small wineries. I respect my colleagues from California's commitment to their constituents. I  must reemphasize, however, that this legislation does nothing to hurt the so-called small wineries in competing or marketing their products in the wine business. I worked hard for over a year with the wine industry to ensure that the legislation does not have any unintended consequences, and want to reassure my colleague from California that the version of the legislation that is included in the conference report incorporates revisions made in the committee to address both the Wine Institute's and the American Vintners Association's concerns. We also included language to further clarify that this bill does not, even unintentionally, somehow change the balancing test employed by the courts in reviewing state liquor laws. I should also not that the Wine Institute and the Vintners Association, as well as numerous Internet commerce companies, have written us that they no longer oppose the legislation. 
   The simple purpose of this bill is to provide a mechanism to enable States to effectively enforce their laws against the illegal interstate shipment of alcoholic beverages. I hope the distinguished Senator from California knows that while I certainly believe that interstate commerce should be encouraged, and while I do not want small businesses stifled by unnecessary or overly burdensome and complex regulations, I do not subscribe to the notion that purveyors of alcohol are free to avoid State laws which are consistent with the power bestowed upon them by the Constitution--and I should add that I don't think that Senator BOXER subscribes to that notion either. 
   Let me emphasize that there are many companies engaged in the direct interstate shipment of alcohol who do not violate State laws. In fact, many of these concerns look beyond their own interests and make diligent efforts to disseminate information to others to ensure that State laws are understood and complied with by all within the interstate industry. This legislation only reaches those that violate the law, and only allows the attorney general of a state to go to Federal court to enforce its laws. It is just a jurisdictional legislation and does not allow or prohibit any sales or marketing by any winery, large or small. 
   Having said that, I do hear the concerns by Senator BOXER and am willing to consider the impact of this legislation after the law has been on the books for a year or so, as my colleague has asked. I look forward to working with her to insure that this legislation does not harm small wineries which comply with the law.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the last several weeks I have listened as some of my Democratic colleagues have taken the Senate floor to complain about the Senate's work on judicial nominations. Some have complained that there is a vacancy crisis in the federal courts. Some have complained that the Republican  Senate has not confirmed enough of President Clinton's judicial nominees. Some have complained that the confirmation record of the Republican Senate compares unfavorably to the Democrats' record when they controlled this body. Some have accused the Republican Senate of being biased against female and minority judicial nominees. These complaints and accusations are wholly false and completely without merit. 
   First, there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis. In 1994, when Senate Democrats processed the nominations of President Clinton, there were 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate. Today, when Republicans control the Senate and process the nominations of President Clinton, there are 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate--exactly the same as in 1994. Of the current vacancies, the President has failed to make a nomination for 25 of them--strong evidence that, in fact, there is no vacancy crisis. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there are the same number of vacancies and the same vacancy rate now as in 1994, Democrats continue to claim that there is a vacancy crisis. 
   Second, the Republican Senate has been fair with President Clinton in confirming his nominees. In fact, the Senate has confirmed President Clinton's nominees at almost an identical rate as it confirmed those of Presidents Reagan and Bush. President Reagan appointed 382 Article III judges. By comparison, President Clinton has appointed 377 Article III judges--only five fewer than were appointed by President Reagan. During the Reagan presidency, the Senate confirmed an average of 191 judges per term. During the one-term Bush presidency, the Senate confirmed 193 judges. During the Clinton presidency, the Senate has confirmed an average of 189 judges per term. 
   Third, the confirmation record of the Republican Senate compares favorably to the Democrats' record when they controlled this body. Comparing like to like, this year should be compared to prior election years during times of divided government. In 1988, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 41 Reagan judicial nominees. The Republican Senate this year has confirmed 39 of President Clinton's nominees--a nearly identical number. 
   The 1992 election year requires a bit more analysis. The Democrat-controlled Senate did confirm 64 Bush nominees that year, but this high number was due to the fact that Congress had recently created 85 new judgeships. Examining the percentage of nominees confirmed shows that compared to 1992, there is no slowdown this year. In 1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 33 of 73 individuals nominated that year--or 45 percent. This year, the Senate has confirmed 25 of 46 individuals nominated in 2000--or 54 percent, almost 10 percent higher than in 1992. Those who cite the 1992 high of 64 confirmations as evidence of an election-year slowdown do not mention these details. Nor do they mention that despite those 64 confirmations, the Democrat-controlled Senate left vacant 97 judgeships when President Bush left office--far more than the current 63 vacancies. 
   Senate Democrats often cite Chief Justice Rehnquist's 1997 remarks as evidence of a Republican slowdown. Referring to the 82 vacancies then existing, the Chief Justice said: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal Judiciary.'' Senators who cite this statement, however, do not also cite the Chief Justice's similar statement in 1993, when the Democrats controlled both the White House and the Senate: ``There is perhaps no issue more important to the judiciary right now than this serious judicial vacancy problem.'' As the head of the Judicial Branch, the Chief Justice has continued to maintain pressure on the President and Senate to speedily confirm judges. He has not singled out the Republican Senate, however. 
   The Chief Justice made additional comments in 1997, which also undermine the claim of a vacancy crisis. After calling attention to the existing vacancies, he wrote: ``Fortunately for the Judiciary, a dependable corps of senior judges has contributed significantly to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships.'' The 63 current vacancies, in other words, are not truly vacant. There are 363 senior judges presently serving in the federal judiciary. Although judges' seats are technically counted as vacant, they continue to hear cases at reduced workload. Assuming that they maintain a 25 percent workload--the minimum required by law--the true number of vacancies is less than zero. 
   Last week, Senator HARKIN said that this year the Senate has confirmed only one circuit court nominee nominated this year, and Senator LEAHY said that this year the Judiciary Committee has reported only three circuit court nominees nominated this year. The fact is, however, the Senate has confirmed eight circuit judges this year. By comparison, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed seven of President Reagan's circuit court nominees in 1988 and 11 of President Bush's circuit court nominees in 1992. 
   It is true that of the eight circuit court nominees confirmed this year, some were nominated during the first session and some were nominated during the second session of this Congress--just as the seven Reagan circuit court nominees confirmed in 1988 and the 11 Bush circuit court nominees confirmed in 1992 were nominated in both the first and second sessions of those Congresses. 
   The fact that the Senate has confirmed eight circuit court nominees in this election year shows that we have been at least as fair to President Clinton with regard to appeals court nominees, as Democrats were to Presidents Reagan and Bush. The Senate has confirmed one more circuit court nominee in this last year of President Clinton's Presidency than Democrats confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's presidency, and only three circuit judges fewer than Democrats confirmed in the last year of President Bush's presidency--when judicial vacancies were at an all time high. 
   Fourth, allegations of race or sex bias in the confirmation process are absolutely false and are offensive. Over the last several months, I have listened with dismay as some have, with escalating invective, implied that Senate Republicans are biased against minority or female judicial nominees. 
   Just this month, President Clinton issued a statement alleging bias by the Senate. He said: ``The quality of justice suffers when highly qualified women and minority candidates are denied an opportunity to serve in the judiciary.'' The White House, though, also issued a statement boasting of the high number of women and minorities that Clinton has appointed to the federal courts: ``The President's record of appointing women and minority judges is unmatched by any President in history. Almost half of President Clinton's judicial appointees 
   have been women or minorities.'' 
   The Senate, obviously, confirmed this record number of women and minorities. That is hardly evidence of systemic bias. Indeed, it cannot credibly be argued that President Clinton has appointed a diverse federal bench and that Republicans simultaneously have prevented him from appointing a diverse federal bench. 
   Last November, Senator JOSEPH BIDEN, former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, stated:  
   There has been argumentation occasionally made.......that [the Judiciary] Committee.......has been reluctant to move on certain people based upon gender or ethnicity or race........[T]here is absolutely no distinction made [on these grounds].......[W]hether or not [a nominee moves] has not a single thing to do with gender or race........I realize I will get political heat for saying that, but it happens to be true.  
   Why then have Democrats insisted on repeating the insidious mantra that the Republican Senate is discriminating against women and minorities in the confirmation process? Why did John Podesta, the President's Chief of Staff appear on CNN yesterday to complain that ``women and minority candidates for U.S. Court of Appeals are sitting, stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee''? Why did Senator Robb take the Senate floor to accuse Senate Republicans, in inflammatory language, of ``standing in the courthouse door'' and refusing to ``desegregate the Fourth Circuit''? Why did Senator Leahy take the Senate floor and list all the female nominees currently pending? 
   Why? Because Democrats have made the crass political decision to attempt to energize women and minority voters by claiming that Senate Republicans are biased against women and minorities nominated for federal judgeships. This coordinated overture to female and minority voters by the White House, the Gore campaign and Senate Democrats is unseemly.  
   The President's determination to play politics with judicial nominations appears as if it will only intensify. Just last Friday, the President nominated African-American Andre Davis to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and it is my understanding that he will nominate a woman, Elizabeth Gibson, to that Court today. 
   The President has persisted in making these nominations, even though I have made clear to him that the Judiciary Committee will not hold any additional nominations hearing this year. The President nominated Mr. Davis and Ms. Gibson, knowing full well that they have no chance of being confirmed. Mr. Davis and Ms. Gibson are being used for political purposes, so the President and Democrats can argue that Senate Republicans are biased against women and minorities. 
   Senate Republicans, however, are not biased against women and minority nominees. Data comparing the median time required for Senate action on male vs. female and minority vs. non-minority nominees shows only minor differences. During President Bush's final two years in office, the Democrat-controlled Senate took 16 days longer to confirm female nominees compared with males. This differential decrease to only 4 days when Republicans gained control of the Senate in 1994. During the subsequent 105th and 106th Congresses, it increased. 
   The data concerning minority nominees likewise shows no clear trend. When Republicans gained control in 1994, it took 28 days longer to confirm minority nominees as compared to non-minority nominees. This difference decreased markedly during the 105th Congress so that minorities were confirmed 10 days faster than non-minorities. The present 106th Congress is taking 
   only 11 days longer to confirm minority nominees than it is to confirm non-minority nominees. 
   These minor differences are a matter of happenstance. They show no clear trend. Senator BIDEN is right when he says that ``whether or not [a nominee moves] has not a single thing to do with gender or race.'' And even if there were actual differences, a differential of a week or two is insignificant compared to the average time that it takes to select and confirm a nominee. On average, the Clinton White House spends an average of 315 days to select a nominee while the Senate requires an average of 144 days to confirm. 
   Under my stewardship, the Judiciary Committee has considered President Clinton's judicial nominees more carefully than the Democratic Senate did in 1993 and 1994. Some individuals confirmed by the Senate then likely would not clear the committee today. The Senate's power of advice and consent, after all, is not a rubber stamp. 
   There is no evidence, however, of bias or of a confirmation slowdown. There is no evidence of bias because, in fact, the Senate is not biased against female and minority nominees--indeed, the Senate has confirmed a record number of such nominees for judicial office. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a confirmation slowdown because, in fact, the confirmation process has been conducted in the normal fashion and at the normal speed.

   Mr. HATCH. I would note that the Reagan and Bush nominations that Senate Democrats allowed to expire included the nominations of minorities and women, such as Lillian BeVier, Frederico Moreno and Judy Hope. 
   I do not have any personal objection to the judicial nominees who my Democratic colleagues have spoken about over the last few weeks. I am sure that they are all fine people. Similarly, I do not think that my Democratic colleagues had any personal objections to the 53 judicial nominees whose nominations expired in 1992, at the end of the Bush presidency. 
   Many of the Republican nominees whose confirmations were blocked by the Democrats have gone on to great careers both in public service and the private sector. Senator JEFF SESSIONS, Governor Frank Keating and Washington attorney John Roberts are just a few examples that come to mind. 
   I know that it is small comfort to the individuals whose nominations are pending, but the fact of the matter is that inevitably some nominations will expire when the Congress adjourns. It happens every two years. I personally believe that Senate Republicans should get some credit for keeping the number of vacancies that will die at the end of this Congress relatively low. As things now stand, 13 fewer nominations will expire at the end of this year than expired at the end of the Bush Presidency.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is often said that Canada and the U.S. share the longest undefended border in the world. While this is repeated so often it has become a cliche, like all cliches, there is a fundamental truth in it. In this case, the fundamental truth is a striking geopolitical reality which Americans do not always appreciate. The peace we enjoy in North America is largely a function of this border. 
   With our neighbor to the north, we share a border of approximately 4,000 miles, a border that runs through New England and the Great Lakes, through the great forests, plains, and mountains, and along the Alaskan frontier of this rich North American continent. Mutually respected sovereignty is the fundamental basis of peaceful international discourse. But I will add that an undefended border makes for the warmest of relations, and the greatest of respect. 
   Last Thursday, Canada lost perhaps its best known Prime Minister of recent times, when Pierre Elliott Trudeau died, at the age of 80. For the past week, our neighbors to the north have been in mourning, and I stand today to pay my respects to the family of former Prime Minister Trudeau and to all the citizens of the country he served with singular dedication. 
   Mr. Trudeau and I did not share a common political tradition, nor did we share a political ideology. This does not diminish my respect for the man and his work one bit. I note, with appreciation, that one of Mr. Trudeau's mottos was ``reason before passion,'' a principle I certainly believe conservative lawmakers would share. 
   I admired former Prime Minister Trudeau for his dedication to his country, to the rule of law, and to the betterment of the world. In his moving tribute at his father's funeral earlier this week, Justin Trudeau said, ``My father's fundamental belief never came from a textbook, it stemmed from his deep love and faith in all Canadians.'' 
   Pierre Trudeau led Canada at a tumultuous time in its history and in the history of the world. In 1970, he was confronted with a terrorist, separatist threat from Quebecois extremists. Prime Minister Trudeau--who, in Canadian history, was at the time, only its third of Quebecois descent himself--was a dedicated federalist and, even more fundamentally, dedicated to the rule of law. He faced down the terrorists, and since then issues of separatism have been dealt with at the ballot box. While he successfully defended the rule of law, Canadians recognize the advances he instituted to preserve Canada's unique cultural diversity. 
   Mr. Trudeau had a different view of geopolitics than did most of the American administrations with which he dealt. It is said that he succeeded, at times, in aggravating U.S. presidents from Nixon to Reagan. 
   Some of this had to do, in my opinion, with the nature of the relationship between our countries. While Canada is the second largest political land-mass in the world, its population is small, approximately one-tenth of ours, and its economy is dwarfed by ours. In fact, the former Prime Minister famously said once: ``Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.'' 
   While Mr. Trudeau held substantively different views on the world than many American leaders, he demonstrated that policy disputes can exist and nations remain civilized and respectful. And that is how I think of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. 
   In closing, I wish to note another story his son, Justin, told at his father's funeral this week. He recounted how, as a child, his father took him one day for lunch at the cafeteria in Ottawa's Parliament. There, young Justin saw a political rival of his father and made a childish crack about him to his dad. His father sternly rebuked him and, according to his son, said ``You never attack the person. You may be in total disagreement with the person; however, you shouldn't denigrate him.'' That day, Pierre Trudeau taught his son, who is now a teacher, that ``having different opinions from those of another person should in no way stop you from holding them in the greatest respect possible as people.'' 
   That is the principle of a civilized man, and the practice of a civilized nation. As the world bids adieu to Pierre Trudeau, I extend my deepest condolences to his family and to all the good citizens of our great neighbor Canada.

   Mr. HATCH. This is a very important bill. This is a bill that both sides have said they wanted for a long time. I have to say it is pitiful that we had to go through three cloture votes because it was filibustered three times. Even the motion to proceed was filibustered by colleagues on the other side. They have tried to make this into a political brouhaha which it doesn't deserve. Further, when they also brought up a bill that they did not even file until July 25 of this year, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which is anything but fair. They brought that up and asked, without hearings, without 1 minute of consultation, that we have a rolling amnesty for up to 2 million illegal aliens--perhaps even more than that; certainly they admit to at least 500,000. It shows the length to which politics can go in this body. 
   I am glad we are at this point. It took continual effort by our leader to push this bill through. There were many times when we thought we might have to pull it down because of the opposition from the other side. 
   But today, I look forward to an overwhelming vote this morning on this important, bipartisan bill and hope that by week's end, the House of Representatives will have acted favorably and with dispatch as well. 
   One of our greatest priorities, Mr. President, is and ought to be keeping our economy vibrant, and expanding educational opportunities for America's children and its workers. That is my priority for this country and for my own State of Utah. 
   I am proud of the growth and development in my own State that has made Utah one of the leaders of the country and the world in our high tech economy. 
   In Utah and elsewhere, however, our continued economic growth, and our competitive edge in the world economy requires an adequate supply of highly skilled high tech workers. This remains one of our great challenges in the 21st century, requiring both short and long term solutions. The legislation we will pass today, S. 2405, addresses both of these challenges. 
   Specifically, a tight labor market, increasing globalization, and a burgeoning economy have combined to increase demand for skilled workers well beyond what was forecast when Congress last addressed the issue of temporary visas for highly skilled workers in 1998. Therefore, this legislation once again increases the annual cap for this year and the next three years. 
   But increasing the number of H-1B visas is nothing more than a short term solution to the workforce needs in my State and the country. The long term solution lies with our own children and our own workers. Our continued success in this global economy depends on our ability to ensure that education and training for our current and future workforce matches the demands in our high tech 21st century global economy. Working with my colleagues, I have included in this bill strong, effective, and forward looking provisions directing the several hundred million dollars in fees expected to be generated by the visas toward the education and retraining of our children and our workforce. Those provisions are included in the substitute which is before us today. 
   Mr. President there are many to whom I want to express my gratitude this morning. This legislation had, from the beginning, an effective group of Senators at the forefront. That included Senator ABRAHAM, a leader on this issue for many years, as well as Senator GRAMM from Texas. On the other side of the aisle, we were joined early on by Senators GRAHAM, FEINSTEIN, and LIEBERMAN, and all have continued their commitment to the continued improvement of our bill. And finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator KENNEDY for his hard work and his tireless dedication to ensuring effective training provisions in this bill for American workers. I would be remiss were I not to also mention Senator PAT LEAHY--the committee's ranking member. He approached this bill in the spirit of bipartisanship and facilitated its consideration both here on the floor and in committee.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 
   let me just take a minute to respond to some of the comments of my colleague, Senator LEAHY. The so-called Latino Fairness Act has little to do with fairness for immigrants. This is no limited measure to undo a previous wrong to a limited class of immigrants who otherwise might have been eligible for amnesty under the 1986 act. In fact, it is a major new amnesty program with a price tag of almost $1.4 billion. That has major implications for our national policy on immigration. 
   The bill purports to be about ``immigrant fairness,'' but it does nothing to increase or preserve the categories of legal immigrants allowed in this country annually. It does nothing to shorten the long waiting period or remove the hurdles for persons who have waited years to legally enter this country. This so-called Latino fairness is no fairness at all to the millions of immigrants who have and will continue to play by the rules. 
   Moreover, the bill does not even fix a date for the registry. Rather it allows a rolling amnesty. What kind of signal does this send? Our government spends millions each year to combat illegal immigrant and deports thousands of persons each year. With the rolling amnesty, however, if an illegal alien can manage to escape law enforcement for long enough we reward that person with citizenship, or at least permanent resident status. 
   Finally, it should be noted that all of these dramatic changes were proposed in July of this year with no hearings and with no assessment of competing costs and benefits. The Senate appropriately refused to consider this bill because its many consequences were not addressed by its proponents. 
   We are proud of the fine bipartisan work that went into the H-1B visa bill and welcome its passage.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are here today in the crunch of end-of-session business to debate and take time on four noncontroversial judicial nominees. This debate today was demanded by Senate Democrats who, ironically, have stood in the way of these nominations made by President Clinton, their own President. These are Clinton nominees the Democrats are holding up, Clinton nominees whom Democrats are insisting we take precious time to debate. 
   For the past few years, Senate Democrats have threatened shutdowns, claimed the existence of a so-called judicial vacancy crisis, and complained of race and sex bias in order to push through President Clinton's judicial nominees. These allegations are false. 
   First, there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis. consider, for example, the Clinton administration's statements on this issue. At the end of the 1994 Senate session, the Clinton administration in a press release entitled ``Record Number of Federal Judges Confirmed'' took credit for having achieved a low vacancy rate. At that time, there were 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate. The Clinton administration's press release declared: ``This is equivalent to `full employment' in the . . . federal judiciary.'' Today, there are 67 vacancies--after the votes today there will be only 63 vacancies, the same as in the 1994. Instead of declaring the judiciary fully employed as they did in 1994. Democrats claim that there is a vacancy crisis. 
   In fact, the Senate has confirmed President Clinton's nominees at almost the same rate as it confirmed those of Presidents Reagan and Bush. President Reagan appointed 382 Article III judges. Thus far, the Senate has confirmed 373 of President Clinton's nominees and, after the votes today, will have confirmed four more. During President Reagan's two terms, the Senate confirmed an average of 191 judges. During President Bush's one term, the Senate confirmed 193 judges. After these four judges are confirmed today, the Senate will have confirmed an average of 189 judges during each of President Clinton's two terms. 
   Second, there has not been a confirmation slowdown this year. Comparing like to like, this year should be compared to prior election years during times of divided government. In 1988, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 41 Reagan judicial nominees. After these four nominees are confirmed today, the Republican Senate this year will have confirmed 39 of President Clinton's nominees--a nearly identical number. 
   In May, at a Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator BIDEN, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said: ``I have told everyone, and I want to tell the press, if the Republican Party lets through more than 30 judges  this year, I will buy you all dinner.'' When he said this, Senator BIDEN apparently believed that the confirmation this year of more than 30 judges would be fair. Well Senator BIDEN owes some people some dinners, maybe everybody in the press. After the votes today, the Senate this year will have confirmed 39 judicial nominees. 
   The 1992 election year requires a bit more analysis. 
   The Democrat-controlled Senate did confirm 64 Bush nominees that year, but this high number was due to the fact that Congress had recently created 85 new judgeships. Examining the percentage of nominees confirmed shows that compared to 1992, there is no slowdown this year. In 1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 33 of 73 individuals nominated that year--or 45 percent. This year, the Senate will confirm 25 of 44 individuals nominated in 2000--or 57 percent. Those who cite the 1992 high of 64 confirmations as evidence of an election-year slowdown do not mention these details. Nor do they mention that despite those 64 confirmations, the Democrat-controlled Senate left vacant 115 judgeships when President Bush left office--nearly double the current number of vacancies. 
   Senate Democrats often cite Chief Justice Rehnquist's 1997 remarks as evidence of a Republican slowdown. Referring to the 82 vacancies then existing, the Chief Justice said: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal Judiciary.'' Senators who cite this statement, however, do not also cite the Chief Justice's similar statement in 1993, when the Democrats controlled both the White House and the Senate: ``There is perhaps no issue more important to the judiciary right now than this serious judicial vacancy problem.'' As the head of the judicial branch, the Chief Justice has continued to maintain pressure on the President and Senate to speedily confirm judges. He has not singled out the Republican Senate, however. Selective use of his statements to imply that he has is inappropriate. 
   The Chief Justice made additional comments in 1997, which also undermine the claim of a vacancy crisis. After calling attention to the existing vacancies, he wrote: ``Fortunately for the Judiciary, a dependable corps of senior judges has contributed significantly to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships.'' The 67 current vacancies, in other words, are not truly vacant. There are 363 senior judges presently serving in the federal judiciary. Although these judges' seats are technically counted as vacant, they continue to hear cases at reduced workload. Assuming that they maintain a 25 percent workload (the minimum required by law), the true number of vacancies is less than zero. 
   Third, allegations of race or sex bias in the confirmation process are absolutely false. Just this month, for example, President Clinton issued a statement alleging bias by the Senate. He said: ``The quality of justice suffers when highly qualified women and minority candidates are denied an opportunity to serve in the judiciary.'' The White House, though, also issued a statement boasting of the high number of women and minorities that Clinton has appointed to the federal courts: ``The President's record of appointing women and minority judges is unmatched by any President in history. Almost half of President Clinton's judicial appointees have been women or minorities.'' The Senate, obviously, confirmed this record number of women and minorities. That is hardly evidence of systemic bias--or any bias at all. 
   Last November, Senator JOSEPH BIDEN, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, stated:  
   There has been argumentation occasionally made ..... that [the Judiciary] Committee ..... has been reluctant to move on certain people based upon gender or ethnicity or race. ..... [T]here is absolutely no distinction made [on these grounds]. ..... [W]hether or not [a nominee moves] has not a single thing to do with gender or race. ..... I realize I will get political heat for saying that, but it happens to be true.  
   I personally appreciated Senator BIDEN's comments on that, while others were trying to play politics with these issues. He knows how difficult it is under the circumstances to please both sides on these matters. The chairman takes pain from both sides on these matters. There is no question there are some on our side who have wanted to slow down this process, and others on the other side have wanted to speed up the process. The important thing is that we do a good process. That is what we have tried to do. 
   The statistics confirm Senator BIDEN's position. Data comparing the median time required for Senate action on male versus female and minority versus non-minority nominees shows only minor differences. During President Bush's final two years in office, the Democrat-controlled Senate took 16 days longer to confirm female nominees compared with males. This differential decreased to only 4 days when Republicans gained control of the Senate in 1994. During the subsequent 105th and 106th Congresses, it increased. 
   The data concerning minority nominees likewise shows no clear trend. When Republicans gained control in 1994, it took 28 days longer to confirm minority nominees as compared to non-minority nominees. This difference decreased markedly during the 105th Congress so that minorities were confirmed 10 days faster than non-minorities. The present 106th Congress is taking only 11 days longer to confirm a minority nominees than it is to confirm non-minority nominees. 
   These minor differences are a matter of happenstance. They show no clear trend. And even if there were actual differences, a differential of a week or two is insignificant compared to the average time that it takes to select and confirm a nominee. On average, the Clinton White House spends an average of 315 days to select a nominee while the Senate requires an average of 144 days to confirm. 
   Under my stewardship, the Judiciary Committee has considered President Clinton's judicial nominees more carefully than the Democratic Senate did in 1993 and 1994. Some individuals confirmed by the Senate then likely would not clear the committee today. The Senate's power of advice and consent, after all, is not a rubber stamp. 
   But there is no evidence of bias or of a confirmation slowdown. Senate Democrats claim that Republicans have politicized the confirmation process. Republicans, though, have not levied false charges or used petty parliamentary games. 
   In conclusion, it always is the case that some nominations die at the end of the Congress. In 1992, when Democrats controlled the Senate, Congress adjourned without having acted on 53 Bush nominations. Currently there are only 38 Clinton nominations that are pending before the Judiciary Committee. 
   It is not the end of the line for nominees that do not get confirmed this year. Republican nominees who failed to get confirmed have bone on to great careers, both in public service and the private sector. Senator JEFF SESSIONS, Governor Frank Keating, Washington attorney John Roberts, and law professor Lillian BeVier are just a few examples. 
   Lillian BeVier and a number of other women are prime examples of those who were denied the opportunity of being on the court for one reason or another back in those days. 
   I bitterly resent anybody trying to play politics with this issue. I stand ready to defend our position on the Judiciary Committee, and I look forward to confirming these last four nominees today. And, of course, once we have done that, we will have matched what was done back in 1994, when the President said we had a full judiciary, with a vacancy of 7.4 percent. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I must respond to the remarks of Senator ROBB and Senator HARKIN. 
   With regard to the nomination of Roger L. Gregory, the position for which Mr. Gregory has been nominated has been vacant since it was created in 1990. Before nominating Mr. Gregory, the President had not even submitted a name to the Senate for this position in almost 5 years. 
   Despite the longstanding vacancy of this judgeship, the work of the Fourth Circuit has not been adversely affected. 
   Moreover, when the President did submit a name to the Senate for disposition almost 5 years ago, he submitted the name of a resident of North Carolina, J. Rich Leonard. In doing so, the President effectively agreed that this seat should be filled by a North Carolinian.

   Mr. HATCH. The President effectively agreed this seat should be filled by a North Carolinian. By nominating Roger Gregory, a Virginian, for the seat instead of a North Carolinian, the President sought to avoid the traditional practice of seeking the ``advice and consent'' of the Senators from the State where the judgeship is located about which local lawyer should be nominated. 
   It is very late in the session to be considering a circuit court nomination. Some nominations can move through the confirmation process quickly, but only where the White House has dealt with the Senate on nominations in good faith. The Arizona nominations we are debating today moved through the confirmation process quickly because the White House did work closely with Senator KYL and negotiated in good faith over which Arizonans should get these lifetime appointments. 
   In contrast, the White House has not dealt with the Senate on nominations in good faith. During our August recess, the President determined to recess appoint several executive branch officials over the express objections of numerous Senators. Furthermore, Democrats stood in the way of these four nominees we are debating today, the President's nominees, and they threatened to shut down the work of the Senate. This is hardly good faith. In fact, it was a Democrat hold--a Democrat hold by the minority leader on these four judges who are put forth by this President in accordance with an agreement worked out--that really caused a lot of angst on our side, plus the fact that these recess appointments that were made without consultation caused a lot of difficulty. Then we have virtually every bill filibustered, even on the motion to proceed. As a matter of fact, the H-1B bill, which just passed 96-1, had three 
   filibusters on it, from the motion to proceed right on up through final passage of 96-1. 
   I must respond to some of the things Senator ROBB said here this morning. He used some pretty incendiary language to imply that the Senate majority is biased against Mr. Gregory because he is an African American. Senator ROBB said we ``are standing in the courthouse door'' and are refusing to ``integrate'' the Fourth Circuit. These allegations of racial bias are beneath the dignity of a Senator in the U.S. Senate, and they are offensive and politically motivated. When Democrats blocked the nomination of Lillian BeVier to the Fourth Circuit--which is what they did--the first female nominee to the Fourth Circuit, no one on our side accused them of gender bias. 
   I am sure Roger Gregory is a fine man. I have no doubt about that. I have been told that by a number of friends of mine, including former Secretary Coleman. But I have informed my colleagues that because of the atmosphere that has resulted from the President's refusal to consult with the Senators from North Carolina, because of the President's recent recess appointments and disregard of commitments he had made up here, and disregard of the advice and consent because of the petty parliamentary games in which our friends on the other side have engaged, Mr. Gregory's nomination is not going to move forward. And because this is a North Carolina seat. We would have to have somebody nuts, from North Carolina, who would not stand up for a  North Carolinian in this seat. There is just no question about it. The President knew that, having nominated a North Carolinian before. 
   I would like to respond to Senator LEVIN for a few minutes. I don't want to go beyond that. There are other things I could say. But I bitterly resent anybody trying to play racial politics with judges, especially after what we went through in prior administrations. 
   It had always been my intention as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on judicial nominations during the month of September. I planned on doing that. At that hearing I was fully prepared to consider the nomination of some of these people, and perhaps even Helene White or Kathleen McCree Lewis to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A number of my colleagues were pressing very strongly for that. I wanted to try to resolve that if I could. 
   However, events conspired to prevent that from happening. First, during the August recess, the President determined to recess appoint several executive branch nominees over the express objection of numerous Senators. He did so notwithstanding the agreement to clear such recess appointments with the relevant Senators. We do not have much power around here in some ways against a President of the United States, but we can demand that he consult with us. These Senators are very aggrieved by the way they were treated on these appointments--I think rightly so. 
   Second, Democrat Senators determined to place holds on the four nominations we are debating today and threatened shutdowns of the Senate's committee work, going as far as to invoke the 2-hour rule and forcing the postponement of scheduled committee hearings, including the Wen Ho Lee hearing, which is an important hearing, a bipartisan hearing, for both sides to look at. 
   Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis have only the White House and Senate Democrats to blame for the current situation, I 
   might add, because of some of these petty procedural games we have been going through around here with filibusters of almost everything that comes up, or a threat to bring up all kinds of extraneous amendments if we do happen to bring a bill up that needs to be passed. 
   It is very late in the session to be considering a circuit court nomination. Some nominations can move through the confirmation process quickly, but only where the White House has dealt with the Senate, on nominations, in good faith. The Arizona nominations we are debating today moved through the confirmation process quickly because the White House worked closely with Senator KYL and others, and myself, and negotiated in good faith over which Arizonans should get these lifetime appointments. 
   Everybody knows there is a tremendous need along the southern border in Arizona to have these judges. There is a tremendous court docket there that needs these judges. Yet they have been delayed for 2 solid months almost. 
   In contrast, the White House and Senate Democrats have not dealt in good faith, given the President's recess appointments in August of several executive branch nominees over the express objection of numerous Senators and Senate Democrats' efforts to hold up these nominees and hold up the work of the Senate. 
   With regard to the nomination of Bonnie J. Campbell, in March, Bonnie Campbell was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. At the urging of Senator GRASSLEY, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing for Ms. Campbell in May. It had always been my intention for the Judiciary Committee to report Ms. Campbell's nomination. However, events conspired to prevent that from happening. 
   First, during the August recess, as I have explained, the President determined to recess appoint several executive branch nominees over the express objection of numerous Senators. He did so notwithstanding his agreement to clear such recess appointments with the relevant Senators. By the way, this type of an agreement arose out of Senator BYRD's objections in earlier Congresses. His objections were followed here on the part of people on our side of the aisle, and the President agreed to it and then violated that agreement. 
   Second, after the August recess, Democrat Senators determined to place holds on the four nominations we are debating today, even though everybody admits--I think everybody admits --that they are important nominations and this arrangement that has been worked out has been fair. 
   Again, they threatened to shut down the Senate's committee work, going as far as to invoke the 2-hour rule and enforce the postponement of scheduled committee hearings. And we went through that because of pique. For these reasons, Bonnie Campbell's nomination has stalled. Ms. Campbell has only the White House and Senate Democrats to blame for the current situation. 
   I might add, it did not help at all on our side for these petty filibusters on everything. It used to be when I got here, there might be one or two or three filibusters a year at the very most, and then they were on monumental issues that involved a wide disparity of belief. It was not every little motion to proceed, every little bill we were going to pass, like the one we just passed 96-1. To go through three filibuster cloture votes on that bill was beyond belief. But that irritated a lot of people. It made it more difficult to get these judges through. 
   Mr. HARKIN, the Senator from Iowa, claimed that his review of history led him to believe we are ``playing politics with the judges.'' I strongly disagree. In President Reagan's last year, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 41 nominees. After the votes today, the Senate this year will have confirmed 39 nominees. And there have been some indications there might be some games played with one of the four judges here today. If that is the case, boy, Katie bar the door, after what we have been trying to do here. 
   The committee worked sincerely to try to get these nominations out, and they have been here for quite a while. Finally, few nominees are confirmed when the White House and Senate are controlled by different political parties. From 1987 to 1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed an average of 46 Reagan and Bush nominees per year. Things changed when President Clinton was elected. In 1994, the Democrat-controlled Senate pushed through 100 Clinton nominees. They could not have done that without cooperation from Republicans, but they did that. 
   In 1992, at the end of the Bush administration when Democrats controlled the Senate, the vacancy rate stood at 11.5 percent. Now at the end of the Clinton administration the vacancy rate after the votes today will stand at just 7.4 percent. 
   Also in 1992, Congress adjourned without having acted on 53 Bush nominations, or should I say nominees who were sitting there waiting to be confirmed. After the votes today, there will be only 38 Clinton nominations that are pending. 
   Under both Democrats and Republicans, the Senate historically confirms 65 to 70 percent of the President's nominees. In his last 2 years, President Bush made 176 nominations, and the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed 122 of them, yielding a confirmation rate of 69 percent. During the last 2 years, President Clinton made 112 nominations, and after today's votes, the Senate will have confirmed 73 of them. He has a confirmation rate of almost the same, 65 percent. 
   In May, at a Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator BIDEN indicated he did not believe we would do even 30 judges this year. He is wrong. We will have now done, at the end of the day, 39 judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate. 
   There has been much debate today about everything but the four nominees we ostensibly are debating. I fully support these nominees and want to say a few words about them. They are supported by their home State Senators--Senators KYL, MCCAIN, FITZGERALD, and DURBIN.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Senate resolution commending Sydney, Australia on the success of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and congratulating the U.S. Olympic Team on their outstanding performance. 
   Once every two years, we have the great opportunity to witness the world's finest athletes display astonishing feats of speed, strength, flexibility and grace. There is no main event quite like the Olympics and the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, left a remarkable impression on all of us over the past several weeks.  
   On behalf of the United States Senate, I express deep appreciation to the city and residents of Sydney, Australia, for being such superb hosts for the Summer Olympic Games. Planning and organizing such a two-week, multi-venue event--which is immediately followed by the Paralympic Games--is a daunting and monumental task. The Australians can be extremely proud of their efforts, which, by all accounts, were extraordinary. 
   We in Salt Lake City will be striving to put on an Olympic Winter Games that equals Sydney in both efficiency and hospitality. 
   We can also be very proud of 
   the U.S. Olympic Team's outstanding accomplishments. Our athletes turned in exciting and memorable performances. All together, the U.S. Team earned 39 gold medals, 25 silver medals, and 33 bronze medals--a total of 97 medals, which was the most of any country! This demonstrates extraordinary commitment to excellence. These athletes trained hard just to participate at this level of sport; many sacrificed other pursuits to attain the honor of competing in this premier sporting competition--the Olympic Games. 
   There were many ``Olympic moments'' during these Games. For instance, who will ever forget Rulon Gardner, the Greco-Roman wrestler from Wyoming, who realized his Olympic dream by defeating the one-time invincible, and still great, Aleksandr Karelin, of Russia. Following the match, Gardner said, ``all I could do was do my best.'' Isn't that the beauty of the Olympic Games? Athletes all over the world giving it their all in competition against tremendous odds. 
   Who could forget Misty Hyman upsetting the world favorite Susie O'Neill in the 200 meter butterfly? Those of us watching on television could plainly sense the sheer surprise and joy of this achievement. 
   And, the athletes from other national teams captured our attention as well. Cathy Freeman of Australia, who stole the heart of her nation in the 400 meter race. China's Fu Mingxia, 
   who made an amazing comeback to win gold in diving. And, Aleksei Nemov, who celebrated the birth of his child by winning a gold medal in gymnastics. 
   I am very proud of the athletes from my home state of Utah, who represented our state with dignity and honor during the Olympic Games. 
   Marcus Jensen and Doug Mientkiewicz, both of the Utah Buzz, were members of the U.S. baseball team that defeated the heavily favored Cuban baseball team--the first time in Olympic history that the Cuban team did not win the gold medal in baseball. 
   Natalie Williams, also of Utah and a key player for the Utah Starzz, led the U.S. women's basketball team with 15 points in the Olympic basketball final to help the U.S. win its fourth gold medal in women's basketball since women's basketball became an Olympic sport in 1976. 
   But, the Olympics is not only about winning medals. Logan Tom, from Salt Lake City who now attends Stanford University, led the U.S. Women's volleyball team to a terrific--and unexpected--fourth place finish. None of the sports handicappers gave this team much of a chance. Yet, they fought their way to the semifinals and through a tough five-set match with Russia. 
   Utah is proud to be the host of the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. We hope to follow the example of the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, with the same enthusiasm and excitement and the same devotion to the ideal of the Olympic movement, which is ``a belief that sport can break down barriers of language, culture, nationality, age and sex and build bridges between people all over the world as a means of promoting world peace.'' 
   Some have derided the Olympic Games as nothing more than commercialism run amok. They say that the news coverage is too positive. They say that the media glosses over the negative elements of the Games--doping, for example. They claim that the only thing that drives athletes is the prospect of product endorsements or professional contracts. 
   Yes, Mr. President, these elements exist at the Games. It is sad that they do. There were displays of poor sportsmanship. There were cases of doping. There are, no doubt, those whose goals extend far beyond the 
   Olympics just concluded. 
   But, Mr. President, we can look at such incidents and say they taint the Olympics as a whole endeavor. Or, we can brush them aside as few in number and unrepresentative of our athletes as a body. We can erase one embarrassing spectacle of bad manners with the sight of Dot Richardson embracing her Japanese opponent. We can remember Marion Jones graciously congratulating the winner of the women's long jump, although Marion Jones is world class in every way. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly believe that the people of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, deserve our official recognition. I know what a monumental effort this was. And, let us commend our U.S. Olympic Team for their successes on the field as well as for their fine representation of our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this Senate resolution. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be placed on the Calendar.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me highlight our intent about how the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) should implement this legislation with respect to physicians who seek H-1B visas. The INS currently requires that each applicant for an H-1B visa who wishes to work as a physician must have passed the three parts of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and, if required by the state in which he or she will be practicing, be licensed. Due to the increased number of physicians who may work in the U.S. under H-1B visas with the passage of this legislation, it is even more important that the INS confirm successful completion of all parts of the USMLE each time an individual physician applies for, or seeks renewal of, an H-1B visa.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the last decade, DNA testing has become the most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when biological evidence of the crime is recovered. While DNA testing is standard in pre-trial investigations today, the issue of post-conviction DNA testing has emerged in recent years as the technology for testing has improved. Because biological evidence, such as semen or hair from a rape, is often preserved by authorities years after trial, it is possible to submit preserved biological evidence for DNA testing. In cases that were tried before DNA technology existed, and in which biological evidence was preserved after conviction, post-conviction testing is feasible. 
   While the exact number is subject to dispute, post-conviction DNA testing has exonerated prisoners who were convicted of crimes committed before DNA technology existed. In some of these cases, the post-conviction DNA testing that exonerated a wrongly convicted person led to the apprehension of the actual criminal. In response to these cases, the Senate Judiciary Committee has examined various state post-conviction DNA statutes, held a hearing on post-conviction DNA testing, and sought the expertise of federal and state prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers. 
   To ensure that post-conviction DNA testing is available in appropriate cases, I, along with Senators LOTT, NICKLES, MACK, MCCAIN, THURMOND, GRASSLEY, KYL, ABRAHAM, DEWINE, SESSIONS, R. SMITH, G. SMITH, COLLINS, FITZGERALD, HELMS, SANTORUM, HAGEL,  SHELBY, WARNER, INHOFE, SNOWE, ALLARD, BROWNBACK, GRAMS, BENNETT, COCHRAN, T. HUTCHINSON, and FRIST are introducing the Criminal Justice Integrity and Law Enforcement Assistance Act today. This Act authorizes post-conviction DNA testing in federal cases and encourages the States, through a grant program, to authorize post-conviction DNA testing in a consistent manner in state cases. In addition, the Act provides $60 million in grants to help States reduce the backlog of DNA evidence to be analyzed and to conduct post-conviction DNA testing. 
   The Criminal Justice Integrity Act was based in large part on the successful post-conviction DNA testing statute in Illinois. The Illinois statute has worked particularly well, as Illinois has the most post-conviction DNA exonerations in the Nation. Like the Illinois statute, the Criminal Justice Integrity Act authorizes post-conviction DNA testing only in cases in which testing has the potential to prove the prisoner's innocence. This standard will allow testing in potentially meritorious cases without wasting scarce prosecutorial and judicial resources on frivolous cases. It is significant that the Illinois statute has worked well without overburdening the State's law enforcement or judicial systems. 
   Mr. President, given that post-conviction DNA testing is a complex legal issue, I would like to discuss the legal standard to obtain testing in the Illinois statute and in the Criminal Justice Integrity Act. While the Illinois statute is somewhat vague, several Illinois Court of Appeals decisions have interpreted the standard for obtaining post-conviction testing under the statute. See People v. Gholston, 697 N.E.2d 375 (1998); People v. Dunn, 713 N.E.2d 568 (1999); People v. Savory, 722 N.E.2d 220 (1999). As these decisions make clear, post-conviction testing is allowed under the Illinois statute only if the testing has ``the potential to establish the defendant's innocence.'' 
   For example, in People v. Gholston, the defendant and five companions were convicted of raping a woman and assaulting and robbing her two male companions in 1981. In 1995, the defendant filed a motion to compel DNA testing of the victim's rape kit to prove that he did not participate in the gang rape. The trial court dismissed the motion for testing, and the appellate court affirmed. 
   In affirming the denial of testing, the court ruled that a ``negative DNA match would not exculpate defendant Gholston due to the multiple defendants involved, the lack of evidence regarding ejaculation by the defendant Gholston and defendant's own admission of guilt under a theory of accountability.'' Id. at 379. 
   In People v. Dunn, the defendant was convicted in 1979 of a rape in which there was only one attacker. The defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief, and the trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court remanded the motion to determine whether post-conviction testing was appropriate under the Illinois statute. 
   In remanding the motion, the court distinguished the facts in Dunn from Gholston, noting that post-conviction testing was denied in Gholston because ``the test results could not have been conclusive of defendant's guilt or innocence.'' Id. at 571. Under the facts in Dunn, the court held that the decision in Gholston would not prevent post-conviction testing ``where DNA testing would be determinative'' of guilt or innocence. Id. The court remanded the motion to the trial court to determine ``whether any conclusive result is obtainable from DNA testing.'' Id. 
   The most extensive discussion of the standard for obtaining post-conviction testing under the Illinois statute occurred in People v. Savory. In Savory, the defendant was convicted of stabbing two people to death in 1977. In 1998, the defendant sought DNA testing of bloodstained pants that were recovered from his home. The trial court denied the motion for DNA testing, and the appeals court affirmed. 
   The court held that DNA testing on the bloodstained pants could not exonerate the defendant because a negative DNA match could merely indicate that the defendant did not wear those pants during the murders. At trial, Savory's father testified that the pants were his and that he, not the defendant, was responsible for the bloodstains. In addition, there was other, overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt. 
   The court in Savory noted that in Gholston, post-conviction testing was denied because ``DNA testing could not conclusively establish defendant's guilt or innocence.'' In discussing the Illinois statute, the court stated:  
   Based on the plain language of [the Illinois statute] and on the interpretation of [the statute] in Gholston and Dunn, we believe that the legislature intended to provide a process of total vindication ..... [I]n using the term ``actual innocence,'' the legislature intended to limit the scope of the [Illinois statute], allowing for scientific testing only where it has the potential to exonerate a defendant. Id. at 224.  
   Under the facts in Savory, the court denied post-conviction testing because ``although DNA testing carries the possibility of weakening the State's original case against the defendant, it does not have the potential to prove him innocent.'' Id. at 225. 
   In short, post-conviction testing is allowed under the Illinois statute only where testing ``could be conclusive of the defendant's guilt or innocence''; only where ``DNA testing would be determinative''; only if ``any conclusive result is obtainable from DNA testing''; and only where post-conviction testing ``has the potential to exonerate a defendant.'' 
   The Criminal Justice Integrity Act has a similar legal standard to obtain testing. The Act authorizes testing if the prisoner makes a ``prima facie showing'' that identity was at issue at trial and DNA testing would, assuming exculpatory results, establish actual innocence. A ``prima facie showing'' is a lenient requirement that is defined as ``simply a sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a fuller exploration by the district court.'' See Bennett v. U.S., 119 F.3d 468 (7th Cir. 1997). Thus, under the Criminal Justice Integrity Act, post-conviction testing is ordered if the prisoner makes a ``sufficient showing of possible merit'' that identity was at issue at trial and DNA testing would, assuming exculpatory results, establish actual innocence. In other words, the Act requires a showing that post-conviction testing has the potential to prove innocence. This is consistent with--and no more difficult than--the legal standard in the Illinois statute. If post-conviction DNA testing can establish a prisoner's innocence, such a prisoner can obtain testing under the Criminal Justice Integrity Act. 
   If post-conviction DNA testing is performed and produces exculpatory evidence, the Criminal Justice Integrity Act allows the prisoner to move for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, notwithstanding the time limits on such motions applicable to other forms of newly discovered evidence. In so doing, the Act relies on established judicial procedures. In addition, the Criminal Justice Integrity Act prohibits authorities from destroying biological evidence which was preserved in cases in which identity was at issue for the duration of the Act, and it authorizes the court to appoint counsel for an indigent prisoner who seeks post-conviction testing. 
   Mr. President, the Criminal Justice Integrity and Law Enforcement Assistance Act is the only federal post-conviction DNA legislation that is supported by the law enforcement community. The Criminal Justice Integrity Act was unanimously endorsed by the bipartisan board of the National District Attorneys Association. In addition, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Sheriffs' Association have endorsed the bill. I am proud to have the support of the law enforcement community for this important legislation. 
   In closing, I would like to note that advanced DNA testing improves the just and fair implementation of the death penalty. While the Criminal Justice Integrity Act applies both to non-capital and capital cases, I think the Act is especially important in death penalty cases. While reasonable people can differ about capital punishment, it is indisputable that advanced DNA testing lends support and credibility to the accuracy and integrity of capital cases. For example, earlier this year, Texas Governor George W. Bush, granted a temporary reprieve to a death row inmate, Ricky McGinn, to allow post-conviction DNA testing on evidence recovered from the victim. In 1995, McGinn was convicted of raping and murdering his 12-year-old stepdaughter. McGinn's lawyers had argued  that additional DNA testing could prove that McGinn did not rape the victim, and therefore, was not eligible for the death penalty. 
   The DNA testing was recently completed, and the test results confirmed that McGinn raped the victim, in addition to murdering her. In short, as the McGinn case demonstrates, we are in a better position than ever before to ensure that only the guilty are executed. All Americans--supporters and opponents of the death penalty alike--should recognize that DNA testing provides a powerful safeguard in capital cases. We should be thankful for this amazing technological development.

   Mr. HATCH. I promise the distinguished Senator from Oregon that I will take up this issue in the months ahead. The issue of competency of counsel for indigents in state capital cases is a difficult issue for several reasons. First, it is not clear that this is a nationwide problem. For example, in Utah and Oregon, there does not appear to be a problem concerning the representation of indigents in capital cases. Second, the anecdotal examples cited in the media of poor capital representation occurred many years ago. For example, the death penalty trial of Gary Graham, which has been repeatedly mentioned in the press, occurred in 1981. Third, the States that seem to have a problem in this area recently made improvements. In 1995, Texas Governor George W. Bush signed legislation that provided indigent capital defendants the right to have two attorneys represent them at trial. Just this year, Alabama passed a law that compensates lawyers who represent indigents in capital trials at $100 per hour. 
   In short, I would like to know more about the extent of this problem before I introduce legislation. Thankfully, the Bureau of Justice Statistics is releasing a comprehensive study of state indigent legal defense services in December. I am hopeful that this study will provide the information necessary to evaluate the extent of this problem. I look forward to working with Senator SMITH in the months ahead.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to answer some of the comments made by our colleagues from the other side yesterday and today. 
   We have been on the floor this week supposedly debating the H-1B bill. That is S. 2045. This bill is an extremely important measure. It is aimed at alleviating both short- and long-term problems in the inadequate supply of a highly skilled worker force in our dynamic and expanding high-tech economy. 
   The debate has turned into quite a different matter. My colleagues on the other side stood on the floor yesterday talking about the so-called Latino fairness legislation and insisting, time and time again, for a vote on this unrelated measure.  
   Let's review where we are. The high-tech community wants this H-1B bill without amendment. My colleagues on both sides voted overwhelmingly for cloture; meaning, ending the debate. Cloture would knock out nongermane amendments which, of course, would knock out the so-called Latino fairness amendment as well. 
   The last time I looked, a vote in support of cloture meant that we support consideration of legislation without--I emphasize that word ``without''--unrelated, nongermane amendments, such as the so-called Latino fairness bill. This bill, by the way, was only filed on July 25 of this year. If it was so important, why was it filed so late in the session, without the opportunity for hearings or committee consideration? 
   Talk about trying to have it both ways. I guess this is a brilliant political move if you don't think about it too closely, the ultimate effort to try to have it both ways: Give the high-tech community a cloture vote and at the same time continue to maneuver to get around what that cloture vote means. 
   So there we have it. I don't recall seeing a spectacle of this sort in all of my years in the Senate. 
   Having said that, let me now join my colleagues in this discussion on the so-called Latino fairness legislation. There was a great deal of talk yesterday. Some of it was shameless. The talk was about due process, about the need for more unskilled workers in this country, and about the hardship of the parents of American-citizen children. Much of the rhetoric does not meet reality. 
   My colleagues on the other side argue that they want to vote on S. 2912, the so-called Latino fairness act. I really wonder if most in the Senate understand and appreciate what is involved in this costly, far-reaching bill that has never had a day of hearings. 
   This is no limited measure, to undo a previous wrong to a limited class of immigrants who otherwise might have been eligible for amnesty under the 1986 act. Rather, this is a major new amnesty program, without 1 day of hearings, with a price tag of almost $1.4 billion, with major implications for our national policy on immigration. 
   For years, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have watched the Immigration Subcommittee, and I have helped to steer through and monitor and help make immigration policy in this country. That policy works well, to a large degree, but there are certainly areas that we can improve. I can tell you that some are trying to turn this bipartisan policy upside down. 
   I will begin by saying that I have been a long-time supporter of legal immigration. That is what has built this country. It has made this country the greatest country in the world. 
   I believe in legal immigration. In connection with the 1996 immigration reform legislation, I fought long and hard against those who wanted to cut legal family immigration and other categories. At that and other times, it has been my view that our emphasis ought to be on combating illegal, not legal, immigration. 
   The bill before us, however, while termed ``Latino fairness,'' does nothing to increase or preserve the categories of legal immigrants allowed in this country on an annual basis. It does nothing to shorten the long waiting period or the hurdles that persons waiting years to come to this country--people who play by the rules and wait their turn--have to go through. 
   In contrast, what we hear now is an urgent call to grant broad amnesty to what could be up to 2 million illegal aliens. Let's be clear about what is at issue here. Some refer to the fact that a certain class of persons who may have been entitled to amnesty in 1986 have been unfairly treated and should therefore be granted amnesty now. That is one issue--and I am certainly prepared to discuss that issue in our committee, with full hearings, and resolve any inequities that exist. I am certainly prepared to discuss that, but only outside the context of S. 2045, a bill that virtually everybody in this body wants because it will allow us to stay in the forefront of our global, high-tech economy. 
   Again, I am prepared to discuss, outside of this bill, what we might be able to do to help that so-called 1982 class of immigrants. But that is not really what S. 2912 is about. This bill that some now want to attach to the H-1B bill, would ensure its death in the House of Representatives; it would never see the light of day. The fact is--this bill also covers that 1982 class, but also hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of illegal aliens who were never eligible for amnesty under the 1986 act. 
   This is a difficult issue and one with major policy implications for the future. When we supported amnesty in 1986--and I believe there were several million people granted amnesty at that time--it was not with the assumption that this was going to be a continuous process. 
   What kind of signal does this type of ``urgency'' send? On one hand, the Government spends millions each year to combat illegal immigration and deports thousands of persons each year who are here illegally. But if an illegal alien can manage to escape law enforcement for long enough, we reward that person with citizenship, or at least permanent resident status, followed by the right to apply for citizenship after 5 years of living here. 
   That is a slap in the face to all of those who have abided by the rules and who have been here legally. If there are inequities, I am willing to work them out, but let's do it through hearings, through a thorough examination. Let's not do it through a political sham that has been thrust upon us on the floor for no other reason than because they are worried on the other side that George Bush appeals to the Hispanic community. We know he gets about 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas, and there is good reason for it. 
   Hispanic children are now reading at better levels. The Hispanic people have been helped greatly in Texas by the Bush administration. Our colleagues on the other side are deathly afraid that if he continues to do that, the Hispanic vote--which they just take for granted--is going to suddenly go to George Bush and the Republicans. Well, I don't blame them for that, 
   because I think that is what is going to happen. 
   As chairman of the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force, which I helped to start years ago, I know that the Hispanics are out there watching both parties and seeing who really has their interests at heart. We have done more with that task force--not just by throwing money at problems--than the other side ever dreamed of. 
   Further, I hope my colleagues are aware of the cost of this bill to American taxpayers. I don't mind the costs if we are doing something that is absolutely right. As I said, I am willing to go through the appropriate hearing process. I do that every day in my work as a Senator in solving immigration problems--as a lot of Senators do. But we ought to take into consideration the costs of this to the American taxpayers--giving amnesty to up to 2 million illegal aliens. 
   Specifically, a draft and preliminary CBO estimate indicates this bill comes with a price tag just short of $1.4 billion over 10 years. But that is a conservative estimate because the amendment actually filed yesterday goes way beyond S. 2912 on amnesty. Not only was S. 2912, the so-called the Latino Fairness Act, filed on July 25, but the amendment filed yesterday goes even beyond what their original bill. The amendment's proponents argue that it just consists of a simple due process restoration. But, in fact, it not only gives hundreds of thousands, if not millions, additional illegal immigrants amnesty who have been here since 1986, it appears to be a rolling amnesty measure! 
   In this highly charged political area, we ought to try and get together in a bipartisan manner. But some of my friends on the other side seem to want to play politics with this issue. They try to act as if they are for Hispanics. But what they are in fact doing is ignoring those who play by the rules, who are here legally, in favor of those who are here illegally and who have broken the rules. It is a slap in the face to all of those who have played by the rules. 
   What do I mean by a rolling amnesty measure? It means the amnesty provision continues and expands for the next 6 years. That is right, Mr. President. If illegal aliens can manage to avoid authorities until 2006--if they can avoid authorities for that long--they automatically get amnesty, and that is a stepping stone to citizenship for people who have violated our laws and are  here illegally. Again, if there are people who are being injured who should not be, people who really have due process rights, or who ought to have consideration, I am willing to work on that with my colleagues on the other side in a bipartisan way to do something that really works. We do that regularly anyway. But to just throw this open on a rolling amnesty basis for 6 solid years is not the way to go; we are talking about millions of people who are here illegally being automatically given the right to apply for citizenship in a few years. 
   Mr. President, what are we doing here? We devote hundreds of millions of dollars each year to try and control illegal immigration. What does this so-called fairness bill do? It rewards persons for their illegal activity. It says let's keep fighting illegal immigration, but if certain persons succeed in evading the law for long enough, they get rewarded by being allowed to stay, get permanent resident status, and 5 years later can apply for citizenship, 
   in contrast to all of those millions who have legally come into this country under legal immigration rules and regulations, who have abided by the law, and who basically have paid the appropriate price to get here. 
   We have also heard about the need for more workers. I agree with that. Why don't we address and examine this need, however, in the right way? Why don't we examine increasing the number of legal immigrants allowed to come here? Why don't we consider lifting certain of those caps? I don't see anyone on the other side of the aisle arguing for that. It would seem to me if they want to argue for having more immigrants in this country--and I might go along with this--that we ought to lift the caps. I have to admit that there are those in this body who do not want to lift those caps--but at least in the other body for sure. That is the appropriate way to do that. 
   During our debate in the 1996 act, the Democrats offered, and the committee unanimously agreed, to curb the number of legal, unskilled workers coming to this country. Why did they do that? Because their No. 1 supporters in the country--the trade union movement in this country--believe that they would take jobs; that if we lifted the caps there would be more legal immigrants coming into this country that would take jobs away from American workers. 
   It is amazing to me that they wouldn't allow the caps lifted then for that reason, and now they want the broad amnesty. They want to allow up to 2 million illegal immigrants in here because everybody realizes there is a shortage of workers right now. 
   I am willing to consider lifting those caps, and do it legally and do it the right way. I would be willing to do that. But without hearings, and without a really thorough examination of this, I am not willing to just wholesale have a rolling amnesty provision that would allow millions of illegal aliens who haven't played by the rules to have a wide open street to citizenship while many people who are applying legally can't get in and who really need to get in. 
   I agree with the need to reexamine our position on lifting the caps on legal immigration. Let's do that. I am willing to hold hearings, or make sure the subcommittee holds the hearings on that. By the way, they have held some hearings. 
   I have to say that generally the two leaders on the Subcommittee on Immigration, Senator ABRAHAM from Michigan and Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts, have worked well together. But all of a sudden, there's a chance to score political points, they think. I don't think they are getting political points. If I was a legal Hispanic, or a legal Chinese, or a legal person from any other country, I would resent knowing how difficult it was for me to become a legal immigrant while people who are trying to make it possible for those who are illegally here to be able to become citizens without obeying the same rules. I suspect there is going to be a lot of resentment, if people really understand this. 
   While we are at it, why don't we do something to get the INS to move more swiftly--the Immigration and Naturalization Service--to move more swiftly on applications for legal immigrants? That would be real Latino fairness. That is what we ought to be doing on the floor. 
   There isn't a person in this body who cares more for family unification than I do. There are some who are certainly my equal here. But nobody exceeds my desire to bring families together, a point brought out yesterday. I fought for years on this issue. Every day we are working on immigration problems to try to solve the problem of bringing families together in my offices in Utah and here. 
   If we really care about family reunification, why don't we do something about the Immigration and Naturalization Service? Why should parents, children, and spouses have to stay on a waiting list for years? I would like to hear more comments from the other 
   side on that. But every time you try to lift the caps, their friends in the union movement come in and say: You can't do that. You might take jobs away from union workers. 
   Under the H-1B bill, we are not taking jobs away from union workers or from anyone else. We are trying to maintain our dominant status throughout the world in the high-tech world. We are trying to make sure we keep the people here who can really help us do that. That bill provides that those who are highly educated in our universities have a right to stay here and work. This is the bill we are talking about. It is a step in the right direction to get us there. 
   What does this so-called Latino fairness amendment, or bill, that they filed so late in this Presidential year say to families who played by the rules? It doesn't say obey the laws and wait your turn. It says we are going to make special favors for those of you who are here illegally, and we are going to do it on a rolling amnesty basis over the next 6 years. They are just going to have the right to become citizens, while others have had to abide by the rules--rules that have been set over decades and decades. 
   I challenge anybody on the other side to work with me in helping to resolve these problems. I am willing to do that. I don't need a lecture from people on the other side about families who have been split up. I think it is abysmal to have families split up. I am willing to work to try and solve that problem, but it takes both sides to do it. 
   Last but not least, it is no secret that our committee handles intellectual property in many of the high-tech issues in this country. Last year we passed one of the most important bills in patent changes in the history of the country--certainly in the last 50 years. We passed a number of other high-tech bills to make a real difference. 
   We have done an awful lot to make sure our high-tech world in this country stays at the top of the ladder. 
   I just came from the Finance Committee upon which I sit where I made a principal argument that we need to get this new bill through that Chairman ROTH is working on with the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, to have a broadband tax credit which we need now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I spoke at length this morning on the issues before us, so I will try and be brief now. 
   First, let me begin by emphasizing how critical this bill is for our country's future. The second vote this afternoon is on the Hatch substitute to the underlying bill, S. 2045. Like the bill, the substitute raises the annual cap on H-1B visas to 195,000 in each of the next three years. The increase in the number of highly skilled temporary workers will help American companies continue to create jobs in this country and maintain their competitiveness in the global economy. 
   But this substitute, however, does a lot more. The use of skilled foreign labor is nothing more than a temporary stop gap solution to a long term problem we face in this Century. The problem is one of ensuring that our high tech industry has an adequate number of highly trained and educated workers to fill the demand. To hear some of my colleagues in recent days, one would think there is nothing in this bill on educating our young people and training our workforce. That is simple and completely inaccurate. The substitute contains important education and training provisions, worked out with my colleagues--including Senators LIEBERMAN, FEINSTEIN, KENNEDY, and ABRAHAM. Senators ABRAHAM and KENNEDY are respectively the chairman and ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee. These provisions use the fees generated by these visas to finance important education and training programs for our children and our current workforce. These are critical measures for our country. 
   That, Mr. President, is the matter at hand. Unfortunately, however, much of the discussion and debate this week  has been on an unrelated and far-reaching immigration matter--the so-called Latino fairness bill. As I noted in some detail this morning, this measure, which purports to simply restore due process to a limited group is a broad, far-reaching and costly new amnesty program, conservatively estimated to cost $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. It provides amnesty to hundreds of thousands if not millions of illegal aliens on an ongoing basis--or, in other words, an amnesty, ``rolling'' amnesty--over the next 5 years. That is right, Mr. President--it is a rolling amnesty, obviously creating an incentive for illegal aliens to continue to escape the law because the rewards for those who are most effective at remaining in this country illegally happen to be permanent resident status. 
   But this so-called Latino fairness is no fairness at all--no fairness to the millions of immigrants who have and will continue to play by the rules and follow the legal process. I have said to my friends on the other side, if we are so eager to increase the supply of labor from abroad, if we are so eager to unify families, then perhaps we should examine lifting the caps on legal immigrants or at least cutting down their waiting periods. 
   I am willing to work on that, but I can never get any cooperation from the other side. They want to have a ``rolling'' amnesty for several million illegal aliens in this country who can evade the law for a matter of time and then be eligible for full nonresident status on the way to citizenship. 
   To summarize: 
   First, the so-called Latino fairness bill extends a broad amnesty to illegal immigrants here since 1986. 
   Second, it is a ``rolling'' amnesty, so that over the next 5 years we move the date up to 1991. 
   Third, a conservative CBO estimate, even without considering the ``rolling'' provision, puts the cost of the amnesty at $1.4 billion over 10 years. 
   Fourth, this provision rewards illegal immigrants who have been the most effective in evading law enforcement. 
   What this proposal does not do, and what I think real Latino fairness would be is: 
   First, we should increase the number of legal immigrants allowed in this country annually if such an increase is needed to ensure an adequate labor supply and greater family unification. This would be a wise thing to do. It would be a fair thing to do. It would also be the legal thing to do, compared to what they are trying to do over there. 
   They are trying to enact a bill that they did not even have the foresight to bring up on the floor or to file until July 25 of this year.

   Mr. HATCH. I only have a limited period of time, so I have to finish my remarks. 
   Second, we should expedite INS review of petitions by family members of citizens. Let's face it, the INS is in a mess right now, and it could be reformed to expedite the processing of legal immigrants. 
   Third, we should restore the right of persons allowed amnesty back in 1986 to have their claims adjudicated. 
   These three changes in law, in contrast to what is proposed today by our friends on the other side, would be real Latino fairness. It would reward those who have followed the law and played by the rules. 
   So this is where we are. The vote we are about to have on suspending the rules is a ``have it both ways'' vote. My colleagues voted overwhelmingly for cloture yesterday--including almost all Democrats and all Republicans. The last time I looked, cloture meant the inability to consider nongermane amendments. 
   Today, many of these same persons who voted for cloture are voting to suspend the results of that vote and allow debate on this unrelated measure. Tomorrow, they will probably vote for cloture again. 
   So on Tuesday, the high-tech community gets its vote. On Wednesday, many of the same group vote to undo their vote, and on Thursday they vote with high tech again. Oh, it is confusing when you are trying to have it both ways. 
   I hope no one will be fooled by what is happening. I urge my colleagues to oppose suspending the rules, which is an extraordinary procedural move aimed at playing politics. 
   I am told that this procedure of suspending the rules has not been used since 1982. I do not believe it has ever been used in this manner for crass political purposes and maneuvering. I hope it will be overwhelmingly rejected. I hope that, once again, we will vote for cloture on this bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise this morning to implore my colleagues to support cloture and to quit playing around with this bill. There is no reason to have a filibuster on the motion to proceed on bills as important as this. There has been a filibuster on the bill. 
   It seems to me we need to work together in moving forward to enact the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act, S. 2045. One of our greatest priorities is, and ought to be, keeping our economy vibrant and expanding educational opportunities for America's children and its workers. That is my priority for this country and for my own home State of Utah. 
   I am proud of the growth and development in my own home State that has made Utah one of the leaders in the country and in the world in our high-tech economy. Utah's IT--or information technology--vendor industry is among Utah's largest industries and among the top 10 regions of IT activity in the United States. 
   Notably, Utah was listed among the top 10 IT centers in the world by Newsweek magazine in November 1998. The growth of information technology is nowhere more evident and dramatic than in my own home State of Utah. According to UTAA, the Utah Information Technologies Association, our IT vendor industry grew nearly 9 percent between 1997 and 1998 and consists of 2,427 business enterprises. 
   In Utah and elsewhere, however, our continued economic growth and our competitive edge in the world economy require an adequate supply of highly skilled high-tech workers. This remains one of our greatest challenges in the 21st century, requiring both short- and long-term solutions. This legislation, S. 2045, contains both types of solutions. 
   Specifically, a tight labor market, increasing globalization, and a burgeoning economy have combined to increase demand for skilled workers well beyond what was forecast when Congress last addressed the issue of temporary visas for highly skilled workers in 1998. Therefore, my bill, once again, increases the annual cap for the next 3 years. 
   But that is nothing more than a short-term solution to the workforce needs in my State and across the country. The longer term solution lies with our own children and our own workers and in ensuring that education and training for our current and future workforce matches the demands in our high-tech 21st century global economy.  
   Thus, working with my colleagues, I have included in this bill strong, effective, and forward-looking provisions directing the more than $100 million in fees generated by the visas toward the education and retraining of our children and our workforce. These provisions are included in the substitute which is before us today. 
   We are here today, however, as this session of Congress comes to a close, with the fate of this critical legislation extremely uncertain. Frankly, when this bill was reported by the committee by an overwhelming vote of 16-2, I thought we were on track to move this rapidly through the Senate. I offered to sit down with other Members, including Senators KENNEDY, FEINSTEIN, and LIEBERMAN, to work with them on provisions regarding education and training. We have done that. I am pleased to report that the substitute to which I have referred reflects many of their ideas and proposals. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days to try to avoid a confrontational process. I hope we can get this done for American workers and children and for our continued economic expansion. 
   The situation, as I understand it, is that there is little disagreement on this bill itself. I have heard no arguments that the high-tech shortage is not real or that we should not move forward with this short-term fix. Rather, it appears that the only dispute has been whether or not we use the bill as a vehicle for other major and far-reaching changes in our immigration policy over which there is much contention and which could scuttle this bill. And I think those who are trying to get us in that posture understand that. 
   I sincerely hope we can move forward today. I hope my colleagues will overwhelmingly support this modest H-1B increase and quit delaying this bill. Let's get it through. This bill has important training and education proposals for the children and workers in the 21st century. 
   The Hatch substitute amendment to S. 2045, the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, is a comprehensive legislative proposal to insure America's continued leadership edge in the Information Age. It takes both short-term and long-term steps. 
   Let me summarize the proposal. With regard to long-term steps, this bill invests in the American workforce through a designated stream of funding for high-tech job training; K-12 education initiatives; authorizes a new program which provides grants for after school technology education; and helps our educational and research communities by exempting them from the cap on high-skilled professionals. 
   No. 2., the short-term steps: This bill addresses immediate skilled worker needs by authorizing a modest increase in temporary visas for high-skilled professionals. 
   When skilled professionals are at a premium, America faces a serious dilemma when employers find that they cannot grow, innovate, and compete in global markets without increased access to skilled personnel. Our employers' current inability to hire skilled personnel presents both a short-term and a long-term problem. The country needs to increase its access to skilled personnel immediately in order to prevent current needs from going unfilled. To meet these needs over the long term, however, the American education system must produce more young people interested in, and qualified to enter, key fields, and we must increase our other training efforts, so that more Americans can be prepared to keep this country at the cutting edge and competitive in global markets. 
   The Hatch substitute to S. 2045 addresses both aspects of this problem. In order to meet immediate needs, the bill raises the current ceiling on temporary visas to 195,000 for fiscal year 2000, fiscal year 2001, and fiscal year 2002. In addition, it provides for exemptions from the ceiling for graduate degree recipients from American universities and personnel at universities and research facilities to allow these educators and top graduates to remain in the country. 
   The Hatch substitute to S. 2045 also addresses the long-term problem that too few U.S. students are entering and excelling in mathematics, computer science, engineering and related fields. It contains measures to encourage more young people to study mathematics, engineering, and computer science and to train more Americans in these areas. 
   Under predecessor legislation enacted in 1998, a $500 fee per visa is assessed on each initial petition for H-1B status for an individual, on each initial application for extension of that individual's status, and on each petition required on account of a change of employer or concurrent employment. Under the Hatch substitute, this money is used to fund scholarships for low income students and training for U.S. workers. Using the same assumptions on the rate of renewals, changes of employer and the like that the committee and the administration relied on in estimating the impact of the 1998 legislation, the increase in visas should result in funding for training, scholarships and administration of H-1B visas of approximately $150 million per year over fiscal year 2000, fiscal year 2001, and fiscal year 2002 for a total of $450 million. This should fund approximately 40,000 scholarships. This is important. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote for cloture today. I hope we can put this bill to bed. I hope there won't be any postcloture filibusters. I hope there won't be any postcloture delays. 
   Let us get this bill passed. It is critical to our country. It is critical to our information technology age, to our high-tech communities, and it is critical to keep us the No. 1 Nation in the world. It makes sense, and it has widespread support throughout Congress. 
   It is being delayed by just a few people in this body--maybe not so few but a number of people who basically claim they are interested in the information technology industries and high-tech industries themselves but who want to play politics with this bill. 
   I think we ought to quit playing politics and do what is right for our country. This is a bipartisan bill that really ought to be passed today. 
   With that, how much time do both sides have remaining?

   Mr. HATCH. What seems interesting to me is I helped to lead the fight years ago in 1996 in my own committee to increase legal immigration in this country. I have led the fight for that. We are talking about giving amnesty to illegal immigrants while not increasing the caps on legal immigration. Something is wrong.

   Mr. HATCH. Let me complete my question. In order to make my question clear, I have to make these points. 
   We can't get caps lifted on legal immigration. It is my understanding that on the H-1B bill--which just had a 94 to 3 vote and that should pass right out of here, has had hearings, and everything else--you want to hold it hostage because you want to give amnesty to 500,000 illegal immigrants.

   Mr. HATCH. Let me ask my question. Is it not true that this major new amnesty program, which has not had one day of hearings, if it passes would legalize up to 2 million people? I know there are those on your side who say there are one-half million illegal immigrants. Is it not true that the price tag for this major new amnesty program to legalize up to 2 million people is almost $1.4 billion, and that the underlying bill that we are trying to pass here--the H-1B bill--would basically provide the high-tech workers that we absolutely have to have?

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard my friends on the other side talk about how important this is. Why didn't they file the bill before July 25 of this year if it is so darned important, if politics isn't being played here. 
   Secondly, why did they all vote for this? Forty-three Democrats voted for cloture. If they wanted this amendment, why did they vote for cloture? They understand the rule that, by gosh, we vote for cloture, end debate, so we can pass the bill. 
   The high-tech industry needs this bill, but it will be brought down if we can't get it passed. The Latino fairness bill has not even had 1 day of hearings. Yet they want to grant amnesty to illegal aliens of at least a half million, and some think up to 2 million people, without 1 day of hearings. Where are the amendments to increase the number of legal immigrants? 
   In 1996, we had a major debate on immigration and there was a serious effort to restrict the numbers of legal immigrants. I fought the fight to preserve the number of legal immigrants. That is Latino fairness. What my colleagues are advocating is a major amnesty program for illegal immigrants, without 1 day of hearing. 
   Let's just understand the 1982, 1986 situation. The fact is the bill before us, while termed ``Latino fairness,'' does nothing to increase or preserve the categories of illegal immigrants allowed in this country annually. If you listen to their arguments, why don't we just forget all our immigration laws and let everybody come in? There is an argument for everybody. 
   We all know what is going on: This is a doggone political game, stopping a very important bill that 94 people basically voted for today in voting to invoke cloture. 
   Their idea does nothing to shorten the long waiting period or the hurdles of persons waiting years to come to this country, playing by the rules to wait their turn. What we hear is an urgent call to grant broad amnesty to what could be more than a million to two million illegal aliens. 
   Now, let's be clear about what is at issue here. Some refer to the fact that a certain class of persons that may have been entitled to amnesty in 1986, have been unfairly treated and should therefore be granted amnesty now. That is one issue, and I am certainly prepared to discuss--outside the context of S. 2045--what we might be able to do to help that class of persons. But that is not really what S. 2912 is about. Rather, this bill also covers that class plus hundreds of thousands, if not millions of illegal aliens who were never eligible for amnesty under the 1986 Act because that Act only went back to 1982. 
   This is a difficult issue, Mr. President, and one with major policy implications for the future. When we supported amnesty in 1986, it was not with the assumption that this was going to be a continuous process. What kind of signal does this send? On the one hand, our government spends millions each year to combat illegal immigration and deports thousands of persons each year who are here illegally. But--But if an illegal alien can manage to escape law enforcement for long enough, we reward that person with citizenship, or at least permanent resident status. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues are aware of the cost of this bill to American taxpayers. Specifically, a draft and preliminary CBO estimate indicates this bill comes with a price tag just short of $1.4 billion over 10 years. 
   The bottom line is that the Senate is not and should not be prepared to consider this bill at this time. It raises far-reaching questions concerning immigration policy, whose consequences have never been addressed by proponents.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate has now given final approval to an important bill that will go far toward improving our nation's public health infrastructure. I strongly support the Children's Public Health Act of 2000 and the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act (H.R. 4365). I hope this measure will soon pass the House as well. 
   It is obvious that we owe our colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee a debt of gratitude for their perseverance and dedication in developing this landmark legislation which contains a number of provisions of importance to my home state of Utah. 
   The Children's Health Act of 2000 authorizes services that will ensure the health and well-being of future generations of America's young people, our most precious resources. I can think of no more important aim for legislation than to focus on our nation's future by providing for our children today. 
   At the same time, through the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, the bill will address serious drug abuse issues that affect our young people, including a reauthorization of the important programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA. 
   The SAMSHA reauthorization legislation will improve this vital agency by providing greater flexibility for states and accountability based on performance, while at the same time placing critical focus on youth and adolescent substance abuse and mental health services. SAMHSA, formerly known as the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration, ADAMHA, was created in 1992 by Public Law 102-321, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. SAMHSA's purpose is to assist states in addressing the importance of reducing the incidence of substance abuse and mental illness by supporting programs for prevention and treatment. 
   SAMHSA provides funds to states for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and activities, and mental health services through the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, SAPT, and the Community Mental Health Services, CMHS, Block Grants. SAMHSA's block grants are a major portion of this nation's response to substance abuse and mental health service needs. 
   As a proud supporter of H.R. 4365, I would like to highlight several provisions that are based on legislation I have introduced. 
   First, this legislation reauthorizes the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, a law I authored in 1996. By incorporating my bill, S. 3081, H.R. 4365 will extend authority for the critical Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI, programs from fiscal year 2001 through 2005. 
   Each year, approximately two million Americans experience a traumatic brain injury; in Utah, 2000 individuals per year experience brain injuries. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in young Americans, and the risk of a traumatic brain injury is highest among adolescents and young adults. Motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, falls and violence are the major causes. These injuries occur without warning and often with devastating consequences. Brain injury can affect a person cognitively, physically and emotionally. 
   Important provisions added to the Traumatic Brain Injury Act through this bill include extending the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's, CDC, grant authority so it may conduct research on ways to prevent traumatic brain injury. In addition, the legislation directs the CDC to provide information to increase public awareness on this serious health matter. The bill also calls on the National Institutes of Health, NIH, to conduct research on the rehabilitation of the cognitive, behavioral, and psycho-social difficulties associated with traumatic brain injuries. 
   Finally, the measure requests the Health Resource Services Administration to provide and administer grants  for projects that improve services for persons with a traumatic brain injury. 
   I am grateful that the members of the HELP Committee were willing to include provisions from my legislation which reauthorizes this program. As a result, many more deserving individuals whose lives and families have been affected by a traumatic brain injury will now receive some type of assistance or help. 
   Second, the Children's Health Act of 2000 also contains a bill that I authored, S. 3080, to address a troubling yet treatable malady--poor oral health in children. 
   I have been concerned over reports from Utah and around the country about the poor oral health of our nation's children. A recent General Accounting Office report on dental disease calls tooth decay the most common chronic childhood disease and finds that it is most prevalent among low-income children. 
   Eighty percent of untreated decayed teeth is found in roughly 25 percent of children, mostly from low-income and other vulnerable groups. Decay left untreated leads to infection, pain, poor eating habits, and speech impediments. 
   Compounding this problem is that there are few places for these children to receive care. 
   Low provider reimbursement rates from state-operated dental plans make it financially impossible for private practitioners to treat all the children in need. Today, there are a large number of children living in either the inner city or in rural areas who do not have a place to seek treatment. Our goal should be to provide access to dental care to children, regardless of where they live. 
   Therefore, I am pleased to report that the ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' contains provisions to address this serious health concern. The legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program funding innovative oral health activities to improve the oral health of children under six years of age. The legislation will make these grants available to innovative programs at community health centers, dental training institutions, Indian Health Service facilities, and other community dental programs. 
   Let's face it, dental disease in young children is a significant public health problem. And this legislation is the beginning of a coordinated, inter-agency strategy that will assist states and localities reduce this preventable problem. 
   I am also pleased that we are considering the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act. This legislation addresses many important issues such as drug abuse and mental health services and how to treat these serious problems within our society. 
   One issue that is highlighted in this bill is the prevention of teen suicide. This is an issue that is rapidly becoming a crisis not only in my State of Utah but throughout the entire country. 
   Young people in the United States are taking their own lives at alarming rates. The trend of teen suicide is seeing suicide at younger ages, with the United States suicide rate for individuals under 15 years of age increasing 121 percent from 1980 to 1992. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 24, and the fourth leading cause of death for children between 10 and 14. In 1997 study, 21 percent of the nation's high school students reported serious thoughts about attempting suicide, with 15.7 percent making a specific plan. 
   Utah consistently ranks among the top ten states in the nation for suicide, and we continue to see increases in suicide rates among our youth. In Utah, suicide rates for ages 15 to 19 have increased almost 150 percent in the last 20 years. According to the CDC, Utah had the tenth highest suicide rate in the country during 1995-1996 and was 30 percent above the U.S. rate. This is one statistical measure on which I want to see my state at the bottom. 
   Although numerous symptoms, diagnoses, traits, and characteristics have been investigated, no single fact or set of factors has ever come close to predicting suicide with any accuracy. 
   I have worked on legislation that will help us determine the predictors of suicide among at risk and other youth. We need to understand what the barriers are that prevent youth from receiving treatment so that we can facilitate the development of model treatment programs and public education and awareness efforts. It also calls for a study designed to develop a profile of youths who are more likely to contemplate suicide and services available to them. 
   This bill also contains provisions from S. 1428, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000. I introduced this bill because of evidence that methamphetamine remains a threat to the entire country, and particularly to my state of Utah. Elements of this bill are also contained in S. 486 as it was reported by the Judiciary Committee. 
   Throughout my travels in Utah, I have heard from state and local law enforcement officials, mayors, city councils, parents, and youth about the seriousness of the methamphetamine problem. 
   Recently, I held two field hearings in Utah during which I heard directly from constituents whose lives had been affected by methamphetamine. I listened to a mother tell a heart-wrenching story of how her beloved daughter had become addicted to methamphetamine and how she feared for her daughter's life. She tearfully described her daughter as being two people, the person ``who has the values of our family, who is kind hearted and loving; and then there's our daughter who's the meth user, and they are completely opposite.'' 
   I also heard testimony from the wife of a methamphetamine addict. I heard how her husband's methamphetamine addiction destroyed their marriage and their financial security. Painfully, she explained how her husband put her and their infant son at risk when he decided to manufacture methamphetamine in their home. She had no choice but to report his activities to the police, a decision that undoubtedly will haunt her for the rest of her life. 
   Methamphetamine use is an insidious virus sapping the strength and character of our country. We need to attack it. This bill contains the tools to help the people of Utah and the rest of the country fight this wicked drug. 
   This bill bolsters the Drug Enforcement Agency's, DEA, ability to combat the manufacturing and trafficking of methamphetamine by authorizing the creation of satellite offices and the hiring of additional agents to assist State and local law enforcement officials. More than any other illicit drug, methamphetamine manufacturers and traffickers operate in small towns and rural areas. And, unfortunately, rural law enforcement agencies often are overwhelmed and in dire need of the DEA's expertise in conducting methamphetamine investigations. 
   To address this problem, the bill authorizes the expansion of the number of DEA resident offices and posts-of-duty, which are smaller DEA offices often set up in small and rural cities that are overwhelmed by methamphetamine manufacturing and trafficking. There are also provisions to assist state and local officials in handling the dangerous toxic waste left behind by 
   methamphetamine labs. 
   To counter the dangers that manufacturing drugs like methamphetamine inflict on human life and on the environment, the bill imposes stiffer penalties on manufacturers of all illegal drugs when their actions create a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment. The inherent dangers of killing innocent bystanders and, at the same time, contaminating the environment during the methamphetamine manufacturing process warrant a punitive penalty that will deter some from engaging in the activity. 
   Finally, the bill increases penalties for manufacturing and trafficking the drug amphetamine, a lesser-known, but no-less dangerous drug than methamphetamine. Other than for a slight difference in potency, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and used in the same manner as methamphetamine. Moreover, amphetamine labs pose the same dangers as methamphetamine labs. Not surprisingly, every law enforcement officer with whom I have spoken agreed that the penalties for amphetamine should be the same as those for methamphetamine. For these reasons, the bill equalizes the punishment for manufacturing and trafficking the two drugs. 
   While we know that vigorous law enforcement measures are necessary to combat the methamphetamine scourge, we also recognize that we must act to prevent our youth from ever starting  down the path of drug abuse. We also must find ways to treat those who have become trapped in addiction. For these reasons, the bill contains several significant prevention and treatment provisions. 
   The comprehensive nature of this bill attacks the methamphetamine problem on several fronts. It bolsters our law enforcement efforts to crack down on traffickers, provides treatment and prevention funding for our schools and communities, and authorizes much needed resources for cleaning-up the toxic pollutants left behind by methamphetamine lab operators. 
   I have been working for over a year with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress to pass this important legislation. It is important to highlight that, as part of this process, there have been changes to the bill made in response to legitimate complaints raised by my colleagues and constituents. For example, provisions relating to search warrants and the Internet have been deleted because of these concerns. 
   Overall, this bill represents a bipartisan effort that will result in real progress in our continuing battle against the scourge of methamphetamine. 
   Yet another important anti-drug abuse provision in this bill we are adopting today is the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, or the DATA bill. With the bipartisan cosponsorship of Senators LEVIN, BIDEN and MOYNIHAN, I introduced S. 324 last year, and I am pleased that this bill has been inserted in H.R. 4365. 
   In 1999, as part of the comprehensive methamphetamine bill, S. 486, the DATA bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee and adopted by the full Senate. The DATA bill also was included in the anti-drug provisions that were adopted as part of the bankruptcy reform legislation, S. 625, that passed the Senate last year. I hope the third Senate passage is indeed the charm. 
   The goal of the DATA provisions is simple but it is important: The DATA bill attempts to make drug treatment more available and more effective to those who need it. 
   This legislation focuses on increasing the availability and effectiveness of drug treatment. The purpose of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act is to allow qualified physicians, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services, to prescribe schedule III, IV and V anti-addiction medications in physicians' offices without an additional Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, registration if certain conditions are met. 
   These conditions include certification by participating physicians that they are licensed under state law and have the training and experience to treat opium addicts and they will not treat more than 30 in an office setting unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services adjusts this number. 
   The DATA provisions allow the Secretary, as appropriate, to add to these conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a physician's DEA registration if these conditions are violated. This program will continue after three years only if the Secretary and Attorney General determine that this new type of decentralized treatment should not continue. 
   This bill would also allow the Secretary and Attorney General to discontinue the program earlier than three years if, upon consideration of the specified factors, they determine that early termination is advisable. 
   Nothing in the waiver policy called for in my bill is intended to change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or other facilities or practitioners that conduct drug treatment services under the dual registration system imposed by current law. And nothing in this bill is intended to diminish the existing authority of DEA to enforce rigorously the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. Doctors and health care providers should be free to practice the art of medicine but they may never violate the terms of the Controlled Substances Act. 
   In drafting the waiver provisions of the bill, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse were all consulted. Secretary Shalala has provided her leadership in this area. As well, this initiative is consistent with the announcement of the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, General Barry McCaffrey, of the Administration's intent to work to decentralize methadone treatment. 
   In 1995, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences issued a report, ``Development of Medications for Opiate and Cocaine Addictions: Issues for the Government and Private Sector.'' The study called for ``(d)eveloping flexible, alternative means of controlling the dispensing of anti-addiction narcotic medications that would avoid the `methadone model' of individually approved treatment centers.'' 
   The Drug Addiction Treatment Act--DATA--is exactly the kind of policy initiative that experts have called for in America's multifaceted response to the drug abuse epidemic. I recognize that the DATA legislation is just one mechanism to attack this problem, and I plan to work with my colleagues in the Congress to devise additional strategies to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs. 
   These provisions promote a policy that dramatically improves these lives because it helps those who abuse drugs change their lives and become productive members of society. We have work to do on heroin addiction. For example, a 1997 report by the Utah State Division of Substance Abuse, ``Substance Abuse and Need for Treatment Among Juvenile Arrestees in Utah'' cites literature reporting heroin-using offenders committed 15 times more robberies, 20 times more burglaries, and 10 times more thefts than offenders who do not use drugs. We must stop heroin abuse in Salt Lake City and in all of our nation's cities and communities. 
   In my own state of Utah, I am sorry to report, according to a 1997 survey by the State Division of Substance Abuse, about one in ten Utahns used illicit drug in a given survey month. That number is simply too high; although I cannot imagine that my colleagues would not be similarly alarmed if they looked at data from their own states. We must prevent and persuade our citizens from using drugs and we must help provide effective treatments and systems of treatments for those who succumb to drug abuse. 
   I hope that the success of this system will create incentives for the private sector to continue to develop new medications for the treatment of drug addiction, and I hope that qualified doctors will use the new system and that general practice physicians will take the time and effort to qualify to use this new law to help their addicted patients. I am proud to have worked with the Administration and my colleagues on a bipartisan basis in adopting the DATA provisions and creating this new approach that undoubtedly will improve the ability for many to obtain successful drug abuse treatment. 
   In closing, I also want to commend the many staff persons who have worked so hard on this bill. These include Dave Larson, Anne Phelps, Jackie Parker, Marcia Lee, Kathleen McGowan, Leah Belaire, David Russell, Pattie DeLoatche and Bruce Artim in the Senate and Marc Wheat and John Ford in the House. 
   I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues in the House to pass it as quickly as possible. It is a bill that will raise awareness on children's health issues and, at the same time, assist those who have specific needs with regard to alcohol abuse, drug abuse and mental health issues. It is a good consensus product and is worthy of our support.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I could not believe my ears yesterday afternoon when I heard the Senator from Arizona take out after my home State and my home city. 
   On behalf of the people of Utah and America, I express our outrage over the notion that supporting our country's Olympic Games could be termed either ``parochial'' or ``pork barrel.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   I frankly do not agree with every provision the committee recommends either. But, I do not question the motives or sincerity of my colleagues who put it there. 
   Yesterday, the Senator from Arizona specifically questioned the level of federal support for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. It is, of course, his right to oppose such assistance. But, before he walks further down the plank, I would like to provide a few facts. Perhaps the Senator will reevaluate his position. 
   First, the report just issued by the General Accounting Office, ``Olympic Games: Federal Government Provides Significant Funding and Support,'' is flawed in several respects. I am sorry that the Senator from Arizona has relied so heavily on this document to form his opinions about the Salt Lake Games. 
   Foremost among the problems with the GAO report is the fact that it errs in categorizing a number of projects, specifically in the transportation area, as ``Olympic'' projects. In fact, these are improvements to transportation infrastructure that would have been requested regardless of whether Salt Lake had been awarded the Olympic bid. 
   I would be happy to show the Senator from Arizona the details of the I-15 improvements and why they were necessary to repair road and bridge deterioration, implement safety designs, and relieve congestion. None of this has anything to do with the Olympic Games. Local planning for this project was actually begun in 1982, 13 years before Salt Lake City was awarded the Games. 
   GAO itself implies that the inclusion of these projects as Olympic projects is misleading. The report states on page 8: ``According to federal officials, the majority of the funds would have been provided to host cities and states for infrastructure 
   projects, such as highways and transit systems, regardless of the Olympic Games.'' 
   The major effect of the 2002 Olympic Games on this project is the timetable for completion. Quite obviously, we cannot have jersey walls marking off construction zones and one-lane passages during the Games. 
   Moreover, while Utah has sought and received some federal assistance for the project, the I-15 reconstruction project has been funded substantially by Utah's Centennial Highway Fund, which was established in 1997 and funded by an increase in the state's gasoline tax. This fact seems to disappear from the radar screen during these debates. 
   The GAO report also ascribes the TRAX North-South light rail system to the Olympic expense column. This, too, is not the case. The full funding agreement for the North-South light rail project was granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation in August 1995, less than two months after Salt Lake was awarded the Games. Clearly light rail was not initiated because of the Games. 
   While the light rail system will certainly benefit Olympic spectators during the Games, that is not why Salt Lake City and communities south of the city built it. 
   Salt Lake is growing by leaps and bounds. More and more people commute into the city--not unlike the Washington metropolitan area. It is a city that is striving to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of public transportation. That is why they built light rail. 
   I would like to point out to my colleagues that the General Accounting Office did another report entitled, ``Surface Infrastructure: Costs, Financing and Schedules for Large-Dollar Transportation Projects.'' In this 1998 report, the GAO evaluated Utah's major transportation projects for the House Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. This report concluded that both the I-15 and light rail projects were being efficiently run and were well within budget. Many of the contracts were being awarded at costs lower than expected. Yet, this fact was not included in the debate yesterday. 
   The Department of Transportation Inspector General issued a report in November 1998 concluding that the I-15 reconstruction project was on schedule and that the cost estimates were reasonable. It also praised Utah's use of the ``design-build'' method of contracting on this project. This fact was similarly omitted from the discussion yesterday. 
   Contrary to the impression left by the Senator from Arizona, 
   the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, SLOC, has never sought to ``sneak'' anything into an appropriations bill. Mitt Romney and his staff have been open about every dime being requested. 
   Those transportation projects which are necessary to put on the Olympic Games in 2002 were delineated in a transportation plan submitted to and approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The funds being requested were detailed in that plan. 
   The Senator from Arizona yesterday implied that these so-called ``pork barrel'' appropriations for the 2002 Winter Games were an outgrowth of the Olympic bribery scandal which has embarrassed my home state. His comments were most unfortunate for many reasons--not the least of which is his suggestion that these appropriations requests are in any way improper is just wrong. 
   SLOC made its budget publicly available to the press. It has briefed officials at federal agencies and at the White House. SLOC has regularly visited with members of Congress including members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Right from the outset, SLOC outlined their plans and budgets and has provided periodic updates. These updates have showed lower requirements for federal assistance. But, again, this fact was not mentioned in the GAO report or by the Senator from Arizona. 
   A second criticism of the GAO report is its comparison of federal support for the Los Angeles Summer Games in 1984 to federal assistance for the Salt Lake Games in 2002. Simply put, this is an apples to oranges comparison. 
   First, the Salt Lake Olympic Committee has fully integrated planning for the Paralympic Games with the Olympic Games. The Paralympics did not even exist in 1984. In 1996, Atlanta chose to have two separate organizing entities. 
   Second, the Senator from Arizona may not have noticed, but there have been an estimated 7,282 reported terrorist attacks since 1984. Let me refresh my colleagues' memories. These attacks have included: Pam Am Flight 103 in 1988; the World Trade Center in 1993; the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995; the Tokyo subway in 1995; Khobar Towers in 1997; and U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. 
   Not all of them have been on the front pages of major newspapers, but this startling number demonstrates the need for enhanced security at an international event like the Olympic Games. The same level of security provided for the Los Angeles Games would most likely be inadequate for the Salt Lake Games. It is essential that we provide security based on the situation in the year 2002. 
   Security and counterterrorism are legitimate federal duties. I am glad the Secret Service is getting $14.8 million for 
   communications infrastructure. I want our law enforcement personnel to have the best equipment available, not just for the Salt Lake City Olympics, but at all times. 
   I do not believe that the Secret Service, FBI, and other security agencies are buying disposable products. This equipment will be well used to keep Americans safe in cities all across America. 
   Third, and perhaps most importantly, by the GAO's own calculation, only $254 million is requested for planning and staging the Games, not the $1.3 billion figure cited yesterday. I would like to note that this is roughly 25 percent of the entire budget for the Salt Lake Games. 
   If that seems like a lot, let us review the point made by the Congressional Research Service in its 1997 report, ``Financing the Olympic Games Held in the United States, 1904-1960: A Brief Overview,'' and noted by the GAO. In  1960, Squaw Valley received an appropriation of $20 million to assist in staging the Winter Olympic Games--about 25 percent of the total budget for the Games. 
   Let me be clear that I am not advocating an automatic 25 percent federal subsidy for a host city. But, I wish to make the point that this level of assistance is not unprecedented and could be construed as quite modest when compared with governmental subsidies foreign cities receive from their national governments. 
   Before I conclude, Mr. President, I would like to make one final point. 
   The Senator from Arizona suggested yesterday that the USOC should not consider bids of cities that do not have the capacity to host the Games. 
   Well, Mr. President, that would eliminate every city in America from hosting an Olympic Games, summer or winter. No city--not even New York or Los Angeles--could put on a 21st century, multi-week, international event like this entirely on its own. 
   Think about this: Lake Placid, New York, has hosted the Winter Games twice, in 1932 and in 1980. But, in 1990, Lake Placid had a population of fewer than 2500 people. There is no way metropolitan Salt Lake City, with a million people, let alone Lake Placid could host these Games under the proposed McCain criteria. 
   Allow me to suggest, Mr. President, that America itself will host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, just as it did in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Lake Placid, or Squaw Valley. An American bid city is selected by the United States Olympic Committee for its organizational ability and world class sporting venues. It becomes America's choice. If chosen by the IOC, the city does not host the Games on its own behalf, but for our whole country. 
   When a U.S. athlete mounts the podium in Salt Lake City two years from now, the music you hear will not be ``Come, Come Ye Saints.'' No, it will be ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' our country's national anthem. 
   I agree with the GAO and with Senator MCCAIN on one thing. I agree that we ought to give some consideration to how, if the United States ever hosts another Olympic Games, we should support the host city. There is much to commend a better process for such support. 
   I would be very happy to join Senator MCCAIN in such a mission. But, I wish that, in the meantime, he would join us in support of America's host city for the XIX Winter Olympiad.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when I first introduced this legislation over one year ago, Medicare beneficiaries with advanced heart disease could not gain access to ventriculaassist devices. Medicare patients who could have benefitted from cochlear implants did not receive them. 
   It is now over a year later. Unfortunately, these problems still persist. Medicare beneficiaries still have trouble gaining access to many technologies that are covered under private plans. And while the Omnibus Budget legislation for FY 2001 addressed the overall problem and by addressing access concerns for Medicare beneficiaries, there is still plenty of work that needs to be done. That is why I am introducing the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act 2000 today. 
   We must eliminate the delays and barriers to access that have arisen in the way Medicare decides to cover, code and pay for new devices and diagnostics. The measure I am introducing today is identical to legislation introduced by Congressman JIM RAMSTAD and Congresswoman KAREN THURMAN earlier this year. It seeks to build off of the success we had last year in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act. The BBRA represented an important first step in creating a Medicare program that provides timely access to needed treatments. 
   The BBRA, which was signed into law as part of last year's omnibus budget legislation made significant changes. We crafted special temporary payments for new breakthrough technologies to ensure they are provided to Medicare beneficiaries in a timely manner. We also established payment categories that better reflect advances in clinical practice and technology. 
   The Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act 2000 recognizes that all Medicare beneficiaries, not just those in the outpatient setting, should be able to benefit from these kinds of improvements. 
   The bill would require: annual updates of Medicare's payment programs; temporary procedure codes to be issued by Medicare for new technologies at the time of FDA review; quarterly updates of Medicare's payment codes; external data to be used to improve the timeliness and appropriateness of reimbursement decisions; and annual reports be made on the timeliness of its coverage, coding and payment decisions. 
   There are some notable changes in this new version of the bill: 
   A provision to extend the issuance of temporary codes and quarterly coding updates to inpatient, or ICD-9, codes as well as outpatient (HCPCS) codes. 
   A provision to require HCFA to create open, timely procedures and sound methods for making coding and payment decisions for new diagnostic tests. It would also give stakeholders the ability to appeal a coding or payment decision for a diagnostic test. 
   This legislation will provide assistance to Medicare beneficiaries who currently face almost insurmountable barriers to advanced technologies. 
   Without this bill, Medicare will continue to fall far short of making the latest technologies and procedures available to beneficiaries in a timely manner. 
   I will fight for enactment of this bill in an effort to make sure that our seniors have access to the advanced treatments that can save and improve their lives.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that will allow all state diabetes education programs to be reimbursed by the Medicare program. Currently, state diabetes education programs that only have state certification are not able to receive Medicare reimbursement for the fine work that they do as far as educating diabetics in the communities. As a result, these individuals have less access to the education that they need to control their diabetes. 
   This issue was brought to my attention by the Program Director of the Utah Diabetes Control Program. There are 32 diabetes education programs in Utah that are either Utah certified or recognized by the American Diabetes Association. Eighteen of those programs have only state certification and seven of those are located in rural communities of Utah, including Moab, Price, Roosevelt, Gunnison, Payson, and Tooele. 
   Without this legislation, these 18 programs cannot be reimbursed by Medicare unless they are certified by the American Diabetes Association. In Utah, our state certification program exceeds national standards. In addition to submitting an application and documentation that the education programs meet the national standards, Utah Diabetes Control Program staff conduct site visits with all applying programs. The staff also collects data through annual reports to assess continued quality and outcomes. 
   One of the biggest concerns that has been brought to my attention by the Utah Department of Health is that the American Diabetes Association charges $850 for state programs to apply for ADA certification. The smaller state diabetes education programs have indicated that the ADA fee is cost-prohibitive for them, especially in the more rural areas. On the other hand, state certification is free to all applicants. 
   I understand that this problem not only exists in Utah, but across the country. I believe that this matter needs to be addressed by Congress so that all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of where they live, will have access to diabetes education programs.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this proposal has engendered one of the most serious and genuine debates we have had recently in the Senate. I have listened carefully to the pros and cons of H.R. 4444 which have been expressed over the last several months as well as here on the Senate floor in the last several weeks. 
   I have not come to a decision lightly and have given a great deal of consideration to all the arguments. There is no question that China is today a communist police state. There is no question that it has an abysmal human rights record. 
   But, the question is not the state of China today. It is what impact PNTR will have in the future, both for the United States and for China. 
   On balance, Mr. President, I have concluded that permanent normal trade relations with China and passage of H.R. 4444 will contribute to America's commercial prospects, enhance the spread of free market principles, and further strengthen the social and economic forces in China that will eventually sweep the police state into the dustbin of history. 
   Mr. President, Asia is the state of Utah's fourth largest market. While the predominant consumer of Utah exports is Japan, which buys nearly $500 million of Utah's products, as China's economy grows, so will the demand for Utah's industrial machinery, processed foods, nutritional and health food products, electronic software, and other products demanded by maturing societies. 
   This trade development cannot occur without PNTR, which will allow the U.S. to take China to court over unfair trading practices. 
   Up to now, Utah's 1,200 informational technology companies have been at a disadvantage in the Chinese market. The Chinese steal and counterfeit virtually all software, videos, and other intellectual property media entering the country. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over copyrights and patents, I am most concerned with enforcing intellectual property laws both at home and abroad. China's WTO membership will place major restraints on pirating, the most important of which is our right to take China to the WTO dispute settlement panels. 
   It is worthwhile to note, Mr. President, that the U.S., whose economy is the most dynamic in the world, and whose producers are the most law-abiding, will be the beneficiary of the equal enforcement of the trade rules of the WTO, which we played a large role in shaping. This is not merely a prediction: To date, the U.S. has won over 90 percent of the cases we have initiated before the WTO. 
   If the U.S denied China PNTR, we would lose the right to go to court and would risk surrendering our market access potential in China to our competitors. 
   Mr. President, job-creating Utah businesses want PNTR. Utah's business community understands the prospective value of China's trade as well as the benefits of WTO. In meetings with state agricultural groups, community leaders, as well as virtually every other major job-creating business sector with export markets or export-market potential in the state, the demands have been consistent: ``Give us access to China.'' 
   While this position is strongly held in Utah, it would be unfair to say it is unanimous. Utah's steel worker community, for example, opposes PNTR for China. But, with WTO, I believe many of their fears can be addressed, since China's current ability to dump steel products in the U.S., and anywhere else, can now be met head-on with a WTO dispute settlement judgment that would bring sanctions against the Chinese, not just from the U.S., but from the entire world. 
   I have worked hard to assure the steel interests in Utah regarding the passage of PNTR. We passed the Steel Trade Enforcement Act of 1999, which requires the President to consult with steel companies suffering from dumping and to get their consent as a condition for lifting dumping-related sanctions. 
   Finally, a third advantage is afforded the steel industry in the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement, which has a 12-year restriction on exports from China that surge into the U.S. causing sudden, often irreparable harm to this important sector of our economy. 
   The fact is, the American economy dominates, and has benefitted enormously from, the global marketplace. That includes Utah. Today, 5.2 percent of Utah's gross state product comes from merchandise exports. Utah sent $2.6 billion of exports into the global marketplace in 1999, and we expect an increase of about five percent in export volume for the year 
   2000. 
   Trade-related jobs in the state, especially in the manufacturing sector, are more stable, pay better, and tend to demand higher skills. International trade competition is good for Utah. 
   There have been, and will be, job losses, but Utah's economy has absorbed them. But, Utah also provides an excellent system for assisting workers make transitions to new positions, including education and training trade-displaced persons for new skills in new industries. I will continue to support these programs. 
   Utah has the right type of industrial base. We have an unmatched business climate for export-oriented companies. My state's population is sophisticated in terms of linguistic skills, cultural experience and tolerance, foreign travel, overseas living experience. Our infrastructure is in place: we have an international airport; our ports of entry are modern and automated; our freight forwarding and customs brokerage communities are highly efficient; our merchandise and commercial banking, insurance and other financial institutional base is competitive with any region in the world. We are poised for another economic take-off, and passage of PNTR so that China and the U.S. can actively participate in the WTO is essential. 
   Mr. President, the WTO enhances the free market principles that I have been committed to since I came to the Senate in 1977. I remain a conservative who believes that the lessons of the 20th century regarding the relationship between the free market and individual freedoms are incontrovertible. 
   I remain convinced of the theses presented by such great thinkers as the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and the American Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman. Capitalism cannot exist without expanding individual freedoms. And the growth of individual freedom is antithetical to authoritarian control. 
   I believe that the opportunities of a free market which have so essentially contributed to our own growth and development will also benefit societies all over the world. 
   From this perspective, I have been a little disappointed by the way some members have characterized aspects of this debate, particularly when they used the term greed in opposition to  national security interests. I do not believe the promotion of capitalism is synonymous with the promotion of greed. It is an excess of self-interest that can lead to greed; but greed, of course, is not limited to capitalist societies, and I wish to make clear that I believe that those who are promoting PNTR for China are doing so for honorable reasons, and not for greed. 
   Moreover, for individual corporations, PNTR is no guarantee of success. Companies must still manufacture and market a good product. They must still be competitive. 
   I have spoken at length about the commercial benefits of granting PNTR for China for Utah, as numerous other speakers have discussed the benefits to their states. But our duties here as Senators require that we always consider the national interest as well as the local interest. And, in this debate, we have revisited again, throughout the exchanges we've had on numerous amendments, the broader question of the U.S.-Sino bilateral relationship and American national security interests. 
   Let me be clear: I deplore the appalling human rights situation in China today, including the repression of political expression and other fundamental expressions of human conscience. I deplore the repugnant practices in forced abortion and organ harvesting. All of this is evidence of the continuing level of social backwardness and political barbarism that remains in effect in many parts of China. 
   But there is a relationship between barbarism and economic autarky that cannot be denied. The peak of modern China's human rights atrocities--measured on a grotesque scale in human casualties--occured during a period when China was in self-imposed economic and political isolation from the rest of the world. During Mao's reign, through the Cultural Revolution, and prior to the opening to the rest of the world orchestrated by President Richard Nixon, over 40 million Chinese were murdered or starved by their government. What a tragic reality that is, Mr. President, but reality it is. 
   Capitalism corrodes communism, Mr. President. Opportunity crowds out totalitarianism. We have certainly seen that occur since Deng Xiaoping realized that the only way China could develop--could, in fact, recover from nearly a quarter century of Mao's economic nihilism--was to open to the world and to engage the free market. 
   One thing I'm not, Mr. President, is a pollyanna. As I've said, I am aware of the political and human rights conditions in China today. 
   The fact is that many of the Chinese are also aware of the situation. The abortion policies, for example, are not supported by the Chinese people. Some Chinese are even becoming aware of a growing social problem called by scholars here the ``surplus males 
   phenomena.'' Dr. Valerie Hudson of Brigham Young University has done excellent work in this area. 
   Orwellian population practices in China have had the effect of creating a growing demographic imbalance in Chinese society between men and women. As the demographic bulge in men moves into young adulthood, Chinese society will grapple with a surfeit of unmarried men. The potential consequences for internal and external instability should be of great concern to the Chinese authorities, as well as for us. These are the consequences of the communist control over families for the past two generations. 
   China has a huge population with a small percentage of arable land. The Maoist answer was to kill large segments of the population through starvation and promote the most inhumane abortion policies in the modern era. As China has opened up to the rest of the world, however, the Chinese are starting to recognize that the answer to population pressures is not a totalitarian abortion policy, but economic development that can support families. 
   The best example for them is Hong Kong, which has a large population on a piece of land that has virtually no natural resources, except a harbor. Capitalism provided the economic development that launched Hong Kong into the developed world, probably beating the PRC to that level of economic development by at least a century, if current predictions hold. 
   Mr. President, I support PNTR because I want to see an end to the barbarisms, such as the abortion policies, of the Chinese police state. Capitalism corrodes communism. 
   We have had a long debate on a number of amendments. Frankly, many of these amendments, all of which have been defeated on this bill, would pass the Senate as amendments to other legislative vehicles, or as stand-alone bills. Certainly the debate over China's deplorable record on proliferation, and the legislative proposal presented by the Thompson-Torricelli amendment, are worthy of further discussion and review. 
   While we will end the annual most-favored nation review of the PRC, nothing of this PNTR debate proscribes the Senate from future initiatives regarding the bilateral U.S.-Sino relationship. 
   Mr. President, sometime, I believe within my lifetime, there is going to be a change in China. There will be a transition from the current police state. I am quite certain of that. 
   I am somewhat less certain--as is any other analyst--about what the change will be. The analysts have parsed out the possibilities for us, including chaos and disintegration, a new Chinese fascism, or another Chinese democratic state. I say ``another,'' because Taiwan has demonstrated conclusively that there are no particular Asian values that prevent the Chinese people from developing, nurturing and robustly practicing democracy. 
   United States policy cannot guarantee the outcome of the transition in mainland China--it would be naive to think otherwise. But we can influence the evolution toward the most desirable outcome. That means promoting economic development and the values of the free market in China. We should plant these seeds, Mr. President. 
   A vote for PNTR is a vote for promoting economic markets for Utah and other American companies, for promoting economic development in China, and for promoting the rule of law in China. PNTR is a promising means of accomplishing these goals, not just for the benefit of U.S. commerce, but also for long-term U.S. strategic interests.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, at the request of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Senator LEAHY and I are introducing the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. This legislation was drafted by the Judicial Conference and is based upon the recently completed biennial survey of judgeship needs conducted by the Judicial Conference, which analyzed caseload statistics for each federal district court and circuit court of appeals. The legislation sets forth the Judicial Conference's recommendation that the Congress create 63 new federal judgeships throughout the country--10 new circuit court judgeships and 53 new district court judgeships.  
   Perhaps the federalism decisions that have marked the tenure of the Rehnquist Court ultimately will serve to check the expansion of federal jurisdiction and the caseload burdens and need for new judges that necessarily follow such expansion. Presently, however, many of our judges--especially those in the border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California--are overburdened by heavy caseloads. Caseload statistics compiled by the Judicial Conference have convinced me of the need for a debate about new judgeships. In this debate, we must ask ourselves: How large do we really want our federal judiciary to be? 
   It should be noted that over the past 22 years, the judiciary has grown substantially. Currently, there are 848 judgeships created pursuant to article III of the Constitution. By contrast, just 23 years ago, there were only 509 Article III judgeships. this growth in the size of the federal judiciary--a 67 percent increase--has outpaced growth in the size of the United States. During the same period, the population of the United States has grown by just 24 percent, from 220 million to 275 million. 
   Given that there are only a few weeks remaining in this Congress, it is going to be difficult to achieve consensus on a comprehensive judgeship bill. Nevertheless, it is important that the views of the Judicial Conference on the issue of judgeship be brought to the attention of the Congress and given the appropriate level of consideration. Still, it is possible that consensus may be reached on legislation authorizing new judgeships. I know that many of my colleagues share my concerns about the expansion of the federal judiciary. It is my judgment, however, that the Judicial Conference's recommendation that additional judgeships be created be brought to the attention of the Congress. I look forward to a dialogue with my colleagues on this issue.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to implore my colleagues to work with me in moving the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act, S. 2045, toward enactment. 
   One of our greatest priorities is--and ought to be--keeping our economy vibrant, and expanding educational opportunities for America's children and its workers. 
   That is my priority for this country and that is my priority for my home State of Utah. 
   I am proud of the growth and development in my own home State--growth that has made Utah one of the leaders of the world in our high tech economy. 
   Utah's information technology vendor industry is among Utah's largest industries, and among the top 10 regions of IT--or information technology--activity in the U.S. 
   Notably, Utah was listed among the top ten IT centers in the world by Newsweek magazine in November 1998. 
   The growth of information technology is nowhere more evident and dramatic than in my own home State of Utah. 
   According to the Utah Information Technologies Association, our IT vendor industry grew nearly 9 percent between 1997 and 1998, and consists of 2,427 business enterprises. 
   While I am on the subject, let me just also note that just a couple of weeks ago, a major high-tech company in Utah announced the layoff of several hundred Utahns. We have several indications that alternative jobs are available. 
   I continue to watch this closely. I certainly want these skilled and talented people to remain in our State rather than being hired by other companies in other States. 
   In Utah and elsewhere, our continued economic growth, and our competitive edge in the world economy require an adequate supply of highly skilled high tech workers. This remains one of our great challenges in the 21st century, requiring both short- and long-term solutions.  
   The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act, S. 2045, contains both. 
   In the short-term, a tight labor market, increasing globalization, and a burgeoning economy have combined to increase demand for skilled workers well beyond what was forecast when Congress last addressed the issue of temporary visas for highly skilled workers in 1998. Therefore, my bill, once again, increases the annual cap for the next three years. 
   That, Mr. President, is nothing more than a short term solution to the workforce needs in my State and across the country. 
   The longer term solution lies with our own children and our own workers; and in ensuring that our education and training of our current and future workforce matches the demands in our high tech 21st century global economy. 
   Thus, working with my colleagues, I have included in this bill strong, effective, and forward-looking provisions directing the more than $100 million in fees generated by the visas toward the education and retraining of our children and our workforce. 
   Those provisions are included in the substitute which I am prepared to offer today. 
   We are here, today, however, as this session of Congress comes to a close, with the fate of this critical legislation extremely uncertain. 
   Frankly, when this bill was reported by the Committee, I thought we were on track to move this rapidly through the Senate. 
   I offered to sit down with other Members--including my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, my colleague from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN--to work with them on provisions regarding education and training. We have done that. 
   And, I as I have noted, I am pleased to report that the substitute which I intend to offer to this bill, reflects the majority of their ideas and proposals. 
   Quite unexpectedly, however, the White House weighed in with what sounded to me like an ultimatum tying passage of this to other unrelated, costly and far reaching immigration amendments. 
   Mr. President, I hope we can get this done. 
   I know the majority leader filed cloture earlier today on a motion to proceed. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days to try and avoid a confrontational process. 
   Again, I hope we can get this done for American workers and children and for our continued economic expansion. 
   I am grateful to be able to say these words today because I want to move this bill forward. It is in the best interest of our country. It is in the best interest of of our high-tech community. We are talking about nanotechnology technology, quantum computers, all kinds of educational projects in which, literally, this Nation needs to be the leader. The only way we are going to be the leader is if we continue to accentuate the positive by having the best high-tech minds working with us. 
   Many of these people for whom we want to allow visas are people who have been educated in our country, given our education and given our information. Frankly, it is much to our advantage to have some of them have the privilege of working here before they go back to their own countries. This bill will help to resolve that. To have it enmeshed in politics, as the White House has tried to do, is a tremendous, incredible mistake. 
   I hope the President and those who are advising him will back off. Let us pass this bill and keep the United States at the forefront of the high-tech revolution. 
   That is my goal. As everyone knows, I have worked very hard in this area. I daresay there is probably no more important bill in this Congress, as far as the information technology industry and the high-tech community are concerned, than this particular bill. There are others that rise to its equal, but nothing rises beyond it. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, in introducing today legislation to increase Medicare reimbursements for skilled nursing facilities, SNFs, which care for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   As my colleagues recall, last year the Congress passed a measure to restore nearly $2.7 billion for the care of nursing home patients. This action provided much needed relief to an industry that was facing extraordinary financial difficulties as a result of the spending reductions provided under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) as well as its implementation by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). 
   Unfortunately, the problem is not fixed, and more needs to be done. That is why Senator DOMENICI and I are introducing the ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act of 2000'' to ensure that patient care will not be compromised and so that seniors can rest assured that they will have access to this important Medicare benefit. 
   As I have talked to my constituents in Utah about nursing home care, it is clear to me as I am sure it is to everyone that no one ever expects--or certainly wants--to be in a nursing home. Yet, it is an important Medicare benefit for many seniors who have been hospitalized and are, in fact, the sickest residents in a nursing home. 
   In Utah, there are currently 93 nursing homes serving nearly 5,800 residents. I understand that seven of these 93 facilities, which are operated by Vencor, have filed for Chapter 11 protection. These seven facilities care for approximately 800 residents. Clearly, we need to be concerned about the prospect of these nursing homes going out of business, and the consequences that such action would have on all residents--no matter who pays the bill. 
   The ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act of 2000'' has been developed to address this problem. Medicare beneficiaries who need care in nursing  homes are those who have been hospitalized and then need comparable medical attention in the nursing home setting. In other words, they have had a stroke, cancer, complex surgery, serious infection or other serious health problem. These seniors are often the sickest and most frail. 
   Medicare's skilled nursing benefit provides life enhancing care following a hospitalization to nearly two million of these seniors annually. Unless Congress and the Health Care Financing Administration take the necessary steps to ensure proper payments, elderly patients will be at risk, especially in rural, underserved and economically disadvantaged areas. 
   Moreover, in an economy of near full employment, nursing homes face the added difficulty of recruiting and retaining high quality nursing staff. The ability to retain high quality skilled nursing staff ensures access to lifesaving medical services for our nation's most vulnerable seniors. 
   Flaws in the new Medicare payment system have clearly underestimated the actual cost of caring for medically complex patients. Subsequent adjustments have led to critical under- funding. Patient care is being adversely affected. Unfortunately, HCFA maintains that it needs statutory authority to fix the problem. The provisions in the Hatch/Domenici bill are designed to address this issue. 
   Our legislation provides that authority. In addition, the bill requires HCFA to examine actual data and actual Medicare skilled nursing facility cost increases. Studies have indicated that the initial HCFA adjustment has been understated by approximately 13.5 percent. Pursuant to the Hatch/Domenici bill, HCFA would be required to make the necessary adjustments in the SNF market basket index to better account for annual cost increases in providing skilled nursing care to medically complex patients. 
   Since HCFA's review and adjustments as provided under our bill will not be immediate, our legislation would also increase the inflation adjustment by four percent for fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002, respectively. This immediate funding increase is necessary to ensure continuity of quality patient care in the interim. It will provide some assurance that quality skilled nursing facility services for our nation's seniors will continue, while HCFA examines actual cost data and develops a more accurate market basket index. 
   Skilled nursing facilities are being underpaid and most of the payment is for nurses' aides and therapists. According to a study conducted by Buck Consultants that surveyed managerial, supervisory, and staff positions in nursing homes, actual wages for these valued employees increased, on average, 21.9 percent between 1995 and 1998. 
   Buck Consultants examined data gathered from a voluntary nursing home survey by looking at salary increases for 37 types of clinical, administrative, and support positions. The difference between HCFA's 8.2 percent inflation adjustment and these salary increases over the same period of time equal 13.7 percent. Again, it is clear that skilled nursing facilities are not receiving adequate payment from the Medicare program. With such funding shortfalls, skilled employees cannot be hired and patient care will be impacted. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that the ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act of 2000'' will provide immediate relief to skilled nursing facilities and the seniors they serve, while attempting to address a fundamental payment shortcoming for the long-term. We cannot forget our commitment to our nation's elderly. 
   Senator DOMENICI and I are working with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, who is also concerned about the impact that the BBA Medicare reimbursement levels are having on skilled nursing facilities and who is currently developing a package of Medicare restorations for health care providers. Over the next several weeks, we will work with him and with members of the Finance Committee in an effort to restore funding for SNFs and for other health care providers who are facing similar reimbursement reductions. 
   Once again, I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and his staff for working with me in developing this important bill and preserving Medicare's commitment to our nation's elderly.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Health Care Safety Net Oversight Act of 2000, which is an important step toward addressing a critical issue facing our country: the fact that over 40 million Americans lack health insurance. 
   While it is natural to question the need for any new commission, I believe this legislation is more than warranted given the fact that there is such a substantial number of Americans who are uninsured and there is to date no comprehensive solution to this problem. 
   Despite the hard work of Community Health Centers in Utah and throughout the Nation, and despite the many, many efforts of others who are working to improve health care delivery in hospitals, emergency rooms and clinics, two facts remain. First, it is deplorable that in a Nation as great as the United States, we still have so many people who lack basic health care services. And second, there is no national consensus on how this problem should be addressed by the public and private sectors. 
   It is obvious that we need to begin the process toward developing that necessary consensus, and I believe the Health Care Safety Net Oversight Commission's work will help us meet that goal. 
   I commend Senator BAUCUS and my colleagues for their work which has led to introduction of our bipartisan bill tonight. As the legislation progresses, I do want to work with them to improve a limited number of provisions in the bill, including the funding source for the Commission.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Senate in anticipation of its action in passing the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. I want to express my appreciation specifically to the lead cosponsor of this bill, Senator KENNEDY. He and I worked together almost 10 years ago in enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. He has once again demonstrated his commitment to religious liberty by his leadership and effort on this measure. 
   I also express my appreciation to Senators THURMOND and REID. Both of these Senators had strong and serious concerns about portions of this bill but were willing to work with us to secure passage of this legislation because of their overriding commitment to religious freedom. 
   Our bill deals with just two areas where religious freedom has been threatened--land use regulation and persons in prisons, mental hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions. Our bill will ensure that if a government action substantially burdens the exercise of religion in these two areas, the government must demonstrate that imposing the burden serves a compelling public interest and does so by the least restrictive means. In addition, with respect to land use regulation, the bill specifically prohibits various forms of religious discrimination and exclusion. 
   It is no secret that I would have preferred a broader bill than the one before us today. Recognizing, however, the hurdles facing passage of such a bill, supporters have correctly, in my view, agreed to move forward on this more limited, albeit critical, effort. The willingness of many serious and well-intentioned persons has brought us to this successful conclusion in the Senate today and likely swift action in the House of Representatives this fall. 
   I thank all persons involved in this effort. Numerous religious denominations have come together with other groups in the spirit of cooperation to form the Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion. They have joined forces and concentrated their energy on this vital issue--I am grateful to all of them. 
   In conclusion, I thank the staff members who devoted so much of their time and who worked so hard to ensure the success of this bill. In particular, I would like to thank Eric George, my former counsel, Manus Cooney, my Chief Counsel, Sharon Prost, my Deputy Chief Counsel, and Sam Harkness, a law clerk for the Judiciary Committee. Their collective work has brought us to where we are today. Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of Senator KENNEDY; specifically, Melanie Barnes and David Sutphen, who were a pleasure to work with. Eddie Ayoob, from the office of Senator REID, also provided valuable assistance. Finally, I would like to thank the dedicated professionals at the Department of Justice who helped in the effort.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Shivwits Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act and send this legislation to the President. This is an important day for the citizens of Washington County, Utah, and the members of the Shivwits Band. This legislation will finally provide a settlement of water rights issues of the Santa Clara  River in Washington County, the driest county in the second driest state in the Union. 
   The Santa Clara is a fairly small river running through the Shivwits Band's reservation near the city of St. George, Utah. This water is shared by the Washington County, the Washington County Water Conservancy District, St. George, the town of Ivins, the town of Santa Clara, and the Shivwits Band. Last, but not least, Mr. President, this water is also used by the Virgin Spinedace, an endangered fish species residing in the river. This water settlement meets the needs of all of these interested parties. 
   This legislation will also establish the St. George Water Reuse Project. This project will provide 2,000 acre-feet of water for the Shivwits Band. It will also create the Santa Clara Project. This project will provide a pressurized pipeline from the nearby Gunlock Reservoir to deliver 1,900 acre-feet of water to the Shivwits Band. 
   I was pleased to be the sponsor of this bill in the Senate, and I would like to express my deep appreciation to Chairman CAMPBELL and Vice Chairman INOUYE of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee for their outstanding support for this legislation. Without their help and the help of their staffs, this legislation would not have progressed as smoothly as it has. I also express my appreciation to my good friend, Senator BENNETT, a cosponsor of this bill, for his support. 
   Finally, however, I want to give due credit to the Administration, the local officials of Washington County, and the members of the Shivwits Band for constructing this agreement. I am a firm believer in a collaborative process and the inclusion of local officials and citizens in it. I believe that legislation--both before and after passage--can be far more successful than when local input is missing from a bill's development. 
   Again, I want to thank all Senators for their support of this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the bill introduced today by my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator DEWINE, that would provide relief for payment of asbestos-related claims. 
   I urge my colleagues on the Finance Committee to take a close look at the serious problem this bill addresses. Certain manufacturers who were required by government specification to use asbestos in their products are facing a severe financial crisis arising from claims made by individuals who are suffering health problems from asbestos-related diseases. These claims have put several of these companies into bankruptcy, and several more appear to be on the brink of insolvency. Thousands of jobs may be at stake, as may be the proper compensation of the victims of the illnesses. 
   A major part of the underlying justification for this measure is that the federal government shares some culpability in the harm caused by the asbestos-related products manufactured by these companies. For example, from World War II through the Vietnam War, the government required that private contractors and shipyard workers use asbestos to insulate navy ships from so-called ``secondary fires.'' Because of sovereign immunity, however, the government has not had to share in paying the damages, leaving American companies to bear the full and ongoing financial load of compensation. 
   The legislation we are introducing today is a step toward recognizing that the federal government is partially responsible for payment of these claims. It does so through two income tax provisions, both of which directly benefit the victims of the illnesses. 
   The first provision exempts from income tax the income earned by a designated or qualified settlement fund established for the principal purpose of resolving and satisfying present and future claims relating to asbestos illnesses. The effect of this provision, Mr. President, is to increase the amount of money available for the payment of these claims. 
   The second provision allows taxpayers with specified liability losses attributable to asbestos to carry back those losses to the tax year in which the taxpayer, or its predecessor company, was first involved in producing or distributing products containing asbestos. 
   This provision is a matter of fairness, Mr. President. Because of the long latency period related to asbestos-related diseases, which can be as long as 40 years, many of these claims are just now arising. Current law provides for the carryback of this kind of liability losses, but only for a ten-year period. 
   Many of the companies involved earned profits and paid taxes on those profits in the years the asbestos-related products were made or distributed. However, it is now clear, many years after the taxes were paid, that there were no profits earned at all, since millions of dollars of health claims relating to those products must now be paid. 
   It is only fair, and it is sound tax policy, to allow relief for situations like these. Again, it should be emphasized that the primary beneficiaries of this tax change will not be the corporations, but the victims of the illnesses, because the taxpayer would be required to devote the entire amount of the tax reduction to paying the claims. 
   This is not the only time the federal government has been at least partially responsible for health problems of citizens that arose many years after the event that initially triggered the problem. During the Cold War, America conducted above ground atomic tests during which the wind blew the fallout into communities and ranches of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. The government also demanded quantities of uranium, which is harmful to those who mined and milled it. The incidence of cancers and other debilitating diseases caused by this activity among the ``downwinders,'' miners and millers has been acknowledged by the federal government. 
   The least we can do for those manufacturers forced to use asbestos instead of other materials is provide some tax relief for their compensation funds. 
   This legislation has substantial bipartisan backing. It is sponsored in the House by both the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Judiciary Committee. It is backed by the by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and by at least one related labor union. This bill addresses a very serious problem and is the right thing to do. I hope we can pass it expeditiously.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier today, we approved the Helms substitute to H.R. 3519, ``Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000.'' I was pleased to support this legislation, recognizing the need for our country to support an enhanced effort to prevent and treat AIDS and tuberculosis abroad. 
   I was pleased to work with Chairman HELMS, Senator BIDEN, Senator FRIST, Senator SMITH of Oregon, and other members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as this legislation was finalized, and, indeed, I want to work closely with them on our continuing efforts to address the problems of infectious diseases in the developing world. 
   For the reasons I will lay out today, I believe the aid we make possible in H.R. 3519 should be expanded to embrace not only HIV/AIDS and TB, but also malaria as well. In fact, I think it essential to make sure our foreign assistance program in Africa and the developing world coordinates its activities closely among these three diseases. 
   With the support of Chairman HELMS, Senator BIDEN, and Senator FRIST in the Senate, and Chairman LEACH in the House of Representatives, I have drafted companion legislation to H.R. 3519 which make certain that U.S. efforts for all three diseases are well-coordinated. 
   Accordingly, I rise today to introduce S. 2940 the ``International Malaria Control Act of 2000''. 
   The World Health Organization estimates that there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria each year. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 million persons are estimated to die due to malaria each year.  
   The problems related to malaria are often linked to the devastation of two other terrible diseases--Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease, that is AIDS, and tuberculosis. One of the unfortunate commonalities of these diseases is that they all ravage sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the underdeveloped world. 
   In addition to the one million malaria related deaths per year, about 2.5 million persons die from AIDS and another 1.5 million people per year die from tuberculosis. 
   The measure I introduce today centers on malaria control and calls for close cooperation among federal agencies that are charged with fighting malaria, AIDS, and TB worldwide. 
   According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40 percent of the world's population is at risk of becoming infected. About half of those who die each year from malaria are children under nine years of age. Malaria kills one child each 30 seconds. 
   Although malaria is a public health problem in more than 90 countries, more than 90 percent of all malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to Africa, large areas of Central and South America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are high risk malaria areas. 
   These high risk areas represent many of the world's poorest nations which complicates the battle against malaria as well as AIDS and TB. 
   Malaria is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. The disease causes severe anemia and is a major factor contributing to maternal deaths in malaria endemic regions. Research has found that pregnant mothers who are HIV-positive and have malaria are more likely to pass on HIV to their children. 
   ``Airport malaria,'' the importing of malaria by international aircraft and other conveyances is becoming more common as is the importation of the disease by international travelers themselves; the United Kingdom reported 2,364 cases of malaria in 1997, all of them imported by travelers. 
   In the United States, of the 1,400 cases of malaria reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1998, the vast majority were imported. Between 1970 and 1997, the malaria infection rate in the United States increased by about 40 percent. 
   In Africa, the projected economic impact of malaria in 2000 exceeds $3.6 billion. Malaria accounts for 20 to 40 percent of outpatient physician visits and 10 to 15 percent of hospital visits in Africa. 
   Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that is spread to humans by mosquitoes. No vaccine is available and treatment is 
   hampered by development of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. 
   Our nation must play a leadership role in the development of a vaccine for malaria as well as vaccines for TB and for the causal agent of AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus--HIV. In this regard I must commend the President for his leadership in directing, back on March 2nd, that a renewed effort be made to form new partnerships to develop and deliver vaccines to developing countries. I must also commend the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation for pledging a substantial $750 million in financial support for this new vaccine initiative. 
   The private sector appears to be prepared to help meet this challenge as the four largest vaccine manufacturers, Merck, American Home Products, Glaxo SmithKline Beecham, and Aventis Pharma, have all stepped to the plate in the quest for vaccines for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. We must all recognize that the private sector pharmaceutical industry, in close partnership with academic and government scientists, will play a key role in the development of any vaccines for these diseases. 
   Among the promising developments in recent months has been Secretary Shalala directing the National Institutes of Health to convene a meeting of experts from government, academia, and the private sector to address impediments to vaccine development in the private sector. Another goal of this first in a series of conferences on Vaccines for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, held on May 22nd and 23rd, was to foster public-private partnerships. 
   These ongoing NIH Conferences on Vaccines for HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis will address three basic questions: what are the scientific barriers to developing vaccines for malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS? What administrative, logistical and legal barriers stand in the way of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS vaccines? And, finally, if vaccines are developed how can they best be produced and distributed around the world? 
   Each of these questions will be difficult to answer. Developing vaccines for malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS will be a difficult task. While each vaccine will be different, there are commonalities such as the fact that the legal impediments and distributional issues may be very similar. Also, there is an unfortunate geographical overlap with respects to the epidemics of malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS. Ground zero is sub-Saharan Africa. 
   So while the ultimate goal is to end up with three vaccines, we must be mindful that there is a close societal and scientific linkage between the tasks of developing and delivering vaccines and therapeutic treatments for those at risk of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS worldwide. 
   While the greatest immediate need is clearly in Africa and in other parts of the developing world, citizens of the United States and my constituents in Utah stand to benefit from progress in the area of vaccine development.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the last several weeks, I have listened as some of my colleagues have, with escalating invective, expressed repeatedly their dismay about the manner in which Senate Republicans have processed President Clinton's judicial nominees. That some would accuse the Senate majority of failing to act in good faith strikes me as ironic, given the recent reckless statements made by President Clinton and members of the all-Democratic Congressional Black Caucus. I already have made my views on their reckless statements known and will not repeat them again here. 
   Some of my colleagues like to talk about proceeding in good faith, but they ignore the fact that there is much legislation with broad, bi-partisan support that is at a standstill because they refuse to let this institution work its will. From bankruptcy reform to H-1B legislation to juvenile justice reform to religious liberty protection legislation, there are several legislative items where the blessings of good faith cooperation have not been bestowed. Consider, for example, the fact that a handful of members on the other side of the aisle have kept us from simply proceeding to a formal conference on the bankruptcy bill. Having poisoned the water themselves, they have no ground for complaining that the water is now poisoned. 
   The more substantive complaints lodged by some of our colleagues have taken various forms. Some complain that there is a vacancy crisis in the federal courts; that the Senate has not confirmed enough of President Clinton's judicial nominees; and that the confirmation record of the Republican Senate compares unfavorably to the Democrats' record when they controlled this body. 
   The claim that there is a vacancy crisis in the federal courts is simply wrong. Using the Clinton Administration's own standard, the federal judiciary currently is at virtual full employment. Presently there are 60 vacancies in the 852-member federal judiciary, yielding a vacancy rate of just seven percent. Of these 60 vacancies, the President has failed to make a nomination for 27 of them. 
   Think about that. Some of my colleagues are complaining about a so-called vacancy crisis when almost half of the current vacancies don't even have a nominee. It is too late to really send additional nominations up here because we are in the final few months of the Congress and there is no way to get through them with the work we have to do in processing judges. 
   In 1994, at the end of the Democrat-controlled 103d Congress, there were 63 judicial vacancies. That is when the Democrats controlled the Senate and President Clinton was President. There were 63 judicial vacancies, yielding a vacancy rate of 7.4 percent. At that time, on October 12, 1994, the Clinton administration argued in a Department of Justice press release that ``[t]his is equivalent to `full employment' in the 837-member Federal judiciary.'' If the Federal judiciary was fully employed in 1994, when there were 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate, then it certainly is fully employed now when there are only 60 vacancies and a 7 percent vacancy rate, even though we have a significantly larger judiciary. 
   Democrats further complain that the Republican Senate has not confirmed enough of President Clinton's judicial nominees. So far this year, the Judiciary Committee has held seven hearings for 30 judicial nominees. In addition, the Committee is 
   holding a hearing today for four additional nominees. This year the Senate has confirmed 35 nominees, including eight nominees for the U.S. Courts of Appeals. 
   With eight court of appeals nominees already confirmed this year, it is clear that the Senate and the Judiciary Committee have acted fairly with regard to appeals court nominees. In presidential election years, the confirmation of appellate court nominees historically has slowed. In 1988, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed only seven of President Reagan's appellate court nominees; in 1992, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed eleven of President Bush's appellate court nominees. This year, the Senate already has confirmed eight circuit court nominees--evidence that we are right on track with regard to circuit court nominees. 
   While some may complain that the Republican Senate has not confirmed enough of President Clinton's judicial nominees, conservatives criticize us for confirming too many. An editorial in today's Washington Times argues that the Republican Senate has confirmed far too many federal judges since gaining control of the Senate in 1995. This view is typical many reactionary conservatives who, like their counterparts on the extreme left, serve in some respects as a check on our political system. I plan to respond to this particular editorial in a more formal manner, but let me just say this--the notion that our Leader is not doing what he believes is best for our country's future is absurd. 
   The fact that the criticism comes from both sides leads me to believe that we probably are carrying out our advice and consent duties as most Americans would have us. 
   There are some on the political right who complain that we are not confirming conservative judges. They forget that we are in the midst of a liberal Presidency and that the President's power of nomination is more powerful than the Senate's power of advice and consent. I urge them to get on the ball and help elect a Republican President who will nominate judges that share our conservative judicial philosophy. 
   Finally, Democrats contend that things were much better when they controlled the Senate. Much better for them perhaps--it certainly was not better for many of the nominees of Presidents Reagan and Bush. At the end of the Bush administration, for example, the vacancy rate stood at nearly 12 percent. By contrast, as the Clinton administration draws to a close, the vacancy rate stands at just seven percent. The disparity between the vacancy rate at the end of the Bush Administration, as compared to the vacancy rate now, illustrates that the Republican Senate has, in fact, acted in good faith when it comes to President Clinton's nominees. 
   The Senate has carried out its advice and consent duties appropriately, in a manner that has been fair to all--to the President's nominees, to the federal judiciary, and to the American people. I stand ready to help Senators LOTT and DASCHLE undertake and complete work on the appropriations bills that are before us and on other legislation, much of which enjoys broad, bi-partisan support and should be acted on this year. 
   I am getting sick and tired of my colleagues on the other side just stopping everything--even bills that they agree with--to try and make the Senate look bad for their own political gain, so that they can take control of the Senate after the next election. If I were in their shoes, I would want to take control of the Senate honorably, rather than dishonorably. 
   I repeat, I stand ready to help Senators LOTT and DASCHLE undertake and complete work on the appropriations bills before the Senate and on other legislation which enjoys broad bipartisan support and should be acted on this year. 
   It is my hope that the important legislative work of the Senate will not be impeded by political gamesmanship over judicial confirmations. I particularly resent people indicating that the Senate is not doing its duty on judicial confirmations, or that there is some ulterior purpose behind what goes on, or that this President isn't being treated fairly, because he has been treated fairly. I am getting sick and tired of it and will not put up with it anymore.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator DURBIN and I wanted to take this opportunity to urge support for our amendment which is intended to speed up generic drug reviews at the Food and Drug Administration. We are pleased to announce that the Hatch-Durbin amendment is cosponsored by Senators DEWINE, LEAHY, WYDEN, FEINSTEIN, GRAHAM of Florida and VOINOVICH. 
   Specifically, our amendment increases funding for FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Review by $2.0 million over the Committee-recommended amount. 
   We intend these funds to be used to provide much-needed additional resources, that is, appropriately-equipped staff, to the Office of Generic Drugs. This will help them reduce review times for generic alternatives to brand-name pharmaceuticals, a considerable benefit to the consumer. 
   One way they can do this is by establishing an additional chemistry division which will allow OGD to increase its efficiency thus permitting applications for new generic drugs to be considered and approved much more rapidly, giving patients access to these products much more quickly. 
   Mr. President, when I travel throughout my home state of Utah, I am besieged by constituents who raise very valid complaints about the need to improve drug coverage for the elderly and others who cannot afford needed medicines. I am very sympathetic to those concerns, and have made this a high legislative priority. 
   But while we are in the midst of devising a program to improve Medicare coverage of pharmaceuticals, it is important to remember that generic drugs offer a less-costly, safe alternative to brand-name medicines for seniors and others who cannot always afford prescription drugs. 
   Our amendment will help offer those who are struggling to make ends meet a viable alternative. It will help get less expensive and more affordable prescription drugs on the market more quickly so that seniors will have additional choice when it comes to purchasing their medications. 
   None of us wants these vulnerable citizens to be faced with the Hobson's choice of whether to purchase food or needed medications. The American public, especially our seniors, can only benefit from having more generic drug products available to them. 
   The problem we face is that the level of FDA resources devoted toward the review and approval of generic drugs can be termed ``modest'' at best. 
   The Office of Generic Drugs is currently funded at $37.8 million and was flat-lined in the Administration's FY 2001 budget request. 
   In contrast to this relatively modest sum available for generic drug review, I would point out that the overall budget for human drug review at the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is $308 million. This represents a total of 2,554 full time equivalents. 
   So the amount devoted to generic drug barely exceeds 10 per cent of the human drug review budget. 
   Hiring additional professional review personnel, together with the necessary computer equipment, at OGD would cost about $100,000 per reviewer. So our amendment will translate into about 20 additional staff members and the computer equipment they need which would certainly be adequate to fund a new chemistry division. 
   The FDA generic drug program currently utilizes about 370 staff members. This amendment, coupled with the $1.2 million, already in the Senate bill will give the generic drug unit at FDA a needed shot in the arm. 
   As a principal author of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, I have long been interested in how we can provide better access to pharmaceuticals, which can do so much to improve the health of the American public. Our nation needs both innovative new drugs and affordable generic drugs. 
   I am particularly pleased that today about 40 percent of all U.S. prescriptions are written for generic products--most of which were made available for generic competition under the 1984 law. 
   These generic drugs save consumers about $8 billion to $10 billion each year. And that's according to a CBO estimate based on 1994 data, so it seems reasonable to project that today's savings must be even higher than the old $8 billion to $10 billion annual savings estimate. 
   Many of us have been pleased to learn that, since 1994, generic drug approval times have generally decreased: the median approval time was 26.9 months in 1994; 27.0 months in 1995; 23 months in 1996; 19.3 months in 1997; and, 18 months in 1998. 
   Unfortunately, this five year downward trend was reversed in 1999. The approval time rose to 18.6 months. This was in a year when the number of products approved actually fell from 225 drugs to 186 drugs. So the time per completed review grew for the first time in 5 years and it is now growing at  a time when many important drug products will be coming off patent. 
   We cannot afford to let this continue. 
   The data on the monthly averages rending applications are also troublesome. Under the law, FDA has 180 days to act on a generic drug application. 
   Let's look at what is happening with the number of generic drug applications that are overdue--that is at FDA for more than 6 months. In 1995 the monthly average of backlogged generic drug applications was 46 applications. 
   This number increased to 59 in 1996. 
   It jumped to 109 in 1997. 
   In 1998, it rose to 127 overdue applications. 
   And last year, the average monthly number of overdue generic applications rose again to 147 overdue applications. 
   So the number of overdue generic drug applications has grown by more than 300 percent since 1995. 
   Clearly, this trend needs to be reversed. 
   It seems obvious to me that we want FDA to have sufficient resources to efficiently evaluate generic drug applications. The funds the Hatch-Durbin amendment provides would be sufficient to fund about 20 full-time equivalents (or ``FTEs'') in the Office of Generic Drugs. 
   Given the fact that so many important medications are about to lose their patent status, it is imperative that FDA has the necessary skilled personnel and computer equipment to do the job of assuring the American public that generic drug products come on the market as soon as possible. 
   We need to make sure that FDA's Office of Generic Drugs has sufficient resources to conduct timely reviews of generic drug applications. That's what this amendment accomplishes, and that is why Senator DURBIN and I have joined together in a bi-partisan manner to work to see that the promise of more affordable generic drug products reach the American public. 
   Mr. President, this is an important amendment. I am pleased that the managers are willing to put it into the bill. I think it is something that will benefit everybody in this country. Hopefully, we can resolve some of these conflicts with regard to generic drugs and help bring the price of drugs down, as the Hatch-Waxman bill has done for the last 16 years. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support an increase to the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Monitoring System regarding dietary supplements. This would be administered by the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). This increase in FDA's Adverse Event Monitoring System for dietary supplements is an important component in the overall effort to implement fully the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.

   Mr. HATCH. Despite this phenomenal growth in the supplement industry, the FDA currently does not have the resources to process adverse event reports in a timely manner and with comprehensive information. As a result, a substantial backlog currently exists in reviewing adverse event reports in the dietary supplement area. However, we must assure that these funds for AERs are effectively spent. Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request that you work with Senator HARKIN and myself on this issue. More specifically, we request that the FDA be directed to assign additional personnel to maintain the timeliness and accuracy of the AER system for dietary supplements. In addition, Congress needs to be assured that all published reports are accompanied by the results of a scientific evaluation of the link between the product and the adverse event and evidence of timely prior notification of any manufacturer or distributor mentioned in the report.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to speak on bankruptcy reform legislation, which in my view, our Nation desperately needs. We  have a balanced bankruptcy reform bill. The administration is on record as saying they support it. If the President really wants a bill, and if my colleagues in the Senate really want a bill, then they should let us move to a formal conference. Furthermore, they should tell us why the clinic violence provision is even necessary. 
   Current law already prevents perpetrators of clinic violence, as well as other types of violence, from discharging the judgments against them in bankruptcy. Given this, it is clear that the overbroad abortion clinic violence amendment serves no substantive purpose. No one has brought forth a single case in which current law has been used to discharge debts from clinic violence. I raised this issue in a letter to Senator SCHUMER last week, and am still awaiting a response. 
   Let's move forward with a bankruptcy conference--we have waited long enough.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, many years ago William Wordsworth wrote a wonderful poem entitled ``Ode On Intimations of Immortality,'' in which he said:  
   Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting; 
   The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, 
   Hath had elsewhere its setting, 
   And cometh from afar; 
   Not in entire forgetfulness, 
   And not in utter nakedness, 
   But trailing clouds of glory do we come 
   From God, who is our home.......  
   I feel particularly bereft today because of the loss of PAUL COVERDELL. 
   I have served here for 24 years and I have seen great people come and go. There are people in this body who are just as great as the Founding Fathers were. There may not be many, but there are people here who by any measure qualify as great leaders. 
   These great people, who are able to cross party lines and bring people together, make this body the greatest legislative body in the world. PAUL was one of those people. 
   He was kind, he was considerate, a good listener; he was wise and he was a person with whom you would want to counsel if you had any concerns. 
   But PAUL was more than that. He was politically astute. He knew when to get tough about matters and stand up for what he believed. But there was also a kindness, a softness, a decency about him that is going to live long after today. 
   I know that ``our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,'' and that we came ``from God, who is our home.'' 
   I know that PAUL was one of God's chosen people. He was given the privilege of coming here to be with us in the Senate. We had the privilege of knowing him. 
   William Cullen Bryant once said: 
 So live that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan that moves To that mysterious realm, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like a quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave Like on who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.  
   PAUL was like that. We are all going to miss him. The fact that he died such a quick and unfathomable death has made a mournful impression on all of us. 
   PAUL was one of those people who could move mountains because of his personality, because of his intelligence, because of his background, because of his experience, because of his kindness, because of his love, because of his fairness, and because of his leadership. 
   I could go through all of his leadership qualities, all of the things he was working on and the accomplishments he made. Right now, I am thinking more of the mourning and the sense of loss we feel in losing PAUL COVERDELL. 
   Tennyson wrote this wonderful poem called ``Crossing the Bar.'' 
 Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me, And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea. 
 But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. 
 Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark, 
 For tho' from out our bourne of time and place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar.  
   I have no doubt that PAUL is going to see his pilot face to face. I have no doubt that he doesn't want any moaning of the bar as he put out to sea. I know he doesn't want any sadness or farewell now that he has embarked on this next phase of eternity. 
   Let us today concentrate on all the good that PAUL stood for on all his amazing accomplishments, not only as a Senator, but also as a man. 
   We all know about PAUL's love for education--he led our caucus on that issue--and all the work he did as chairman of the Senate Republican Task Force on Education to encourage learning opportunities for America's schoolchildren. 
   PAUL worked hard to make sure that every parent, every child, and every teacher could devote enough time throughout each year to educational matters. He made encouraging a love of reading his special priority for students, pupils, and teachers alike. He was a leader in formulating ``A+'' tax free accounts for education. His landmark Safe and Affordable Schools Act has been widely regarded as a model program to improve our country's education policies. PAUL authored bills to make sure we appreciate the hard work of our Nation's teachers, something we tend to forget so easily when formulating education policy. 
   PAUL must also be memorialized for his steadfast work to lower taxes and make our tax policies more fair. Many times PAUL reminded us of his belief that the freedom and means to raise, educate and care for our families are threatened by a government that takes more than 50 percent of an average family's income in taxes and cost of government. PAUL was very proud of his work on tax issues and in particular, of the law he authored to stop unscrupulous IRS workers from rummaging through the tax files of private citizens. It is many ways so ironic that the last vote he cast was on repealing the death tax, an important policy change he had worked so hard to advocate. 
   I worked closely with PAUL on his antidrug efforts, on his work to stop narcotics trafficking, and on his efforts to make the workplace drug free. All of these things PAUL did, and he did them well. 
   PAUL never forgot the needs of his home state, whether it were through his work as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection and Product Promotion, or through his work as a member of the Finance Committee and the Small Business Committee. His record is replete with accomplishments that benefited his constituents back home. 
   Of course, there were so many other legislative things I would like to mention, but let me leave it at that. 
   Another side of PAUL was his love for baseball. He was as excited as anybody I have ever seen when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's Major League home run record as a beloved Atlanta Brave. 
   I am deeply saddened by his passing. I am going to miss him very much. 
   One of my favorite poets is a poet named Sara Teasdale who wrote an interesting poem. Although this was surely a love poem, I think it applies to our memories of PAUL as this poem is called ``The Beloved.'' 
 It is enough of honor for one lifetime To have known you better than the rest have known, The shadows and the colors of your voice, Your will, immutable and still as stone. 
 The shy heart,  
   Which PAUL had--  
   so lonely and so gay,The sad laughter and the pride of pride, The tenderness, the depth of tenderness Rich as the earth, and wide as heaven is wide.  
   I like that. Even though it was meant for someone else, I think it applies to a large degree to PAUL COVERDELL.  
   PAUL was a good man. He did the right things. He set a good example. He was a good colleague here. He was one of the most respected Senators in this body for all of these qualities, qualities that very few people can come close to matching. 
   I wish PAUL the best in his afterlife. 
   My sympathy and heartfelt feelings to Nancy, his wife, and to the rest of his family who are mourning him. 
   I thank God for the privilege of knowing PAUL, working with PAUL, accomplishing things with PAUL, laughing with PAUL. 
   I am grateful for our colleagues in this body on both sides of the floor. We do learn that these people are here for a very important reason. They have been selected by their respective constituents to do good things. I can say as one who has been here long enough to know that PAUL COVERDELL did good things while he was here and that his legacy will be that all of us need to do better in the things we have been and are doing. All of us need to follow and emulate his example so that we can hopefully be as good as he was. 
   My sympathy and my best to Nancy and other members of his family, and to my fellow colleagues who are mourning PAUL COVERDELL this day. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. There is a lot of sincerity behind it. 
   I rise today to offer some concerns about the Jeffords-Dorgan Amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill and to support the Cochran amendment. 
   I have many questions about the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment. 
   Let me make something perfectly clear from the start--I do not question the good intentions of this amendment. I know that my colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, is sincerely seeking to address this difficult matter of high prices for pharmaceuticals in the United States. 
   As I traveled across my state and around our country this election year, I found that many Utahns and many Americans, particularly our senior citizens, are having difficulty in affording prescription medicines. Some are going across the borders to Canada and Mexico. We have all seen the news broadcasts of those cross-border bus trips to buy the cheaper foreign drugs. And, it may seem obvious, particularly to two Senators who represent States on the Canadian border, that the solution is simply to allow the importation of prescription drugs into our country. 
   There is something of a cruel dilemma at play here: right at the moment when scientists seem poised to invent an unbelievable new array of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, many Americans are encountering difficulties in affording these new and sometimes costly medications. 
   There are many issues at play in this debate. 
   One issue that policymakers face is to see whether a balance can be constructed whereby we retain the necessary investment to produce the promised wonder cures while at the same time maintain our ability to deliver these new products to the patients at affordable prices. 
   This is part of what is shaping the debate over the fashioning of a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program. 
   This balance between new drugs and affordable drugs is what shaped the debate 16 years ago when the Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. I am proud to have played a leadership role in this law that helps, according to CBO, consumers save $8 billion to $10 billion annually through the purchase of generic drugs. 
   But, in our understandable and highly populist zeal to make drugs more accessible, we must not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. That is to say, we must be able to continue to attract the private sector investment into the biomedical research establishment that has made the American drug development pipeline so promising. 
   While it is true enough that, at this time, the drug industry is the most profitable sector of the economy, I do not think that success should be a license for us to over-regulate this industry. Sometimes well-intentioned, but ill-advised, governmental policies have hastened the decline of American business to the detriment of American workers and consumers alike. 
   But, another consideration with respect to the advisability of this amendment is the premium that we place on our citizens receiving safe and effective products, free from adulteration and misbranding. 
   Dating from the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, through the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the 1962 efficacy amendments, and the 1988 Prescription Drug Marketing Act, our Nation has devised a more or less closed regulatory system that ensures that drug products will be carefully controlled from the manufacturer to the patient's bedside. 
   If we are to open up our borders to a new plethora of drug reimports--I am talking about reimports--we need to be absolutely certain that we have not undermined the integrity of this regulatory system by admitting products improperly manufactured, transported, or stored. A pill may look like the real item but not contain the active ingredient in the right concentration, or it may simply not contain the medication at all. 
   Similarly, we must not allow the American public to fall prey to counterfeit so-called ``gray market'' products. These are products which could be made to look exactly like the real thing and may comply with, or attempt to comply with, the requirements of the actual approved product, but do not comply with the legal requirement of a license from the patent holder--in short, a pirated product. 
   While there is a clear and obvious health danger in an adulterated, non-conforming pirated product, there is also great detriment to the American public if the unscrupulous are allowed to reimport America's inventions back into America without compensating the inventor. Few will be willing to invest the upfront capital--hundreds of millions of dollars--to develop a drug if another party can make and sell the drug while it is under patent protection. 
   It takes an average of 15 years and a half a billion dollars to create one of the blockbuster drugs. So we have to be careful. Keep in mind, too, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have a special obligation with respect to our intellectual property laws that we not go down any path that can be seen as inviting the development of a gray market for prescription drugs. 
   After all, a fake Rolex may be right twice a day, but a bad copy of a good drug can kill you. This is something we have to be more concerned about around here. We can't just do what appears to be good but, in essence, could kill people. 
   As we move further into the information age, protection of American intellectual property becomes more and more vital to our national interest. For example, if the latest computer software can be taken without proper licensing arrangements, our national leadership in high technology will be threatened. 
   Where is the pharmaceutical industry in Canada? They have price controls, and nobody is going to invest the money into developing these lifesaving and cost-saving drugs over the long run in those countries with price controls. 
   We have had many debates over price controls. I remember those days when Senator Pryor and I were on this floor arguing back and forth about price controls. Fortunately, the Senate, in its wisdom, decided not to go for price controls. This is another step toward price controls that will stultify one of the most important industries in America at a time when we just mapped the human genome, and we are at the point where we can actually create more lifesaving drugs--perhaps at even a greater cost but nevertheless at a greater health care cost savings than ever before. 
   So that is why intellectual property protections are so necessary. 
   In fact, one of the great accomplishments of the 1995 GATT Treaty was to put intellectual property protection front and center in our trade relationships with the developing world. Many countries are notorious for the lax policing of patent and copyright violations by their citizens. 
   When the value of American inventions is expropriated, it is American inventors and American consumers who suffer. The United States cannot and  should not allow free riders around the world essentially to force the American public to underwrite a disproportionate amount of the research and development that results in a next generation breakthrough product. 
   One has only to read a collection of the section 301 reports the Office of the United States Trade Representative to get a feel of just how prevalent such intellectual property theft is worldwide. 
   I took the time to present this background because I think the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment requires such analysis. 
   And I will be the first one to admit that the amendment, at first blush, seems quite simple and appealing. What could be the matter with a rule that essentially says drugs obtained from outside the United States at prices lower than U.S. prices can be resold in the U.S., presumably in a manner that places pressure to lower prevailing U.S. prices? Yet, I recall H.L. Mencken's sage observation, ``There is always an easy solution to every human problem neat--plausible, and wrong.'' 
   I, too, join many of my constituents in Utah and others across the country, in questioning why our citizens are paying higher drug prices than those who live in other countries. 
   And while I recognize that there are complex economic, political, and social factors at play that partially explain why a drug company would charge less for a drug in a destitute region in sub-Saharan Africa, it is more difficult to understand why drug costs less in Tijuana, Mexico, or Alberta, Canada than in San Diego, California. This is a policy I cannot totally defend. And I do think the pharmaceutical companies need to address this more. 
   But I can say that where nations impose price controls, a flawed economic theory which we have proven does not work in the U.S., there are negative consequences which among other hazards could imperil the flourishing research and development we count on to bring us miracle cures. 
   I am very apprehensive about government price controls, particularly on our most cutting-edge technologies like pharmaceuticals. Price controls function in an economic environment the way a lid works on a boiling pot. Price controls may temporarily keep prices down, but they are certainly no long term solution to the problem. As soon as the lid comes off, the pot boils over. 
   And, why not just keep the lid on indefinitely? Because price controls also have a stifling effect on the incentives to conduct research. Without the prospect of recouping a substantial, multi-million dollar investment, there is little reason for pharmaceutical companies to undertake such research on the next breakthrough drugs. It would not take long for our nation's pharmaceutical industry to atrophy. 
   How can we guarantee that foreign government price controllers will not set an artificially low price on some new Alzheimer's drug? And can we be sure that this won't have the unintended, but real, ripple effect of convincing company officials to forgo research on this new class of drugs for fear that, in conjunction with the new liberal re-import policy, they will not be able to recoup their investment? 
   I support those who wish to instruct the United States Trade Representative to be even more aggressive in promoting and protecting intellectual property rights in all of our bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations. 
   It seems to me that rather than importing the effects of foreign price controls back into the U.S., a strong case can be made that we should be using our Trade Representative to attack the foreign price controls that many countries have enacted so that a better balance between U.S. research costs and foreign borne research costs might be achieved. Let's stop the free riders and cheap riders overseas while American citizens are paying the full freight of R&D. 
   I have to confess that one part of me likes the feature of this amendment that creates the challenge to the entrepreneur of bringing goods sold cheaper abroad back to the United States at presumable savings to U.S. citizens. Yet, the amendment provides no guarantee that those wholesalers and pharmacists importing the products would pass their savings on to the consumer. And so, we could be trading public safety for middleman profits, an outcome not contemplated by proponents of the amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. I have debated the issue, as I say, of price controls many times, so I will not spend any more time on the issue of price controls. But it does not make sense. That is what we are headed towards. 
   The greatest industry in our country, that has the greatest potential to do the greatest amount of good to bring health care costs down in the end--even though it is tremendously expensive to develop these drugs--is going to be flattened by this type of legislation which is well meaning, well intentioned, and absolutely destructive to our innovative industries in this particular country. 
   We have to find a way around this drug price problem in this country without creating a gray market in these particular goods and services. There has not been 1 day of hearings on this particular language. How can we guarantee that foreign government price controllers will not set an artificially low price on some new Alzheimer's drug? And can we be sure this will not have the unintended but real, ripple effect of convincing company officials to forgo research----

   Mr. HATCH. Can we be sure this will not have the unintended, but real, ripple effect of convincing company officials to forego research on this new class of drugs for fear that, in conjunction with the new liberal reimport policy, they will not be able to recoup their investment? 
   Let us hope that the future does not come down to a choice between two lousy alternatives, what economists call a Hobson's Choice: great drugs that are not widely affordable or potentially great drugs abandoned due to minimal projected revenues. 
   And I can tell you given my work in the area of the AIDS epidemic, as between 
   expensive drugs and no drugs, expensive drugs is a better problem to have. 
   My conservative instincts are always against government price controls, and I don't think that this principle should be limited to U.S. government price controls if a by-product of this well-intentioned re-import bill is to import some other government's price controls into U.S. market dynamics. 
   Frankly, this does not seem the type of far reaching legislation that we should rush into without pausing to try to think through all of its ramifications. 
   It just seems to me that if there are areas where governments world-wide must tread carefully in enacting legislation, if indeed they must tread at all, it is in areas like biotechnology. 
   It is clear from absolutely stunning developments like the early completion of the mapping of the human genome that there is an incredible synergy taking place between information technology and biotechnology. The high-speed sequencing machines that mapped the genetic code and almost instantaneously made this information available on the Internet represent this confluence of technology. 
   In our valid and justified quest to help make drugs more affordable to the American public, we should be mindful not to unwittingly retard the development of the next generation of innovation. 
   Having described the general angst I feel in relation to the possible effect that this legislation may have on the pace of and investment in pharmaceutical research and development as well as challenges it will create in terms of respect for intellectual property rights, I want to focus next on the important concerns that I have about the public safety aspects of the amendment. 
   I want to commend Senators JEFFORDS and DORGAN for perfecting some of the gaps and shortcomings related to drug safety contained in the House-passed legislation. 
   But let me say that, as Chairman of the Committee with jurisdiction over the Controlled Substances Act, I am not convinced that the American public is adequately protected by this amendment.  
   Now, I know that drafting and redrafting is an unglamourous part of the legislative process and that you and your staffs, and if the reports are correct many in the Administration, have been working hard to refine this amendment. 
   But let's be fair, legislating on an appropriations bill is not the optimum way to change some central provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
   I was involved in redrafting the Import and Export Chapter of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act both in 1986 and in 1996. 
   While I recognize the HELP Committee had a hearing yesterday, I think that everyone would agree with me that it is helpful to have a legislative hearing on legislation when the ink is at least dry. 
   I would like to see what the FDA, the DEA, General McCaffrey and the Patent and Trademark Office have to say about the bill when they have had time to give thoughtful consideration to a sufficiently finalized draft. 
   While it is true that the bill is drafted generally to the FDC Act, it will be particularly important to see how this liberalized re-import may affect controlled substances. Can't we take the time to hear from the Drug Enforcement Administration? 
   Also, I don't know if this is the case, but I have heard second hand reports that the White House has more or less limited FDA to a ``let's make the best of this'' role and is not encouraging the agency to look at this bill more globally. 
   Also, I cannot help but note that in the latest draft that I have seen, the language covers only drug products and not biologics, which are in the vast majority of cases perceived and used by consumers as drugs in the non-legalistic definition. 
   And since it is also the case that many times it is precisely these new generation biologics that are the most costly on the market, the question must be asked why Americans should not get the advantage of lower priced biologics as well as drugs? 
   Frankly, it is evident that each successive draft attempts to address the many shortcomings with respect to assuring the American public that the imported drugs are the safe and effective and unadulterated. 
   Clearly, this drafting would be better served if it were down in the public forum of a mark-up. 
   I just don't think that we know enough about this language to be reasonably certain that we could be sowing the seeds of a future tragedy but I certainly don't want to take that chance. I worry that a day will come when either a under-potent or over-potent batch of imported drugs will leave a trail of avoidable carnage. 
   Yes, we can have certifications and regulations and foreign inspections and every other thing you can think of, but the fact remains we are opening a door that Congress carefully closed in 1988 when it enacted the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. The history of this bill is that it was enacted after a series of serious adverse events due to improperly stored, handled, and transported imported drugs. It also addressed the issue of the import of counterfeit and unapproved drugs such as the presence of counterfeit antibiotics and contraceptives. 
   These were serious threats to public health and safety. These incidents were the subject of extensive hearings of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. These incidents were the impetus of the 1988 legislation that this amendment would unravel. 
   Look, I know that there is a certain attractiveness to accept this amendment and that some members may be inclined to vote for this measure with the expectation that the language, which is still in flux, will be cleaned up in Conference. 
   But I am concerned that opening up this import loophole is either fixable or will do more good than harm. 
   As interested parties study this measure, objections are beginning to be registered. And they are not only from the big drug companies who are the true, and, to some extent, justified target of this provision. 
   I am mindful that a similar provision passed the House by a wide margin. But one vote that this legislation did not get was of that the Dean of the House, Representative JOHN DINGELL of Michigan. 
   Now you would think that if ever there was a group that stood to benefit from legislation it would be the wholesale druggists because they are the natural middlemen in the new, liberalized import system. Instead they call the amendment ``unworkable'' because ``(w)wholesalers do not have the expertise, equipment or personnel to undertake such complicated tasks''. 
   I will say in public right now that I fully expect that the DEA, FBI, and other components of DOJ will weigh in when this correspondence is answered. 
   I am particularly interested in learning from the DEA and FBI to what extent importation of counterfeit and adulterated controlled substances is a current problem and to what extent, if any, this legislation, would likely affect the current state of affairs? 
   But before my colleagues vote on this measure I would ask each of you to review the Dingell correspondence together with any response from the administration. Here are some of the questions that were included in Congressman DINGELL's letter to FDA:  
   1. Please provide a detailed analysis on how (H.R. 4461 and H.R. 3240) would affect FDA's present operations regarding efforts to prevent misbranded or potentially dangerous drugs from entering the U.S. Specifically, please provide: (a) a description of how the present system now used by FDA works; (b) what the present system is intended to accomplish; and (c) what changes would be required (and the potential effects of those changes) if this legislation passes in its present form. 
   Please include a discussion of how these amendments would affect the activities of other agencies, such as the U.S. Customs Service, with responsibilities for assuring the safety of imported prescription drugs. 
   2. Please determine if either of these amendments would have any effect on FDA's ability to enforce good manufacturing practices (GMPs) in any foreign firms that ship drugs to the U.S. If so, please explain any potential effect on consumer health and safety. 
   3. Please provide a full description regarding what a ``warning letter'' is and how it is typically used by the FDA. Please compare this with correspondence that is sent by Customs. 
   4. It appears that these amendments would directly affect the ability of FDA to send warning letters to consumers that purchase drugs over the Internet. As you know, some web sites appear to be covertly linked to foreign drug suppliers. When a consumer orders from such a site, it is not always obvious that they are dealing with an offshore supplier, and thus a potentially non-FDA approved facility. Often, warning letters may be the only indication that the Internet-ordered drugs originated from a foreign (and potentially dubious) source. Please indicate how this legislation could affect FDA's ability to protect consumers who purchased drugs in this way. 
   5. Please detail any other potential effects this legislation could have on FDA's ability to protect consumers from potentially dangerous drugs that originate aboard. 
   6. Finally, please provide technical assistance in the form of specific suggestions for legislative or regulatory changes that would be needed in order to facilitate the safe importation of prescription drugs by individuals, wholesalers, or retailers.  
   Only if you are convinced that FDA has the resources and international presence to enforce the myriad of new regulations and procedures required by the amendment should you vote for this measure. 
   Ask yourself how confident you are that more word-smithing during a closed conference committee meeting is likely to prevent one or more of your constituents from being seriously injured down the road by unsafe drug products brought into the U.S. as a result of this amendment? 
   Do we really want to turn back the clock and essentially re-open a dangerous door that was closed by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1988? 
   Why the rush to open a potential Pandora's box of public health problems? 
   I hope that this well-intentioned amendment, offered by two highly-respected co-sponsors, does not place Congress and the public in the position of the old adage, those who do not understand the past are doomed to repeat it. 
   I respect the men and good intentions behind this amendment. 
   We all want to increase access to pharmaceuticals for all Americans. I do not think that the benefits of the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment outweigh its downsides, and that is why I am supportive of the alternative offered by the Senator from Mississippi. 
   I have to say, when this debate happened in the House, my dear friend, Congressman JOHN DINGELL, who has  played a tremendous role in health care all these years I have been in the Congress, stood up and argued against this. He lost in the House, but he should have won. 
   During the House debate, Congressman DINGELL said the following, ``We now find ourselves in the regrettable position of confronting the possibility that the easing of the law with regard to food and drug and cosmetics, which is going to be done here under this legislation, will in fact reduce the safety of the American consuming public.'' 
   Mr. DINGELL was Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee when the PDMA passed in 1988. He was a key mover and shaker behind the bill. As the bill was being developed the Energy and Commerce Committee issued a report that concluded that ``the very existence of a market for reimported goods provides the perfect cover for foreign counterfeits.''

   Mr. HATCH. Given the reported White House activity on this bill, I would not be surprised that FDA will quickly respond to and brush aside the questions this letter raises. 
   Mr. President, in sum, we are in danger of losing a tremendously innovative and effective and productive industry that has made the American Nation the leader in health care throughout the world. 
   I think this type of an amendment will undermine everything we have decided to do all these years, that has really benefited the whole world.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000. This much-needed bill has had a long and difficult journey in getting to this point where we can pass it in the Senate. Passage will occur today; and, as we did in 1999, the Congress will send legislation to help married couples being hurt by marriage tax penalties to the President. 
   I congratulate my colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for his very effective leadership on this issue. I realize that this matter has not been an easy one for Chairman ROTH this year, because he has been unfairly criticized by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for taking the approach on marriage tax penalty relief that is reflected in this bill. Let me explain. 
   The Senate last year, led by Chairman ROTH, passed a marriage penalty relief provision in the Taxpayer Refund Act, which used a different solution to the marriage penalty problem than the one included in the bill before us today. Last year's bill would have solved the marriage penalty problem by allowing married couples the option of filing as single taxpayers on a combined joint return. I supported that bill as did a majority of our colleagues. It was a good approach to solving a major tax problem for American families. 
   Last year's bill was effective in relieving the marriage penalty. However, it left untouched another glaring family tax problem that I will call the single-earner penalty. I would like to illustrate this with a hypothetical example of three Utah families. 
   Let's suppose we have three families, all neighbors living on the same street in Ogden, UT. These families are nearly identical, in that they each have three children and household incomes of $80,000 per year. The only differences in these three families are in the marital status of the parents and in who earns the income. In the first family, the Allen family, the parents are married and both work outside the home and earn $40,000 each for a total of $80,000. The second family, the Brown family, are also married but only the husband works outside the home, earning $80,000 per year. The third family, the Campbell-Clark family, are unmarried parents and each of them earns $40,000 per year for a total of $80,000. 
   As you can see from this chart, under current law, the Allen and the Brown families each pay about $9,200 in income tax each year. The Campbell-Clark family, however, because they can file as single taxpayers, pay only a combined $7,900. Because the Allens each earn one-half the family income, if they were to divorce and file as singles, they could reduce their combined  tax bill down to $7,900, the same as the Campbell-Clarks. Therefore, the Allens suffer a marriage penalty of about $1,300 each year. 
   The marriage penalty relief provision 
   included in last year's tax bill would have eliminated this marriage penalty and reduced the tax bill of the Allen family down to the same level paid by the Campbell-Clarks. However, by doing so it would have left behind the Brown family, who would still be paying income taxes of $9,200 per year. 
   This is not fair. We must not, in the name of fairness, fix the marriage tax problems of one category of families, but not another category. It is true that the Browns do not suffer a marriage penalty, but why should they pay higher taxes simply because their family income is earned by one spouse and not two? 
   There are approximately 210,000 couples in my home state of Utah, who, like the Allens, suffer a marriage penalty. However, there are also about 108,000 couples in Utah who are like the Browns, and would be left behind by marriage tax relief like we passed in 1999. 
   This is why this year's marriage penalty bill is superior to last year's. The bill before us today lowers the tax burden of both the Allen family and the Brown family. It alleviates the marriage penalty and the one-earner penalty. It does not leave any family behind. 
   In essence, the Internal Revenue Code results in marriage tax penalties and bonuses because it pursues three conflicting ideals or principles--marriage neutrality, equal treatment of married couples with the same household income, and progressive taxation. 
   The ideal of marriage neutrality states that a couple's tax liability should not be determined based on their marital status. In other words, there should not be a tax incentive either to marry, to remain single, or to divorce. Under our example, current law does penalize the Allen family, because they would pay about $1,300 per year less if they were to divorce and live together. That is ridiculous. We want to encourage people to live together in marriage. 
   The equally important principle of equal treatment holds that married couples with equal incomes should pay the same amount in taxes without regard to how much each spouse contributes to the couple's income. Under this principle, the Allens and the Browns should pay the same tax since they are both married with identical family incomes. Currently, they do pay the same, but this principle would be violated if we did not also lower the Browns' tax while fixing the Allens' marriage penalty. 
   Progressive taxation is the principle that those with higher incomes should pay a higher percentage of their incomes in taxes than is required of those with lower incomes. 
   It is mathematically 
   impossible for the Tax Code to achieve all three of these tax policy ideals simultaneously. 
   One of the three objectives must be sacrificed. If we continue to insist on a progressive tax system, we cannot solve both the marriage penalty and the one-earner penalty. Simply put, last year's marriage penalty relief provision did solve the marriage penalty, but it violated the one-earner penalty. The bill before us today does not totally solve the marriage penalty, but it greatly alleviates it for most families. And, it does not create a one-earner penalty. All in all, it represents the fairest approach for the most families in our country. 
   As long as we have a progressive tax system, we will never achieve total family tax fairness. Therefore, no marriage tax penalty bill will be perfect. While making tremendous progress toward marriage penalty relief for most families, the bill before us leaves some serious marriage penalties in place. 
   For example, the current-law student loan interest deduction provision penalizes married couples struggling to pay off student loans. In February, the Senate passed an amendment to the education tax bill that Senator MACK and I offered that would have eliminated this problem. I had hoped to add that provision to this bill, but it would not be germane under the reconciliation rules. I hope we can take care of that problem in another tax bill later this year. 
   President Clinton has given strong indications he will veto this bill because it gives tax relief to families who do not suffer from marriage penalties. This is a shortsighted point of view that ignores the structure of our tax system and the needs of American families. 
   In fact, it kind of makes me wonder whether President Clinton's real concern is the idea of cutting taxes. He has made no secret of his opposition to tax cuts. He has fought us every step of the way in our efforts to return a portion of the budget surplus to those hard-working Americans who produced it. 
   But, I will be very sorry if a Presidential veto denies American families even this tax cut which is not being made for its own sake, but rather to correct a longstanding inequity in the Tax Code. 
   I implore the President to reconsider that all American families need fair and substantial tax relief--those where both spouses work outside the home as well as those where one parent stays home. I hope he will sign this bill into law. 
   And, allow me to say just a word about parents who forego outside income to remain at home. Everyone in this body knows that I believe we must have adequate child care for those families who need it. I have worked with my Republican colleagues and my Democratic colleagues across the aisle on child care legislation. But, I cannot say 
   emphatically enough that the best child care is still provided by a parent. I have yet to hear a single Senator disagree with that. Yet, our Tax Code penalizes a family in which one parent makes this choice to stay at home with their children. 
   I am glad that my wife stayed home with our children. She did work in the early years of our marriage as a grade school teacher, but she stayed home virtually all of the time our children were growing up, and I think it shows. 
   It is high time we fix this problem. It is high time we correct the marriage penalty for both the Allens and the Browns in Utah, and families like them all over the country. Today, we have the means to do it. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: There are no more excuses. 
   Again, I thank Chairman ROTH for his insight and leadership on this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this bill. I urge President Clinton to sign it. 
   One last thing, and that is, when you have a $4.3 trillion surplus in the budget, you know darn well somebody is being taxed too much. Why can't we at least solve these inequities that are literally calling out to us for a solution? Why can't we make it clear that being married should not be a disadvantage to couples? Why don't we make it clear that we are going to treat married couples just as well as those who live together and are not married, who don't pay as much in taxes today? 
   These three families illustrate this as well as I think we can illustrate it. Why should the Allen family and the Brown family pay $9,222, while the Campbell-Clark family, just because they live together--each of them single, and each of them earning $40,000--why should they get a tax bill of $1,300 less than the other two families? 
   I urge the President to sign this bill. I think it is the right thing to do. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. The death tax, which is also known as the estate and gift or the transfer tax, is an unfair and counterproductive burden on our economy, and it is past time Congress repealed it. 
   Many of my colleagues who agree with me that this tax ought to be repealed have made many persuasive arguments as to why. Rather than repeat all of these excellent arguments, I would like to focus on just one vital reason the death tax should be repealed: by hurting millions of closely-held businesses and farms, the death tax harms the economy and every American. 
   Mr. President, our colleagues from across the aisle have been quick to assert that only two percent of all estates are affected by the estate tax and that fewer than five percent of these estates are made up of farms and small businesses. These statistics are highly misleading and conceal a very important point. Estates that actually pay the estate tax represent only the tip of the iceberg of the total number of estates that are harmed by the tax. Let me explain. 
   Millions of individuals and the owners of millions of family-owned farms, ranches, and closely-held businesses are potentially subject to the estate tax, but the majority of them are able, with great effort and expense, to avoid the tax by complex tax planning or by selling the business or farm. What are left are the two percent of death tax-paying estates my colleagues keep mentioning. 
   Every year, billions of dollars are spent in legal and tax planning fees and other costs so that estates may effectively avoid the death tax. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers last month found that, over the past five years, more than 40 percent of respondents spent more than $100,000 on attorney and consultant fees, life insurance premiums, and other estate planning techniques. More than half had spent over $25,000 in the past year. Despite this planning, nearly one-third of the respondents believed the business would have to be sold to pay the death tax if the owner died tomorrow. 
   Furthermore, thousands of businesses are prematurely sold each year in order to escape the death tax. Business owners are forced into selling their business when they have tangible  assets of significant value, such as land or business machinery, and yet have few liquid assets to pay an estate tax bill. Clearly, a great many more 
   taxpayers are affected by the estate tax than opponents of repeal would have us believe. 
   Let me give you an example, Mr. President. Until late last year, Ken Macey was the chairman of his second-generation family-owned grocery business based in Sandy, Utah. Ken's father had founded the business in 1946, opening a tiny store called ``Sava Nickel'' in a renovated house in North Salt Lake. Relying on old-fashioned hard work and thrift and the principle of treating customers and employees as they would want to be treated, the Macey family built their business into an eight-store chain, with $200 million per year in revenues and 1,800 employees. 
   Mr. Macey tells me he would have liked to keep the business in the family. However, the long shadow of the death tax loomed. Even though Mr. Macey had spent many thousands of dollars in professional fees for estate tax planning, he still believed his estate was vulnerable for tax rates of up to 60 percent. Rather than risk the trauma of a forced sale upon his death that could have been devastating to his children and the 1,800 employees and their families that depended on Macey's for their livelihood, Mr. Macey decided to sell his business to a larger food store chain. 
   Although this story could have been much worse if some or all of Macey's employees has lost their jobs, it is a tragedy that a business founded by this Utahn's father was forced to be sold outside the family. Macey's Inc. is another example of the millions of American family businesses that do not survive to the next generation. 
   Some of the same senators and congressmen--and our President--who have decried the loss of family farms and family-owned small businesses and who have wondered aloud why large corporations seem to be taking over Main Street have totally ignored the estate tax as one major reason. Yet, many of these colleagues continue to argue that repealing the death tax benefits only the wealthiest two percent. 
   According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, only about 30 percent of family farms and businesses survive to the second generation, and only about 4 percent survive a second-to-third generation transfer. No one can tell Mr. Macey or his children or grandchildren that they are not the victims of an unfair death tax. 
   The point is that a huge amount of money, effort, and talent is wasted by millions of individuals and owners of family farms and businesses on activities designed to avoid the death tax. Most of these efforts are successful in the sense that the majority of these estates avoid paying the tax. However, the cost to the economy in terms of lost productivity, business disruption, and lost jobs is enormous.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment is a simple one. It would permanently extend the research and experimentation tax credit--a tax provision that has been instrumental in helping to keep our economic growth robust over the past decade. 
   Let me explain why this amendment is necessary. 
   Last July, this body voted to extend the research credit permanently. Unfortunately, the House version of last year's tax bill included only a five-year extension of the credit. The five-year extension prevailed in conference. Of course, last summer's tax bill was vetoed by the President. 
   Fortunately, however, last November, Congress passed and the President signed the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, which included the five-year extension of the research credit. Therefore, the credit has been extended to June 30, 2004. 
   And, in 2004, corporate America will have to go through this rigmarole again. This tax credit has been on and off, extended and expired, a legislative certainty or a legislative football almost more times than anyone can count. 
   Anyone in this body who has been in business for more than 10 minutes knows that planning and budgeting--unlike what we do here in Congress--is a multiyear process. And, anyone who has been involved in research knows that the scientific enterprise does not fit neatly into calendar or fiscal year. 
   Our treatment of the R&E tax credit--that is, allowing it to run to the brink of expiration and reviving it at the 11th hour--is a disservice to our research entities and, yes, our whole country. 
   It is time to get serious about our commitment to a tax credit that is widely believed by economists and business leaders to be one of the most effective provisions in creating economic growth and keeping this country on the leading edge of high technology in the world. 
   This amendment gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment. 
   A large number of the Members of this body, on both sides of the aisle, are on record in support of a permanent research credit. Indeed, S. 680, the research credit permanence bill that my colleague from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, and I introduced last year, enjoys the support of 26 Democrats and 20 Republicans. In addition, a permanent research credit was included in Democratic alternative to last summer's tax bill, which was supported by 39 Democrats. Moreover, both Governor Bush and Vice President GORE support a permanent research credit. 
   But, while practically everyone says they support a permanent research credit, it has become too easy for Congress to fall into its two-decade-long practice of merely extending the credit for a year or two, or even five years, and then not worrying about it until it is time to extend it again. 
   These short-term extensions have occurred ten times since 1981, Mr. President. Ten short-term extensions for a tax credit that most members of this body strongly support. I am not sure if we realize how the lack of permanence of the credit damages the effectiveness of the research credit. 
   Research and development projects typically take a number of years and may even last longer than a decade. As our business leaders plan these projects, they need to know whether or not they can count on this tax credit. 
   The current uncertainty surrounding the credit has induced businesses to allocate significantly less to research than they otherwise would if they knew the tax credit would be available. This uncertainty undermines the entire purpose of the credit. For the government and the American people to maximize the return on their investment in U.S. based research and development, this credit must be made permanent. And now is the time to do so. 
   During the ten times in the past 19 years that Congress has extended the research credit for a short time, the ostensible reason has been a lack of revenue. The excuse we give to constituents is that we didn't have the money to extend the bill permanently. Ironically, it costs at least as much in terms of lost revenue, in the long run, to enact short-term extensions as it does to extend it permanently. 
   With the latest projections of the on-budget surplus, for one year, for five years, and for ten years, this excuse is gone. There is simply no valid reason that the research credit should not be extended on a permanent basis. 
   Moreover, now is the time to extend the provision permanently. By making the research credit permanent now, we will send a strong signal to the business community that a new era of stronger support for research has dawned. 
   The timing could not be better because, as I mentioned, many research projects, especially those in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, must be planned and budgeted for months and even years in advance. The more uncertain the long-term future of the research credit is, the smaller the potential of the credit to stimulate increased research. Simply knowing of the reliability of a permanent research credit will give a boost to the amount of research performed, even before the current credit expires in 2004. 
   My home state of Utah is a good example of how state economies benefit from the research tax credit. Utah is home to a large number of firms who invest a high percentage of their revenue on research and development. 
   For example, between Salt Lake City and Provo lies one of the world's biggest stretches of software and computer engineering firms. This area, which was named ``Software Valley'' by Business Week, is a significant example of one of a growing number of thriving high tech commercial regions outside California's Silicon Valley. Newsweek magazine included Utah among the top ten information technology centers in the world. The Utah Information Technologies Association estimates that Utah's IT industry consists of 2,427 enterprises, employing 42,328 with revenue of over $7 billion. 
   In addition, Utah is home to about 700 biotechnology and biomedical firms that employ nearly 9,000 workers. Research and development are the reasons these companies exist. Not only do these companies need to continue conducting a high quality level of research, but this research feeds other industries and, ultimately, consumers.  Just ask the patients who have benefited from new drugs or therapies. 
   In all, there are more than 80,000 employees working in Utah's thousands of technology based companies. Many other states have experienced similar growth in high technology businesses. Research and development is the lifeblood of these firms and hundreds of thousands like them throughout the nation. 
   Findings from a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that workers in every state will benefit from higher wages if the research credit is made permanent. Payroll increases as a result of gains in productivity stemming from the credit have been estimated to exceed $60 billion over the next 12 years. Furthermore, greater productivity from additional research and development will increase overall economic growth in every state in the Union. 
   Research and development is essential for long-term economic growth. Innovations in science and technology have fueled the massive economic expansion we have witnessed over the course of the 20th century. These advancements have improved the standard of living for nearly every American. Simply put, the research tax credit is an investment in economic growth, new jobs, and important new products and processes. 
   In conclusion, if we decide not to make the research credit permanent, we are not limiting the potential growth of our economy? How can we expect the American economy to hold the lead in the global economic race if we allow other countries, which provide huge government direct subsidies, to offer faster tracks than we do? 
   Making the credit permanent will keep American business ahead of the pack. It will speed economic growth. Innovations resulting from American research and development will continue to improve the standard of living for every person in the U.S. and also worldwide. 
   Simply put, the costs of not making the research credit permanent are far greater than the costs of making it permanent. As we enter the new millennium, we cannot afford to let the American economy slow down. Now is the time to send a strong message to the world that America intends to retain its position as the world's foremost innovator. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a narrowly focused bill that protects religious liberty from unnecessary governmental interference. It will provide protection for houses of worship and other religious assemblies from restrictive land use regulation that often prevents the practice of faith. This legislation also allows institutionalized persons to exercise their religion to the extent that it does not undermine the security, discipline, and order of their institutions. 
   Seven years ago, recognizing the need to strengthen the fundamental right of religious liberty, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Unfortunately, in 1997, in the case of City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the authority to enact RFRA as applied to state and local governments. In an attempt to respond to the Boerne decision, I introduced S. 2081 earlier this year. Legislation similar to S. 2081 passed the  House of Representatives. Yet, concerns were raised by some regarding the scope of S. 2081, and I undertook an effort to seek out a consensus approach. The legislation I am introducing today, which maintains certain provisions of S. 2081, is a tailored version which represents the product of our efforts. 
   The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 provides limited federal remedies for violations of religious liberty in: (1) the land use regulation of churches and synagogues; and (2) prisons and mental hospitals.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to extend my personal gratitude to the Armed Services Committee Chairman and the Ranking Member, as well as to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Readiness for their consideration of my recommended language at Sec. 361 of this bill. This provision requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the consequences of high OPTEMPO on military aviation and ground equipment. Let me explain why I applaud this provision. My particular interest is somewhat more focused on aviation assets. 
   Quite simply, we need to know the adverse effects that the worldwide contingency operations engaged in by our military high-performance aircraft are having on the integrity of the aircraft's frame, engines and other components. 
   I raise this issue, Mr. President, because my state proudly hosts the Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Just recently, a team of depot technicians at Hill discovered that the mechanical assembly designed to brake or halt the rise and fall of the stabilizer on the Air Force KC-135 tanker had been prematurely wearing out because of a surge of KC-135 flight activity, much of it related to the frantic deployment schedules that these aircrews are tied to. 
   The shortage of replacement parts for the stabilizer braking system forced the Air Force to come up with a methodology to refurbish the old part. There had never been a refurbishment of the braking assembly before this time. 
   This is an important fact because the engineering design missed a critical step in the refurbishment process designed to heat out hydrogen that  risked getting into microscopic fissures in the brake ratchet. This would have eventually embrittled the system, causing the stabilizer to fail. It would have meant with near certainty that we would have lost aircraft in midair flight as well as some aircrew lives. 
   The Secretary of the Air Force, Whitten Peters, has commended the depot technicians for their astute recommendations to the Air Force Materiel Command to ground the KC-135 fleet; this was done, and I am convinced that lives were saved. 
   But I am no less convinced that we need better visibility over the rapidly aging aircraft airframes and other parts are suffering from the near-frenetic flying schedules and deployments that they and their crews are committed to. Put more directly: we cannot and must not push these brave aircrews into harm's way in aircraft that are even remotely vulnerable to critical component failures. 
   Mr. President, my concern extends to all tactical and strategic, as well as support and service support aviation assets used in these contingency and peacekeeping operations by the Navy, Marine Corps, and the Air Force. The provision asks for a study of the effects of these deployments on all such assets. Wisely, the Committee has added Army aviation since its predominately rotary wing--or helicopter--operations warrant inclusion in the scope of this assessment. 
   If one looks at the Air Force commitments, which have carried the bulk of many of the contingency operations, the statistics are as staggering as they are telling: 18,400 sorties over Iraq; 73 percent of the air assets patrolling the Northern watch no-fly zone which produced 75 percent of the total number of sorties in that region. In the Southern Watch no-fly zone, the Air Force also provided 35 percent of the total air assets and produced 68 percent of the sorties. But I don't want to ignore the Navy with its carrier-based aircraft that undergo take-off and, especially, landing procedures that create unimaginably harsh stresses on aircraft. Many members of this body have witnessed carrier operations and know precisely what I am talking about. Some of our colleagues, like my good friends John McCain and Tom Harkin, are even former Navy carrier pilots. 
   The Secretary of Defense has tried to deal with this issue. And we have tried to help him in the past year. Secretary Bill Cohen cited in his report to Congress this February that aging systems, spot spare parts shortages, and high OPTEMPO [high operating tempo] are placing increased pressure on materiel readiness.'' The Secretary has testified to his ``particular concern'' for ``negative readiness trends in mission capable rates for aircraft.'' Last year, Congress provided DOD with $1.8 billion in Kosovo emergency supplemental funding to meet the most urgent demands. 
   Yet, our equipment is aging. The average age of Air Force aircraft is now 20 years old. Our state of art air-to-ground mission aircraft, the F-16, has a technology base older than most of its pilots, some of whom are flying F-16 aircraft that have been in service longer than they have been alive! The problems of corrosion, fatigue and even parts obsolescence are rampant. I spend much time at Hill Air Force Base in my state of Utah. There are certain critical components that are still tied to vacuum tube technology. Imagine that! How many of us still listen to vacuum tube radios; some of our younger staff members may not even know what they are! Some of our top-of-the-line tactical fighter aircraft use gyroscopes--which are absolutely critical to positional accuracy--that are several generations old. It bothers me greatly to hear people complain about ``gold-plated'' military aircraft. I would invite any of them to join me in a tour of the Ogden, Utah, depot. When they see the condition of components from our best tactical fighters being serviced, I suspect they would better understand the real meaning of courage. 
   But let me conclude with a word about the most important resource in this equation: people. We have reduced our forces by 30 percent and increased deployments by nearly 400 percent. The effect is exactly what you would expect. Recently, the Marine Corps' Commandant and the Army Chief of Staff announced that deployments of their aviation and ground equipment are now 16 times the rate during the Cold War. Unprecedented pilot losses, reaching a 33 percent level in the Navy, 15 percent in the Air Force and 21 percent in the Marine Corps. But the most critical losses are found among the highly specialized aircraft service technicians. Specialists in electronic components, air traffic control, armaments and munitions, and other technical specialties, at all levels of service, short-term, mid-term and long-term, are leaving in unprecedented numbers. Even the Air Force's valiant Expeditionary Air Force concept, which organizes a highly mobile slice of the Air Force into 10 task forces, called ``Air Expeditionary Forces,'' faces technical enlisted skill shortages which still burden the fewer and fewer technicians who remain on active duty, according to a General Accounting Office study on military personnel released in early March 2000. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for listening to this long presentation regarding my concerns for the state of our military aircraft and the people who fly and service them. I know that most will join with me and the committee in calling for a full review of the consequences of the unprecedented peacetime demands being made on our people and their equipment.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 4577, the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act. I would like to congratulate my colleagues, Senator SPECTER, Senator STEVENS, and Senator HARKIN for working together to pass one of the more contentious of the annual appropriations bills. 
   I appreciate the comity and courtesy displayed by the managers of this bill. I realize that most of my colleagues have specific priorities they wish to highlight in this measure. I appreciate the managers' support of the Inhofe amendment regarding the Impact Aid program. As I have stated in the past, this is a vital program for Utah. 
   I also appreciate the fact that the subcommittee has once again included a provision which would allow school districts adversely affected by a recalculation of the census to keep their Title I concentration funds. 
   According to Utahns who live and work and educate our children in these districts, this cut would do a huge disservice to Title I students in these districts. These hardworking Utahns have informed me that they believe that the census calculations do not adequately reflect the pockets of poverty that exist in these districts. Some of the schools in these districts have a poverty rate, when calculated based on school lunch data, at over 70 percent. I am pleased that the subcommittee has accepted the recommendation to hold these districts harmless. 
   I intend to vote in favor of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, but I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to note, once again, that a crucial provision in the Title I formula remains unfunded. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Program was authorized in the 1994 Elementary and Secondary Education Act and is included in S. 2, the ESEA reauthorization, currently pending before the Congress. 
   I recently detailed the merits of this program when I spoke about my intention to offer an amendment to S. 2 that would make EFIG a mandatory component of Title I. I will briefly review those arguments here: 
   EFIG has, as a principal component, an equity factor, which measures how states distribute resources among school districts. As policy, equalizing resources among school districts has merit well documented in academic literature. 
   Moreover, many States are being compelled by the courts to equalize resources among school districts. Over 30 states have been taken to court on the basis of an unequal distribution of resources. My amendment would provide some relief to states that are currently required by the courts to equalize resources among school districts by increasing their share of Title I funds. My amendment would also provide the incentive to equalize resources to states which may not have already done so. 
   The Education Finance Incentive Grant program would be the only part of the Title I formula that does not use the per-pupil expenditure as a proxy for a state's commitment to education. There are many ways to measure a State's commitment to education--the per-pupil expenditure is merely one. Indeed, one of the most damaging aspects of the Title I formula is that it is replicated as a means to distribute Federal money to the states in other programs that have no relation to Title I. The insertion of another measure of a state's commitment to education is appropriate. 
   When EFIG is a factor in the Title I formula, more states do better than under current law. This was a key factor in the debate over the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and why it was the intent during the enactment of the 1994 reauthorization that any additional funds directed to Title I go out through the EFIG. Indeed, it was the reason why a number of Senators voted for the conference report. It is my strongly held conviction that the intention of the 1994 act should be realized, and I will continue to pursue this goal. 
   I do not believe that the Senate should authorize on an appropriations measure, which is why I did not offer my amendment during consideration of this bill. However, I join with many of my colleagues who have expressed concerns over the possibility that, for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Congress will fail to reauthorize vital elementary and secondary education programs. I sincerely hope that those who have obstructed enactment of S. 2 will reconsider their position and allow the bill to go forward.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator CHRISTOPHER DODD and others, to introduce a simple but highly significant bill which will confer the treasured status of American citizenship on individuals with disabilities. 
   Under current law, the Attorney General possesses the authority to waive certain requirements of naturalization, such as the English and civics test requirements, for disabled applicants. The law, however, has been construed to stop short of granting the Attorney General authority to waive the requirement for the oath of renunciation and allegiance for disabled adult applicants. 
   Consequently, even though such persons are able to fulfill all other requirements of naturalization, or it is clear that the Attorney General can waive them, certain individuals with disabilities may never become citizens. 
   This is the sad situation that a young man from my home state of Utah is facing. Gustavo Galvez Letona, a 27 year-old immigrant from Guatemala, suffers from Down's syndrome. Mr. Letona's entire family are already  American citizens. But, while Mr. Letona is otherwise able to become a citizen, despite his developmental disability, the fact that the Attorney General's authority to waive the oath is unclear will prevent Mr. Letona from enjoying the same status as a naturalized American citizen. 
   Imagine a family in which mother, father, brothers and sisters could become U.S. citizens, but one sibling could not only because of a disability. I believe all my colleagues would agree that this would be a sad and tragic situation. It is discriminatory to boot. 
   This bill would not affect a large number of people. A recent estimate was that only about 1100 individuals with disabilities would possibly be eligible for such a waiver. Moreover, I used the word ``possibly'' because the waiver would not be automatic. The waiver would be granted at the discretion of the Attorney General and is not intended to confer citizenship on individuals--regardless of a disability--who would not otherwise qualify for citizenship. It would not apply to every individual with a disability, most of whom would not need such a waiver. 
   Today's legislation remedies this unfortunate scenario facing Gustavo Letona by extending the Attorney General's authority to waive the taking of the oath if the applicant is unable to understand or communicate an understanding of the oath because of disability. This simple solution allows Mr. Letona and others the privilege of becoming American citizens. 
   I would like to express my gratitude to Senator DODD for his willingness to make this a bipartisan effort. I would also like to thank my Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy, and particularly Ron Gardner, who brought this problem to my attention and who works tirelessly to protect the rights of the disabled. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in the RECORD following my remarks.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Congress is approving one of my top legislative priorities, the ``Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000,'' (S. 1515) which will update the compensation program Congress enacted a decade ago. The amendments we pass tonight will make certain that more Utahns who were exposed to radiation during the Cold War can now be granted deserved compensation to recognize the injuries and hardship they and their families have suffered. It will also streamline the application process, making it easier for eligible claimants to qualify. 
   Mr. President, we our government can never truly make right the unanticipated illness and injury caused by our Nation's nuclear testing program. But we should do all we can, and it is my fervent hope these amendments show Congress' commitment to righting a wrong in which the government played such a substantial role.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to express my extreme pleasure with the agreement reached by the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, and the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, restoring funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   I am delighted that an agreement has been reached by the two chairmen on restoring funding--not only for the CHIP program--but also for the Social Services Block Grant program. 
   These two important programs affect the lives of millions of Americans daily and are critically important in my home state of Utah. 
   As the original sponsor of the child health program, I was particularly concerned about the committee provision and--not only its potential impact on children already enrolled in CHIP--but especially on those children who are eligible but not yet enrolled. 
   This is why I wanted to come to the floor and personally thank the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for agreeing to restore the $1.9 billion in federal spending for CHIP as well as the $1.1 billion reduction in the Social Services Block Grant. 
   Moreover, I understand that the Chairman has also agreed to restore $240 million in funding for the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program. This is also an important improvement to the committee bill. 
   I want to commend Senator STEVENS for working with us on the Finance Committee in resolving this very difficult funding issue. 
   Moreover, I want to commend our chairman, Senator ROTH, for his steadfast leadership in leading the charge at preserving the underlying funding for these critically important programs. 
   I can appreciate the difficult work that the Chairman and all the Members on the Appropriations Committee have faced in crafting a bill that addresses the needs of the American people while complying with the fiscal constraints necessary to balance the federal budget. 
   It is not an easy task recognizing the numerous demands placed on the committee by many worthy 
   programs and causes. 
   As one of the original sponsors of the CHIP legislation, I am particularly concerned about any mid-course changes to this important program that could undermine our ability to enroll eligible children. 
   In my state of Utah, nearly 18,000 kids have benefitted from CHIP. 
   Had the committee provision been enacted, the Utah CHIP program would have seen a $1.7 million reduction in its fiscal year 1998 allocation. 
   And, as we now know, one of the critical problems facing the program has been the outreach effort to enroll eligible children. 
   Clearly, we do not want to undermine the success we have had to date in which there are now more than two million children enrolled nationwide. 
   As with any new initiative, it takes time to get these programs up and running. This is especially true in view of the fact that CHIP is administered at the state level and, therefore, it takes more time to get these programs fully operational. 
   I have heard from many constituents who are concerned about these proposed funding cuts. 
   They point out to me that there is a substantial lead time required to establish the outreach necessary to sign up new enrollees. That work is underway. 
   I am very proud of the job Utah is doing under the leadership of our Governor Mike Leavitt and with the help of many, many community organizations doing such excellent work in the field--but we are not there yet. 
   That is why the proposed cuts could have been so harmful. 
   Mr. President, the CHIP program has been a resounding success across the country with all fifty states providing some form of CHIP services to eligible children. 
   It has truly been remarkable the level of support we have seen from many groups across the country opposed to the proposed CHIP funding reductions. 
   Not only has there been strong, bipartisan support in the Senate against the reductions, but we also have heard from the National Governors Association and scores of other advocacy organizations including the American Hospital Association, the Children's Defense Fund, and the Girl Scouts of the USA expressing strong opposition to any reductions in CHIP funding. 
   Once again, I thank Senator STEVENS and Senator ROTH for this agreement as it sends a clear signal that CHIP is, indeed, fulfilling its mission to America's youth. 
   Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator INHOFE, to increase funds for the Impact Aid program. I have been a long time supporter of this vital program. 
   The Impact Aid program helps compensate states, like Utah, which are adversely affected by a federal presence. This program allocates funds to school districts where there are substantial concentrations of children whose parents both live and work on federally connected property and kids who parents either live or work on federally connected property. This is an extremely important program in Utah, especially in the southern part of my state. 
   Some may ask why this program is needed. The answer is simple. When the federal government owns or controls property, that property is lost to the tax base of state and local governments. The Impact Aid program was established for the purpose of compensating school districts for the tax revenue they lose given a federal presence. 
   I note with dismay and frustration that the Clinton Administration routinely eliminates portions of the Impact Aid program in its annual budget recommendations. Fortunately, however, this important program has been maintained and consistently funded. For that, I want to recognize the assistance of Senator SPECTER, Senator STEVENS, and the other members of the Appropriations Committee. Congress has kept this program viable. 
   Impact Aid is a vital program for Utah for many reasons. Utah needs every dollar it can get for our schools. Utah is a ``worst case scenario'' when it comes to the issue of school finance. We have the largest percentage of school age population in the country and the lowest percentage of working age adults. Because of this we have the lowest per-pupil expenditure in the country, despite the fact that our state allocates an extraordinary percentage of its tax revenue to education. Moreover, the adverse impact of a low per-pupil expenditure is felt over and over again because per pupil expenditure has become a factor in the funding formulas for a number of federal education programs. 
   To make matters worse, about 70 percent of Utah's land is federally connected. We have military bases, parks, forests, wilderness, BLM land, reservations, and, of course, a relatively new 1.7 million acre national monument. 
   If the Federal Government is going to own or control this much land in Utah, we need a fully funded Impact Aid program to offset the tax revenue losses to our schools. The federal government cannot improve education if they give with one hand and take away with the other. That is what the Clinton administration seems to be doing--advocating education funds only for those initiatives it has proposed, but financially starving federal education programs that send money directly to Utah school districts. 
   I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of the Impact Aid program. I urge senators to support this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have offered this amendment on behalf of Senator LEAHY and myself. I believe this amendment is going to be accepted because it clarifies some matters that are very good. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this Hatch-Leahy amendment which is aimed at limiting the negative impact violence and indecent material on the Internet have on children. 
   This amendment does not regulate content. Instead it encourages the larger Internet service providers to provide, either for free or at a fee not exceeding the cost to the service providers, filtering technologies that would empower parents to limit or block access of minors to unsuitable material on the Internet. 
   We simply can not ignore the fact that the Internet has the ability to expose children to violent, sexually explicit and other inappropriate materials with no limits. 
   A recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 believe the Internet is partly responsible for crimes like the Columbine High School shooting. 
   Our amendment respects the First Amendment of the Constitution by not regulating content, but ensures that parents will have the adequate technological tools to control the access of their children to unsuitable material on the Internet. 
   I honestly believe that the Internet service providers who do not already provide filtering software to their subscribers will do so voluntarily. They will know it is in their best interests and that the market will demand it. 
   A recent survey reported in the New York Times yesterday, found that almost a third of online American households with children use blocking software. 
   In a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, 60 percent of parents said they disagreed with the statement that the Internet was a safe place for their children. 
   And according to yesterday's New York Times, after the shootings in Colorado, the demand for filtering technologies has dramatically increased. This indicates that parents are taking an active role in safeguarding their children on the Internet. 
   That is what this amendment is about: using technology to empower the parent. I urge my colleagues' approval of the amendment. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to Senator LEAHY, who would like to speak on this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and friend, Senator JOSEPH BIDEN, to introduce one of the most significant pieces of legislation that the Senate will consider this year, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. This historic bill reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act programs that would otherwise expire at the end of this fiscal year. This new bill is the result of bipartisan cooperation over the last year and combines the best provisions of S. 245, the Violence Against Women Act of 1999, which I introduced last year, and of S. 51, Senator BIDEN's Violence Against Women Act II. 
   Six years ago, recognizing the importance and need to protect the women and children in this country from domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault, senators from both parties supported the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994. This legislation has made a critical difference in the lives of countless families in my state of Utah and across the country. 
   The Violence Against Women Act strengthened our laws, empowered law enforcement, facilitated access to protective orders, established and funded both battered women shelters and a national domestic violence hotline, and most importantly led to the overall protection of America's women and children. 
   Well, we must ask ourselves, ``Was it worth it? Did our efforts made a difference?'' I stand here today to answer those questions with a resounding ``yes.'' 
   The most recent Department of Justice statistics show that violence against women by intimate partners is down 21 percent across the board from just before the original bill's enactment. The Department of Justice has prosecuted hundreds of cases involving interstate domestic violence, interstate stalking, and interstate violations of protection orders. Through funding provided by the Act, the Department of Health and Human Services has provided grant funds to shelter more than 300,000 women and their dependents each year, while the National Domestic Violence Hotline has responded to approximately 500,000 calls. In all, the original Violence Against Women Act provided $1.6 billion in grant funds supporting the work of law enforcement officials, prosecutors, the courts, victim advocates, and intervention and prevention programs to address domestic violence at all levels. 
   Although the Violence Against Women Act has been widely successful, domestic violence continues to plague our homes, our communities, and our country. The national statistics are sobering: 
   Nearly one-third of women murdered each year are killed by their intimate partners.  
   Violence by intimates accounts for over 20 percent of all violent crime against women. 
   Approximately one million women are stalked each year. 
   Women were raped and sexually assaulted 307,000 times in 1998 alone. 
   Thus, I believe we should ask ourselves today, ``Should we continue and strengthen our efforts to combat violence against women?'' Once again, I stand here today to answer this question with a resounding ``yes.'' We must continue our efforts to protect our women and children from the devastating effects of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 will reauthorize through fiscal year 2005 the grant programs that will enable the federal, state, and local governments to persist in their efforts 
   to prosecute offenders and provide vital services to the victims of domestic violence. I would like to point out that the recent Supreme Court case United States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000), simply invalidated the ``civil remedy'' provision, which allowed a victim of gender-motivated violence to sue her attacker in federal court. The case did not affect the ability of Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, nor did the case affect any other aspect of the Act. 
   There are several new, important, and worthwhile programs in this bill. One in particular, the transitional housing program, had its inception in my own state of Utah. Dedicated professionals in my State, working in the field, brought to my attention the fact that shelters often fail to provide adequate help to persons escaping the horror of domestic violence. In states like Utah, the spread-out location and the few number of shelters makes it difficult to serve the entire population in need of refuge from domestic violence. Furthermore, shelters are often inadequate for anything more than a few weeks. The transitional housing program remedies the situation by allowing some supplemental and short term housing for persons escaping domestic violence. 
   It is absolutely imperative that we achieve strong, bipartisan support for this bill. We are approaching the end of our legislative session--we need to take the politics out of the process and reauthorize this Act. Senator BIDEN and I have worked long and hard on this--we are confident that our bill represents not only the interests of both Republicans and Democrats, but that it truly represents the interests of the American family. I intend to move this bill through the Senate Judiciary Committee promptly and intend to do all I can to ensure it becomes law this year. 
   Finally, I would conclude by expressing my gratitude to Senator BIDEN for his tireless efforts to get this legislation written and passed. No one in the Senate has a longer and greater history of dedication to combating violence against women. 
   I would also like to express my appreciation to Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM from Michigan. He has given much of his time and attention to this bill, particularly on the immigration provisions. I am grateful for his efforts.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment that I have offered concerning the horrible crimes that are being committed in our country that have come to be known as hate crimes. They are violent crimes that are committed against a victim because of that victim's membership in a particular class or group. These crimes are abhorrent to me, and I believe to all Americans who think about it. They should be stopped. That is why I have offered this amendment. 
   My amendment does two things. First, it requires that a comprehensive analysis be conducted to determine whether State and local jurisdictions are failing or refusing to prosecute hate-motivated crimes to the fullest extent possible. Second, it provides assistance to State and local jurisdictions who lack the resources to carry out their duties of combating hate crimes. 
   Let me talk about the comprehensive study first. Under the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, data has been collected regarding the number of hate-motivated crimes that have been committed throughout the country. This data, however, has never been properly analyzed to determine whether States are abdicating their responsibility to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. My amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis of this raw data that would include a comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--some with hate crimes laws, others without--to determine whether there, in fact, is a problem with the way certain States are investigating and prosecuting these crimes. 
   Supporters of broad hate crimes legislation, like that proposed in the Kennedy amendment, claim that there are States and localities that are unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It is unclear whether this claim is true. There is precious little evidence showing that there is a widespread problem with State and local police and prosecutors refusing to enforce the law when the victim is black, or a woman, or gay, or disabled. 
   At the hearing on hate crimes legislation that we held in the Judiciary Committee, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder came to testify and explain the reasons why the Justice Department supports the expansive legislation proposed by Senator KENNEDY. I asked Mr. Holder the rather basic and straightforward question of whether he could identify ``any specific instances in which State law enforcement authorities have deliberately failed to enforce the law against the perpetrator of a crime.'' After he gave a somewhat non-responsive answer, I asked him again: ``Can you give me specific instances where the States have failed in their duty to investigate and prosecute hate crimes?'' Mr. Holder could not. He then indicated that he would go back to the Justice Department, conduct some research, and then provide the Judiciary Committee with the specific instances for which I asked. 
   In a subsequent response to written questions, the Justice Department identified three cases in which the Justice Department ``filed charges against defendants . . . after determining that the state response was inadequate to vindicate the federal interest.'' In addition, the Department identified two cases where the Justice 
   Department determined that the State could not ``respond as effectively as the Federal Government because, for example, State penalties are less severe.'' These five cases hardly show wholesale abdication of prosecutorial responsibilities by State and local prosecutors. To the contrary, these cases show that State and local authorities are vigorously combating hate crimes and, where necessary, cooperating with Federal officials who may assist them in investigating, charging, and trying these defendants. 
   During the debate yesterday, Senator KENNEDY indicated that the Justice Department had produced additional examples of cases where State and local prosecutors have failed or refused to prosecute hate crimes. There are three of these additional cases. I have to say, however, that the three additional cases produced by the Justice Department and cited by Senator KENNEDY do not establish that State and local authorities are unwilling to combat hate crimes. 
   So where does that leave us? We are being asked to enact a broad federalization of all hate-motivated crimes that historically have been handled at the State and local level because, it is argued, States and local authorities are either unable or unwilling to prosecute them. My amendment's grant program addresses the first concern--that States and localities, because of a lack of resources, are unable to prosecute these crimes. If there is not enough money there, let's put enough money into the bill. I am not against increasing the sums. As for the second concern, we are being asked to conclude that States and localities are unwilling to prosecute hate-motivated crimes on the basis of eight cases--eight cases out of the thousands and thousands of criminal cases that are brought each year. Eight cases, I might add, that at the very least are equivocal on the issue of whether States and localities are failing or refusing to prosecute hate crimes. 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment also cite to the horrible beating death of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, WY, and the dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, TX, as evidence that there is a problem that Congress should address. But the Shepard and Byrd cases prove my point. Both were fully prosecuted by local authorities who sought and obtained convictions. In the Byrd case, the defendants were given the death penalty--something that would not be permitted under the Kennedy amendment. 
   This is not a case where my mind is made up; where no matter what evidence I am shown of dereliction by State and local authorities in the area of hate crimes, I would say that it is not enough, or is not sufficient for me to believe that there is a problem. I am open to the possibility that State and local authorities are not doing their part. I hope that is not true, but my mind is not made up. That is why my amendment calls for a comprehensive study that would carefully and thoroughly and objectively study the data we have collected to see if there is a disparity in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. If there is a problem with prosecution at the State level, then I am on record calling for an effective and responsible Federal response. 
   To summarize: My amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis of hate crimes statistics to determine whether, in fact, any State and local law enforcement authorities are unwilling, for whatever reason, to combat these horrific crimes. Even if the eight cases identified by the Justice Department did show that State and local authorities were unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes, they still would 
   only be eight cases out of the thousands and thousands of cases that are brought each year. They simply do not show a widespread problem regarding State and local prosecution of hate-motivated crime. 
   In fact, if you look at them it show that the system is working and the two bodies, the State and local prosecutors and the Federal prosecutors generally work together and they simply do not show a widespread problem regarding State and local prosecutions of hate-motivated crime.  
   Reasonable people should agree that an analysis of the hate crimes statistics that have been collected ought to be conducted to determine whether there is anything to the argument that State and local authorities are failing to combat hate crimes. If the study shows that State and local authorities are derelict in their duties when it comes to hate crimes, I will be the first to support legislation targeted at such government conduct. 
   The second main thing that my amendment does is create a grant program to help provide resources to States and local jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment claim that some State and local jurisdictions do not have adequate resources to combat hate crimes. They say that these jurisdictions, while willing to combat hate crimes, are unable to do so because they lack the resources. My amendment answers this very real concern. My amendment would equip States and localities with the resources necessary so that they can combat such crimes. And my Amendment would do so without federalizing every hate-motivated crime. 
   Now, I should make clear what my amendment does not do. It does not create a new federal crime. It does not federalize crimes motivated because of a person's membership in a particular class or group. Such federalization would, in my estimation, be unconstitutional and would unduly burden federal law enforcement, federal prosecutors and federal courts. 
   I must say that the serious constitutional questions 
   that are raised by the Kennedy amendment's broad federalization of what are now State crimes is its greatest drawback. The intention of Senator KENNEDY's amendment--to combat hate-motivated crimes--is certainly praiseworthy. But the Kennedy amendment's method for achieving this laudable aim--by making a federal case out of every hate-motivated crime--is not. If enacted, the Kennedy amendment likely will be struck down as unconstitutional. As I discussed at length yesterday, Congress simply does not have the authority to enact such broad legislation under either Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause. This is clear in light of the Supreme Court's decision last month in United States v. Morrison. 
   During the debate yesterday it was argued that the Thirteenth Amendment provides Congress with the authority to enact the Kennedy amendment. I respectfully disagree. The Thirteenth Amendment provides:  
   Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  
   Under this amendment, Congress is authorized to prohibit private action that constitutes a badge, incident or relic of slavery. An argument could perhaps be made that the failure or refusal by State authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes committed because the victim is an African-American constitutes a badge or incident or relic of slavery. But while this creative, Thirteenth Amendment argument possibly may work for federal regulation of hate crimes committed against African-Americans, it simply does not work for federal regulation of hate crimes against women, or gays, or the disabled, as the Thirteenth Amendment applies only to the badges or incidents or relics of slavery. At no time in our nation's history, thank goodness, have our laws sanctioned the enslavement of women, homosexuals or the disabled. 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment argued yesterday that the Justice Department has placed its stamp of approval on this creative, Thirteenth Amendment argument. I am fairly confident, however, notwithstanding the Justice Department's opinion, that the Supreme Court will not interpret the Thirteenth Amendment so expansively. 
   In conclusion, it is my hope that my colleagues who intend to vote for the Kennedy amendment will also support my amendment. While I strongly disagree with the approach taken by the Kennedy amendment, the two amendments are not inconsistent. My amendment provides for a strong and workable assistance program for State and local law enforcement. Indeed, it has the support of the National District Attorneys Association. Further, my amendment requires a comprehensive study so that we can really learn what, if any, problems and difficulties exist at the State and local level. 
   With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Oregon made my case. I decry what happened in the Matthew Shepard case. I decry what happened in the James Byrd case. Those horrific crimes, however, were investigated by local authorities and prosecuted by local prosecutors. In both instances, the local prosecutors obtained appropriate sentences--life terms in the case of the Shepard defendants and death sentences in the case of the Byrd defendants. Local law enforcement and local prosecutors did their jobs and investigated and prosecuted truly awful hate crimes. 
   All of these horrible examples of hate crimes were handled properly by State and local authorities. That is why my amendment is strongly supported by the National District Attorneys Association, the major organization that represents State and local prosecutors throughout the country. 
   The National District Attorneys Association has endorsed my amendment because State and local prosecutors believe that the assistance offered in my amendment would be very helpful to them as they seek to fight hate-motivated crime. 
   In a letter of support, the National District Attorneys Association also states that it strongly endorses my amendment because my amendment ``appropriately recognizes that local law enforcement has the primary responsibility to safeguard their citizens while working as a team with the Federal Government.'' 
   I have at least a couple of problems with the Kennedy amendment. First, it is unconstitutional. The Morrison case, decided only a month ago, is directly on point and leads to the inexorable conclusion that the Kennedy amendment, if adopted, will be struck down as unconstitutional. Second, the Kennedy amendment is overbroad. It would make a federal case out of every single hate-motivated crime that occurs in this country--including all rapes and sexual assaults, which currently are prosecuted under State law. Can you imagine what will happen if our Federal courts are clogged with all the rape cases in this country that are currently being handled very well by State and local prosecutors? That is why the National District Attorneys Association is strongly supportive of what I am trying to do here today. 
   My amendment takes action with regard to the horrible crimes that are being committed in our country that have come to be known as hate crimes. They are violent crimes that are committed against a victim because of that victim's membership in a particular class or group. These crimes are abhorrent to me, and to all Americans. They should be stopped. That is why I have offered this amendment. 
   My amendment does two things. First, it requires that a comprehensive analysis be conducted to determine whether State and local jurisdictions are failing or refusing to prosecute hate-motivated crimes to the fullest extent possible. Second, it provides assistance to State and local jurisdictions who lack the resources to carry out their duties of combating hate crimes. 
   Let me talk about the comprehensive study first. Under the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which I worked to get enacted in 1990, data has been collected regarding the number of hate-motivated crimes that have been committed throughout the country. This data, however, has never been properly analyzed to determine whether States are abdicating their responsibility to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. My amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis of this raw data that would include a comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--some with hate crimes laws, others without--to determine whether there, in fact, is a problem with the way certain States are investigating and prosecuting these crimes. 
   Supporters of broad hate crimes legislation, like that proposed in the Kennedy amendment, claim that there are States and localities that are unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It is unclear whether this claim is true. There is little or no evidence showing that there is a widespread problem with State and local police and prosecutors refusing to enforce the law when the victim is black, or a woman, or gay, or disabled. Of the thousands--perhaps hundreds of thousands--of criminal cases that are brought every year, the Justice Department could identify only five cases where it believed that it could have done a better job than the States in prosecuting a particular hate crime. In each of these five cases, however, the States either investigated and prosecuted the hate crime themselves, or worked with the federal government to investigate and prosecute the hate crime. In none of these cases did the perpetrator of the hate crime escape the heavy hand of the law. 
   In United States v. Lee and Jarrad, a 1994 case from Georgia, the State obtained a guilty plea from one of the defendants and, after investigating the matter for several months, determined that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the other defendant. 
   In United States v. Black and Clark, a 1991 case from California, the county sheriff--who lacked resources--ceded investigatory authority to the FBI after the federal government indicated its desire to investigate and prosecute the case. Because the defendants were charged federally, State prosecutors declined to bring State charges. My amendment would provide grants for similarly situated Sheriffs who operate on a tight budget. 
   In United States v. Bledsoe, a 1983 case from Kansas, the State prosecuted the defendant for homicide and, after a trial, the defendant was acquitted. The Justice Department then brought federal charges and obtained a life sentence. 
   In United States v. Mungia, Mungia and Martin, a Texas case, state prosecutors worked with federal prosecutors and agreed that federal charges were preferable because (1) the defendants could be tried jointly in federal court and (2) overcrowding in State prisons might have led to the defendants serving less than their full sentences. 
   And, in United States v. Lane and Pierce, a 1987 case from Colorado, State prosecutors worked with federal prosecutors and agreed that federal charges were preferable because most of the witnesses were in federal custody in several different States. 
   These five cases hardly show wholesale abdication of prosecutorial responsibility by State and local prosecutors. To the contrary, these cases show that State and local authorities are vigorously combating hate crimes and, where necessary, cooperating with federal officials who may assist them in investigating, charging, and trying these defendants. 
   During the debate yesterday, Senator KENNEDY indicated that the Justice Department had produced to the Judiciary Committee additional examples of cases where State and local prosecutors have failed or refused to prosecute hate crimes. 
   In fact, the Justice Department did identify three additional cases to Senator KENNEDY. However of these three additional cases produced by the Justice Department and cited by Senator  KENNEDY, none establishes that State and local authorities are unwilling to combat hate crimes. 
   In the 1984 case of United States v. Kila, the State authorities who were investigating the case requested that the Justice Department become involved in the case and bring federal charges. A federal jury then acquitted the defendants of the federal charges. 
   In a 1982 case that the Justice Department does not name, the defendant was acquitted of federal charges; the Justice Department does not state whether State charges were brought or whether the local prosecutors simply deferred to the federal prosecutors. 
   And, in United States v. Franklin, a 1980 case from Indiana, the defendant was acquitted of federal charges; again, the Justice Department does not state whether State charges were brought or whether local prosecutors deferred to federal prosecutors. 
   In summary, my amendment calls for a comprehensive analysis of hate crimes statistics to determine whether, in fact, any State and local law enforcement authorities are unwilling, for whatever reason, to combat these horrific crimes. 
   Even if the eight cases I have just discussed did show that State and local authorities were unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes, they still would only be eight 
   cases out of the thousands and thousands of cases that are brought each year. In no way do they show a widespread problem regarding State and local prosecution of hate-motivated crime. Reasonable people should agree that an analysis of the hate crimes statistics that have been collected ought to be conducted to determine whether there is anything to the argument that State and local authorities are failing to combat hate rimes. If the study shows that State and local authorities are derelict in their duties when it comes to hate crimes, I will be the first to support legislation targeted at such government conduct. 
   The second main thing that my amendment does is create a grant program to help provide resources to States and local jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment claim that some State and local jurisdictions do not have adequate resources to combat hate crimes. They say that these jurisdictions, while willing to combat hate crimes, are unable to do so because they lack the resources. My amendment seeks to answer this very real concern.

It does not federalize crimes motivated because of a persons's membership in a particular class or group.

The intention of Senator KENNDY's amendment--to combat hate-motivated crimes--is certainly praiseworthy. But the Kennedy amendment's method for achieving this laudable aim--by making a federal case out of every hate-motivated crime--is not. If enacted, the Kennedy amendment likely will be struck down as unconstitutional. As I discussed at length yesterday, Congress simply does not have the authority to enact such broad legislation under either Section 5 of the 14th amendment or the commerce clause. This is clear in light of the Supreme Court's decision last month in United States v. Morrison. 
   During the debate yesterday it was argued that the 13th amendment provides Congress with the authority to enact the legislation proposed in the Kennedy amendment. I respectfully disagree. The 13th amendment provides: ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'' An argument could perhaps be made that the failure or refusal by State authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes committed because the victim is an African-American constitutes at badge or incident of slavery. But while this creative 13th amendment argument possibly may work for federal regulation of hate crimes committed against African-Americans, it simply does not work for federal regulation of hate crimes against women, or gays, or the disabled, as the 13th amendment applies only to the badges or incidents or relics of slavery. At no time in our nation's history, thank goodness, have our laws sanctioned the enslavement of women, homosexuals, or the disabled. 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment argued yesterday that the Justice Department has placed its stamp of approval on this creative 13th amendment argument. I am fairly confident, however, notwithstanding the Justice Department's opinion, that the Supreme Court will not interpret the 13th amendment so expansively. 
   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy amendment. It almost certainly is unconstitutional, given the current state of constitutional law. In addition, it is bad policy to enact a broad federalization of what traditionally have been State crimes--crimes that are, by all accounts, being vigorously investigated and prosecuted at the State and local level. 
   I also would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment that I have offered. It calls for a study of the way States are dealing with the problem of hate crimes and provides grants to States so they will have the resources to continue their efforts. And, my amendment has the added benefit of being constitutional. For the reasons that I have stated, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment. 
   I commend Senator KENNEDY and those who are supporting his amendment in the sense that all of us should be against this type of tyranny, this type of criminal activity that is motivated by hate, this type of mean, venal, vile conduct that lessens our society. But nobody should make the mistake of not understanding that I do not think the case has been made that States and localities are unwilling to combat hate crimes. In the cases I have seen, the evidence is to the contrary: States and localities are leading the fight against hate-motivated crimes. The only way to resolve this issue regarding the willingness of the States to engage in the fight against hate crimes is to do what I suggest: conduct a thoroughgoing study of the hate crimes statistics that we do have to see if, in fact, States and local jurisdictions are not doing their jobs. I, for one, do not believe that the case has been made against local prosecutors.

   Mr. HATCH. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment want to enact a broad federalization of all hate-motivated crimes because, they argue, some State and local authorities are unable to investigate and prosecute hate crimes because of the lack of resources. 
   My amendment will solve this problem by establishing a grant program to provide financial assistance to State and local jurisdictions for the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment also argue that we should make a Federal case out of every hate-motivated crime because some States and locales are unwilling to engage in the fight against hate crimes. There is little or no evidence, however, that shows that States and localities are being derelict in their duties to enforce the law. 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment cite the horrible beating death of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, WY, and the dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, TX, as evidence that there is a problem that Congress should address. The Shepard and Byrd cases, however, both were fully prosecuted by local authorities who sought and obtained convictions. In the Byrd case, local prosecutors obtained the death penalty--something that would not be permitted under the Kennedy amendment. 
   Moreover, the Justice Department has identified only eight cases in which, in the Justice Department's view, States or localities were unwilling to investigate and prosecute a hate-motivated crime. Of the thousands and thousands of criminal cases that are brought each year, the Justice Department could identify only eight cases. These eight cases, I might add, are at the very least equivocal on the issue of whether States and localities are failing or refusing to prosecute hate crimes. 
   Because the evidence is so scarce on the issue of whether States and localities are unwilling to combat hate crimes, my amendment provides for a comprehensive study to see if there really is a problem with State and local prosecution of hate crimes. Studying this issue to see if there really is a problem seems to me to be a reasonable course of action. 
   Even if it could be clearly shown that States and localities were failing or refusing to investigate and prosecute hate crimes, the approach taken by the Kennedy amendment raises serious constitutional questions, especially in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision last month in United States v. Morrison. As written, the Kennedy amendment likely would be held to be unconstitutional under the commerce clause, the 13th amendment, the 14th amendment, and quite possibly, the 1st amendment. 
   In conclusion, it is my hope that those of my colleagues who intend to vote for the Kennedy amendment also will support my amendment. While I disagree with the approach taken by Senator KENNEDY, our two amendments are not inconsistent. My amendment provides for an effective and workable assistance program for State and local law enforcement, a program that enjoys the strong support of the National District Attorneys Association. And, it requires a comprehensive study so that we can really learn what, if any, problems and difficulties exist at the State and local level.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I admire my colleagues. I feel very much the same as they do about these heinous crimes, but I have absolute confidence that our State and local governments are taking care of them. 
   The problem with the Kennedy amendment is that it is unconstitutional and it is bad policy. 
   First, the Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional because it seeks to make a Federal crime of purely private conduct committed by an individual against a person because of that person's race, color, religion, national origin, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. This broad federalization of what are now State crimes would be unconstitutional under the commerce clause, the 13th amendment, the 14th amendment, and, possibly, the 1st amendment. This is clear in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision just last month in United States v. Morrison. 
   As Senators, we have a real duty to consider whether the legislation we enact is constitutional, and not just try to get away with all we can and hope the Supreme Court will fix it for us. 
   Secondly, the Kennedy amendment is bad policy. It would make a Federal crime out of every rape and sexual assault--crimes committed because of the victim's gender--and, as such, would seriously burden Federal law enforcement agencies, Federal prosecutors, and Federal courts. 
   In addition, the Kennedy amendment would not permit the death penalty to be imposed, even in cases of the most heinous hate crimes, such as the Byrd case, where State law permits prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
   Finally, the Kennedy amendment, by broadly federalizing what now are State crimes, would allow the Justice Department to unnecessarily intrude in the work of State and local police and prosecutors without any real justification for doing so right now. That is why we need to do this study while at the same time providing monies to help the State and local prosecutors to do a better job. 
   The Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional, and it is bad policy. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support for the West Desert Wilderness Land Exchange Act, introduced by my good friend and colleague, Senator ROBERT BENNETT. This is a proposal of importance to the citizens of my home state of Utah and to all Americans. 
   Utah is the home to some of the most environmentally diverse lands in the nation. These lands contain environmentally significant plants, animals, geology, and many priceless archaeological sites. 
   This legislation will transfer 106,000 acres of state school trust lands that are currently held within Wilderness Study Areas to areas where they may better benefit Utah schools. School trust lands are intended to raise revenue for Utah's schools. The economic benefits of these lands are vital to Utah schools and their funding. Trapped within Wilderness Study Areas, these lands have not been able to be developed, and Utah's school children have been left holding the short end of the stick. This proposal will allow for a land swap between the Department of the Interior and the State of Utah, and both parties have given their blessing to this proposal. 
   The lands that will be given to the Department of the Interior are home to a variety of endangered and threatened species of plants and animals. A few of these are: the desert tortoise, the chuckawalla, purple-spined hedgehog cactus, and the golden and bald eagles. These lands also contain some of the most magnificent vistas in the western United States with views of Zions National Park, Elephant Butte, and the Deep Creek Mountains. This land exchange will preserve the unparalleled landscapes characteristic of Utah. 
   The Utah State School Lands Trust was established at the time Utah became a state with lands deeded to the trust by the federal government for the purpose of creating a reliable source of income to support our state's educational system. Every student in Utah benefits from the resources made available by the school trust lands. It is a critical source of support for Utah education. 
   This proposal, therefore, has the backing of all major Utah educational organizations, including the Utah PTA and Utah Education Association. This land exchange will unlock our school trust lands for the long-term benefit of Utah's school children. And, quite frankly, we will never be able to designate more wilderness in Utah without protecting the integrity of our Utah State School Lands Trust. 
   This is one proposal where everyone benefits--our schools as well as our environmental interests. It is a logical proposal; it is a fair proposal. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look forward to working with them on this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, our Nation's recent history has been marred by some horrific crimes committed because the victim was a member of a particular class or group. The beating death of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, WY, and then the dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. in Jasper TX. These two spring readily to mind. I firmly believe that such hate-motivated violence is to be abhorred and that the Senate must raise its voice and lead on this issue. 
   During the last 30 years, Congress has been the engine of progress in protecting civil rights and in driving us as a society increasingly closer to the goal of equal rights for all under the law. 
   Historians will conclude, I have little doubt, that many of America's greatest strides in civil rights progress took place just before this present moment on history's grand timeline: Congress protected Americans from employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion and national origin with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Congress protected Americans from gender-based discrimination in rates of pay for equal work with the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and from age discrimination with the passage of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; Congress extended protections to immigration status with the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986, and to the disabled with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. And the list goes on and on. 
   Yet despite our best efforts, discrimination continues to persist in so many forms in this country, but most sadly in the rudimentary and malicious form of violence against individuals because of their membership in a particular class or group. Let me state, unequivocally, that this is America's fight. As much as we condemn all crime, crimes manifesting an animus for someone's race, religion or other characteristics can be more sinister than other crimes. 
   A crime committed not just to harm an individual, but out of the motive of sending a message of malice to an entire community--oftentimes a community that has historically been the subject of discrimination--is appropriately punished more harshly, or in a different manner, than other crimes. 
   This is in keeping with the longstanding principle of criminal justice--as recognized by the Supreme Court in its unanimous 1993 decision in Wisconsin versus Mitchell upholding Wisconsin's sentencing enhancement for crimes of animus--that the worse a criminal defendant's motive, the worse the crime. 
   Moreover, crimes of animus are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes; they inflict deep, lasting and distinct injuries--some of which never heal--on victims and their family members; they incite community unrest; and, ultimately, they are downright un-American. 
   The melting pot of America is the most successful multiethnic, multiracial, and multifaith country in all recorded history. This is something to ponder as we consider the atrocities so routinely sanctioned in other 
   countries--like Serbia or Rwanda--committed against persons entirely on the basis of their racial, ethnic or religious identity. 
   I am resolute in my view that the Federal Government can play a valuable role in responding to crimes of malice and hate. One example here is my sponsorship of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, a law which instituted a data collection system to assess the extent of hate crime activity, and which now has thousands of voluntary law enforcement agency participants. 
   Another, more recent example, is the passage in 1996 of the Church Arson Protection Act, which, among other things, criminalized the destruction of any church, synagogue, mosque or other place of religious worship because of the race, color, or ethnic characteristics of an individual associated with that property. 
   To be sure, however, any Federal response--to be a meaningful one--must abide by the constitutional limitations imposed on Congress, and be cognizant of the limitations on Congress's enumerated powers that are routinely enforced by the courts. 
   This is more true today than it would have been even a mere decade ago, given the significant revival by the U.S. Supreme Court of the federalism doctrine in a string of decisions beginning in 1992. Those decisions must make us particularly vigilant in respecting the courts' restrictions on Congress's powers to legislate under section 5 of the 14th amendment, and under the commerce clause. 
   We therefore need to arrive at a Federal response to this matter that is not only as effective as possible, but that carefully navigates the rocky shoals of these court decisions. To that end, I have prepared an approach that I believe will be not only an effective one, but one that would avoid altogether the constitutional risks that attach to other possible Federal Responses that have been raised. 
   Indeed, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that States and localities should continue to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of hate crimes, and that no legislation is worthwhile if it is invalidated as unconstitutional. This is worth repeating. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that States and localities should continue to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of hate crimes, and that no legislation is worthwhile if it is invalidated as unconstitutional. 
   There are two principal components to my approach: 
   First my amendment creates a meaningful partnership between the Federal Government and the States in combating hate crime by establishing within the Justice Department a grant program to assist State and local authorities in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. 
   Much of the cited justification given by those who advocate broad Federal jurisdiction over these hate-motivated crimes is a lack of adequate resources at the State and local level. Accordingly, before we take the step of making a Federal offense of every crime motivated by a hatred of someone's membership in a particular class or group, it is imperative that we equip States and localities with the resources necessary so that they can undertake these criminal investigations and prosecutions on their own. 
   Second, my approach undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the raw data that has been collected pursuant to the 28 U.S.C. 534, the law requiring the collection of data on these crimes--a bill that I worked very hard to pass. The Federal Government has been collecting this data for years, but we have yet to analyze it. A comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--some with hate crimes, others without--to determine whether there is, in fact, a problem in certain States' prosecution of hate crimes also is provided for in my amendment. 
   Before we make all hate crimes Federal offenses, I believe we should provide assistance to the States and analyze whether our assumptions about  what the States are doing, or are not doing, are valid. 
   It is no answer for the Senate to sit by silently while these crimes are being committed. The ugly, bigoted, and violent underside of some in our country that is reflected by the commission of hate crimes must be combated at all levels of government. 
   For supporters of the Kennedy amendment, Federal leadership necessitates Federal control. I do not subscribe to this view, especially when it comes to this problem. Thus, I oppose Senator KENNEDY's amendment. It proposes that to combat hate crimes Congress should enact a new tier of far-reaching Federal criminal legislation. That approach strays from the foundations of our constitutional structure--namely, the first principles of federalism that for more than two centuries have vested States with primary responsibility for prosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries. 
   As important as this issue is, there is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate crimes is warranted. Indeed, it may be that national enforcement of hate crimes could decrease if States are told the Federal Government has assumed primary responsibility over hate crime enforcement. 
   In addition, serious constitutional questions exist regarding the Kennedy hate crimes amendment. First, the Kennedy amendment, if adopted, would not be a valid exercise of congressional authority under section 5 of the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court has made clear in recent years that legislation enacted by Congress pursuant to section 5 of the 14th amendment may only criminalize action taken by a State. Just last month, the Supreme Court in the recent United States v. Morrison case re-emphasized the State-action requirement that limits Congress' authority to enact legislation under the 14th amendment. The Court stated:  
   Foremost among these limitations [on Congressional power] is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, by its very terms, prohibits only state action. The principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the ..... Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however, discriminatory or wrongful.  
   The Kennedy amendment, however, seeks to prohibit private conduct--crimes of violence committed by private individuals against minorities, religious practitioners, women, homosexuals, or the disabled. It therefore is very similar to the provision of the Violence Against Women Act--a bill I worked very hard to pass, called the Biden-Hatch Act--that sought to prohibit crimes of violence committed by private individuals against women. The Supreme Court in Morrison held that that provision of the Violence Against Women Act was not a valid exercise of congressional power under section 5 of the 14th amendment. 
   To be sure, Congress can regulate purely private conduct under its commerce clause authority. But the Kennedy amendment likely would not be a valid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce clause either. The Supreme Court's 1995 decision in United States v. Lopez, and especially its recent Morrison decision, set forth the scope of Congress' commerce clause power. The Morrison opinion, in particular, changed the legal landscape regarding congressional power in relation to the States. Thus, legislation that was perfectly fine only 2 months ago now raises serious constitutional questions. The Kennedy amendment is not consistent with Lopez and Morrison. 
   Both Lopez and Morrison require that the conduct regulated by Congress pursuant to its commerce clause power be ``some sort of economic endeavor.'' The Court has held that a statute that is ``a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms,'' does not meet constitutional muster. Here, the conduct sought to be regulated--hate crimes--is in no sense economic or commercial, but instead, by its very terms, is non-economic and criminal in nature, just like the conduct Congress sought to regulate in the Gun Free Schools Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act--statutes that were held to be unconstitutional in Lopez and Morrison. 
   In light of the Morrison decision, the Kennedy amendment makes an effort to require a direct link to interstate commerce before the Federal government can prosecute a hate crime based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. It permits Federal hate crimes prosecution in four broad circumstances: No. 1, where the hate crime occurred in relation to interstate travel by the defendant or the victim; No. 2, where the defendant used a ``channel, facility or instrumentality'' of interstate commerce to commit the hate crime; No. 3, where the defendant committed the hate crime by using a firearm or other weapon that has traveled in interstate commerce; and No. 4, where the hate crime interferes with commercial or economic activity of the victim. None of these circumstances provides an appropriate interstate nexus that would make the legislation constitutional. 
   First, the interstate travel requirement of the Kennedy amendment's first circumstance where Federal prosecution would be appropriate does nothing to change the criminal, non-economic nature of the hate crime. 
   The requirement of the second circumstance, that the defendant commit the hate crime by using a channel, facility or instrumentality of interstate commerce, may provide a interstate nexus, but it is unclear precisely what hate crimes that would encompass: hijacking a plane or blowing up a rail line in connection with a hate crime? 
   The third circumstance's requirement that the defendant have used a weapon that traveled in interstate commerce would blow a hole in the commerce clause; Congress could then federalize essentially all State crimes where a firearm or other weapon is used; for example, most homicides. 
   Finally, the fourth circumstance's requirement that the victim be working and that the hate crime interfere with his or her work is analogous to the reasoning the Court rejected in Morrison; that is, that violence against women harms our national economy. In the case of the Kennedy hate crimes amendment, the argument would be that hate crimes harm our national economy and therefore they have a nexus to interstate commerce. The Court in Morrison and in Lopez rejected those ``costs of crime'' and ``national productivity'' arguments because ``they would permit Congress to regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce.'' Finally, the Kennedy amendment's catch-all provision, that the Federal government may prosecute a hate crime only if the crime ``otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce,'' not only merely restates the constitutional test, it misstates the constitutional test. To be constitutional, the conduct must ``substantially affect'' interstate commerce. 
   In addition to its constitutional problems, the Kennedy amendment has other deficiencies. The amendment provides that where the hate crime is a murder, the perpetrator ``shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.'' It does not authorize the death penalty for even the most heinous hate crimes. Accordingly, the horrific dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. on a back road in Jasper, TX, for example, under the Kennedy amendment, would provide only for a life sentence. In the Byrd case, however, State prosecutors tried the case as a capital case and obtained death sentences for the defendants. The Kennedy amendment, then, which purports to provide Federal leadership in the prosecution of hate crimes, would not even provide for the ultimate sentence permitted under duly enacted Texas law. 
   When we asked the Justice Department what type of proof they had that the States are not doing the job, they promised to provide us evidence. I haven't seen it yet. 
   That was quite a while ago. There may be, in the eyes of some, and in my eyes, a great reason to try to make Senator KENNEDY's amendment constitutional, and that is what I tried to do in my amendment in order to do something about this if the States are not doing the job. But to this day, I have not had any information indicating that they are not doing the job. And in the Byrd case, they certainly have. In the Shepard case, they certainly have, just to mention a couple of them. 
   I feel as deeply about hate crimes as Senator KENNEDY or anybody else in  this Chamber. But I want to abide by the Constitution. I recall Justice Scalia's admonition that there should be a presumption that Congress want to enact constitutional legislation, but because of some of the things we are doing, maybe that presumption is unjustified 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment have claimed that it will create a partnership with State and local law enforcement. They have delicately described the legislation as being deferential to State and local authorities as to when the Justice Department will exercise jurisdiction over a particular hate crime. This is hogwash. The amendment does not defer to State or local authorities at all. It would leave the Justice Department free to insert itself in a local hate crime prosecution at the beginning, middle or end of the prosecution, even after the local prosecutor has obtained a guilty verdict. Even if the Justice Department does not formally insert itself into the particular case, it nevertheless will be empowered by the legislation to exert enormous pressure on local prosecutors regarding the manner in which they handle the case--from charging decisions the plea bargaining decisions to sentencing decisions. The Kennedy hate crimes amendment, pure and simple, would expand federal jurisdiction and federalize what currently are State crimes. 
   By contrast, my amendment would address the issue of hate crimes in a responsible, constitutional way--by assisting States and local authorities in their efforts to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It provides for a study of this issue to see if there really are States and local governments out there who, for whatever reason, are not investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. And, it would provide resources to State and local governments that are trying to combat hate crimes but lack the resources to do so. 
   In summary, we must lead--but lead responsibly--recognizing that we live in a country of governments of shared and divided responsibilities. In confronting a world of prejudice greater than any of us can now imagine, President Abraham Lincoln said to Congress in 1862 that the ``dogmas of the quiet past'' were ``inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise--with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.'' 
   In that very spirit, I encourage this body to question the dogma that federal leadership must include federal control, and I encourage this body to act anew by supporting a proposal that seeks to stem hate-motivated crime, while at the same time respecting the primacy states traditionally have enjoyed under our Constitution in prosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries. 
   Ultimately, I believe the approach I have set forth is a principled way to accommodate our twin aims--our well-intentioned desire to investigate, prosecute, and, hopefully, end these vicious crimes; and our unequivocal duty to respect the constitutional boundaries governing any legislative action we take. 
   My proposal should unite all of us on the one point about which we should most fervently agree--that the Senate must speak firmly and meaningfully in denouncing as wrong in all respects those actions we have increasingly come to know as hate crimes. Our continued progress in fighting to protect Americans' civil rights demands no less. 
   Madam President, what the Hatch amendment does in comparison to the Kennedy amendment--and look, like I say, I feel as deeply about this as Senator KENNEDY does, and I respect him for how he feels, and I also respect Senator SMITH from Oregon and the distinguished Senator from Illinois. We are all trying to do the same thing, and that is make sure that hate crimes are prosecuted in our society today. I am very concerned about it, but I am also concerned about meeting the requisites of the Constitution as well. I believe my amendment would do that. I believe it would do it in a far more responsible way than the way the Kennedy amendment does. 
   What the Hatch amendment does is provide for a comprehensive study so we can find out once and for all--we have the Hate Crimes Statistics Act giving us the statistics; it is something that I helped to do years ago along with Senator KENNEDY. That study would help us to find out just what is happening in our society and whether or not the State and local governments are inadequate or incapable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
   Two, we would provide for an intergovernmental assistance program. We provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or other assistance in the criminal investigation or the prosecution of crimes that, one, constitute a crime of violence; two, are a felony under relevant State law; and three, are motivated by animus against the victim by reason of the victim's membership in a particular class or group. 
   My amendment would provide for Federal grants. We authorize the Attorney General, in cases where special circumstances exist, to make grants of up to $100,000 to States and local entities to assist in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. We require grant recipients to certify that the State or local entity lack the resources necessary to investigate or prosecute such crimes. And, we require that the Attorney General shall approve or disapprove grant applications within 10 days of receiving the application. We provide that the Attorney General shall report to Congress on the effectiveness of the program and conduct an audit to assure that the grants awarded are used properly. 
   What we do not do is we do not create a new Federal crime. We do not give the Justice Department jurisdiction over crimes that are motivated because of a person's membership in a particular class or group; that is, the Hatch amendment does not Federalize crimes motivated because of a person's race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. 
   To enact such a broad federalization of hate-motivated crimes would raise serious constitutional concerns. In addition, the Kennedy amendment would federalize all rapes and sexual assaults and, in so doing, would severely burden Federal law enforcement agencies, Federal prosecutors, and Federal courts. My amendment does not authorize Federal interference with State and local investigations and prosecutions. It is not our job to second-guess the investigation and prosecution and sentencing decisions of State and local authorities in cases involving hate crimes. As such, my amendment recognizes the significant efforts of State and local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting all violent crimes, including hate crimes. 
   In other words, my amendment would provide the analysis, study, and data to determine whether or not the States are failing or refusing to combat these horrible crimes. It provides the Government assistance to be able to help the State and local people do their job in these areas. Of course, we provide various other kinds of assistance that could be helpful in this matter.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I respect my colleagues. I think we are all here to try to get at the same problem. I respect Senator KENNEDY for his sincere effort to try to do what is right with regard to civil rights matters generally, and with regard to hate crimes in particular. 
   I feel very much the same way. This is a great country. It is the greatest in the world. We ought to set an example. We ought to do the things that really need to be done. But I think we have to have the facts before we act. I don't think we should federalize crimes. I think this amendment is too broad. 
   We are approaching this in two different ways. I hope we can somehow or other get together to solve this matter in a way that will make sense--that respects the principles of federalism, that respects the States in their efforts to combat hate crimes. Right now, we are not sure there are any States or local jurisdictions out there that are failing or refusing to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. You can cite the James Byrd and Matthew Shepard cases as two illustrations where State authorities have done a tremendous job in prosecuting horrific, hate-motivated crimes. 
   I don't think anybody should have to suffer from hate crime activity. I think my amendment does not go as far as Senator KENNEDY's, but I think it will certainly handle the problem in a way that respects federalism, respects the Constitution, and respects the nine decisions of the Supreme Court over the last 8 years that have reinforced the principle of federalism. In the end, I think my amendment will do what all of us here on the floor would like to see done--promote the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes--in a way that is constitutionally sound. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I haven't said this isn't an issue for the Federal Government. I think it may be. But the point is, we ought to get the facts, and we ought to find out if State and local authorities are failing or refusing to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. We ought first to find out whether State and local authorities are, in fact, denying individuals the equal protection of the laws. So far, the Justice Department has produced precious little evidence to the Judiciary Committee that would indicate  that State and local authorities are abdicating their responsibility to combat hate-motivated crimes. And we asked for the Justice Department to get us this information, if there is any, a long time ago. 
   Yet we have had actually nine decisions by the Supreme Court over the last 8 years reinforcing the principle of federalism--the principle that State governments and the federal government have distinct areas of responsibility. It is true that these Court decisions are, in many instances, 5-4 decisions, which shows again how important the Supreme Court really is in all of our lives. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. I remember the passion when we passed it. There were real concerns whether it would be upheld by the Supreme Court. Part of it was not upheld by the Supreme Court, the part that I was concerned about. But up to that point, I thought there was a chance. 
   But with the Morrison decision, I don't think there is a chance that the Kennedy amendment, as it currently is written, will survive a constitutional challenge. And I think that we ought to at least make an attempt to abide by the Constitution, if nothing else. This is not a matter of States rights. I think there may be a role for the Federal Government. But right now, let's at least get the facts. In the process, we can lend assistance, both financial and otherwise, to the States to help them with these serious problems. 
   I am very grateful for my distinguished colleague and his respectful remarks. They mean a lot to me because I happen to believe he is one of the most articulate Members of this body. I believe he is very sincere. It is true that we agree on much more than just a few things. 
   But I just want to make it clear that my amendment offers a different approach--an approach that I think is constitutional, that will get us there without going through another 2 or 3 years and then having it overruled as unconstitutional and having to start all over again. I know that the amendment I have offered is constitutional. I know we can implement it from day one, without any fear that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court as violative of the Constitution. And I know it will make an impact and really do something about hate crimes, rather than just make political points on the floor. 
   I thank my colleague.

   Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. 
   If I could comment, I believe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts can show that there are hate crimes in our society. I think that he will have a difficult time, however, showing that that State and local prosecutors are unwilling to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. That is why I asked the Justice Department to provide to us data and information on the specific instances where State and local authorities failed or refused to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
   Years ago, under the leadership of Senator KENNEDY and myself, the Senate passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act to collect data on the incidence of hate crimes. We have statistics. I am sure there are hate crimes, but I am not sure there is any evidence to show that these hate crimes are not being prosecuted in the respective States. I'm just not sure. That is one reason I think we should cautiously approach this, rather than approach it in a way that I believe would be unconstitutional. 
   I thank my colleague.

   Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I am having a little bit of difficulty, so I ask how the 13th amendment applies. As I read the 13th amendment, it says, in section 1:  
   Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  
   In section 2:  
   Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  
   How does the Kennedy amendment qualify under the 13th amendment? As I made clear, it doesn't qualify under the 14th amendment because of the arguments I made, pure Supreme Court arguments, that are recent in decision. 
   I missed something on the 13th amendment because that is the amendment that abolished slavery.

   Mr. HATCH. I don't mean to keep interrupting, but as I read that, I can see if what the Senator is after is a hate crime of keeping somebody involuntarily in servitude, but I don't know of many of those today. I am sure that may happen. We are talking about all kinds of hate crimes that certainly don't fit within the 13th amendment. If that is the way we are going to get at it, I think that is a very poor way of getting at a resolution for a hate crime problem. 
   Reading again, section 1:  
   Neither slavery--  
   And I don't know of many instances of slavery in this day and age; in fact, I don't know of any, but there may be some. But we can get them constitutionally, right now, if they do that --  
   nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  
   Section 2:  
   Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  
   If there is such a thing, if there is such a hate crime today as slavery, or involuntary servitude not required because of a due conviction, then we have the absolute power today, federally, to go in and prosecute under the Constitution itself under the 13th amendment. 
   Maybe I am missing something, or maybe I just haven't thought it through or I am too tired. I can't see how the 13th amendment provides a nexus whereby the Kennedy amendment becomes constitutional. It doesn't. In some ways, I wish the Kennedy amendment were constitutional. I worked hard back in those days to pass the Violence Against Women Act. I am working hard right now to pass it again in a form that is constitutional. We thought it was constitutional. I have to say, I had my qualms about it and my qualms proved to be accurate. 
   Today, we know what the Court has said. It has been the principle debate in this country since the beginning. The Court has said that Congress' power in relation to the States is limited. They are 5-4 decisions that are valid and are constitutional. For us to fly in the face of those just because we want to federalize hate crime activity, is, I think, constitutionally improper. That is what worries me. 
   These Supreme Court cases outlining the limits of congressional power under the principle of federalism are quite recent decisions. They are not old-time decisions that have been disqualified or overly criticized. They are decisions that basically advise us of the law right now. 
   I just wanted to make that point because I am concerned: How do you make the Kennedy amendment constitutional? I don't think you can under current law. 
   Now let's face it. If another Court comes in and reverses the nine major federalism decisions that the Supreme Court has handed down in the last few years, and ignores the principle of stare decisis and ignores the principle of federalism, I suppose that at that point you could enact the Kennedy legislation with impunity. But right now, I don't see how you do it if we, as Members of Congress, are trying to exert our influence and our obligation and our oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
   I am sorry to interrupt.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of my colleague. He knows I have great respect for him in regard to civil rights matters. I have great commendation for him. I feel deeply, as he does. However, there is no use kidding about it. I  think we ought to be prudent in the approach that we take. I think we ought to be constitutionally sound as well. 
   In all of the comments of my dear friend, he still hasn't answered this basic question, which is: Can those who are pushing this very broad legislation that would federalize all hate crimes--and all crimes are hate crimes, by the way. I believe that is, if not wholly true, certainly substantially true--but can those who want to enact this broad legislation federalizing all hate-motivated crimes tell me the number of instances, if any, in which State or local authorities have refused or failed to investigate and prosecute hate crimes? If there are any cases in which State or local authorities have refused or failed to investigate and prosecute a hate crime, was it because the State or the local jurisdiction was unwilling, for whatever reason, to bring the prosecution? 
   These questions haven't been answered. We asked them at the hearings, and the Justice Department couldn't answer them. In fact, Deputy Attorney General Holder testified that States and localities should be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of hate crimes. He said:  
   State and local officials are on the front lines and do an enormous job in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes that occur in their communities. In fact, most hate crimes are investigated and prosecuted at the State level.  
   That is the Deputy Attorney General of the United States of America. 
   We have never denied that hate crimes are occurring. Nobody can deny that. I want to get rid of them as much as anybody--certainly as much as the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. 
   But we have yet to hear of specific instances where States have failed or refused to prosecute. We have heard lots of horrific stories about hate crimes from Senators KENNEDY, REID, and DURBIN. But I think they have neglected to finish the story. 
   In each case, the Shepard case and the Byrd case, for example--heinous crimes, no question about it--that should never have occurred; that should have been prosecuted; and were prosecuted. The State prosecutors investigated those cases. They prosecuted the defendants. In the Byrd case, the prosecutors even obtained the death penalty, something that could not be obtained if the Kennedy amendment had been passed and the Federal Government had brought the case. Think about that. I think some crimes are so heinous that the death penalty should be imposed. Certainly the Byrd case, where racists chained James Byrd to a truck and dragged him to death on a back road in Jasper, Texas, warranted the death penalty. But in all of those cases, there ought to be absolute proof of guilt. The crime ought to be so heinous that it justifies the penalty, and there should be no substantial evidence of discrimination. In the Byrd case and the Shepard case, the defendants were fully prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
   The question is not whether hate crimes are occurring. They are. We have them in our society--the greatest society in the world. We have some hate crimes. They are occurring. We all know it. They are occurring, and they are horrific and are to be abhorred. The question, though, is whether the States are adequately fighting these hate crimes, or whether we need to make a Federal case out of every hate-motivated crime. 
   My amendment calls for an analysis of that question. If my amendment passes and causes an analysis of that question, and we 
   conclude that hate crimes are not being prosecuted by the State and local prosecutors, my gosh, I think then we are justified to federalize, if we can do it constitutionally, many of these crimes. 
   A prudent thing, in my view in light of the constitutional questions that are raised by the Kennedy amendment, would be to do the analysis first. 
   But my amendment does more than that. My amendment provides funds to assist State and local authorities in investigating and prosecuting hate-motivated crimes. My amendment provides resources and materials to be able to help States and localities with hate crimes. We are not ignoring the problems that exist. 
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder conceded in his testimony before our committee, and he acknowledged that an analysis of the hate crimes statistics that have been collected needs to be conducted to determine whether State and local authorities are failing to combat hate crimes. Eric Holder testified that the statistics we have are, to use his term, ``inadequate.'' In his testimony, Deputy Attorney General Holder repeatedly argued that the Justice Department should be permitted to involve itself in local hate crime cases where local authorities are ``unable or unwilling to prosecute the case.'' Holder admitted in his testimony that there are ``not very many'' instances--later in his testimony, he said, ``rare instances''--where local jurisdictions, for whatever reason, are unwilling to proceed in cases that the Justice Department ``thinks should be prosecuted.'' 
   At the hearing, I asked Deputy Attorney General Holder if he could identify ``any specific instances in which State law enforcement authorities have deliberately failed to enforce the law against the perpetrator of a crime.'' I asked him a specific question, to give me any specific instances in which State law enforcement authorities have deliberately failed to enforce the law against the perpetrator of a crime. 
   I went further and I asked him, ``So the question is, can you give me specific instances where the States have failed in their duty to investigate and prosecute hate crimes.'' Deputy Attorney General Holder responded with only a handful of specific instances--and they were not instances where the State or local authorities refused to act but instances where the Justice Department felt that it would have tried the case differently or sought a harsher sentence, or where the Justice Department was not pleased with the verdict that State prosecutors obtained. The few cases Holder identified generally were not cases where State officials abdicated their responsibility to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. 
   I have to believe there may be some such cases, but the ones Mr. Holder identified were not persuasive. They did not show any widespread pattern of State and local authorities refusing or failing to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. I am happy to receive them from my distinguished friend from Massachusetts, and I am sure he may be able to cite some. Are there so many of them that we justify federalizing all hate crimes and dipping the Federal nose into everything that is done on the State and local levels? I don't know--in my mind, the case for doing so has not yet been made. 
   Deputy Attorney General Holder also testified that no hate crimes legislation is worthwhile if it is invalidated as unconstitutional. It would be one thing if we were talking about a Supreme Court case that was decided 100 years ago. We are talking about a case, however, the Morrison case, that was decided one month ago and invalidates exactly what Senator KENNEDY is doing today. If we find out that States are refusing to prosecute hate crimes, then we would be justified under the 14th amendment in enacting legislation directed at State officials or people acting under color of law who are denying victims of hate crimes the equal protection of the laws. If that were shown, then we would be justified, especially if such conduct were pervasive, or especially if there were a considerable number of cases where State officials were denying the equal protection of the laws by refusing to prosecute crimes committed against certain groups or classes of people. The supporters of the Kennedy amendment, I have to believe, will be able to come up with one, or two, or maybe three cases where State officials denied the equal protection of the laws in this manner. But even if then can, would that justify federalizing all hate crimes? 
   Mr. President, 95 percent of all criminal activity is prosecuted in State and local jurisdictions--95 percent. There are good reasons for that. Frankly, they do every bit as good a job as Federal prosecutors do. 
   But if you put in ``gender,'' as Senator KENNEDY does in his amendment, then every rape or assault becomes a Federal crime. I can just hear some of the very radical groups demanding that U.S. attorneys in Federal court bring cases in every rape case because every rape, in my opinion, is a hate crime.  However, there is no evidence that the States are not handling those sorts of cases properly. They may be in a better position to handle them well. It may be that the federal government needs to provide enough money, so that as a backup, the DNA postconviction and even preconviction DNA testing can be conducted and we can see that justice is done. 
   I am not unwilling to consider doing that. In fact, I am 
   considering doing just that. I take no second seat to any Senator in this Chamber in the desire to get rid of hate crimes. But I do think you have to be wise and you can't just emotionally do it because you want to federalize things and you want to get control of them, when, in fact, the State and local governments are doing a fairly decent job. If they are not, that is another matter. I want to see the statistics. That is one reason I want a study, an analysis of these matters, so that we can know. 
   Senator KENNEDY and I fought on this very floor for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. I have taken a lot of abuse through the years for having done so by some on the conservative side, and by some on the liberal side for not doing more. We have the statistics. We have a pretty good idea that these crimes are being committed. We just haven't got an analysis, nor do we have the facts, on whether the States are doing an adequate job of combating these crimes. And why should we go blundering ahead, federalizing all these crimes, when we are not really sure that the State and local governments are not doing a good job. In fact, the evidence I have seen appears to show that the States are taking their responsibilities in this area seriously. 
   My amendment does a lot. It calls for a study to determine whether these hate-motivated crimes are not being prosecuted at the State level in the manner that they should be. There are those in our body who even fight against that. I am talking about the Congress as a whole. I hope there is nobody in the Senate who would fight against that. We should do an analysis and a study. We should know. We have the statistics. 
   I do want to clear up one thing. The Department of Justice did send up a handful of cases in which the Department felt the result in hate crime litigation was inadequate. But the very few cases they identified in no way justify this type of expansive legislation. That is what I am concerned about. 
   Now, if we find that the States are refusing to do their jobs, that is another matter. We would be justified under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to enact remedial legislation prohibiting the States from denying our citizens the equal protection of the laws by refusing or failing to combat hate crimes. 
   Supporters of the Kennedy amendment argue that their amendment is limited because the Justice Department could exercise jurisdiction only in four instances. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment call these instances ``exceptions''--as in the Justice Department will not exercise jurisdiction over State prosecutions of hate crimes, ``except'' when one of the four circumstances outlined in the amendment is present. But these so-called ``exceptions'' to the exercise of federal jurisdiction are exceptions that swallow the rule. 
   The Kennedy amendment raises serious constitutional decisions or questions. The amendment is not consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, just decided last month. The amendment attempts to federalize crimes committed because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. 
   Last month's Supreme Court decision in United States v. Morrison changed the legal landscape with regard to congressional power vis-a-vis the States. In light of the Morrison decision, we first should take adequate steps to ensure that legislation is constitutional. And where serious constitutional questions are raised, we should responsibly pursue less intrusive alternatives. In the case of hate crimes legislation, we should at least determine whether a broad federalization of these crimes is needed, and whether a broad federalization of these crimes would be constitutional in light of Morrison. What may have been constitutional in our minds pre-Morrison may not be constitutional today. 
   I was the primary cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. It may never have come up had Senator BIDEN and I not pushed it as hard as we did. I believed it was constitutional at the time, or I wouldn't have done it. But it clearly was stricken as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. 
   As the father of three daughters and a great number of granddaughters, I certainly want women protected in our society. If the State and local governments are not doing that, I will find some way. I think perhaps Senator KENNEDY, I, and others of good faith can find some way of making sure that these wrongs are righted. 
   But Congress has a duty to make sure that legislation it enacts is constitutional. Justice Scalia, as I stated earlier, recently criticized Congress for failing to consider whether legislation is constitutional before enacting it. Here is what he said:  
   My court is fond of saying that acts of Congress come to the court with the presumption of constitutionality. But if Congress is going to take the attitude that it will do anything it can get away with, and let the Supreme Court worry about the Constitution [let the Supreme Court worry] perhaps the presumption is unwarranted.  
   He is saying that we have a constitutional obligation to live within the constraints of the Constitution. Although Morrison was a 5-4 decision, as many important decisions are, it is the supreme law of this land. 
   And the Kennedy approach is unconstitutional. 
   It is unconstitutional because under the 14th amendment it seeks to criminalize purely private conduct. In the Morrison case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that legislation enacted by Congress under the 14th Amendment may only criminalize State action, not individual action. So it really is unconstitutional from that standpoint, from the standpoint of the 14th Amendment. 
   In addition, the Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional under the commerce clause. In Morrison, the Supreme Court emphasized that the conduct regulated by Congress under the commerce clause must be ``some sort of economic endeavor. Here, the conduct sought to be regulated--the commission of hate crimes--is in no sense economic or commercial, but instead is non-economic and criminal in nature. Accordingly, it is just like the non-economic conduct Congress sought to regulate in the Gun Free Schools Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act--statutes held to be unconstitutional in Lopez and Morrison. 
   In an effort to be constitutional, the Kennedy amendment provides that federal jurisdiction can only be exercised in four circumstances where there is some sort of link to interstate commerce. These circumstances, however, probably do not make the amendment constitutional. 
   First, the interstate travel circumstance set forth in the Kennedy amendment arguably may provide an interstate nexus, but it does nothing to change the criminal, generally non-economic nature of a hate crime. The same can be said for the other circumstances set forth in the Kennedy amendment authorizing the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The second circumstance's requirement, that the crime be committed by using a ``channel, facility or instrumentality of interstate'' commerce, also may provide a interstate nexus, but it is unclear precisely what hate crimes that would encompass: hijacking a plane or blowing up a rail line in connection with a hate crime? Such occurrences, if happening at all, surely are so infrequent as to make the Kennedy amendment unnecessary. And I might add, in these cases they have been prosecuted by state and local officials who have the right and power to do so. So there seems little or no reason to want the Kennedy amendment on that basis. But without some economic activity, it still makes you wonder. 
   The third circumstance's requirement that the defendant have used a weapon that traveled in interstate commerce would eviscerate the limits on commerce clause authority the Court stressed in Lopez and Morrison. If using a weapon that happened to have traveled in interstate commerce to commit a hate crime provides a sufficient interstate nexus authorizing congressional action federalizing hate  crimes, then by the same logic Congress could federalize essentially all State crimes where a firearm or other weapon is used. And that would include most homicides had assault cases. 
   The fourth circumstance's requirement that the victim be working and that the hate crime interfere with such working is analogous to the reasoning the Court rejected in Morrison. In Morrison, the Court rejected the argument that gender-motivated violence substantially affects interstate commerce. It can only be presumed that the Court would similarly conclude that violence motivated by disability, sexual 
   orientation or gender--again--does not substantially affect interstate commerce. The Court in Morrison and in Lopez rejected these ``costs of crime'' and ``national productivity'' arguments because they would permit Congress to regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce. 
   Finally, the Kennedy amendment's catch-all provision--that federal prosecution is permitted where the hate crime ``otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce''--not only merely restates the constitutional test, it restates it wrongly. Under Lopez and Morrison, the conduct sought to be regulated under the commerce clause must ``substantially affect'' interstate commerce. The Kennedy amendment provides for a much lower standard. 
   With regard to the first amendment, the Kennedy amendment also has the potential to have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech. Under the amendment, the Federal Government could obtain a criminal conviction on the basis of evidence of speech that had no role in the chain of events that led to any alleged violent act proscribed by the statute. Evidence that a person holds racist or other bigoted views that are unrelated to the underlying crime cannot form the basis for a prosecution--otherwise the statute would be unconstitutional under the first amendment. 
   The Kennedy hate crimes amendment is also bad policy. It would place significant burdens on federal law enforcement and Federal courts, undermine State sentencing regimes, and unduly interfere with State prosecution of violent crime. 
   The Kennedy amendment prohibits hate crimes based upon the victims gender. I mentioned this earlier. Accordingly, the amendment, on its face, could effectively federalize all rapes and sexual assaults. Not only would such a statute likely be unconstitutional, it also would be bad policy. Seizing the authority to investigate and prosecute all incidents of rape and sexual assault from the States could impose a huge burden on Federal law enforcement agencies, Federal prosecutors, and the federal judiciary. 
   I know that the Supreme Court is very concerned about the proliferation of federal crimes, as are all Federal courts in our country. They think we federalize far too many laws when, in fact, the States are doing a good job in prosecuting those crimes. And there is little or no reason for us to intrude that much on State laws when they are doing a good job. 
   Authorities in Jasper, TX, secured a death penalty against the murderers of James Byrd, Jr., without either State or Federal hate crimes legislation. In contrast, the Kennedy amendment does not provide for the death penalty, even in the case of the most heinous hate crimes. Under the Kennedy amendment, then, a State could prosecute the same criminal acts more harshly than under the Kennedy hate crimes amendment. As a result, the Kennedy amendment would provide a lesser deterrent against hate-based criminal conduct. 
   If there was ever a case justifying the death penalty, it certainly was the case of James Byrd, Jr. But then again it makes my point. The State and local prosecutors were fully capable of taking care of this matter. And why should we intrude the Federal Government's unwanted nose under the tent in this matter when the States are perfectly capable of taking care of these matters. 
   The Kennedy amendment also would unduly interfere with state prosecutions of hate crimes. Contrary to claims by supporters of the Kennedy amendment, the amendment would not defer to State or local authorities at all. The amendment leaves the Justice Department free to insert itself in a local prosecution at the beginning, middle or end of the prosecution, and even after the local prosecutor has obtained a guilty verdict. 
   Even if State or local authorities inform the federal government that they intend to prosecute the case and object to Federal interference, the Justice Department, nevertheless, is empowered by the amendment to exert enormous pressure on local prosecutors regarding the manner in which they handle the case, from charging decisions to plea bargaining decisions to sentencing decisions. In essence, the federal government can always exercise jurisdiction under the Kennedy amendment. And in so doing, the Kennedy amendment works an unwarranted expansion of federal authority to prosecute defendants--even when a competent State prosecution is available. 
   In my view, hate crimes can be more sinister than non-hate crimes. A crime committed not only to harm an individual, but out of the motive of sending a message of hatred to an entire community--often a community that historically has been the subject of prejudice or discrimination--is appropriately punished more harshly or in a different manner than other crimes. 
   In Wisconsin versus Mitchell, the Supreme Court essentially agreed that the motive behind the crime can make the crime more sinister and more worthy of harsher punishment. In that case, the Court upheld the State of Wisconsin's sentencing enhancement for hate crimes. 
   There is a limited role for the federal government to play in combating hate crime. The federal government can assist State and local authorities in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. In addition, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, which I sponsored, provides for the nationwide collection of data regarding hate crimes. 
   Because I believe there is a federal role to play, I have introduced legislation, held hearings, and am offering this amendment today. The Federal government has a responsibility to help States and local governments solve our country's problem of hate-motivated crime. 
   But for a federal response to be meaningful, it must abide by the limitations imposed on Congress by the constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. This is especially true today in light of the Supreme Court's decisions in Lopez and Morrison, which emphasized that there are limits on congressional power. The Morrison case was decided just last month and changed the legal landscape regarding congressional power in relation to the States. 
   We should be concerned, as the Supreme Court is, about the proliferation of companion Federal crimes in areas where State criminal statutes are sufficient. The Kennedy amendment would vastly expand the power and jurisdiction of the Federal Government to intervene in local law enforcement matters. 
   Repeatedly, supporters of the Kennedy amendment have argued the State and local authorities are either ``unable or unwilling'' to investigate the prosecute hate crimes. Let's examine this rationale closely. 
   First, the argument that State and local authorities are unable to get serious about hate crimes: I do not dispute that in certain cases the resources of local jurisdictions may be inadequate. We can solve that. But that cannot mean that we therefore should federalize these crimes. That soft-headed logic would lead us to argue that because State and local resources are inadequate to, for example, educate our young people in some parts of the country, then the Federal Government should conduct a nationwide takeover of elementary and secondary education. That, of course, would be the wrong solution. The right solution to a problem involving inadequate resources at the local level is to try to provide some Federal assistance where requested and where needed. That is what my amendment does. 
   If it is not enough money, then let's beef up the money. That is what my amendment does. It provides the monetary means whereby we can assist the States if they do not have the money to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. With regard to postconviction DNA evidence, it may mean we have to do more from a Federal Government standpoint. 
   Second, I have even more difficulty stomaching the second argument put forth by supporters of the Kennedy amendment, that State and local authorities are unwilling to get serious about hate crimes. I admit that I am not certain what the supporters of the Kennedy amendment mean when they say ``unwilling.'' I assume that we all understand and appreciate that in numerous cases State and local officials are unwilling to go forward because the evidence does not warrant going forward. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment cannot possibly mean to cover all of these cases. So what do they mean? A subset of these cases? Does the Federal Government intend to review every case where local officials fail to go forward, second guess their judgments, and then pick and chose on which of those cases they want to proceed? The true answer is that no one knows what supporters of the Kennedy amendment mean when they claim that States are ``unwilling'' to deal with hate crimes. 
   If we want to act responsibly and sensibly, we ought to do what I suggest in my amendment--(1) conduct a comprehensive analysis of whether there, in fact, is unwillingness at the local level in the handling of crimes motivates against persons because of their membership in a particular class or group and (2) provide some grant monies to States who may lack resources. 
   The amendment I have offered does not go as far as legislation I have offered in the past, but this is not because I do not believe that hate crimes are not a problem. Rather, it is because the Supreme Court has ruled as recently as a month ago in this area, and I do not think we can ignore that. The recent decision in Morrison requires that we step back and prudently assess whether legislation like the Kennedy amendment would pass constitutional muster, and I think more than an overwhelming case can be made that it does not. 
   Let's assume that if this amendment is ultimately adopted, and 2 or 3 years from now the Supreme Court decides the case based upon that amendment, and I am right and the Kennedy amendment is overturned, that means we are 3 more years down the line unable to do anything about hate crimes in our society when, if we do the appropriate analysis and get the information and do not walk in there emotionally, and try to give the State and local governments the monetary support and the other types of support we describe in our amendment, we could start tomorrow combating hate crimes at the federal level. The day my amendment is passed doing something about hate crimes, that will really be substantial and will work. It is a throw of the dice if we adopt the Kennedy amendment and that becomes law because I do not believe it can be possibly upheld by the Supreme Court in light of current constitutional law. 
   My amendment is very limited and does not raise the constitutional questions raised by the Kennedy amendment. At the same time, it provides for Federal assistance to State and local authorities in combating hate crimes. 
   With regard to both amendments, I find no fault at all--in fact, I commend my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, my friend from Oregon, and others who are pushing the Kennedy amendment because they believe something has to be done about hate crimes in our society. I find no fault with that. In fact, I admire them for doing that. I find no fault with people trying to write laws, but I do believe we can be 3 years down the line and lose all that time in making headway against hate criminal activity in our society. 
   Where, if we do it right today and do it in a constitutionally sound way, as my amendment does, then we will have truly accomplished something. Perhaps we can get together and find some way of doing this so it brings everybody together; I would like to see all civil rights bills, all bills that involve equal protection under the laws pass unanimously, if we can. I want to work to that end. 
   I pledge to work with my colleagues from Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, and others in this body in trying to get us there. We are all after the same thing, and that is to have a better society so that people realize there are laws by which they have to live, that there are moral laws by which they should live, and that people realize this society has been a great society and will continue to be, the more we are concerned about our fellow men and women and equality under the law. 
   We differ on the ways to get there at this point. Maybe we can get together and find some way of resolving the differences. I find no fault with my colleagues, other than that I think Morrison is so clear, and it was decided only a month ago. I do find fault in that sense, to push an amendment probably is unconstitutional. 
   I find no fault with the motivations behind those supporting the Kennedy amendment. In fact, I am very proud of my colleagues for wanting to do something in this area, to make a difference in our society and help our society be even better. I commend them and thank them for their efforts in that regard, but I do think we ought to do it in a constitutional way. I do think we ought to do it in a thoughtful way. I do think we ought to do it in an analytical way. I do think we ought do it in a way that will bring people together, not split them apart. And I do think we ought to do it in a way that will help State and local prosecutors, rather than Federal prosecutors, to handle these cases in manners that are proper and acceptable in our society. I do think it ought to be done in a way that does not burden our Federal courts with a plethora of cases, in addition to the drug cases burdening our courts today, when State and local governments are totally capable of taking care of it, perhaps with some monetary assistance from the Federal Government. 
   I look forward to finding a way whereby Senator LEAHY and I and others can get together to resolve these problems of postconviction DNA testing because regardless of where one stands on the death penalty, for or against it, that is not the issue. The issue is justice, and that is what the issue is here as well. 
   Does anyone in this body think I like opposing this amendment? I don't think so. I have stood up on too many of these matters for them to think that. But defending the Constitution is more important to me than ``feeling good'' about things or just ``feeling emotional'' about things. I do feel emotionally about hate crimes. I do want to stamp them out. I do want to get rid of them. I want to start now, not 3 years from now when we have to start all over again because the Court rules that the Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional. 
   I have taken enough time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't disagree with the Senator that hate crimes are occurring, but they are being prosecuted by State and local officials. That is the point. Many of the cases --and there aren't a lot of cases that the Justice Department has provided--are cases where the Justice Department felt there should have been a greater remedy and there should have been greater sentencing. But they are not in large measure cases where State refused or failed to prosecute the perpetrators of these horrendous crimes. 
   The fact is, there are not a lot of cases that can be produced, and the Justice Department has not been able to produce them. I don't disagree that hate crimes are occurring and we should stamp them out, but they are being prosecuted by State and local officials to the fullest extent of the law. The Federal Government may disagree on how they prosecute sometimes, but the fact is, they are being prosecuted. No one has shown, certainly not the Justice Department, that these truly horrific crimes are not being prosecuted, let alone on a large scale. The fact is, they are being prosecuted. 
   The cases identified by the Justice Department, a handful of cases, were in large measure cases where State officials, investigators, and prosecutors got verdicts and sentences. In other words, they were brought and verdicts and sentences were obtained. The Federal Government would have tried the cases differently or might have sought a higher or more harsh sentence. But they are not cases where the State refused to prosecute a hate crime. 
   My colleague is right: We should do everything in our power to stop hate  crimes in our society. But no one to this date has been able to show that there is a widespread, endemic failure at the State level to prosecute these crimes. There is no real evidence that the States are being slovenly in their duties. That is one reason why I think it is very important that we objectively analyze these matters. We will have more time to debate this, hopefully a little more time tomorrow. 
   Finally, when Mr. Holder, the Deputy Attorney General, appeared before the committee, he could not cite one case, not a single case. After a month of research, the Justice Department came up with a handful of cases. That was it. Not because they weren't prosecuted at the State level, they were. They just differed with the way they were prosecuted. That is not good enough. These are some of the things that bother me. 
   I am willing to work with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and the distinguished Senator from Oregon and others who want to do something. If the amendment I am offering is not good enough, I am willing to work to see if we can find something that will bring us together and do a better job, certainly, to stamp out any type of hate criminal activity. But I am very loathe to federalize all crimes so that the Federal Government can second-guess State and local prosecutors every time a criminal activity occurs. I think one could say in many respects all crimes are hate crimes, even though they are not categorized as such now. They are prosecuted, and that is the important thing. 
   Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent, unless there is anyone else who desires to speak. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't mean to prolong this, but in the handful of cases they don't like what happened. In that case, I may agree with the Senator that there should have been a verdict against the defendants, but a jury in the United States found otherwise. That doesn't mean we should federalize all hate crimes. That is what I am concerned about. 
   I will just put forth my offer to work with the Senator to see if we can find some way of bringing everybody together in a way that will not intrude the Federal Government into all the local and State prosecutions in this country, which certainly the Senator's amendment would do. That is what I am concerned about. We will chat overnight and talk about it and see what we can do.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman, the senior Senator from Alaska, and the ranking minority, the senior Senator from Hawaii, for their long and effective leadership in evolving the Defense Health Program. The Senate bill added nearly $700 million to the President's request, funding the total Defense Health Program at $12.1 billion for FY01. And, of great importance to me and many other members of this body, the Committee has once again committed the Department of Defense's medical science capabilities to the management  of a major cancer research program, extending to breast, prostate, cervical, lung, and other cancers. There is over $330 million in this bill dedicated to cancer-related research. 
   I would like to bring to the attention of the distinguished chairman and the ranking minority member an important area of cancer research--the investigation of genealogical and genetic databases that can uncover medical precursors to cancer in humans. My state of Utah has a history of genealogical research that is known to the millions of Americans who routinely visit the family history websites that originate from Utah. But millions of Americans are also potentially benefiting from a lesser known program. This program is currently developing a genealogical database that will help identify and predict genetic structures associated with the development and, hopefully, prevention of, cancer. 
   Mr. President, I wish to make you aware of the Utah Population Database which if a very promising development in the area of genealogical research related to cancer. This data base is housed at the University of Utah where scientists are learning to use this unique comprehensive genealogical set of data to help predict, detect, treat, and prevent cancer. I am therefore asking the distinguished chairman and ranking minority member to support the continued development and use of the Utah Population Database by increasing the University of Utah's program for genealogical cancer research in the coming fiscal year by an additional $12.5 million.

   Mr. HATCH. I join Senator BIDEN this afternoon. We passed the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994. He deserves a great deal of credit for that. I would like to move forward with the passage of the violence against women reauthorization this year. 
   For almost 10 years, I have stood with my colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, on this particular issue. He and I have worked for almost a year  now to try to resolve any disagreements regarding specific provisions in our respective bills on this issue, S. 245 and S. 51. 
   What we want to do is combat violence against women. I believe we have a good product. It is the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of the year 2000. 
   I have committed to Senator BIDEN that we plan to move this legislation in the Judiciary Committee. I plan to have it on the committee markup for next week. Now, any member of the committee can put it over for a week. I hope they will not. Before the Fourth of July recess, I hope we can pass the bill out of the Judiciary Committee. Hopefully, the leadership will allow us some time on the floor to debate it. It is a very important piece of legislation. 
   Millions and millions of women, men, and children in this country will benefit by the passage of this bill. I am going to do everything in my power to help Senator BIDEN in getting it passed.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, first, I want to make it perfectly clear that I strongly support reforming the managed care system. I was an original cosponsor of S. 300, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act of 1999 and voted in favor of S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights which was approved by the Senate last July. 
   The House-Senate conference committee is currently working out the differences between the managed care bills passed by the House and the Senate. I believe this conference committee is making significant progress. So, not only is it premature for us to vote today on the House-passed managed care bill in the midst of these negotiations. I also do not feel that the DOD authorization debate is the appropriate time for us to be considering such important health care legislation. 
   We are all aware of the public's frustration and the need for effective legislation to guarantee that those enrolled in managed care plans receive quality health care. Over the years, the Congress has held numerous hearings exposing story after story regarding people receiving insufficient medical treatment from their managed care  plans. And let me assure you that these stories are deeply troubling to me--that's why Congress is addressing this important issue. We are listening to our constituents and we are taking action. 
   There is one point where all of us agree--people deserve to receive the best care possible when they are sick. I believe that when the conference committee has completed its work, this important goal will 
   become a reality. None of us think that someone should be turned away from medical treatment because his health plan won't cover it. Our legislation provides patients the ability to appeal these types of decisions, quickly, by offering both internal and external appeals processes. It is my hope that by providing these options, people will receive quality health care, in a timely fashion, when they need it the most. 
   All of us in this chamber know very well there are numerous competing bills that have been introduced over the years that provide a variety of legislative remedies to address this issue. In many respects, these bills have common components intertwined with similar, and, in some cases, identical provisions. Approximately 47 bills were introduced in the Senate and the House last year to provide patient protections to managed care enrollees. 
   So it is obvious that we all are concerned about this issue--we all want patients to receive the best care possible. 
   However, for Congress to pass responsible managed care legislation, we must come together and put forth the best bill for the American people. We have done this many times before on health care legislation, and there 
   is no reason why we cannot do this again. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts is trying to preempt this process. He has offered an amendment that flies in the face of every effort we have made to achieve that consensus. 
   There can be nothing more to this amendment than its public relations value, since it surely will not pass in the Senate. We have spent hours and hours and hours on the Senate floor, in conference, and in the back rooms of the Capitol on this legislation. 
   The Senator knows well why the Dingell-Norwood approach will not pass. He knows it is likely to cause health insurance premiums to rise and, as a direct result, cause employers to drop their health plans. He knows this will lead to higher numbers of uninsured Americans. And, he knows that this is an unacceptable outcome. 
   I remain hopeful that, in the end, we will reach consensus on this bill. I commend senator NICKLES for his fine work and leadership as chairman of the House-Senate conference committee and urge my colleagues to support the conferees and let them continue their work.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as somebody who lived through the last BRAC process, and lived through it in a very intensive way, I have to say the process did not work. Everyone lost: the taxpayers, the workers in Utah, as well as those in the losing states of California and Texas, and the Air Force's state of military readiness. The process was too politicized, as I elaborate upon in my later remarks. It was a pitiful exercise, in many respects. 
   There were some good things about it, I have to acknowledge, but most of it was not. 
   Utah had the Air Force's highest rated air logistics command in the nation, bar none. Nobody could compare with it. It was listed No. 1. It made the top of every chart. The workforce and its achievements were models of efficiency. But, after the President finished tampering with the BRAC results, we had to fight like dogs against raging wolves to prove repeatedly what the BRAC had already determined. 
   No sooner did we get through all that process--time after time appearing at hearings, appearing at major meetings considering BRAC, and considering what should be done, making our case over and over, and winning, winning, winning--this administration came in and immediately undertook questionable steps to sully the BRAC process. 
   My experience gives me little confidence in this process. And it's not done yet: we won't have the process completed until late 2001, six years after the BRAC decision. I do not care who is in charge. When you politicize the base closing process, it just leads to the type of anquish I and my colleagues are expressing here today. 
   How can we forget the major problems between San Antonio and McClellan, both of which were installations important to their respective States but did not reach the high standards of Utah's Hill Air Force Base. If Hill Air Force Base had come in last, I would not be here arguing today, nor back then, to keep it alive. 
   Let's not forget that we need high military readiness--it is a deterrent that allows for peace through strength. But that means having a system that accentuates everything that is good about our military, like Hill Air Force Base. I would not back a base that was not doing the job. 
   But in this particular case, McClellan had been judged by the Air Force and the BRAC commssion as deficient, as was the San Antonio Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. Yet, we wanted to help Kelly, if we could, because it had a high percentage of Hispanic workers. But the brutal facts showed that Kelly could not measure up. Neither did McClellan. 
   Then came the administration's misguided and downright wrongful attempts to save some of those jobs. 
   Mr. President, Ronald Reagan immediately comes to mind when I consider today's debate on BRAC ..... ``Here we go again.'' We're being asked to engage in the same type of taxpayer deception that characterized the 1995 BRAC. We promise savings, and deliver nothing. All BRAC produces is a politicized outcome that makes a mockery of the independent commission process. 
   We need to remind ourselves why we sought a BRAC in the first place: It was because we did not feel Congress could be trusted. In fact, it was the President who couldn't be trusted. Let's look at some facts, facts especially painful to states which lost bases, and those that had to defend what they had won again, again and again. I refer to Utah's Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill AFB--three times we had to compete for workloads that the BRAC awarded us, but which the President delayed sending to Utah. 
   The President intervened in the BRAC 95 process to secure California's 54 electoral votes in the 1996 election. My good friends from California--Senators BOXER and FEINSTEIN--publicly stated that they would get relief from the White House after BRAC decided to close McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento. They succeeded, and at the cost of work that ought to have gone to Georgia and Utah, but which was delayed. 
   The President called the BRAC decision to close McClellan an ``outrage'', in a Rose Garden statement. He actually rejected the decision of his own independent commission. In its place, the President put great pressure on the Air Force to sully an already messy situation. He called this ``privatization in place.'' He attempted to keep the jobs which were intended to be distributed to Utah, Oklahoma and Georgia in California by forcing a public-private competition that GAO rejected as unfair. It had the effect of leaving in California as many as 3,200 jobs for as long as six years after the BRAC decision, or conveniently after the year 2000 presidential election. 
   The BRAC monies designated to move jobs and equipment to Utah and elsewhere were mismanaged. They were spent to improve the very facilities at McClellan AFB that the BRAC had intended to close! This, the President and his gang thought, would make it easier for the base to attract private contractors to perform the privatized work in place. 
   The delay caused by this contrived competition cost the taxpayers an additional $500 million, according to GAO, to sustain the bases' workloads in place, despite the decision of BRAC to ship the workloads to the other Air Force depots. 
   In May 1998, as many of you will remember, the Secretary of the Air Force was embarrassed by a memo written by his office urging that the Lockheed-Martin bid for the California work win the award. This behavior, to my mind, remains one of the most egregious violations of the Ethics Reform Act I have seen in my 24 years in the Senate. This act prohibits precisely the type of collusion in which the Secretary of the Air Force participated. 
   It was so outrageous that Secretary Bill Cohen, to his everlasting credit, removed the Secretary of the Air Force from the selection team that would oversee the public-private competition for the McClellan workload. 
   But this was not the end of the Clinton Administration's meddling: they directed the Air Force to deny the GAO, the congressional watchdog agency responsible for overseeing the expenditure of taxpayers' funds, access to the cost-data and other information used by the Air Force to put together competition for the McClellan workload. 
   As might be expected, the long-term effect of this mischievous meddling had a cost on readiness. Delays in workload transfer were directly responsible for a severe F-16 parts shortage in 1999. Also, there is a suspicious relationship between the delayed workload transfer and the KC-135 tanker problems early this year when the fleet was grounded because of a rear stabilizer malfunction, a problem akin to the cause of the Alaskan Airline aircraft off the California coast. My personal inquiry into the KC-135 issue demonstrated that if the entire KC-135 team responsible for  the repair of this part of the aircraft had been transferred to Utah in a timely way, as directed by the BRAC, the design flaw would probably never have occurred. 
   There is an answer to BRAC: let Congress endorse the decisions of the military services, without the filter of presidential intervention, whether by a BRAC-like commission or any other procedure. The military services know better than any other body the best and the worst of their installations, the ones that pay their own way, and the ones that drain the taxpayers' pockets. After my state's experience with the BRAC process, I am more inclined to trust this body to evaluate the services' recommendations. 
   I see that we have a very important guest. I will be happy to yield the floor at this time for Senator HELMS.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation intended to start us on the path to a simpler, more rational, and fairer federal tax system. The bill I am introducing in the Senate today, the Tax Ease and Modernization Act--Part I (TEAM-I), is designed to be the first of several installments to incrementally transform the Internal Revenue Code into a revenue collection device that is more efficient, more responsive to the needs of taxpayers, more able to help this nation compete in a global marketplace, and most importantly, much easier to understand, comply with, and administer. 
   I realize that this is a tall order. I also believe that such a transformation cannot occur overnight. This is why my plan calls for incremental action through a multi-year plan--a plan that we can start implementing this year rather than waiting for consensus to develop around a fundamental tax reform approach that centers on a flat tax, a national consumption tax, or some hybrid system. 
   As I said on this floor on April 4, 2000, when I announced this plan, I recognize the need for a new paradigm in taxation for this country. I believe our Internal Revenue Code is fundamentally flawed and needs to be replaced with a new system. But such a new tax code will require years of presidential leadership, public education, and an intelligent transition from the current system. 
   In the meantime, we should not wait for an elusive tax Utopia to come along and remove the immediate need for improvements to the Internal Revenue Code. We should begin to act now, and do what we can to make our current system better in the short run. This is what my plan is all about. 
   Mr. President, the bill I introduce today begins this transformation process by repealing or repairing some of the most complex and unfair provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, it does so in a balanced way, with relief from complexity for every classification of taxpayer--low-income and high income individuals, school teachers and chief executive officers, members of neighborhood investment clubs and high rollers, small businesses and sprawling multinationals, people with IRS problems and families with foster children. The goals are to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for everyone. 
   Because the Internal Revenue Code is so riddled with complexity at every level, attempting to eliminate it all at once would be difficult at best. Therefore, this bill focuses on solving several of the largest problems affecting millions of taxpayers, then supplements these features with a number of smaller provisions that may appear relatively minor, but as a whole add a tremendous amount of complexity, unfairness, or hassle for many taxpayers, as well as for the Internal Revenue Service.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, to introduce the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act. I am pleased that we are being joined by Senators ROCKEFELLER, ROBB, CHAFEE, and BRYAN as original cosponsors. 
   This bill is an outgrowth of S. 1003, the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act of 1999, which was sponsored by many of the same sponsors of this year's bill. And, like S. 1003, the bill we are introducing today is designed to achieve two vital goals--reduce our dependency on foreign oil and reduce air pollution from motor vehicles. 
   While the goals of both of these bills are the same, Mr. President, the Alternative Fuels Incentive Act takes a similar, but more comprehensive approach to achieving them. 
   There is a little dispute that our growing dependency on imported oil is dangerous, not only to our continued economic growth, but also to our national security. We are witnessing again this year just how volatile the price of gasoline and other motor fuels are and how decisions made by oil producers far from our shores affect the everyday lives of all Americans. As we increase our dependence of energy from others nations, we are literally placing our future in the hands of foreign entities. Yet, we are stymied at every turn in trying to significantly increase the discovery and development of new domestic sources of oil. 
   At the same time, we continue to face serious air quality challenges from our almost exclusive use of conventional fuels for motor vehicles. Just in my home state of Utah, transportation vehicles account for 87 percent of carbon monoxide emissions, 52 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions, 34 percent of hydrocarbon emissions, and 22 percent of coarse particulate matter in the air. All of these emissions can be harmful to individuals suffering from chronic respiratory illnesses, heart disease, asthma, and other ailments. 
   More than just harming our health, however, these emissions detract from the natural beauty of our country. Furthermore, as the United States grows in population and dependency on automobile transportation, these problems will only become worse unless something is done to turn the tide. 
   Fortunately, Mr. President, answers to both problems exist. Vehicle technology using domestically plentiful and clean-burning alternative fuels have advanced to the point that, if widely adapted by Americans, we could reverse the course on both foreign dependence and clean air. The challenge is in getting over the hurdle of initial acceptance of the new technologies by the American public. 
   In essence, there are currently three market barriers to this initial acceptance of alternative fuels vehicles by Americans--the incremental cost of the vehicles over conventionally-fueled vehicles, the cost of the fuel, and the lack of convenient fueling stations. Providing incentives--not mandates--to overcome all three of these barriers is what this bill is all about. 
   Mr. President, the bill addresses the first barrier--the extra cost of the alternative fuels vehicles--by providing a tax credit for a portion of the difference in cost. This is key component of the bill that was lacking in S. 1003. By bringing the cost of these vehicles within the range where savings on the cost of the alternative fuel will make owning these vehicles economically viable over the life of the vehicle, public acceptance of the technology should rapidly increase. Once this occurs, production economies of scale will bring the price of the vehicles down further. 
   The bill addresses the second and third market barriers, that of fuel cost and availability, by providing tax credits for the alternative fuels and tax benefits for suppliers who decide to sell it to the public. This is important because the ready availability of the fuel in all geographic locations where the public needs to go or to send goods is key to their acceptance of alternative fuels vehicles. These tax benefits, when combined with the market effect caused by the demand for more fueling stations created by the purchase of more vehicles, will help ensure that such stations will appear where people need them. 
   Mr. President, the incentive approach taken by this bill is meant to provide a temporary bridge over these barriers. If this approach works, the tax incentives will not be needed in the long run. This is why we have placed a seven-year sunset on these provisions. At the end of this period, Congress should take a close look at how well these incentives worked and how the market has developed. 
   There is little doubt that sooner or later this Nation will have to turn to alternative fuels to help solve the two problems I mentioned earlier. I believe it should be sooner and the move should be incentive-based and market-driven. The bill we are introducing today can create the momentum to get us to a cleaner and more secure America much sooner. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, as well as my distinguished colleagues Senators WELLSTONE, GRAMS, KOHL and GRASSLEY, for their leadership and effort on behalf of the Hmong veterans and in support of this legislation. Also, I  would like to make special mention of Senator KOHL's critical role in bringing all parties together and in negotiating this compromise. Senator KOHL's role truly was pivotal. 
   With respect to Senator GRAMS, I would like to point out my appreciation for all that he has done to assist the Hmong veterans and their families in Minnesota. 
   I also appreciate very much the efforts of the Lao Veterans of America with their national recognition ceremonies for the Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army and the monument that they dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery. 
   Mr. President, it is important to state that a negative inference should not be drawn from the fact that in moving this legislation through the Senate today, the Senate has amended the bill to eliminate specific mention of any one organization. In fact, the distinguished organization mentioned in the original House legislation was cited because of its role in developing, organizing and keeping records regarding the service of Hmong and Lao veterans who served with U.S. military and covert forces in Laos during the Vietnam War. It, along with other such organizations, may be helpful in providing input for the naturalization of the Hmong veterans and their families.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I oppose Senator DASCHLE's gun control resolution on the military construction appropriations bill. Rather than move forward on this important appropriations bill, some of my colleagues are trying to breathe life into their gun control agenda. 
   I think it needs to be made very clear that nothing this President has proposed and nothing that the million moms have proposed would have prevented Columbine; West Paducah, KY; Jonesboro; State of Washington, or Hawaii--none of those incidents. This is being done for political purposes, not because there is any real logic behind it. 
   I was disturbed to learn that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's national instant criminal background check system malfunctioned last week, thereby preventing background checks of gun buyers. As a result of the Government's error, gun sales throughout the Nation were halted from last Thursday through Sunday. Meanwhile, existing Federal gun laws are not being enforced, and the Clinton administration appears to be allowing the national instant check system to fall into disrepair. As a matter of fact, they have never fully implemented it, even though we gave them that charge a number of years ago. 
   During the debate on the Brady bill, the Clinton administration promised the American people an instant background check system, and we all agreed with having that system to get the real criminals in our society and to keep guns away from them. Indeed, I have worked hard to make such a system a reality. Unfortunately, as we have seen all too often, the NICS system is not instant for many Americans who wish to purchase firearms. As a result, many firearms-owning Americans are suspicious of the Federal Government's attempt to regulate firearms. Last week's collapse of the NICS system, which occurred during the Million Mom March, only increases this distrust. 
   As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am announcing hearings today on the problems associated with the NICS system and how Congress can compel this administration to administer the system adequately. 
   We will hold hearings on this. One thing is clear about last week's collapse: had the Lautenberg Amendment been enacted into law, all sales--even private sales--would have been barred at gun shows. 
   The Clinton Administration, and many of my Democratic colleagues, call for more gun control, but they do not administer or enforce existing laws and programs. There are literally thousands of federal, state, and local firearm laws presently in existence. President Clinton spends a great deal of time at press conferences on gun control. Meanwhile, his Administration cannot even operate the NICS system adequately. 
   Not only does the Clinton Administration fail to administer the NICS system adequately, it fails to prosecute existing gun crimes. For example, compare the following federal gun laws to the Clinton Administration's prosecution record: 
   It is a federal crime to possess a firearm on school grounds. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight cases under this law in 1998, even though more than 6,000 students brought guns to school. The Clinton Administration prosecuted only five such cases in 1997. 
   It is a federal crime to transfer a firearm to a juvenile. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases under this law in 1998 and only five in 1997. 
   It is a federal crime to transfer or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only four cases under this law in 1998 and only four in 1997. 
   It is a federal crime for a person who has been adjudicated mentally ill to possess a firearm. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only five cases under this law in 1998 and only four in 1997. 
   It is a federal crime for a person who has been dishonorably discharged to possess a firearm. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only two cases under this law in 1998 and no cases in 1997. 
   Worse yet, the Clinton Administration has failed to prosecute even the most serious gun crimes. Between 1992 and 1998, prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the upcoming hearing on the NICS system. My colleagues in the Senate should work with me to encourage this Administration to administer and enforce the existing laws before we even consider additional laws. 
   Additionally, we are talking about an enumerated right in the Constitution. And we should be very careful before we start playing around with the enumerated right. Unfortunately, some people think they can make political hay for this matter, and they are going to do everything they can to make that political hay. I have heard arguments here on the floor that are not justified under any terms. 
   It is time for us to enforce the laws that are on the books. There are some 20,000 laws, rules, and regulations against misuse of firearms, against the criminal use of firearms, against all other things I have been talking about, and this administration has not been serious about enforcing those laws. When they get serious about that, maybe they can come in less hypocritical and talk about some changes that both sides can get together on and do something about rather than having these phony approaches toward politics rather than the consideration of the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms. 
   Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to urge my colleagues to support a bill, the Mortgage Cancellation Act of 2000, that I am introducing along with Senator KERREY. This bill would fix a flaw in the tax code that unfairly harms homeowners who sell their home at a loss. 
   Often, homeowners who must sell their home at a loss are able to negotiate with their mortgage lender to forgive all or part of the mortgage balance that exceeds the selling price. However, under current tax law, the amount forgiven is taxable income to the seller. 
   For example, suppose a young family purchased their home for $150,000 with a $130,000 mortgage, $120,000 of which is still outstanding. Let us also assume that there is an economic downturn that has both decreased the value of the house to $110,000 and put this family in financial distress because the primary wage earner has lost his or her job. Because the family is no longer able to meet their mortgage payments, they are forced to sell their home for $110,000, $10,000 below the value of the mortgage, with the condition that the lender will forgive this difference. Unfortunately, under current tax law, this family will have to recognize this $10,000 difference as taxable income at a time when they can least afford it. This is true even though the family suffered a $40,000 loss on the sale. 
   Mr. President, I find this predicament both ironic and unfair. If this same family, under much better circumstances, was able to sell their house for $200,000 instead of $110,000, then they would owe nothing in tax on the gain under current tax law because gains on a principal residence are tax exempt up to $500,000. I believe that this discrepancy creates a tax inequity that begs for relief. 
   Finally, I want to stress that now is the time to address the inequity, while the economy is healthy, instead of waiting for the next recession, when this problem will be much more common. Luckily, the problem addressed by this bill is not widespread in our country right now. However, a few years ago, many families in my home state of Utah suffered losses on the necessary sale of their homes, and had to pay taxes on the canceled mortgage debt. Families in other areas of our nation experienced similar problems. 
   So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join with Senator KERREY and me in support of this bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the trade bill before us represents a milestone in U.S. trade policy. This bill, and especially the African Growth and Opportunity Act found at Title I, acknowledges the social, health, and political problems as well as the economic challenges facing a group of states, most of which are developing nations. 
   It is not that our trade policies have not concerned themselves with developing countries before--that commitment is evident in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and many other trade initiatives. However, this bill is unique in many ways. 
   First, we are acknowledging that the mere existence of a trade agreement does not produce immediate results. The strength of a society and its polity profoundly affect the development of the capabilities that allow for globalization. Developing countries, for example, need investment, but prudent companies do not commit their resources unless some very fundamental conditions exist, conditions that exceed those addressed in the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization. 
   The bill before us does that. We underscore the importance of political stability; we provide opportunities for technical assistance that can create a banking and legal structure to repatriate profits and to protect the sanctity of the contract. 
   Second, we acknowledge that there are regionally specific social and health issues that are preconditions to real economic development--what I refer to as ``trade enablement.'' Most Sub-Sahara African (SSA) states have been left behind. Their colonial and post-colonial societies have not, for the most part, melded into a modern, unified state. Nor have these societies produced the type of workforce that trade demands--educated, technically skilled, and healthy workers. 
   The bill before us deals this reality, too, and in several ways. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I believe we should do what we can to help restore our African partners to the world baseline standard of good health. With 20-30 percent HIV/AIDS infection among the adult populations in some states, few firms will risk hiring a workforce in which one-in-three to one-in-five workers may not be alive, let alone working in five years. I agree with President Clinton's comments that Africa, too, needs to do more to control this problem. But this bill provides incentives. 
   Not only are these efforts to improve health in this region good economics and good politics, but they are also simply the right thing to do. We are the richest nation in the world. It has always been a part of the American character to help those who are suffering and to improve conditions where we can. 
   Worker education also faces immense challenges. Literacy rates have risen to 59 percent, but that level lags comparable literacy rates in East Asia (84 percent), Latin America (83 percent) and the Caribbean (83 percent). Once more, the incentives provided by this bill to create an investment climate, will awaken African governments to the need for programed improvements in literacy and technical training. And, through the newly created economic forum under this bill, conditions can be put in place for technical assistance. 
   Mr. President, it is undeniable that this bill is a hybrid. It is not a conventional trade bill, because Africa, with the exception of a few states like South Africa, Gabon, and Mauritius, is not positioned to gain immediate or even mid-term benefits unless, and I repeat, unless, trade is coupled with the forms of assistance and incentives that this bill provides. 
   But it is no less deniable that great benefits will be potentially available to both the U.S. and Sub-Saharan Africa if the underlying concept in this bill materializes. 
   For the United States, Africa is a warehouse of badly needed strategic materials which will open new sources of supply for U.S. producers. Moreover, if properly developed, this market will benefit the entire population of an African state, rather than a few, often corrupt elites. 
   It is a fundamental axiom of every trade theory that the economic evolution of trading partners produces rolling prosperity--which is another way of saying that prosperity raises all boats. Not only does this phenomenon promise future markets for U.S. goods, services, and agricultural products, but also a more prosperous, politically stable African continent, which, in turn, produces other foreign policy and national security benefits for the U.S. It creates international partners in this region that have a stake in world peace, disease controls, as well as other initiatives to combat terrorism, international crime, labor force abuses, and environmental degradation. 
   I believe that this Africa Trade bill will have a broad range of benefits for America, and I will support this legislation. I want to compliment Senator ROTH, Senator GRASSLEY, and other Senators who worked so diligently on this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday Senator KENNEDY asked me about the source of one of the statistics I quote during the debate on S. 2. I am pleased to provide the Senator from Massachusetts with the source for my statistics. 
   During the 105th Congress, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation of the Committee on Education and the Workforce prepared an excellent report, entitled, ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' I am pleased to share an excerpt from it with my colleagues. This report concludes that:  
   One of the main problems with delivering federal education aid to states and communities through such a vast array of programs is the added cost of paperwork and personnel necessary to apply for an keep track of the operations of each of these programs. Many of the costs are hidden in the burdens placed on teachers and administrators in time and money to complete federal forms for this multitude of overlapping federal programs. 
   In 1996, Governor Voinovich of Ohio noted that local schools in his state had to submit as many as 170 federal reports totaling more than 700 pages during a single year. This report also noted that more than 50 percent of the paperwork required by a local school in Ohio is a result of federal programs--this despite the fact that the federal government accounts for only 6 percent of Ohio's educational spending. 
   The Subcommittee has attempted to quantify the number of pages required by recipients of federal funds in order to qualify for assistance. Without fully accounting for all the attachments and supplemental submissions required with each application, the Subcommittee counted more than 20,000 pages of applications. 
   So how much time is spent completing this paperwork? In the recently released strategic plan of the Department of Education, the administration highlights the success of the Department in reducing paperwork burdens by an estimated 10 percent--which according to their own estimates accounts for 5.4 million man hours in FY 97. If this statistic is accurate, it would mean that the Department of Education is still requiring nearly 50 million hours worth of paperwork each year--or the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full-time. [page 15]  
   Mr. President, this paper chase, as I suggested yesterday, has our nation's teachers and administrators spinning their wheels on the requirements of a federal education bureaucracy instead of concentrating on teaching and meeting the needs of students. Our educational system has been taken over by a federally driven emphasis on form rather than substance. 
   While I commend Secretary Riley's 10 percent reduction effort, we need to go much further in order to put our education emphasis where it needs to be--in classrooms, not on process requirements. I am committed to helping reduce the amount of paperwork teachers and administrators must fill out. S. 2 goes a long way to easing this burden.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, next month, friends, associates and colleagues will gather at Utah State University to honor Mr. Marvin G. Fifield, a remarkable man whose entire professional career has been devoted to improving the lives of those with learning or developmental disabilities. While I stand in tribute to my friend of many years, it is his body of work over the span of forty-four years that does him honor. 
   At his retirement on July 1, Dr. Fifield will have served as the founder and Director of the Center for Persons with Disabilities for thirty-three years. He wrote the grant application, saw it funded, and directed the creation of the center. But it is not the Center alone that owes its existence to Dr. Fifield. Over a thirty year period, he succeeded in writing, achieving the approval and funding for over fifty projects, with combined grants exceeding $60 million. Without his skilled direction, numerous regional mental health centers, rehabilitation and vocational services, studies and workshops would not now be available. The Navajo Initiative in the Developmental Disabilities program, the Indian Children's Program, and the Native American Initiative program all owe their start to this man. 
   Dr. Fifield's chairmanship and membership in professional and community service organizations bridges more than three decades and forty organizations. To this day he chairs or serves on eight boards, including serving as Chairman of the Hatch Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy. He also serves on the innovative Assistive Technology Work Group. Marv was the first to champion assistive technologies for people with disabilities--or at least I think he was the first because he was the first to tell me about this exciting field. Assistive technology comprises all devices that improve the functional capabilities of those individuals with disabilities. 
   Marv Fifield is so accomplished that his curriculum vitae is not so much measured in pages as in pounds. 
   In academe, an individual's worth is often measured by how widely they have been published. Dr. Fifield has published seventeen books, chapters in books, or monographs; he has published twelve refereed journal articles and seven non-referenced journal articles; he has published seven technical papers; he has submitted ten testimonies and reports to congressional and Senate subcommittees; published twenty-three final reports and research reports; authored eleven instructional products, and has authored ninety-one selected unpublished conference papers. 
   Dr. Fifield has been a consultant to both national and international organizations including the World Health Organization. Among the richly deserved honors bestowed upon him, he is the recipient of the Leone Leadership Award, the highest honor an administrator can receive. He was presented the Maurice Warshaw Outstanding Service Award by the Governor of the State of Utah and was twice called to serve as a staff member on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
   Since 1981, Marv Fifield has provided leadership for my Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy. The Disability Advisory Committee has become a model for encouraging constructive dialogue among diverse interests and points of view. The committee has often been able to develop consensus recommendations, which have helped me a great deal over the years. I am most grateful to Marv for all his efforts with the committee. 
   I want to wish him well as he enters the next chapter in his already full life. I hope he will find retirement rewarding. But, if he thinks he can escape consulting with me and those in Utah who rely on his quiet and good-natured leadership to achieve consensus on matters of importance in disability policy, he can forget it. I am here to announce that we are not letting him off the hook. We need the benefit of Marv's knowledge, his humor, and his diplomacy to help us continue moving forward. 
   So, Mr. President, I rise today to pay a well-deserved tribute to Dr. Marvin Fifield. But, I am not bidding him farewell. On the contrary, I will be calling  on him often for the same solid advice and counsel he has given to us for so many years. 
   The lives of countless thousands of disabled and disadvantaged citizens have been enriched as a result of Marvin Fifield's work. As a result, our nation will benefit for generations to come. It is a privilege to honor him today. I am proud to call him a friend.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have really enjoyed listening to my colleague from Massachusetts. He seems to think the only answer to education, public education in this country, happens to be the Federal Government. Of course, those of us who really have watched it and observed it over all these years realize that is not the answer. 
   The Federal Government spent, over the last 30 years, I guess, $120 billion. And in almost every category in title I, poor kids do a lot worse. We had over 700 Federal programs--over 700--300 of them just in the Department of Education alone. Yet we still have the same age old arguments that the Federal Government is the last answer to everything and really parents and families just don't know what to do for their kids. 
   I know there is a legitimate feeling on the part of those on the left that that is true, but there is more than a legitimate feeling on the part of us on the right who know that that is not true and literally the Federal Government is not the last answer. My good friends talks about block grants just being another name for revenue sharing--no, block grants are a way of letting the State and local people take care of their educational processes and to find out how and then to use the money in the best interests of the State and local educational processes. It is a pretty pivotal, basic Federalist principle, it seems to me. 
   I rise today to talk about the education bill pending before the Senate today. S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act, if enacted would make a number of improvements to education. This bill that is on the floor would really help education. S. 2 allows up to 15 states to shake off federal restrictions in exchange for increased accountability. It allows eligible parents to choose the provider of Title I services for their children. 
   This bill also gives parents the right to move their children out of schools that are failing them. 
   Why would we not want to do this? why would we not want to allow parents more control over the education of their children? I am sincerely baffled as to why this bill has attracted such opposition--I cannot believe that my colleagues are more interested in protecting bureaucracy instead of supporting teachers and students. Why should my colleagues be more concerned with filling out forms than in getting needed funds into classrooms? 
   I commend the Chairman and the hard working members of the HELP Committee. This is one of the most difficult committees to chair and to work on. I should know. I think the committee has put together a common-sense piece of legislation that, while not as sweeping as some would prefer, moves us along in the right direction. I would like the opportunity to vote for this bill. 
   I listened with interest to the comments of my fellow Utahn, Senator BENNETT last week. I thought he made some excellent points, especially about the voluntary nature of some of more controversial elements of the bill. These really are very modest reforms, and this Congress and this President should move ahead with them. 
   It may come as a shock to some here in the Emerald City, but the Federal Government did not invent the public schools. Education in our country is never going to get better if we do not stop spinning our wheels here in Washington and start supporting the innovative reforms being implemented at state and local levels. 
   There is a role for the Federal Government, but it is a supportive one. And, many of those supportive programs are being reauthorized in this bill. 
   Today, however, I would like to speak about my amendment to the Title I funding formula for economically and educationally disadvantaged authorized in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--ESEA. 
   Before I get into that, though, I would like to note the Federal Government pays about 7 percent of the cost of education. Yet it requires 50 percent of the paperwork. That is the equivalent of 267,500 full-time teachers. We could go a long way towards solving some of the teacher problems in this country if we would get off the kick that the Federal Government is the last resort to everything. I think the Federal Government muddles in education where it should not. And many of the things it has done have not been fruitful or beneficial, even though I admit that the Federal Government can have a supportive role, if it is truly supportive and not destructive. 
   My amendment would make the Education Finance Incentive Grant Program, EFIG, a permanent statutory factor in the allocation of resources in the Title I formula. The EFIG program is currently authorized as a separate part of the Title I formula, which has never been funded. I believe that including it as a permanent factor in the Title I formula has merit. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Program distributes resources to states based on two important factors: effort and equity. 
   The effort factor measures a State's own fiscal commitment to education. The equity factor is determined by a state's commitment to equitably distributing resources among its school districts. Unlike demographic factors, both effort and equity can be controlled to a substantial degree by states as a matter of policy. 
   The equity factor is a crucial element of the EFIG program. It measures the ``coefficient of variation'' of funding among a state's school district; i.e., the equity factor measures how well a state endeavors to even out education assistance between districts which have high property tax revenues and those which do not. 
   Let me reiterate my support and appreciation for the hard work done by the HELP Committee on this bill, which I support. But, I wish the Committee had looked a little harder at the Title I formula. S. 2, as reported, does not change the fundamental problem of using State-per-pupil-expenditure as a proxy for determining a state's financial commitment to education. 
   What this expenditure proxy does is place a higher value on a child who lives in a rich State than it places on a child from a poor state, which cannot spend a large amount. If a State can afford to spend more money per-pupil, it gets more money from the Federal Government. If a State has less capacity and cannot spend as much per-pupil, it gets less money under Title I. This seems backwards to me. 
   Second, use of per-pupil spending as the sole proxy for a State's commitment to education ignores other important factors--such as tax effort. Thus ``effort'' is also a component of the EFIG formula, which my amendment would finally incorporate into the Title I formula. 
   In my home State of Utah, education consistently ranks as one of the highest priorities for Utahns. During this year's session of the Utah legislature, Utah reaffirmed its commitment to improving education, reducing class size, and increasing salaries for teachers. 
   Utah takes its commitment to education funding very seriously. During the 1995-96 school year, education expenditures in Utah amounted to $92 per $1000 of personal income. The national average was $62 per $1000. In other words, Utah's education expenditure relative to total personal income is 50 percent more than the national average. It is the third highest in the nation. 
   In terms of education expenditures as a percent of total direct State and local government expenditures, Utah ranks 2nd in the Nation. Utah's expenditure for education was 41.5 percent of the total amount spent for government. The national average is 33.5 percent. 
   No one can tell me that Utahns are not serious about funding education. And these efforts have garnered results. Utah's scores on ACT tests are equal to or better than the National average in English, math, reading and science. Utah ranks 1st in the nation in Advanced Placement tests taken and passed. 
   Still, even with these efforts, Utah remains 1st in the Nation in terms of class size and last in per-pupil expenditure. This is due to Utah's unique demographic. Utah families are, on average, larger than any other state. Utah has the highest birth rate in the Nation. 
   But I am realist. While I would like to completely eliminate per-pupil expenditure from the Title I formula, I understand that this is not going to happen. 
   However, I do believe it is appropriate and very sound policy to include in the Title I formula a small measure of diversity, that is, other ways of measuring a state's commitment to education--namely, effort and equity. 
   Including the EFIG program as a permanent factor in the allocation of Title I makes sense from this perspective. 
   Equity in education financing is receiving considerable attention both in the media and in the courts. States are being compelled by the courts to equalize resources. Most experts agree that the courts are tending towards equalization. To the extent reluctant states are having to equalize education funding to comply with court decisions, my amendment provides these States with some measure of relief because greater equity will increase their allocations under Title I. David Goodman in ``Mother Jones'' noted:  
   Since 1971, when the California Supreme Court declared in Serrano v. Priest that using property taxes to finance public education was a violation of the state constitution's equal protection clause, all but six states have been sued over educational equity. To date, school financing systems in 19 states have been deemed unconstitutional, and the courts have ordered these states to restructure their systems to improve the quality of education for all. 
   The implication is clear: School funding and student performance are believed to be directly and inextricably linked and wide variances in school funding are thought to both promote and maintain inequality of educational opportunity.  
   Indeed, some States are increasingly compelled to demonstrate that not only are they equalizing resources, but are providing an equal quality of education to all students. 
   I understand that these initiatives are causing some community concerns. I know that the distinguished Chairman of the HELP committee is all too aware of the controversies associated with the legal ruling in his home State of Vermont. However, the increasing reliance on resolving these issues through the courts and the fact that the courts are tending to favor equalization as a means of mitigating educational disparities lead me to conclude that legally requiring States to equalize resources among districts will continue to be a strategy employed by those concerned about education equity. 
   I also conclude that it is an appropriate use of federal resources to provide incentives for states to implement equalization programs as well as to assist those implementing court-ordered policies. 
   Resource equity has been identified as an effective strategy to accelerate education reform, which was the theme of the 2000 education conference sponsored by the Aspen Institute. Included in the rapporteur's summary was the following:  
   In the effort to raise the achievement of all American students, an extremely serious barrier is the huge disparities in resources for education across districts and states, It is not unusual for the per-student expenditure to be three times greater in affluent districts than in poorer districts of the same state. Although qualified, effective teachers and principals are key to student achievement--even more so for at-risk students--districts where salaries are low continually lose teachers and principals to districts that are able to pay more. 
   ..... Equally important is crafting finance equalization strategies, such as allowing federal funds to go only to those states that demonstrate equitable and adequate state education funding.

   Mr. HATCH. The purpose of title I is to give educationally and economically disadvantaged students additional assistance: teachers, textbooks, and additional education resources. These resources were never intended to comprise the entirety of aid to an educationally or economically disadvantaged student. 
   Unless there is an equity factor used in their distribution so that poorer districts within a state can be brought closer to even, those title I funds that are provided will merely be a thin coat of paint covering up the cracks. The layering of resources where resources are already inadequate will not meet the needs of disadvantaged children. Title I was meant to provide additional resources, not to compensate for an inadequate financial commitment to poorer LEAs on the part of States. 
   By directing resources to states where this is not the case, we are being true to the underlying intent of title I. 
   Indeed, as the following excerpts from the debate over the final conference report reveal, the addition of the effort and equity factor in the title I formula it was the reason why many Members of the Senate may have voted for the conference report. However, title I funds have yet to be distributed using this factor.

   Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Iowa is correct. The literature in the education field is loaded with recent articles suggesting that equalization is an important means of addressing inequalities. In a statement I gave on July 28, 1994, I outlined the reasons, which are supported by the literature in the education field, why I support equalization as a sound policy.

   Mr. HATCH. Yes, I do, provided that it is not mandatory. If effort and equity were factors driving education dollars, states would be encouraged to take steps toward equity on their own. Education is primarily a state and local responsibility to begin with. The equity factor included in this authorization, unlike the State per pupil expenditure--which I believe is an extremely poor and terribly unfair measure of effort--can benefit a State even if its needs are great and its tax base is small. This is because an equalization incentive is based not on how much a State has, but on how it distributes what it has. I confess that in many areas of public policy I do not favor such an approach. In many areas, I believe this type of allocation destroys incentives to work hard and to do more that contributes to our economy overall. 
   But, education is a legitimate function of State and local governments. We do not need to be concerned with hindering private sector incentives. Educational equalization--based on a plan developed by the State itself--should be encouraged. 
   Some of our colleagues have expressed concern regarding the equity factor. Does the Senator from Iowa believe that the equalization of resources within a State is inherently consistent with the premise of the title I program?

   Mr. HATCH. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Iowa. Many States have recognized the need to more fairly redistribute their resources. I am very proud that Utah has been a leader in just about every aspect of education--achievement, graduation rates, school finance. Utahans long ago developed a workable plan for school equalization. It is working in our State. 
   I believe the title I formula should reward real effort and real progress toward serving every child in a State equally. 
   I obviously would have preferred that the effort and equity provisions that were included as an integral part of the Senate-passed title I formula. However, it was the final decision of this conference to include these factors in the title I formula but to include them as a separate authorization that is, based on the Senate-passed version of the bill. This, I believe, is a step in the right direction. 
   I hope that this will not be a hollow authorization, that is, one with no money. While I do not want to put my colleague from Iowa on the spot because I know he is as committed to this idea as I am, I wonder if he would comment on this last point? He is in a position of some influence on that subcommittee.

   Mr. HATCH. I am pleased to point out that 30 States, plus Puerto Rico, would increase their title I allocations under my amendment relative to their allocations under the formula in S. 2. A number of these beneficiaries are States with high poverty districts. 
   Moreover, as my colleagues will note, my amendment holds states harmless for funds going out under the remaining title I part A formula. Additionally, my amendment allows school districts affected by census changes to retain 95 percent of their FY 98 funds. 
   One of my priorities in crafting this amendment was to improve title I while preventing huge shifts in the allocation amounts. Of those States which would currently stand to lose under my amendment, only one state loses 7 percent of their allocation, 4 States lose an average of about 5 percent of their allocation, 7 States lose about 3 percent of their allocation and 8 States lose under 1.3 percent of their allocation. 
   I reiterate that I have worked to adjust my proposal so that it not only captures the benefits of including effort and equity in the formula but also so that the minority of states who would currently lose under these factors would lose as little as possible. 
   Again, I hasten to add that States can change their own circumstances under my amendment. If States wish to access more Federal title I money, they can take steps to increase their effort and their equity. My amendment provides a degree of control for States. 
   States can, and many have already, adopted financing systems to equalize resources among districts. States have chosen a variety of equalization systems of their own design. A fair equalization factor will promote ``bottom up'' education reform that will help all kids make progress towards achieving the national goals. 
   Real education reform must take place at the grassroots level. A series of edicts issued from Washington, D.C. is not going to improve education for Americans. State and local education agencies must take on this challenge. But, the Federal Government should help--and at least not plant obstacles in the way which cannot be overcome. 
   The degree to which a State equalizes funding for education is a factor that a State can control. A State that equalizes is a state that will benefit under a this improved title I formula. 
   Also, equalization is a factor that can be quantified. So much of what the Congress is asking the State and local education agencies to do requires a judgment based a series of qualitative analyses. An equalization factor does not rely on subjective determinations. 
   An equalization factor does not rely on mandates or guidelines for how a State should achieve equalization. I, for one, would oppose a measure that specified how a state was to engage in equalization. On the contrary, I believe States are perfectly capable of figuring this out for themselves.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I notice probably one of the wealthiest States in the Union, Connecticut, gets more money per pupil than any other State, and it does not even need the money. What about these States that do? I hate to call it a stupid formula because it is in an education bill, but it is really a dumb, stupid formula, and it ought to be changed. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the people who have followed the victims' rights amendment closely know that I voted for this measure in the Judiciary Committee, and that I did so despite some reservations about its provisions and its language. No one has worked harder on this issue than the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information--Senator JON KYL. He has been a tireless advocate for victims rights, and has done more than most will ever appreciate to make the Senate's consideration of this proposed resolution a reality. Both he, and his lead cosponsor and ranking member on the Subcommittee, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, are to be commended. Frankly, they--and the committed network of victims' advocates--are why we are here today. It is because of their tireless commitment to this measure that I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of S.J. Res. 3. I should be clear, however, that I do so with some reservations concerning the proposed text of the amendment. But I hope my concerns can be addressed during the floor debate on the resolution. 
   Among my reservations are: 
   Its scope: the amendment's protections apply only to violent crimes; 
   Its vagueness: some of its definitions are unclear and will be subject to too much judicial discretion; and 
   Its effects on principles of federalism: the proposed amendment could pave the way for more federal control over state legal proceedings. 
   Given my reservations, some of my colleagues have asked how I could nevertheless approve the Senate's consideration of S.J Res. 3. I'd like to explain, beginning with a little background on the origins of the criminal justice system. 
   Our Constitution provides the backbone for what has unquestionably evolved into the best criminal justice system that has ever existed on Earth. Decent and thoughtful people have worked for over two hundred years writing and re-writing the statutes, case law, rules and procedures that guide the judges and lawyers who run the system. Those laws and rules have, by and large, kept the courts appropriately focused on the twin goals of seeking the truth and protecting the accused from arbitrary or unreasonable government actions. 
   Although our criminal justice system is the best, it is not perfect. There are many ways in which it could improve. One of the most important areas needing improvement is the manner in which the criminal justice system treats victims of crime. 
   The fact that the drafters of the Constitution did not include specific rights for victims of crime is not surprising. At that time, there was no need for such rights because victims were parties to the legal actions against their perpetrators. There was no such thing as a public prosecutor; victims brought cases against their attackers. When the Constitution was drafted, victims of crime were protected by the same rights given to any party to litigation. 
   The rights of victims were dramatically altered--along with the rest of the criminal justice system--with the advent of government-paid public prosecutors in the mid-1800s. Since then, the government, not the victim, has been the party litigating against criminals in court. Obviously this has been a tremendously important effect on society by ensuring that criminals are punished even when their victims could not, or would not, prosecute them. Today we would not have even a semblance of crime control without public prosecutors. 
   Unfortunately, however, one side-effect of replacing victims with public prosecutors was to force victims to the sidelines of the criminal justice system. No longer are victims parties to the case. No longer do individual victims have legal representation in court. No longer are the victims an integral part of the process. Instead, victims have become relegated to the role of one-call witnesses who can be summoned--or not--by either side. 
   The distance between victims and the criminal process has grown greater over time. Prosecutors are overworked, courts face backlogs of cases, and prisons are overcrowded. These practical constraints, together with strategic legal considerations, has led to an increasingly institutional view of crime--a view that focuses on processing cases rather than involving victims. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe the time has come for the Senate to consider the victims rights amendment. The issue for the Senate should not be whether we pass a victims' rights amendment--I believe we should do so. But I believe we must ensure that whatever form our final product takes, we have fully debated and considered the matter. In the end, deliberations and our final passage of a victims' rights amendment will have profound, reaching effects on the criminal justice system. We need to be sure the results are as we would wish them to be.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the FY 2001 Budget Resolution. I would be remiss if, upon reflection, I did not take this opportunity to talk about the federal commitment to education in my state of Utah. 
   In my state of Utah, education consistently ranks as one of the highest priorities for Utahns. During this year's session of the Utah legislature, Utah reaffirmed its commitment to improving education, reducing class size and paying dedicated teachers a salary commensurate with their efforts and qualifications. 
   Utah takes its commitment to education funding very seriously. During the 1995-96 school year, education expenditures in Utah amounted to $92 per $1000 of personal income. The national average was $62 per $1000. In other words, Mr. President, Utah's education expenditure relative to total personal income is nearly 50 percent more than the national average. It is the third highest in the nation. 
   In education expenditures as a percent of total direct state and local government expenditures, Utah ranks 2nd in the nation. Utah's expenditure for education was 41.5 percent of the total amount spent for government. The national average is 33.5 percent. 
   Mr. President, no one can tell me that Utahns are not serious about funding education. And these efforts have garnered results. Utah's scores on ACT tests are equal to or better than the national average in English, math, reading and science. Utah ranks 1st in the nation in Advanced Placement tests taken and passed. 
   Still, even with these efforts, Utah remains 1st the nation in terms of class size and last in per-pupil expenditure. This is due to Utah's unique demographic. Utah families are, on average, larger than any other state. Utah has the highest birth rate in the nation. 
   While it is true that these factors contribute to the allocation of federal education funds, most notably the Title I funds, the Clinton administration has done very little to help Utah. Indeed, many of the proposals in the administration budget would be detrimental to education efforts underway in Utah. 
   Among other things, this administration has consistently cut funding for Impact Aid. Impact Aid is a vital program for Utah because it helps make up for the lost property tax revenue in school districts where there is a significant federal presence. Since half of our state is federally owned or controlled, that means our schools would suffer even greater financial difficulties without Impact Aid. I appreciate that this Budget Resolution rejects the 15 percent cut requested by the Clinton administration. 
   Indeed, in addition to support for Impact Aid, there is much to applaud in this Budget Resolution relative to education. It assumes an increase of more than $600 million over the administration's request. Over $11 billion will be dedicated to funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This will greatly assist Utah fund the education of students with special needs. 
   Moreover, because the federal government will be contributing more toward the costs of special education, fulfilling more of its promise to fund 40 percent of the cost for educating students with disabilities, the state will be able to use its own resources to address state and local priorities such as lowering class size, improve facilities, increasing teachers' pay, upgrading instructional equipment and textbooks, or offering enrichment programs. 
   Finally, this administration has never recommended funding for the Education Finance Incentive Grant program which, instead of a per-pupil expenditure as a proxy for a state's  commitment to education, uses a combination of a state's effort to fund education and a state's willingness to more equitably distribute resources among a state's economically diverse school districts. As I have noted, Utah allocates a significant amount of state revenue to education, demonstrating our state's effort. Utah also has in place an ``equity program'' for assisting schools with smaller tax bases. Nationally, we ought to be encouraging states to make such effort, and we ought to be rewarding states that do. This is an important program that deserves a consistent funding stream, and I will be addressing this issue in the context of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   In the area of higher education, this Budget Resolution rejects the administration's proposal to require guaranty agencies, which finance guaranteed student loans (GSLs), to pay accelerated and increased funds from their federal reserves. This would be especially devastating to Utah's Higher Education Assistance Authority (UHEAA). Utah has one of the lowest average incomes in the nation; and, therefore, Utah students who are not reliant on their parents for financial assistance rely instead on assistance from UHEAA. 
   During past assessments, because UHEAA had maintained one of highest guarantee program reserves ratios, Utah had to return one of the highest percentages of current reserves to the federal government. Under the administration's proposal, these cuts would have been deepened, and I am grateful to the Budget committee for rejecting them. 
   In closing, I would like to commend the tireless hard work of the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI. His dedication to sound fiscal policy and appropriate spending priorities are laudable. I also thank the Senate leadership for their efforts on moving this process along. I look forward to the enactment of this Budget Resolution. I thank the chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted on a cloture motion to end debate on Senator LOTT's proposal to roll back the gasoline excise tax. Senator LOTT's bill is a sincere effort to address the hardships many Americans have been facing given the rising price of gasoline at the pump. 
   I commend the majority leader for this legislation. But, I do want to clarify my vote on the cloture motion. 
   I voted for cloture because I believe the majority leader, of all people, deserved an up-or-down vote on the proposal. I also believed that, if we were going to vote to cut or maintain the current gasoline tax, we ought not to confuse the American people about where we stood by deciding this issue on a procedural vote. 
   Unfortunately, because cloture was not invoked, and there may not be a vote up-or-down on the proposal itself, it seems that Utahns are indeed confused about where I stand on this issue. As it frequently happens, the vote on the procedural motion becomes a proxy for how a senator would have voted on the bill. However, that assumption does not hold true for me in the case of this gas tax proposal. I would have reluctantly voted against it. 
   While I respect Senator LOTT for his effort at providing relief for truckers, farmers, landscapers, salesmen, and everyone else who depends on his or her vehicle, I have an equal concern for the quality of the highways they drive on. 
   It is unclear to me that the loss of revenue that would have resulted from passing this legislation could have been immediately made up from other programs, thus necessary highway construction and repair projects in Utah and around the nation could have been delayed. 
   Moreover, I believe that there are other measures we can find should take to address the issue of high gas prices. In the long-term, we should encourage development of alternative fuels vehicles. Toward this end, Senator JEFFORDS and I will be introducing legislation later this month that will provide strong tax incentives for the development and purchase of such vehicles, along with the alternative fuel they use. 
   I also believe that there are other tax relief initiatives that will have greater positive impact for American families, and I will continue to press hard for these proposals.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to comment about the status of the Medicare program and the more immediate issue of adding outpatient prescription drugs as a covered benefit. 
   First of all, I think we can be pleased with the news from the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees on March 31 regarding the financial status of the Medicare program. The Trustees' annual reports on the financial status of Medicare and Social Security were, indeed, encouraging to the nearly 84 million Americans who rely on these two critically important entitlement programs. 
   The news for the Medicare program was especially good. The Trustees' reported that Medicare's Part A Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays for inpatient hospital expenses, is projected to remain solvent until the year 2023. Last year, the Trustees' reported the Part A Trust Fund would remain solvent until 2015. Thus, we have gained an additional eight years of solvency under the projections recently issued by the Trustees' report. 
   This is very welcome news. But we must recognize that the fiscal soundness of the Medicare program cannot be attributed to the underlying health of Medicare itself. Medicare's projected bankruptcy has been extended eight years to 2023 because of the strong economy, and not because of the overall health of the Medicare program.  
   As one witness before the Finance Committee testified last year, if there is as much as a hiccup in the economy, that could translate into lowering the solvency date by as much as five to ten years. Medicare is not solvent indefinitely. 
   In fact, beginning in 2010, the Part A Trust Fund will begin deficit spending taking in fewer dollars than it spends until 2023 when it is projected to be bankrupt. That is why Medicare reform is needed, and why it is needed now. 
   The Finance Committee, on which I serve, is currently considering several proposals that, in addition to reforming Medicare, would also provide Medicare beneficiaries with a drug benefit. There is not one member I am aware of on the committee who is opposed to adding prescription drugs as a Medicare benefit. And, I doubt there are many, if any, members in the Senate or House who do not believe prescription drugs should be added as a covered benefit. 
   Prescription drugs are as much a part of modern medicine as is any component of health care. In fact, drug therapy has often provided a successful alternative to more extensive and expensive medical interventions. To preclude prescription drugs from Medicare's benefit package today is tantamount to precluding hospital care back in 1965 when the Medicare program was enacted. 
   Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to cast Republicans as the barrier to a new drug benefit. That could not be farther from the truth. In fact, I was one of the three sponsors of legislation in 1997 along with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, and the Ranking Minority Member, Senator MOYNIHAN, that created the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare Reform. 
   That Commission held great promise to identify and forge a bipartisan proposal to reform Medicare, including the development of a drug benefit. But, by just one vote--which was cast by the President's own commission appointee--the nearly two years of work by the seventeen member commission failed to receive the necessary super majority vote to formally report recommendations to Congress. 
   In fact, all of the President's appointees voted against the commission's recommendations. As a result, the commission was unable to formally recommend to Congress a strong bipartisan proposal that would clearly have helped provide the impetuous toward reforming Medicare and providing a drug benefit. 
   The issue now before the Finance Committee is not so much should we have a prescription drug benefit, but rather how a benefit would be structured and how much a benefit would cost the Medicare program. These are very real and complicated issues that will clearly need to be fully vented and addressed before any legislation can move forward. 
   For example, one of the key issues which will need to be addressed, but on which there has been little discussion, is who will administer or manage the new drug benefit? This is not an insignificant decision, Mr. President. 
   Under the President's program, the Health Care Financing Administration, along with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, would be responsible for administering the drug benefit. Another proposal by Senator BREAUX and Senator FRIST--who I would add is the only physician that serves in the Senate--would create a new Medicare Board to be the administering entity. 
   Now, I don't mean to be too critical of my friends at HCFA, but I do believe that involving the Health Care Financing Administration in the management of the drug benefit is not the prudent course of action. 
   Moreover, HCFA has been besieged by complaints from providers over reimbursement policies and practices. Although, in all fairness to HCFA, it is not totally at fault. There are clearly management issues involving third-party fiscal intermediaries, or the insurance carriers, which actually administer the reimbursement component of the Medicare program. 
   I do not think the current structure is a good model on which to base a new drug benefit. It seems to me we need to fix the current structure under which HCFA and the fiscal intermediaries operate before we add-on a whole new layer of responsibility which, in many respects, will be one of the costliest benefits Medicare beneficiaries receive. 
   I believe we can fix the current administrative structure. There are many good people at HCFA, including the administrator and the deputy administrator, who are committed to improving program integrity and accountability by the carriers. But I simply do not believe that the kind of significant administrative reforms necessary to make the President's proposal work can be approved by Congress and implemented in time to make a drug benefit available within the foreseeable future. 
   A new Medicare Board as proposed under the Breaux/Frist legislation makes inherently greater sense in the overall scheme of providing a drug benefit. The proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program which has successfully served federal employees, including the President of the United States and each member of the U.S. Congress, for over 40 years. Moreover, the proposal promotes choice by allowing seniors a voluntary option to either stay in the current, traditional Medicare fee-for-service system, as run by HCFA, or enroll in a private plan, as run by the Medicare Board. Both options would offer prescription drugs. 
   This is just one example of the numerous logistical and structural issues that must be addressed before a drug benefit can be implemented. Even under the Breaux/Frist proposal, there will need to be considerable lead time to get the Medicare Board up and running, and fully functional. So I am very pleased the Budget Committee has reported a budget resolution which provides $40 billion over five years for this purpose. This is certainly an important first step. 
   The Finance Committee is now currently considering all options under the very able leadership of our Chairman, Senator ROTH. I would only reiterate the importance of fully addressing the critical management and administrative issues because they clearly will be instrumental in the success of any new drug benefit Congress enacts. Once again, the provisions in the Budget Resolution represent an important first step in moving forward. 
   But there remains a great deal of work on the details and little time in which to address them. Our work will have to be bipartisan and it will require the support and leadership of President Clinton. Otherwise, we jeopardize the very real prospect of a drug benefit this year. 
   I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee in the development of a drug proposal that meets the needs of Medicare beneficiaries while preserving the underlying financial integrity of the Medicare program. 
   We owe it to our seniors, and to those with disabilities, to do this the right way.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank Senator DOMENICI, chairman of the Budget Committee, for his outstanding leadership on the budget resolution. 
   Mr. President, I feel compelled to make some short remarks today because the topic has strayed away from the budget and focused once again on gun control. This topic--and many misleading statements about it--are paraded out year after year when the Senate considers the budget resolution. 
   This year, I hope we can see through the rhetoric and focus on what objective observers already know to be true: The statistics prove that the Clinton administration has failed to enforce federal gun laws. For example: 
   Between 1992 and 1998, so-called Triggerlock prosecutions--prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony--dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800. 
   Despite over 6,000 incidents of children carrying guns into public schools last year, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight cases under the federal law against possessing firearms on school grounds in 1998, and only five such cases in 1997. 
   It is a federal law to transfer a firearm to a juvenile, yet the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases in 1998, and only five in 1997. 
   Similarly, for all its talk about the dangers of semiautomatic assault weapons, the Clinton Justice Department has an equally abysmal record for prosecuting cases under the current laws governing those weapons. The Clinton administration brought only four cases in 1998, and only four in 1997, under the federal law criminalizing the transfer or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. 
   Now, Mr. President, you will not hear the Clinton administration or the gun control advocates in Congress talk about these statistics, even though it is these statistics--not a wish-list of more laws and regulations--that reveal the true story of gun misuse in America. Instead, the number that gun control advocates talk about is the 500,000 felons and other prohibited purchasers that the Brady background check prevented from buying firearms since the Brady law was enacted. 
   Let me point out that with the original Brady law this administration wanted was a 7-day delay once you tried to buy a weapon. We reduced it to 5 days. We knew that wasn't going to work, so we instituted an instant check system so you can find out immediately whether a person is capable of purchasing a weapon. It was our instant check system that caught these, according to the President, 500,000 people. Actually, it was about 400,000 people. 
   But even this statistic points out the Clinton administration's lack of commitment to enforcing federal gun laws. Every one of those 500,000 people who were thwarted in their attempts to purchase firearms violated 18 U.S.C. section 922(a)(6) by stating under oath that they were not disqualified from purchasing a firearm. How many of those 500,000 were prosecuted between 1996-1999? Only about 200 were even referred for prosecution. 
   Mr. President, the only thing worse than this poor enforcement record is the Clinton administration's disingenuous and concerted effort to blame the lack of federal gun prosecutions on a lack of resources. The facts demonstrate that, during the period when federal gun prosecutions decreased nearly 50 percent, the overall budget of the Department of Justice has increased by 54 percent. 
   The Clinton administration also tries to hide its failure to prosecute gun crimes behind its never-ending calls for more federal gun control laws. The irony of the administration's position was evident at an oversight hearing last year, when I questioned Attorney General Reno about the decline in federal firearms prosecutions. She replied  that many firearms violations have been prosecuted in state court, and she indicated that state court is the proper forum for these cases. As chairman of the board of the Federalist Society, I agree that most firearms crimes can be prosecuted in state court as well as federal court. Nevertheless, I find it ironic and hypocritical for the administration to argue that crimes involving firearms should be prosecuted in state court at the same time they are calling for more federal gun control laws. If the administration really believes that its dismal record on gun prosecutions is because gun laws are a state issue, it should be consistent and stop pressuring Congress for even more federal gun control laws that it does not intend to enforce. 
   The relevance of all this to the budget resolution is that there are several actions the Justice Department could take right now--with no additional laws or resources--that would have a positive impact on reducing crime in America. First, the Justice Department should use state law enforcement grants to encourage States to enact mandatory minimum sentences for firearm offenses based on 18 U.S.C. 924(c), and to prosecute such offenses in state court. The key to Project Triggerlock is the 5-year mandatory minimum 
   prison sentence for any person who uses or carries a firearm in a crime of violence or serious drug trafficking offense. This 5-year prison sentence is in addition to the prison term for the underlying crime. As I mentioned earlier, most of these gun crimes can be prosecuted in state court as well as federal court. By encouraging States to enact stronger penalties for gun crimes, there will be less need to prosecute these cases in federal court. 
   Mr. President, there is a precedent for the federal government encouraging States to increase prison sentences. The Truth-in-Sentencing Grant Program provides prison construction funds to States that adopt truth-in-sentencing laws. Truth-in-sentencing laws require violent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. Due to truth-in-sentencing grants, more than 70 percent of prison admissions last year occurred in states requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. 
   Another positive step the Justice Department should take is using the funds provided in the budget resolution to designate at least one assistant United States attorney in each district to prosecute federal firearms violations. As the U.S. attorney's office in Richmond, Virginia has shown, federal prosecutors, in cooperation with state and local law enforcement, can help reduce violent crime. The U.S. attorney's offices should focus their efforts on federal firearms violations until the States enact stronger sentences for state firearm offenses. 
   Finally, the Justice Department should place mental health adjudications on the National Instant Check System (NICS). It is a federal crime for any person who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution to possess or purchase a firearm. Despite this commonsense federal law, mental health adjudications are not placed on the NICS system. Consequently, mentally ill persons can buy firearms from licensed dealers because the dealers are not notified by the NICS system of the mental disqualification. The NICS system will never reach its potential until mental health adjudications are included. These commonsense ideas would go a lot further toward reducing the number of crimes committed with firearms than the administration's current practice of ignoring federal violations, asking for more gun restrictions, and blaming lack of funding for their abysmal record of prosecutions. 
   It is pathetic that there are 2,000 laws, rules, and regulations on the books that aren't being taken care of now, and now we have some who say let's have a political recitation here on this resolution to try to embarrass people instead of standing up and doing something about the misuse of weapons in our society.

   Mr. HATCH. The juvenile justice bill provides $450 million in accountability in block grants for all kinds of problems; $547.5 million in prevention grants for juveniles, $75 million in grants to update felony records, et cetera, none of which basically will pass as long as we stay in the gunfight. 
   A majority of Republicans and Democrats in the House will not support the Lautenberg amendment. A majority of the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate will not support the Dingell amendment. So we are stuck with one of the most important anticrime juvenile justice bills in history because we can't resolve the gun process. 
   The best thing we can do is strip it out, fight that another day, and do it this way. We cannot get a conference report and call a conference when all we will do is polarize the situation and divide people even more. I think we have to come to a conclusion and pass the juvenile justice bill, regardless of what happens. I hope we can vote down this amendment. It is not helping.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in less than two weeks, American taxpayers face another federal income tax deadline. Although this year's deadline falls on a Saturday, and is thus deferred for two days, the date of April 15 stabs fear, anxiety, and unease into the hearts of millions of Americans. Some discomfort with filing tax returns and, especially, with paying taxes, is understandable and probably unavoidable. Paying taxes will never be fun. But neither should it be cruel and unusual punishment. 
   But because of the complexity of our federal income tax system, for millions of American taxpayers, completing the forms can be sheer torture. According to the Tax Foundation, American taxpayers, including businesses, spend more than 5.4 billion hours and $250 billion each year in complying with tax laws. That works out to more than $2,400 per U.S. household. This is astounding, Mr. President. 
   Last year, over 126 million individual income tax returns were filed. The good news is that about 25 million of these were filed on Forms 1040EZ or 1040A, which are significantly easier to complete than Form 1040. Nearly six million more taxpayers last year filed over the telephone, simply by pushing buttons. I am pleased to note that the Internal Revenue Service is making strides in improving telefiling and also electronic filing. The bad news is, however, that the majority of taxpayers still face filing tax forms that are far too complicated and take far too long to complete. 
   According to the estimated preparation time listed on the forms by the IRS, the 1999 Form 1040 is estimated to take 12 hours and 51 minutes to complete. This is an increase of 77 minutes from 1998. 
   Moreover, Mr. President, this does not include the estimated time to complete the accompanying schedules, such as Schedule A, for itemized deductions, which carries an estimated preparation time of 5 hours, 39 minutes, or Schedule C, for taxpayers with a business, which has an estimated time of 10 hours, 19 minutes. Schedule D, for reporting capital gains and losses, shows an estimated preparation time of 5 hours 34 minutes. 
   Even though millions of taxpayers are spared having to file the more complex 1040 with its many schedules, I believe the majority of Americans are intimidated by the sheer number of different tax forms and their instructions, many of which they may be 
   unsure whether they need to file. Simply trying to determine that a certain form is not required can itself be an overwhelming task, given the massive set of instructions and the approximately 325 possible forms that individual taxpayers must deal with. 
   This is the instruction book for 1999 individual tax returns, Mr. President. It includes 116 pages, not counting the forms themselves.  
   It is no wonder that well over half of all taxpayers, 56 percent according to a recent survey, including a large number of my colleagues in the House and Senate, now hire an outside professional to prepare their tax returns for them. However, the fact that only 29 percent of individuals itemize their deductions shows that a significant percentage of our taxpaying population believes that the tax system is too complex for them to deal with, even though they may qualify to file one of the simpler forms. 
   Moreover, Mr. President, this complexity is getting worse each year. As I mentioned, just from 1998 to 1999 the estimated time to prepare Form 1040 jumped 77 minutes. Going back a few years, to tax year 1988, we see that the estimated preparation time was only 9 hours and 17 minutes, so we have an increase of 38 percent since 1988. The number of pages in this 1988 instruction book is only 59. So, in a matter of 11 years, we have nearly doubled the hassle factor for our constituents. 
   I might note, Mr. President, that the income tax system was not always so complicated. I hold here the very first Form 1040, the 1913 edition. This form totaled three pages for the form and just one page for the instructions. But as Congress changed the tax code over the years, the cumulative results have left us with a quagmire of tax rules that would challenge the wisdom of Solomon and the genius of Einstein--not to mention the patience of Job. In fact, the genius of Einstein might not even help here. Albert Einstein himself is quoted as saying ``the hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.'' 
   As much as we in Congress would like to blame the Internal Revenue Service for this mess, Mr. President, I am afraid that we instead need to look in the mirror to see who is responsible for the complexity of our tax system. After all, the Internal Revenue Code is our creation. And what a creation it is. According to the Congressional Research Service, the tax code last year included over 2.8 million words. The Holy Bible itself has only about 775,000 words. Obviously, God did not need to issue such copious instructions for living as we currently have for complying with the tax laws. 
   Moreover, the pace of change to the Internal Revenue Code is quickening. According to Charles Rossotti, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Congress made about 9,500 tax code changes in the past twelve years. And we are far from being finished. Currently, there are at least 11 pending bills that have been reported by the 
   House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees that have changes to the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, we are talking about passing still more tax bills this year. What started as a trickle in 1913 has become an avalanche in 2000. 
   So, what is the solution, Mr. President? Many of my colleagues, myself included, have berated the tax code and the Internal Revenue Service, calling for both to be eliminated and replaced with a system that is much simpler. Such an idea seems to be a popular one, judging by the applause lines I receive when I mention this concept in speeches, and by the mail I have received on the subject. 
   I do believe that our current tax is seriously flawed and that Congress, led by the President, should enact legislation that would give the American people the tax system they deserve --one that is simpler, fairer, and geared to the needs of our economy in the 21st Century. 
   This is not an easy proposition, Mr. President. Nor is it one that can be completed in a short period of time. One major problem has been the lack of presidential leadership. As with so many other vital issues facing this great country, the Clinton-Gore Administration has been AWOL on tax reform--aloof without leadership. 
   It seems that the Administration's solutions to almost every societal and economic problem has boiled down to one of two things--targeted tax cuts or revenue increases. Both have had devastating effects on the complexity and fairness of the tax code. And again, there is plenty of blame to go around for this, right here on Capitol Hill. 
   But even when we have a president willing to show us the way to a new tax system, the problems of such a monumental undertaking are enormous. Just the task of educating ourselves and the taxpaying pubic on what the effects of fundamental tax reform would be, and how each taxpayer would be affected, is a large one indeed. 
   Moreover, computing the effect of such a change on the economy and figuring out how to make a fair transition will be truly daunting. This will be the case whether we decide to adopt a flat-tax, a consumption tax, or some hybrid system. Indeed, the inability of members of Congress to unite behind one reform plan, after years of discussion, is but one indication of how difficult this job of fundamental tax reform will be. 
   This is not to indicate in any way, Mr. President, that I shrink from or do not favor the idea and need for fundamental tax reform. I am fully convinced that we, as a nation, must find a better tax system. I merely wish to point out that getting to that point is a long and difficult journey that, when looked upon with a realistic eye, will not be accomplished in the next two to three years under the best of circumstances. I believe 
   it will take a minimum of five years. 
   In the meantime, what do we do? Do we simply sit on our hands and lament the terrible tax code and wish for the day we can change things? Not in my book, Mr. President. I believe we should take action, starting this year, to improve our present tax system. For all of the Internal Revenue Code's many flaws, there are numerous incremental steps we can take this year and over the next two years that can dramatically lessen the complexity and increase the fairness of our tax code. 
   In the next few weeks, I intend to introduce legislation that will represent the ``down payment'' or first installment of what I believe will be a significant multi-year tax simplification package. This first installment will include a number of tax simplification provisions designed to make tax life easier for each category of taxpayers, including business filers. A considerable portion of the bill will be repeal provisions. After all, repeal of a overly complex and outdated tax provision is the ultimate reform. 
   My tax simplification plan will be in three installments because I believe that, for a number of reasons, trying to simplify the entire code in one year may be too large an undertaking to succeed. Rather, I believe that a three-part plan, each containing significant, but digestible, relief for different classes of taxpayers, is a more practical approach. 
   Each of these three installments will include a centerpiece repeal provision that would remove from the Internal Revenue Code a major source of complexity that, in my view, is beyond repair and should simply be eliminated. For the first installment, the provision to be repealed is the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT). 
   The individual AMT is growing out of control and, if left unchecked, will become a source of major complexity to millions of taxpayers, most of whom it was never intended to affect. The alternative minimum tax was originally established in 1969 as a sort of backstop provision to ensure that sophisticated taxpayers who took advantage of some of the tax code's incentive provisions, called tax preferences, paid at least some minimum amount of tax. 
   The AMT was expanded as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, with the changes taking effect in 1987. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that only 140,000 individual taxpayers were required to pay the individual AMT that year. By 1999, that estimate had grown to 823,000 taxpayers, largely because the thresholds for determining minimum tax liability were not indexed for inflation. In other words, as incomes grew because of inflation and other factors, more and more people found themselves subject to the AMT. This is a major flaw, Mr. President, which will bring millions of middle-class families into the net of the minimum tax over the next ten years. 
   As serious as this problem is, a worse one also lurks in the AMT. Because of structural problems with the provision, some of which have been temporarily solved on a year-to-year basis through 2001 only, the minimum tax serves as a limitation to families receiving the major tax relief Congress passed in 1997 in the form of the child credit and the education credits. If not corrected or repealed, this ``AMT time bomb'' will affect 17 million taxpayers by 2010, according to the Treasury Department.  
   Many of these taxpayers, Mr. President, are not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination. We are talking about middle-class American families here, many struggling just to raise their children. Let me give you an example from this chart entitled: The Effect Of The Alternative Minimum Tax on a Middle-Class Family of Five. 
   Todd and Mary Anderson live in Murray, Utah, and have three children. Their oldest daughter, Sarah, is a freshman in college. The younger two children, Mark and Marcia, are twins in the fifth grade. Todd and Mary are both school teachers and together earn $80,000 per year. This is not a wealthy family by any measure. 
   However, Mr. President, this family will be paying at least $878 of alternative minimum tax beginning in 2002. Moreover, because the AMT exemption is not indexed for inflation, the minimum tax for the Andersons will get larger each year as their income rises because of cost of living adjustments. 
   Perhaps almost as aggravating for this family as the higher taxes is the fact that they will need to file the alternative minimum tax form with their annual tax return. Not only does this entail mastering an 8-page set of instructions, which are estimated to require 6 hours to learn about and complete, but also preparing a 50-line form along with a 10-line worksheet. 
   This kind of extra complexity is simply unjustified for any taxpayer, but more especially for families like the Andersons, who have nothing out of the ordinary about their financial situation. 
   Mr. President, the best way to reform provisions like the individual alternative minimum tax is simply to repeal them. This is exactly what my bill would do. 
   As I mentioned earlier, this first installment of my simplification initiative will have provisions that are designed to simplify the tax lives of every group of taxpayers. Let me outline what the major provisions would be and who they would benefit. 
   For lower-income taxpayers, probably the most complex feature of the current tax law is the earned income tax credit (EITC). This credit is vital to the livelihoods of millions of working American families. Unfortunately, the computation of the credit is so complicated that many professional tax preparers do not even know how it works. My bill does two things, Mr. President. First, it would significantly simplify the credit, and 
   second, it would enhance it so more low-income families could take advantage of it. 
   Besides the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, my bill will also aid middle-class taxpayers by vastly simplifying the capital gains tax. Many of my constituents were thrilled in 1997 when Congress lowered the capital gains tax rates from 28 percent to 20 percent. However, many were not as excited when they found out what the new law meant come tax return filing time--a 54-line Schedule D accompanied by two worksheets and seven pages of instructions. This is compared to a 39-line form and just two pages of instructions prior to the change. 
   I plan to simplify capital gains by changing from the current maximum rate approach to a 50 percent exclusion approach, as was the case before the 1986 Tax Reform Act repealed the capital gains preference. In other words, taxpayers would be allowed to exclude 50 percent of the long-term capital gain from gross income. The remaining 50 percent would be taxed at ordinary income rates. This would do away with the need for a special computation on the tax forms. It would also result in a lower capital gains rate for every tax bracket, with those in the lowest tax brackets getting the largest rate decreases. 
   My tax plan would greatly simplify taxes for taxpayers in the upper-middle income and upper-income brackets by repealing two phaseout provisions that are both unwarranted and very complex. These provisions, which phase out the benefits of personal exemptions and itemized deductions for taxpayers with incomes above certain thresholds, are nothing more than backdoor tax increases Congress passed in 1990. Repeal of these provisions would make a significant contribution to simplification. 
   Corporate taxpayers will also find tax simplification provisions in this first installment of my tax plan, Mr. President, including a provision to equalize the interest rate that the IRS pays corporate taxpayers on overpayments with the rate that companies must pay when they owe the government. Future installments of my simplification plan will have even more corporate provisions. 
   Finally, each of the three installments of my simplification plan will include ten to fifteen smaller, yet important, simplification provisions that, taken together, would make a significant difference in lessening the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   American taxpayers are fed up with our tax system and want to see some serious changes made. Like all members of this body, I hear from my constituents each day who complain about taxes. This has been the case since the first year I was privileged to represent the State of Utah here in the Senate. Over the years, the nature of the complaints has changed, however. Years ago, I mostly heard from constituents that taxes were too high or were unfair. While I still hear plenty of complaints of this nature, I have begun hearing more and more from Utahns who are just plain sick and tired of the complexity of our tax code. 
   We need to take action now to reduce complexity. We should not wait for a new president, nor for a groundswell of popular support for either the flat tax or a national consumption tax. Let's start this year, Mr. President, with a tax simplification plan that begins the long process of making our current system both fairer and simpler. In the meantime, we should also continue the national debate about how to best replace the tax code with a new system. I urge my colleague to join me in this undertaking. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has today passed a bill that I tried to have passed along with the comprehensive satellite reforms enacted a few months ago at the end of the last congressional session. The reforms we authored are already bearing fruit. Satellite carriers are beginning to serve their customers local television, which they had not done before. As part of our comprehensive reform we developed a loan guarantee program to help ensure that smaller markets would not be left behind in enjoying the benefits of our reforms. 
   The chairman of the Banking Committee requested further time to review and improve if possible the program, and we were able to work together to meet his concerns. The bill the Senate adopts today is similar in most respects to the legislation we developed last year, and I am pleased that we are finally able to pass this important legislation. 
   I hope the House will act expeditiously on similar legislation, or take up the Senate legislation as soon as possible. I have long championed the provision of local television signals by satellite carriers for many reasons. First, it allows for more direct competition against cable customers alike, in the form of lower prices and better services, as well as expanded choice. Second, I believe that local television helps unite local communities by providing programming relevant to that community. It is important that Utahns know what is happening in their communities, and be able to participate in civic affairs as informed citizens. They need to know what the local weather forecast in New York. And they enjoy watching the local sports teams, or other Utah-related programming. Third, I think local television service is more consistent with the current market relationships than beaming the programming tailored to other communities into our local communities. 
   For these reasons, I pushed reforms to allow satellite companies to carry local programming for a number of Congresses, culminating in our passage of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 last year. The one piece of unfinished business from that package of reforms was the loan guarantee program we adopt today. Under this legislation, government-backed loans will be made available to ensure that those smaller markets, the markets that most need local television delivery by satellite or other means, are not left behind. The satellite carriers and cable companies understandably serve the larger markets first, where costs are lower and revenues potentially greater. Hopefully with the adoption and eventual enactment of this legislation today, we will go a long way to help all our local communities enjoy together the programming most relevant to them, their local television signals.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it would be appropriate at this point to explain our joint view regarding the application of copyright and communications law to those who provide local television signals with the assistance provided under this Act. We all agree that the rights, obligations, and limitations that apply to applicants under this loan guarantee program ought to be the same as those providing similar services without the assistance of the loan guarantee program. Congress passed comprehensive rules in this area just a few months ago at the end of the last session, and it is our joint intention to clarify that those rules apply to applicants under this program just as they do to others who take advantage of the reforms passed last year. To underscore this position we have offered an amendment, and that amendment has been accepted, that will clarify some confusion resulting from the manner in which section 8 of the underlying bill was drafted by dropping section 8 from the bill altogether. It is the general rule that otherwise applicable law will apply absent a clear statement to the contrary. Since the relevant sections of Title 17 and Title 47 would apply, the attempt to list the provisions that apply in this context is superfluous, and to the extent that the drafting in current section 8 could be read to be inconsistent with current law, it merely causes needless confusion. It seems best, therefore, to simply drop the provision and make a clear statement that currently applicable copyright and communications law will apply to applicants under the loan guarantee program just as it does to those providing similar services without loan guarantee assistance. Do my colleagues agree?

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the pending flag desecration resolution for 30 minutes prior to a cloture vote on the resolution. Therefore, Senators can anticipate the cloture vote to occur at approximately 10 a.m. Following the vote, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m. with the time under the control of Senators BROWNBACK, COVERDELL, and DURBIN. 
   It is hoped an agreement regarding final passage of the flag resolution can be made so that the vote can occur during today's session. As a reminder, cloture on the motion to proceed to the gas tax legislation was filed on Tuesday, and that vote will occur on Thursday at a time to be determined. Also on Thursday, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the loan guarantees legislation. 
   I thank all Members for their attention.

Mr. President, during the past 2 days, we have heard several Senators who oppose the flag desecration amendment speak about the American flag as only a symbol or a piece of cloth that should not be confused with the real freedoms that we as Americans enjoy. They want to know why we get so worked up over a symbol, a mere piece of cloth. They want to know why we should care if someone urinates or defecates on the American flag.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been interested in these arguments because, if I recall it correctly, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has said that basically America is different from the long list of repressive regimes or dictatorial regimes--from Cuba, to North Korea, to Nazi Germany--because we do not have a law prohibiting flag desecration. 
   But until 1989, we had State laws, in nearly all of the States, prohibiting flag desecration. If I recall it correctly, I believe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is saying we should not have a State law protecting the flag. If I recall it correctly, he voted for the flag statute to protect the flag back in 1989, and just yesterday voted for the McConnell amendment which would have done the same thing. 
   Now look, there is a certain ``elitism'' around here in this country that literally is saying: We are above having to protect the flag of the United States. If somebody defecates on it or urinates on it, we do not want to give them any publicity for that. 
   It is kind of the ``high society'' approach to things. If you want to be a member of the ``high society'' group, then don't do the ``unintellectual'' thing to protect our flag. That is what is getting me about this. 
   We had, for 200 years, in 48 States, anti-flag-desecration statutes that protected the flag. These very people who are saying we cannot do this in a constitutional amendment, to give the Congress the power, the coequal right, to protect our flag, and ignore the Supreme Court, that is wrong in these 5-4 decisions, these two decisions--they said we cannot do this in this constitutional amendment--yet many of them voted for an anti-flag-desecration statute back in 1989, and yesterday many of them voted for the McConnell amendment. 
   Until the Supreme Court struck down these 48 States' statutes in 1990, we had a Federal statute protecting the flag. I cannot believe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was arguing that in those days, when we had flag protection statutes in the States and the Federal Government, we were like Nazi Germany or Cuba or North Korea or Iran or Iraq. That is something that really bothers me. 
   I look at those marines risking their lives in raising the flag on Iwo Jima. They revered that flag, just as we do today. Eighty percent of the people in this country revere this flag--in fact, I hope everybody does--and want this constitutional amendment. 
   If we had any sense of proportion, we Members of Congress should want to overrule those two Supreme Court decisions. The only way we can do it is with a constitutional amendment. In that process, we prove we are coequal to the judicial branch of Government and will protect our flag in the process. We will be a better Nation for it. 
   If we do it, we will create a debate on morals and values around this country in all 50 States that, sadly, is lacking at this particular time. We will, for once in our lives, stand up and say to our children, there are some values and some symbols--at least one symbol in our country that is extremely important to us, and that happens to be this flag of the United States of America. 
   I think there are very sincere people on the other side of this issue. I do not mean to malign them. But I have to say, I 
   get particularly upset when I hear these arguments, as I have heard this morning, when, in fact, they vote for statutes that would protect the flag, the very thing they are arguing against. It seems a little inconsistent to me. 
   All we are saying is, give the Congress the power to do this, and then we will enact a statute for which they voted.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise this morning to voice my deep concern over the developing situation in Miami involving this young boy, Elian Gonzalez. 
   I do not rise today to make legal or policy arguments regarding the events that have transpired thus far, although I have strongly held views on those matters. Rather, I rise to implore--yes, implore--the Justice Department and the Clinton Administration to exercise restraint in how they proceed. 
   For reasons I fail to understand, this Administration yesterday significantly ratcheted up the stakes in this matter, and unnecessarily turned this into a crisis situation by threatening to involuntarily and forcibly remove this  boy from the place he calls home and to forcibly remove him from the family that has cared and sheltered him for four months. 
   And why? The Justice Department had previously indicated a willingness to allow the Miami family to pursue its legal avenues in federal court. This family is appealing the recent decision of the district court. That is not news, and should hardly come as a surprise to the Department. In fact, it is my understanding that the family has agreed to the Justice Department's request to try and expedite the appeal. 
   So why has the Administration manufactured this crisis and issued these threats and ultimatums? Why make these threats regarding this arbitrary, self-created and self-imposed deadline of Thursday morning at 9:00 a.m.? 
   I know that my colleagues have different views on the matter of whether Elian Gonzalez should be returned to Cuba or allowed to stay in our country. But I do not stand before you today to debate that matter. 
   Rather, I would hope we could all join in calling upon the Department of Justice and the Clinton Administration to calm down, exercise restraint, and stop acting to increase the tension of this delicate situation unnecessarily through arbitrary deadlines or threats of force. 
   I fail to see how these threats serve any useful purpose. Hasn't this young boy been through enough? Why does this Administration need to forcibly remove him from his home while the appeal process continues to run? Has Elian become an enemy of the United States of America? If not, why is the Administration treating him like a dangerous drug lord or a mass murderer? 
   Again, I implore this Justice Department and this Administration to calm down and exercise restraint. We need to find a way to diffuse this situation, not to further inflame it. And, we need to act in accordance with the values of our country--restraint, respect for law, and common sense. We should not be led to extremes merely to appease a foreign government. We will be fair and deliberate. But, we should not engage in ridiculous, overwrought measures. 
   After all, this is not Cuba. This is the United States of America, and we have a young boy here. He ought to be treated with dignity and with respect by a government that does not act as a bully with no restraint whatsoever. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have had a productive and educational debate concerning our proposed constitutional amendment to protect the flag. We have considered--and defeated by overwhelming votes--two significant amendments which were aimed at the heart of this amendment. A clear majority of the Senate has its mind made up on this resolution, and it is proper that we are now preceding to a vote. 
   The events of the last three days could cause one to question the depth of feeling my colleagues have for their argument that this flag protection constitutional amendment would erode free speech rights guaranteed by the first amendment. Many of these same Senators have denounced flag desecration and voted for statutes which would allegedly protect the flag. In 1989, the Congress responded to the Supreme Court's decision in Texas v. Johnson, which held that State flag protection statutes were unconstitutional, by enacting the Flag Protection Act. Ninety-one Senators--let me repeat, 91 Senators--voted in favor of that statute, which provided that:  
   Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.  
   That was the statute that 91 Senators in this body in 1989 voted for. 
   Clearly, 91 Senators believed in 1989 that flag desecration should be stopped; that people who knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn, or trample upon any flag of the United States should be prevented from engaging in this sort of conduct. Clearly, 91 Senators believed in 1989 that prohibiting flag desecration would in no way erode free speech rights guaranteed by the first amendment, and voted for the bill in response to a Supreme Court decision that had said otherwise. 
   I remember those arguments. We can do this by statute. We have had the same arguments in this debate, all of which are just as specious as they were back then. 
   Yet, of those 91 Senators who voted to outlaw flag desecration in 1989 to prohibit this form of expressive conduct, 18 who are still here will vote against the flag protection constitutional amendment. In other words, of the more than 30 opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment, 18 voted in 1989 to prohibit flag desecration. 
   Let me read directly from the joint resolution, the constitutional resolution:  
   The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.  
   In other words, we want to give them the power so that they can, again, vote for their beloved statute. They can't vote for it now because it would be declared unconstitutional again. I think the limited version presented here, the McConnell statute, which would not do much to begin with, is likewise unconstitutional. 
   The point was that 18 of those who will vote against the flag protection constitutional amendment today, at least 18 of the more than 30 opponents of this proposed constitutional amendment, voted in 1989 to prohibit flag desecration. 
   Just yesterday we voted on whether to adopt the Flag Protection Act of 1999. That is a more narrow flag desecration statute offered by Senator MCCONNELL. Now some Senators voted against Senator MCCONNELL's amendment because they do not believe flag desecration is a problem in our society, that it is too trivial of an issue for the Senate even to consider. Other Senators, including myself, voted against the McConnell amendment because we believe that under the Supreme Court precedents, and given the present composition of the Court, it would be struck down as the other statutes were. Yet 36 Senators voted in favor of the McConnell amendment, a statute prohibiting flag desecration. Clearly, these 36 Senators do not believe that prohibiting flag desecration will erode free speech rights guaranteed by the first amendment. Of these 36 Senators, 30 have indicated they will vote against the flag protection constitutional amendment today. 
   I must ask these Senators: Do you believe in flag protection or not? Or are you just playing political games? If they do believe in flag protection, they should vote for this constitutional amendment, which is the only constitutional way of protecting our flag. If not, they should have the courage to repudiate the votes they cast yesterday, in 1995, and in 1989, and to admit that they do not want to prohibit flag desecration in any way. They can't have it both ways unless they are just playing politics. I would never accuse anybody in this body of doing something as denigrating as playing politics. 
   Some of my colleagues contend our country has achieved greatness in its two centuries of existence because they say we value tolerance over all else. Yes, we are tolerant of everything that is rotten and we are intolerant of many things that are good. They say if we pass this constitutional amendment and then adopt legislation prohibiting flag desecration, we will become Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Cuba, and a host of other repressive and dictatorial regimes that do ban desecration of their respective flags. They even suggest we will become like South Africa during apartheid or like Nazi Germany if we protect our flag. This argument is not only specious, it is absolutely ridiculous. It is insulting. 
   Indeed, I must say their argument is full of historical revisionism. The United States of America prohibited desecration of the American flag during the first two centuries of its existence. If this constitutional amendment is adopted and implementing legislation is passed, the United States of America will not somehow become an intolerant, repressive, dictatorial police state. No, the United States of America's laws will be just as they were for over 200 years before this lousy decision by five people on the Supreme Court, versus four, showing it was hotly contested. Even they weren't sure what they were doing. 
   I find that a sense of elitism is creeping into the Senate. In fact, I don't fear it, I know that is the case. We have amongst us people who seem to think the Senate has more important things to do than to listen to, and act on, the views of the overwhelming majority of American citizens who want the flag protection constitutional amendment. I find this elitism profoundly troubling. As a matter of fact, all we are asking is for this body to give a two-thirds vote, as the House did, so we can submit this to the people in the respective States and let them decide once and for all whether or not they want to protect the flag. 
   The American people do not believe that the flag of the United States of America is just a piece of cloth or just another symbol. The American people know that the flag is the embodiment of our heritage, our liberties, and indeed our sovereignty as a nation, as Madison indicated--the author of the Constitution. The American people are deeply offended and morally outraged when they see the flag humiliated and the Government powerless to defend it. 
   I have heard both sides of this debate cite leaders in the military, and I am sure that some of these people who are opposed to our amendment today are good people. But let me quote Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. and allied forces during the gulf war. He wrote:  
   The flag remains the single, preeminent connection to each other and to our country. Legally sanctioned flag desecration can only serve to further undermine this national unity and identity that must be preserved.   
   There are tens of thousands of veterans living in our country today who have put their lives on the line to defend our flag and the principles for which it stands. Those are the fortunate ones who were not required to make the ultimate sacrifice. For every one of those, there is someone who has traded the life of a loved one in exchange for a flag, folded at a funeral. Let's think about that trade--and about the people who made that trade for us--before deciding whether the flag is important enough to be addressed by the Senate. 
   Let's think about the meaning of majority rule before we dismiss the feelings of the American public. Would it really trivialize the Constitution, as some of these critics suggest, to pass an amendment that is supported by the vast majority of Americans? The Constitution itself establishes the process for its own amendment. It says that the Constitution will be amended when two-thirds of the Congress and three-fourths of the States want to do so. It does not say that this procedure is reserved for issues that some law professors, or even some Senators, think are important. If government by the people means anything, it means that the people can decide the fundamental questions concerning the checks and balances in our government. It means the people can choose whether flag desecration is against the law. The people have said they want Congress to protect the American flag. 
   Because the flag amendment reflects the will of the people, I believe passage and ratification of this amendment is ultimately inevitable. It may not pass the Senate today, but it will pass the Senate. The votes in the past few years demonstrate that momentum--as well as the fulfillment of duty--is on our side. In 1989, 51 Senators voted for the amendment. That was it, 51. In 1990, there were 58 votes in favor. In 1995, 63 Senators voted for the amendment. And, today, we hope we will at least get that many. We have had some reversals, as you have seen. But the trend of support will continue until we get the 67 needed to pass this resolution and send the constitutional amendment to the States for ratification. I personally will not stop fighting for the flag amendment until it passes the Senate with the requisite two-thirds vote. 
   I came up the hard way. I had to earn everything I have, and I have earned it the hard way. I learned a trade as a young man. I worked as a janitor to get through school. I have never been part of the elite, and I wouldn't be there if I could be. I have to tell you, this place is filled with elitism among those who are voting against this amendment today. 
   Frankly, I get a little tired of the elitism in this country. It is throughout our country, and it is elitism that is allowing the savaging of our values to occur today in this country. It is the elite who are basically upholding things that force us to be tolerant, as they say, of some of the very offensive acts that occur in our society. They say we should be tolerant, not to do 
   anything about people who defecate on our flag or urinate on our flag or burn our flag with contempt or trample on it. They don't seem to see any real problem with that, although they condemn it vociferously without doing one doggone thing about changing this culture and letting the American people know we are going to stand for something. 
   What better thing can you stand for, other than your families--and this is part of standing for families in my book--what better thing to stand for than standing up for this national symbol that unites us and brings us together? Just think about it. 
   In conclusion, the flag amendment is the very essence of government by the people because it reflects the people's decision to give Congress a power that the Supreme Court has taken away on a 5-4 vote. The four who voted against the five--in other words voted to uphold the right of the Federal Government and the States to ban desecration of the flag--those four fought very hard for their point of view. They happen to be right. 
   I urge all my fellow Senators to do the right thing for the American people. I urge everybody in America to hold us responsible for not doing so. I am asking the folks out there in America to start getting excited about this. If we could pass this amendment through the Senate, since the House has already done it, I guarantee we would create the biggest debate on values this country has seen in years in every one of our 50 States. If we did that, that alone would justify everything we are talking about today, let alone standing up for the greatest symbol of any country in the world today. I think we ought to do it. I hope my fellow Senators will do the right thing and vote for this resolution so the people, through their State legislatures, can decide for themselves whether or not they want their elected representatives to enact a law prohibiting the physical desecration of the American flag. 
   We know we do not have the votes today, but we are not going to stop until this amendment is approved. Sooner or later we will get enough people here who feel strongly enough about this to get the constitutional amendment passed. I venture to say, if we could pass this constitutional amendment, at least 38 States--and, frankly, I think all 50 States would ratify this amendment--I believe the people out there would ratify this amendment and we would have more than 80 percent in the end, and people would feel very good about it. 
   I know one thing, those seven Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who were standing with us yesterday as we had a press conference on this, it would make their lives, as it would for all these veterans throughout this country who have sacrificed for you and me that we might be free. I would like to see that happen. If it does not happen today, don't worry, we will be back because we are not going to quit until we win on this amendment. When we do, it will be a great thing for this country. 
   I want to thank the dedicated staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee for their hard work on this important proposed constitutional amendment--S.J. Res. 14. In particular, I would like to commend Alex Dahl, Catherine Campbell, Kyle Sampson, and Ed Haden. These fine lawyers and professional staff spent countless hours getting us to this point. I also want to thank the committee's chief counsel, Manus Cooney, for his assistance and counsel. On the minority side, let me acknowledge Bruce Cohen for his professionalism and spirited opposition. 
   Many other staffers were helpful including Jim Hecht and Stewart Verdery of our leadership staff. I think these staffers know that this debate was an important one and one of significance. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the pending flag desecration resolution. Under the order, there are 2 hours of debate remaining on the Hollings amendment, to be followed by an additional hour for general debate. 
   At 2:15, following the party caucus luncheons, the Senate will proceed to two consecutive votes on the pending amendments to the flag desecration resolution. Cloture was filed on the resolution during yesterday's session; therefore, under the provisions of rule XXII, a cloture vote will occur on Wednesday. However, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached with regard to a vote on final passage of the resolution and that the cloture vote will not be necessary. 
   I thank all Members for their attention.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to make remarks generally on the flag amendment. Frankly, I think it is a travesty on this constitutional amendment to bring up campaign finance reform as a constitutional amendment to this amendment. But be that as it may, any Senator has a right to do that. 
   I hope my colleagues will vote down the Hollings amendment, as it should be voted down. That is a serious debate that has to take place, and it should not take place as a constitutional amendment. Having said that, let me comment about why we are here. 
   The Senate began today's session with the Pledge of Allegiance to our American flag. Today, we resume debate over a proposal that will test whether the pledge we make--with our hands over our hearts--is one of consequence or just a hollow gesture. We resume debate over S.J. Res. 14, a constitutional amendment to permit Congress to enact legislation prohibiting the desecration of the American flag. Now all we are asking, since the Court has twice rejected congressional statutes, is to give Congress the power to protect our flag from physical desecration. It seems to me that is not much of a request. 
   It should be a slam dunk. But, unfortunately, politics is being played with this amendment. Congress would not have to act on it if it didn't want to, but it would have the power to do so. It also involves the separation of powers doctrine. 
   The Supreme Court, in its infinite wisdom, has indicated that flag burning, defecating on the flag, or urinating on the flag is a form of free speech. 
   I don't see how anybody in his right mind can conclude that. There is no question that is offensive conduct and it ought to be stamped out. On the other hand, all we are doing is giving Congress the power to enact legislation that would prohibit physical desecration of the flag. Congress doesn't have to, if it doesn't want to; it can, if it wants to. 
   When we enacted those prior statutes to protect the flag, they passed overwhelmingly. It was also under the guise that we were trying to protect the flag through statutory protection, which I of course pointed out very unfailingly in both cases was unconstitutional. Of course, the Supreme Court upheld what I said they would uphold. 
   Symbols are important. The American flag represents, in a way that nothing else does, the common bond shared by the people of this nation, one of the most diverse in the world. It is our one overriding symbol of unity. We have no king; we won our independence from him over 200 years ago. We have no state religion. What we do have is the American flag. 
   Whatever our differences of party, politics, philosophy, race, religion, ethnic background, economic status, social status, or geographic region, we are united as Americans in peace and in war. That unity is symbolized by a unique emblem, the American flag. Its stars and stripes and rich colors are the visible embodiment of our Nation and its principles and values and ideals. 
   The American flag has come to symbolize hope, opportunity, justice, and freedom--not just to the people of this Nation but to people all over the world. Failure to protect the flag would lessen the bond among us as Americans and weaken the symbolism of our sovereignty as a nation. 
   This proposed amendment recognizes and ratifies James Madison's view--and the constitutional law that existed for centuries--that the American flag is an important and unique incident of our national sovereignty. As Americans, we display the flag in order to signify national ownership and protection. The Founding Fathers made clear that the flag reflects the existence and sovereignty of the United States, and that desecration of the flag was a matter of national--I repeat--national concern that warranted government action. This same sovereignty interest does not exist for our national monuments or our other symbols. While they are important to us all, the flag is unique. It is flown over our ships. We carry it into battle. We salute it and pledge allegiance to it. We do these things because the flag is the unique symbol unity and sovereignty. 
   The proposed amendment reads simply: ``The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.'' S.J. Res. 14 is not an amendment to ban flag desecration, but an amendment to allow Congress to make the decision on whether to prohibit it. It is not self-executing, so a statute defining the terms and penalties for the proscribed conduct will need to be enacted, should this amendment be approved by two-thirds of the Senate today, or whenever. 
   While it would be preferable to enact a statute, and not take the rare and sober step of amendment the Constitution, our amendment is necessary because the Supreme Court has given us no choice in the matter. 
   I understand there is some lack of knowledge in this body where people have not realized that for 200 years we have protected the flag and that 49 States have anti-flag-desecration language. But in two narrow 5-4 decisions, breaking from over 200 years of precedent--Texas v. Johnson and United States v. Eichman--the Court overturned prior State statutes prohibiting the desecration of the flag. 
   Make no mistake about it: The United States Senate is the forum of last resort to ensure that our flag is protected. H.J. Res. 33--an identical measure--has already won the necessary two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives by a vote of 305 to 124, with overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact, nearly 50 percent of the Democrats in the House voted for the measure. 
   In addition, the people, expressing themselves through 49 State legislatures, have expressed their readiness to ratify the measure by calling upon Congress to pass this constitutional amendment to protect the flag. Protecting the flag is not a partisan gesture, nor should it be. Especially at a time of election-year partisan rhetoric, this amendment to protect our flag is an opportunity for all Americans to come together as a country and honor the symbol of what we all are. This effort will not only reaffirm our allegiance to the flag, it will reestablish our national unity. 
   The American people revere the flag of the United States as the unique symbol of our Nation and the freedom we enjoy as Americans. As Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said in his dissent in Texas v. Johnson:   
   [A] country's flag is a symbol of more than ``nationhood and national unity.'' It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power of those ideas. ..... So it is with the American flag. It is more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill for other peoples who share our aspirations.'' [491 U.S. at 437 (dissenting)]  
   In the long process of bringing this amendment to the floor, we have gone more than half way to address the concerns of critics. I think it is time for opponents of the amendment to join with us in offering the protection of law to our beloved American flag. 
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in his dissent in the Texas v. Johnson decision, said it best:  
   The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible force in motivating leaders like Patrick Henry, Susan B. Anthony, and Abraham Lincoln, schoolteachers like Nathan Hale and Booker T. Washington, the Philippine Scouts who fought at Bataan, and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha Beach. If those ideas are worth fighting for--and our history demonstrates that they are--it cannot be true that the flag that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of protection from unnecessary desecration. [491 U.S. at 439]  
   I want to talk a little bit about the arguments that I have heard over the past several years, and again this week, from some of my colleagues who oppose this amendment. Opponents contend that preventing the physical desecration of the flag actually tramples on the sacred right of Americans to speak freely. Although I respect many people who have this view, I strongly disagree with it. I hope that, as I have come to understand their perspective, they too will be open to mine and, together, we will be able to achieve consensus on the most important issue of all--protecting and preserving the American flag. 
   Restoring legal protection to the American flag would not infringe on free speech. If burning the flag were the only means of expressing dissatisfaction with the nation's policies, then I imagine that I, too, might oppose this amendment. But we live in a free and open society. Those who wish to express their political opinions--including any opinion about the flag--may do so in public, private, the media, newspaper editorials, peaceful demonstrations, and through their power to vote. 
   Certainly, destroying property might be seen as a clever way of expressing one's dissatisfaction. But such action is conduct, not speech. Law can be, and are, enacted to prevent such actions, in large part because there are peaceful alternatives equally expressive. After all, right here in the United States Senate, we prohibit speeches or demonstrations of any kind in the public galleries, even the silent display of signs or banners. As a society, we can, and do, place limitations on both speech and conduct. 
   Mutilating our Nation's great symbol of national unity is simply not necessary to express an opinion. Those individuals who have a message to the country should not confuse their right to speak with a supposed ``conduct right,'' which allows one to desecrate a symbol that embodies the ideals of a Nation that Americans have given their lives to protect. 
   For this reason, I must reiterate strongly that the flag protection amendment does not effectively amend the first amendment. It merely reverses two erroneous decisions of the Supreme Court and restores to the people the right to choose what law, if any, should protect the American flag. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues miss this point and talk about how we cannot amend the Bill of Rights or infringe on free speech, and I was struck by how many of them voted for the flag protection statute in 1989. Think about that. They cannot have it both ways. How can they argue that a statute that bans flag burning does not infringe on free speech, and yet say that an amendment that authorizes Congress to enact such a statute banning flag burning does infringe on free speech? 
   Moreover, the argument that a statute will suffice is an illusion. We have been down this road before, and it is an absolute dead end, having been rejected by the Supreme Court less than 30 days after oral argument, in a decision of fewer than 8 pages. 
   They will do the same to any other statute of general applicability to the flag. A constitutional amendment is necessary because the Supreme Court has given us no choice in this matter. 
   We all understand the game that is being played. We have people who changed their vote at the last minute to prevent the flag amendment from passing, as they did on the balanced budget amendment. The same people who voted for the statute are claiming their free speech rights would be violated by this amendment, but I guess not by the statute that allows them to ban desecration of the flag--a statute that I think they all know would be automatically held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. It is a game. It is time for people to stand up for this flag. 
   Some of my colleagues argue that because the Supreme Court has spoken we can do little to override this newly minted, so-called ``constitutional right.'' In my view, this concedes far too much to the judiciary. 
   No human institution, including the Supreme Court, is infallible. Suppose that the year is 1900 and we are debating the passage of an amendment to override the Plessy versus Ferguson decision. That was the decision in which the Supreme Court rules that separate-but-equal is equal, and that the Constitution requires only separate-but-equal public transportation and public education. The Plessy decisions was almost unanimous, 8-1 in contrast to the Johnson and Eichman decisions, which were 5-4. Would any of my colleagues be arguing that we could not pass an amendment to provide that no state may deny equal access to the same transportation, public education, and other public benefits because of race or color simply because the Court had spoken the final word? Would any one of my colleagues argue that the Plessy decision had to stand because an amendment might change the 14th amendment? Of course not. 
   The suggestion by some that restoring Congress' power to protect the American flag from physical desecration tears at the fabric of our liberties is so overblown that it is difficult to take seriously. In fact, I think it is phony. These arguments ring particularly hollow because until 1989, 48 states and the federal government had flag protection laws. Was there a tear in the fabric of our liberties then? Of course not. 
   It goes without saying that among the most precious rights we enjoy as Americans is the right to govern ourselves. It was to gain this right that our ancestors fought and died at Concord and Bunker Hill, Saratoga, Trenton, and Yorktown. And it was to preserve that right that our fathers, brothers, and sons bravely gave their lives at New Orleans, Flanders, the Bulge, and Mt. Suribachi. The Constitution exists for no other purpose than to vindicate this right of self-government by the people. The Framers of the Constitution did not expect the people to meekly surrender their right to self-government, or their judgment on constitutional issues, just because the Supreme Court decides a case a particular way. Nor, when they gave Congress a role in the amendment process, did the Framers expect us to surrender our judgment on constitutional issues just because another, equal and co-ordinate branch of government, rules a particular way. The amendment process is the people's check on the Supreme Court. If it were not for the right of the people to amendment the Constitution, set out in Article 5, we would not even have a Bill of Rights in the first place. It was the people through their elected representatives--not the courts--who enshrined the freedom of speech in the Constitution. 
   The Framers did not expect the Constitution to be routinely amended, and it has not been. The amendment process is difficult and exceptional. But it should not be viewed as an unworthy or unrighteous process either. The amendment process exists to vindicate the most precious right of the people to determine under what laws they will be governed. It is there to be used when the overwhelming majority of voters decide that they should make a decision rather than the Supreme Court. 
   In Texas versus Johnson and United States versus Eichman the Supreme Court decided for Americans that a  statute singling out the flag for special protection is based on the communicative value of the flag and therefore violates the first amendment. The Court decided that what 48 states and the federal government had prohibited for decades was now wrong. Since the Johnson and Eichman decisions, several challenges have been brought against the state statutes prohibiting flag desecration. State courts considering these types of statutes have uniformly held these statutes unconstitutional. 
   One recent case, Wisconsin versus Janssen, involved a defendant who confessed to, among other things, defecating on the United States flag. Relying on the Supreme Court's Johnson decision, the Wisconsin high court invalidated a state statute prohibiting flag desecration on the ground that the statute was overbroad and unconstitutional on its face. 
   In reaching that decision, the court noted that it was deeply 
   offended by Janssen's conduct, and stated that ``[t]o many, particularly those who have fought for our country, it is a slap in the face.'' The court further explained that ``[t]hough our disquieted emotions will eventually subside, the facts of this case will remain a glowing ember of frustration in our hearts and minds. That an individual or individuals might conceivably repeat such conduct in the future is a fact which we acknowledge only with deep regret.'' What was particularly distressing about this decision is that the court found the statute constitutionally invalid even though the state was trying to punish an individual whose vile and senseless act was devoid of any significant political message, as so many of them are. 
   The court noted ``the clear intent of the legislature is to proscribe all speech or conduct which is grossly offensive and contemptuous of the United States flag. Therefore, any version of the current statute would violate fundamental principles of first amendment law both in explicit wording and intent.'' Under prevailing Supreme Court precedent, then, the Court found that the proscribed conducted was protected ``speech.'' The Wisconsin decision, like those before it, demonstrates that, because of the narrow Johnson and Eichman decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, any statute, state or federal, that seeks to prohibit flag desecration will be struck down. 
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court, however, noted that all was not lost. The Court opined that ``[i]f it is the will of the people in the country to amend the United States Constitution in order to protect our nation's symbol, it must be done through normal political channels,'' and noted that the Wisconsin legislature recently adopted a resolution urging Congress to amend the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration. 
   Clearly, with the House having already sent us the amendment on a strong, bipartisan vote, the ball is firmly here in the Senate's court. If we are serious about protecting the American flag, it is up to this body, at this time, to take action and to send this proposed amendment to the people of the United States. 
   After all the legal talk and hand-wringing on both sides of this issue, what is comes down to is this: Will the Senate of the United States confuse liberty with license? Will the Senate of the United States deprive the people of the United States the right to decide whether they wish to protect their beloved national symbol, Old Glory? Forty-nine state legislatures have called for a flag protection amendment. By an overwhelming and bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives has passed the amendment. Now it is up to the Senate to do its job. Let us join together and send this amendment to the people. 
   This resolution should be adopted, and the flag amendment sent to the states for their approval. Our fellow Americans overwhelmingly want to see us take action that really protects the flag and this, my friends, can do just that. I urge you to support the flag protection amendment and, by doing so, preserve the integrity and symbolic value of the American flag. 
   It is now time for the Senate to heed the will of the people by voting for the flag protection constitutional amendment. Doing so will advance our common morality and the system of ordered liberty encompassed in our history, laws and traditions. We must restore the Constitution and the first amendment, send the flag amendment to the States that have requested it with near unanimity, and return to the American people the right to protect the United States flag. It is time to let the people decide. 
   Again, I come back do that major point. All this amendment does is recognize that there are three separated powers in this country--the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of Government. When the judicial branch says we can no longer enact by statute the protection of the flag and suggests we have to pass a constitutional amendment if we want to protect the flag, then this amendment gives the Congress the right to be coequal with the other branches of Government. It gives us the right to protect the flag through a constitutional amendment and it gives us the right, if we so choose, to pass legislation similar to the legislation that a vast majority of Members of this body voted for back in 1989. 
   Last but not least, in this day and age, many of our young people don't even have a clue to what happened back between 1941 and 1945. They don't even realize what happened in the Second World War. 
   Sending this amendment to the 50 States would create a debate on values, which is necessary in this country, like we have never had before. It will be up to the people to decide. That is all we are asking. Let the people, through their State legislatures, decide whether or not we should protect the flag. That is not a bad request. It is something that needs to be done. Above all, it restores to the Congress the coequal power as a coequal branch of Government that is gone because of the very narrow set of 4-5 Supreme Court decisions. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way of reforming our system of campaign finance. The Hollings proposal to amend our Constitution is simply the wrong way. It would, in effect, amend the first amendment to our Constitution to allow any ``reasonable'' restrictions to be placed on independent campaign expenditures and contributions. Why does he propose that we amend the first amendment? Because the Supreme Court of the United States has held that restrictions on independent expenditures violate the first amendment's free speech protection and that such restrictions could only be justified upon a showing of a compelling--as opposed to any reasonable--reason. 
   The Hollings amendment would gut the free speech protections of the first amendment. It would allow the curtailing of independent campaign expenditures that could overcome the natural advantage that incumbents have. It would, thus, limit free speech and virtually guarantee that incumbents be reelected. Thus, the Hollings amendment could change the very nature of our constitutional democratic form of government by establishing what the Founders of the Republic feared most: a permanent elite or ruling oligarchy. Let me explain. 
   The very purpose of the first amendment's free speech clause is to ensure that the people's elected officials effectively and genuinely represent the public. For elections to be a real check on government, free speech must be guaranteed--both to educate the public about the issues, and to allow differing view points to compete in what Oliver Wendell Holmes called ``the market place of ideas.'' 
   Simply put, without free speech, government cannot be predicated upon, what Thomas Jefferson termed, ``the consent of the governed.'' Without free speech, there can be no government based on consent because consent can never be informed. 
   The Supreme Court of the United States recognized this fundamental principle of democracy in the 1976 case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). The Court in Buckley recognized that free speech is meaningless unless it is  effective. In the words of Justice White, ``money talks.'' Unless you can get your ideas into the public domain, all the homilies and hosannas to freedom of speech are just plain talk. Thus, the Supreme Court held that campaign contributions and expenditures are speech--or intrinsically related to speech--and that the regulating of such funds must be restrained by the prohibitions of the first amendment. 
   The Buckley Court made a distinction between campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. The Court found that free speech interests in campaign contributions are marginal at best because they convey only a generalized expression of support. But independent expenditures are another matter. These are given higher first amendment protection because they are direct expressions of speech. The Court reaffirmed the principles it outlined in Buckley just a few months ago in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov't. 
   Consequently, because contributions are tangential to free speech, Congress has a sizeable latitude to regulate them in order to prevent fraud and corruption. But not so with independent expenditures. In the words of the Court:  
   A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. [424 U.S. at 19-20].  
   The Hollings amendment's allowance of restrictions on expenditures by Congress and state legislatures would impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech. It would permit placing drastic limitations on both individuals and groups from spending money to disseminate their own ideas as to which candidate should be supported and what cause is just. The Supreme Court noted that such restrictions on expenditures, even if ``neutral as to the ideas expressed, limit political expression at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms.'' [Buckley at 39]. 
   Indeed, even candidates under the Hollings proposal could be restricted in engaging in protected first amendment expression. Justice Brandeis observed, in Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927), that in our republic, ``public discussion is a political duty,'' and that duty will be circumscribed where a candidate is prevented from spending his or her own money to spread the electoral message. That a candidate has a first amendment right to engage in public issues and advocate particular positions was considered by the Buckley Court to be of:  
   ..... particular importance ..... candidates [must] have the unfettered opportunity to make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues before choosing among them on election day. 424 U.S. at 53.  
   Campaign finance reform should not be at the expense of free speech. This amendment--in trying to reduce the costs of political campaigns--could cost us so much more: our heritage of political liberty. Without free speech our Republic would become a tyranny. Even the liberal American Civil Liberties Union opposes Hollings-type approaches to campaign reform and called such approaches a ``recipe for repression.'' 
   The simple truth is that there are just too many on the other side of the aisle that believe that the first amendment is inconsistent with campaign finance reform. That is why they are pushing the Hollings proposal. To quote House Minority Leader RICHARD GEPHARDT, ``[w]hat we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for a healthy campaign in a healthy democracy. You can't have both.'' 
   I strongly disagree. You can have both. We have to have both. For without both, the very idea of representative democracy is imperiled. That is why I oppose the Hollings amendment. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am intrigued by the comments of my colleague from Illinois. I would like to focus all the attention in the world on those who desecrate the American flag. I think it would be a great thing. It would help everybody in this country to know how distasteful it is and how denigrating to our country it is and how denigrating it is for all those who have died for this country following the flag, how denigrating it is to everybody who served in the military, how denigrating it is to every schoolchild, how denigrating it is to people who believe in values and things that are right. I have no trouble focusing on somebody who runs on the field burning a flag. I would like to focus on that creep as much as I could. I think if we did a little bit more of that, we might find a renewed resurgence of feelings about our country out there. 
   To be honest with you, if I interpret what the Senator said, he basically said that people ought to be able to make their statement. I wonder if he would be happy to have anybody who wants to make a statement in our gallery make any statement they want to every day that we meet. I think he would acknowledge that would disrupt the workings of the most important legislative body in the world. 
   There are limitations on everything, including the first amendment. By the way, how do you call offensive conduct of defecating, urinating on the flag or burning the flag with contempt, how do you call that free speech? The Supreme Court apparently has done so, but then, again, what we are talking about here, just look at this amendment. It is a very simple amendment. It is not telling us to do anything about the flag. What it says is: The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. My gosh, it doesn't tell us what to do. It just says we are going to take back this power that we had before this other third of the three separate powers, the judiciary, took it away from us and took it away from 49 States, all of which have asked us to restore that right to the States and the Federal Government. 
   These people are arguing against an amendment that gives the Congress back the power it had before, that it had for 200 years. Where is the logic in that? Many of these folks who are going to vote against this amendment voted for an anti-flag-desecration statute back in 1989. If they believe it is free speech today to defecate on the flag, then why wasn't it in 1989 when they voted for that useless statute that I stood up and said was unconstitutional and voted against and which later was declared to be what I said it would be, unconstitutional? Why didn't they vote against it if they are so enamored with this argument on free speech? 
   But forget the free speech argument. What about the power of three separate branches of Government? Why should we let the judiciary tell 49 States and the Congress of the United States we don't have any power to protect the national symbol of our sovereignty, of our patriotism, of our Nation? Any self-respecting Senator would want to stand up for the rights of the Congress, especially since this amendment doesn't say what we have to do. It basically says we have the right to change things. That is what you do with a constitutional amendment. 
   Some opponents of the flag-protection amendment have argued that we should be passing more restrictions on gun ownership rather than debating our constitutional amendment to protect the American flag. Give me a break. Everything is gun amendments around here. We have 20,000 laws, rules, and regulations about guns in this society that aren't even being enforced by this administration. 
   While I believe there is no shortage of important issues for the Senate to take up, I believe the flag amendment is not only vital to protect our shared values as Americans, but also that this debate is particularly timely today as we all strive to recover what is good and decent about our country. 
   We see evidence of moral decay and a lack of standards all around us. Our families are breaking down, our communities are being divided, and there are leaders who are not providing the appropriate moral leadership for the American public. Our popular culture, including movies, television, video games, and music, bombards our children with offensive messages of violence and selfishness. The very disturbing incidents of gun violence--particularly at our public schools--is a particular result of a culture that is afraid to teach that certain ideas are right or wrong. As the saying goes, you have to stand for something, or you will fall for anything. 
   Today, the Senate has a unique opportunity to say that our country, and our culture, does stand for something; that on the issue of protecting and safeguarding an incident of national sovereignty, we stand for something. Today, we can reaffirm that all Americans share certain beliefs and values and a respect for this symbol of our national sovereignty. We can give a united bedrock of principle to a generation that is increasingly floating adrift and alone. Think about it. If we pass this amendment, we will create a debate on values in this country in all 50 States. That alone justifies this amendment--although I could give many additional justifications even better than that. 
   The disillusioned young people in our society today learn a very negative lesson by watching our Government sit powerlessly as exhibitionists and anarchists deface the embodiment of our sovereignty and our common values. What do you think they take away from watching people who dishonor the memory of those millions of men and women who have given their lives for the future of America? Allowing desecration of the flag lowers again the standards of elemental decency that all of us must and should live by. This proposed amendment affirms that without some aspirations to national unity, there might be no law, no Constitution, no freedoms such as those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights was never intended to be a license to engage in any kind or type of behavior that one can imagine. Don't sell this amendment, and what it stands for, short. 
   If we pass this amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote, the Senate will say that our symbol of sovereignty, the embodiment of so many of our hopes and dreams, can no longer be dragged through the mud, torn asunder, or defecated on. We will say to the young people of America that there are ideals worth fighting for and protecting. There is a reason we are united as Americans, and that our experiment in democracy has proven to be the most enlightened government in history. 
   Can anyone think of a better message to send to our young people than to begin to reclaim the values of liberty, equality, and personal responsibility that Americans have defended and debated? 
   The flag amendment is not a distraction from matters of violence and education and social decay; nor is it an abdication of responsibility, as it has been called by some who oppose it. If there has been an abdication of responsibility, it has been to defend the irresponsible notion that the Bill of Rights 
   exists to allow people to engage in any type of behavior or conduct that one can imagine. We need more attention to public values and standards, not less. 
   I am deeply offended by those who say the Senate has more important things to do than discuss a flag-protection constitutional amendment. I urge those of my colleagues who think the Senate is too important for the American flag to listen to the American people on this issue. I just came from a press conference where seven Congressional Medal of Honor recipients were there praying that the people of this country will get the Members of the  Senate to support this flag amendment. 
   The vast majority of our citizens support amending the Constitution to protect our Nation's flag. Even then, this amendment just says it gives the right to the Congress to do that. To these citizens and elected officials, protecting the flag as the symbol of our national unity and community and utilizing the constitutional amendment process to do so is no trivial matter. 
   Sitting in our gallery today are people who put their lives on the line to defend our flag and the principles for which it stands. These are the fortunate ones who were not required to make the ultimate sacrifice like my brother was in the Second World War, and like my brother-in-law was in Vietnam. Every one of these people--like tens of thousands of American families across our country--have traded the life of a loved one for a flag, folded at a funeral. Let's think about that trade--and about the people who made it for us--before deciding whether the flag is important enough to be addressed in the Senate. 
   Given the great significance of the flag, it is not surprising that support for the flag amendment is without political boundaries. It is not, as some suggest, a battle between conservatives on one side and liberals on the other. Indeed, the flag amendment transcends all political, racial, religious, and socioeconomic divisions. This is consistently reflected in national polling, in resolutions to Congress from 49 State legislatures requesting Congress to send the flag amendment to the States for ratification, and in the support of a bipartisan supermajority of the House of Representatives both last year and during the 104th Congress. 
   Is this overwhelming support for the flag amendment, as manifested through polling and through the actions of State and national legislatures, frivolity? Are we trivializing the Constitution, when a vast majority of Americans speaking for themselves or through elected representatives seek to utilize the article V amendment process, itself constructed by our Founding Fathers to right the wrongs of constitutional misinterpretation? Are we irresponsible if we simply restore the law as it existed for two centuries prior to two Supreme Court decisions, which were 5-4 decisions, hotly contested decisions? Does the principle of ``government by the people'' end where the self-professed ``experts'' convince themselves that the concerns of the overwhelming majority of ordinary citizens and their representatives are not important? 
   Is the Constitution, which establishes processes for its own amendment, wrong? I say it is the Constitution which establishes processes for its own amendment, and it is right. It says that the Constitution will be amended when two-thirds of the Congress and three-fourths of the States want to do so. It does not say that this procedure is reserved for issues that 
   some law professors think are important, or issues that would crumble the foundations of our great Republic. 
   If ``government by the people'' means anything, it means that the people can decide the fundamental questions concerning the checks and balances in our Government. The people can choose whether it is Congress or the Supreme Court that decides whether flag desecration is against the law. 
   I urge colleagues to think hard about what they consider to be ``important'' before they conclude that the Senate should ignore the people and what they think is important and what should be considered important before they conclude that the Senate should ignore the people's desire to make decisions about the Government which governs them. The flag amendment is the very essence of ``government by the people'' because it reflects the people's decision to give Congress a power that the Supreme Court has taken away. This question is very important. I urge my colleagues not to think that this body is above listening to the vast majority of citizens of this country who want to give Congress the ability to determine whether and how to protect the American flag. 
   People should not say that there are more important issues than this one. This issue involves the very fabric of our society, what we are all about, and what our children, we hope, will be all about. This issue is very important. Anybody who thinks otherwise is trivializing this very important issue and the 80 percent of the American people who are strongly for it. The other 20 percent are not strongly against it; only a small percentage of those are. The rest of them just don't know or don't care. 
   You should have been with those seven Congressional Medal of Honor recipients, Miss America, and a whole raft of other veterans outside as we talked about why this amendment is important. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I generally support the distinguished Senator from Kentucky on all campaign finance reform issues because I think he is one of the most learned people, if not the most learned person in this area and on many other occasions. On this issue I cannot. 
   I predicted back in 1989 it was unconstitutional when they passed the statute, which passed overwhelmingly by a lot of people who, today, when this amendment is finally voted upon, will vote against it. In other words, they passed the statute that would do what this amendment would allow the Congress, if it so chooses to do, to do. 
   It seemed illogical to me they are unwilling to do what really has to be done because we have had two statutory attempts to resolve the problem of physical desecration of our beloved American flag. Both times I predicted it was unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decisions, and both times they were held to be unconstitutional. So a statute is not going to do the job. 
   In spite of good intentions, the only way we can resolve this problem and do it effectively without taking anybody's rights away is to do what we are doing--not passing a constitutional amendment that prohibits physical desecration of the flag. We are passing a constitutional amendment that gives the Congress a coequal status with the judiciary, two coequal branches of Government to have the right to determine what to do with regard to the flag. That is what we intend to do. 
   I hope our colleagues will vote against this amendment because it  would undermine, of course, the constitutional amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at least the Senator is consistent because he opposes both the McConnell amendment and the flag amendment. 
   Having made that point, of the 36 Senators who voted for the McConnell ``statutory fix,'' shall we call the proposal, 30 are opponents of the flag-protection amendment. These 30 Senators apparently believe that some flag desecration should be prohibited. Voting for McConnell makes their first amendment arguments a mockery. 
   At least the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is consistent, because the McConnell amendment says, one, that flag desecration on Federal land with a stolen flag should be prohibited; two, damaging a flag belonging to the United States will be prohibited; or three, desecrating a flag intending to promote violence should be prohibited. 
   It reminds me of 1989 when a high percentage of Senators in this body, who claim to be against the constitutional amendment to prohibit desecration of our beloved flag, voted for the statutory anti-flag-desecration amendment. 
   If first amendment rights hold with regard to this constitutional amendment, that it would violate first amendment rights, then why wouldn't it have violated first amendment rights with regard to any statute that would prohibit desecration?  
   I think anyone can see the game that is going on; that is, that some of the folks wouldn't vote to protect the flag no matter what happens because they know the flag desecration amendment or a statutory amendment is not going to protect our flag because it will be stricken down as unconstitutional. I predicted it in both cases where the Supreme Court has stricken it down. 
   If one agrees that flag desecration is wrong, why limit it to these circumstances provided in the McConnell amendment? Why should it be legal to burn a flag in front of a crowd who loves flag desecration, or on television where people are at a safe distance, yet make it illegal to burn a flag in front of people who would be upset by that act? Why make it illegal to burn a Post Office flag but not a flag belonging to a hospital across the street? Why make it illegal for a lone camper to burn a flag in a campfire at a Yellowstone park, when it is legal to burn a flag before hundreds of children at a public school under current law? 
   To anyone interested in protecting the flag, these distinctions make no sense. That is what is amazing to me. There is such inconsistency. I personally believe that it is the elitist position that calls the 80 percent of Americans who believe we should sustain the dignity of our flag, of our national symbol, that we are somehow Neanderthals, the 80 percent of the people in this country who want to protect our national symbol from acts of physical desecration. 
   The funny thing about it, this amendment does not even do that. All this amendment does is restore the power to the Congress of the United States to be able to pass a statute if the Congress so chooses, something that we have to do by constitutional amendment if we want to be coequal with the judicial branch of Government. 
   Opponents of the constitutional amendment argue that this would be an unprecedented infringement on the freedom of speech, which does not satisfy James Madison's counsel that amendments 
   of the Constitution should be limited to ``certain great and extraordinary circumstances.'' Setting aside the fact that flag desecration is conduct, not speech, and that our freedom of speech is not absolute, these critics never fully address the fact that our Founding Fathers, James Madison in particular, saw protection of the flag as falling outside the scope of the first amendment and was more a matter of protecting national sovereignty. The original intent of the Nation's founders indicates the importance of protecting the flag as an symbol of American sovereignty. Madison and Jefferson consistently emphasized the legal significance of infractions on the physical integrity of the flag. 
   For example, one of Madison's earliest pronouncements concerned an incident in October 1800 when an Algerian ship forced a U.S. man of war--the George Washington--to haul down its flag and replace it with the flag from Algiers. As Secretary of State under Thomas Jefferson, Madison pronounced such a situation as a matter of international law, a dire invasion of sovereignty which ``on a fit occasion'' might be ``revised.'' 
   Madison continued his defense of the integrity of the flag when he pronounced an active flag defacement in the streets of an American city to be a violation of law. On June 22, 1807, when a British ship fired upon and ordered the lowering of an American frigate's flag, Madison told the British Ambassador ``that the attack.......was a detached, flagrant insult to the flag and sovereignty of the United States.'' Madison believed that ``the indignity offered to the sovereignty and flag of the Nation demands.....an honorable reparation.'' Madison's statements suggests his belief that protecting the physical integrity of the flag ensured the protections of the Nation's sovereignty. 
   This is the author of the Constitution. We have these people inconsistently voting for statutes--twice in the last 11 years--that are unconstitutional, that would, I suppose if you take their arguments on the floor, denigrate the first amendment to the Constitution. If this constitutional amendment is denigrating it, why isn't the statute they voted for denigrating it as well? 
   Madison did not conclude, as some defenders of the right to deface the flag contend, that the first amendment protected the rights of Americans to tear down a flag or that defacing the flag was a form of expression protected by the first amendment. On the contrary. It would appear that Madison had an intimate familiarity with the significance of protecting the physical integrity of the flag, especially as such protection related to the first amendment, which he helped draft and move through the First Congress. He knew there had been no intent to withdraw the traditional physical protection from the flag. 
   Madison and Jefferson intended for the Government to be able to protect the flag consistent with the Bill of Rights. This was based on their belief that obtaining sovereign treatment was distinct from an interest in protecting against the suppression of expression. Madison and Jefferson consistently demonstrated that they sought commerce, citizenship, and neutrality rights through the protection of the flag. They did not seek to suppress the expression of alternative ``ideas,'' ``messages,'' ``views,'' or ``meanings.'' 
   Although it is commonly asserted that Congress has never sent an amendment to the States to amend the Bill of Rights, this assertion is absolutely false. Even if you assume this amendment would lead to a violation of first amendment rights, it is absolutely false to think the Congress has never sent an amendment to the States to amend the Bill of Rights. Yet the Bill of Rights has been amended in some form on several occasions. For example, the 13th amendment amended the 5th amendment as interpreted in Dred Scott v. Sanford, to provide that the former slaves were not property subject to the due process clause, but were free men and women. 
   Further, the 14th amendment was interpreted in Bolling versus Sharpe, to have effectively amended the due process clause of the 5th amendment to apply equal protection principles to the Federal Government. 
   Moreover, in Engel versus Vitale, the Supreme Court circumscribed the 1st amendment rights of American school children by holding that the establishment clause precluded prayer in the public schools. 
   Each of these constitutional changes substantially modified the rights and correlative duties of affected parties from those originally envisioned by the Framers of the Bill of Rights. The change effected by the Engel versus Vitale decision did not expand rights, but restricted them by taking away the right of children to pray at school. 
   Further, there have always been numerous limits on free speech. We limit libelous and defamatory speech. We limit speech that constitutes ``fighting words.'' We limit speech that consists of falsely shouting ``fire'' in a crowded theater. We limit speech that is obscene. We limit speech that jeopardizes national security. And each of these limits balances an important governmental interest in protecting against an individual's right to engage in radical or dangerous speech. 
   Thus, the Bill of Rights has been amended numerous times and has consistently been interpreted to include limits on speech. The long legal tradition of accepting regulation of physically destructive conduct toward the flag is consistent with these limits that balance society's interest in promoting respect for the nation with an individual's interest in sending a particular message by means of desecrating our beloved flag. The proposed amendment would effect a much smaller change than the other amendments listed and a much narrower limit on speech than the other limits mentioned. The amendment would simply restore the traditional right of the people to protect the physical integrity of their flag, something that existed 200 years before the Supreme Court struck it down. Protestors would still be free to speak their opinions about the flag at a rally, write their opinions about the flag to their newspaper, and vote their opinions at the ballot box. 
   Most of the American people, men and women, black, brown, and white, support the flag protection amendment and 49 State legislatures have asked for the flag protection amendment. Accordingly, I believe we should send the flag protection amendment to the States for ratification. 
   The argument that we have never amended the Bill of Rights or limited  speech is absurd; it is false, and, in any event, the flag protection amendment would change only the results of a few recent court decisions to restore the true meaning of the Bill of Rights as ratified by our forefathers. 
   This proposed amendment recognizes and ratifies our Founding Fathers' view--and the constitutional law that existed for nearly 200 years--that the American flag is an important and unique incident or symbol of our national sovereignty. As Americans, we display the flag in order to signify national ownership and protection. The Founding Fathers made clear that the flag, and its physical requirements, related to the existence and sovereignty of the United States and that desecration of the flag were matters of national concern that warranted government action. 
   This same sovereignty interest does not exist for our national monuments or our other symbols. While they are important to us all, the flag is unique. It is flown over our ships and national buildings. We took the flag to, and planted it for eternity, on the Moon. We carry it into battle. We salute it and pledge allegiance to it. Men and women have died for it and have been tortured for their fidelity to it. 
   Senator MCCAIN, in appearing before our committee, told of one of the experiences he had when he was in the Hanoi prison with others of our men. He said there was a young man who literally could not afford shoes. He had no shoes until he was 13 years of age. He was raised in poverty. But when he joined the military, he stood out as a really fine human being, and ultimately he went to officer's candidate school. 
   Flying over Vietnam, he was shot down. When he arrived in the Hanoi prison, if I recall it correctly, he took a bamboo needle and he knitted together little bits of cloth to make an American flag, and he put it inside his shirt. Every night, he would bring out that flag and put it on the wall, and they would all salute and pledge allegiance to it. It was one of the things that kept them from going insane. 
   One day his captors found him with that flag and took him outside and beat him within an inch of his life. Of course, they took his flag from him. Then they tossed his broken and bleeding body inside the compound which had a concrete slab in the middle. Senator MCCAIN may tell this story because he can tell it better than I can having been there. I think it is worthwhile to retell it. 
   Senator MCCAIN said they picked him up and cleaned him up as best they could in those very tragic circumstances. He was all black and blue with his eyes shut from having been beaten. They had incandescent light bulbs on all day long, every day, and all night long, every night. As they all went to sleep, suddenly Senator MCCAIN looked up and here was this young military man sitting there with another bamboo needle getting little bits of cloth to make another American flag. 
   To be honest with you, that flag meant an awful lot to those people who were under those very terrible circumstances. It means a lot to me. 
   Opponents of this proposed constitutional amendment argue this would be an unprecedented infringement on the freedom of speech which does not satisfy James Madison's counsel that amendments to the Constitution should be limited to ``certain great and extraordinary circumstances.'' 
   Setting aside the fact that flag desecration is conduct not speech and that our freedom of speech is not absolute, what these critics never fully address is the fact that our Founding Fathers, James Madison in particular, saw protection of the flag as falling outside the scope of the first amendment and was more a matter of protecting national sovereignty. The original intent of the Nation's founders indicates the importance of protecting the flag as an incident of American sovereignty. Madison and others did that. 
   We took this flag, as I said, and planted it for eternity on the Moon. We carry it into battle. We salute it and pledge allegiance to it. Men and women have died for it and have been tortured for their fidelity to it. 
   As Americans we recognize and believe that the flag is our unique symbol of unity and sovereignty. As Madison noted, the flag is a unique incident which, when desecrated, ``demands an honorable reparation.'' 
   That was how we viewed it--as a people, as a nation--until 1989 when the Court handed down its 5-4 decision in the Johnson case. Are we really going to stand here on the floor of the Senate and pretend that the law never was as it was? Does anyone here believe that two narrow Supreme Court decisions should settle whether we as a nation should and can safeguard our symbol of sovereignty? 
   There are opponents to S.J. Res. 14 who argue that our flag--this incident of sovereignty--is not important enough to amend the Constitution; that amending the Constitution requires a ``great and extraordinary occasion.'' Tell that to the young man in Vietnam. For reasons I have stated, the Supreme Court's decisions in the Johnson and Eichman cases--decisions which overturned centuries of law and practice--more than meets Senator LEAHY's test. Senator KERREY's test, and others. It certainly meets it more than the 27th amendment which dealt with pay raises for members of Congress or the 16th amendment which gave Congress the power to impose an income tax. I can understand why some in Congress would view the 16th amendment as one of Congress' finest moments, not that I ever have. In fact, my State of Utah was one of only three States to reject the 16th amendment. 
   The flag amendment presents this Congress with an opportunity to do something great and extraordinary. It is anything but an abdication of responsibility. Indeed, one could argue that, failure to vote for this amendment is an abdication of our responsibility and that restoring the power of Congress the power to prohibit acts of desecration against our symbol of national sovereignty would be a great and extraordinary occasion.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that Chairman HYDE, Senator LEAHY and I reached an agreement with the Department of Justice and Senators SESSIONS and SCHUMER yesterday on civil forfeiture reform legislation. This is an important issue, and I am proud to support this legislation. While civil forfeiture is a valuable law enforcement tool, it has become increasingly clear that some reform of civil forfeiture law is necessary given the numerous controversial seizures of property in the last decade. 
   Federal civil forfeiture procedures, which are based largely on 19th century admiralty law, provide inadequate protections for private property. For example, under current Federal law, once the government seizes property, the burden of proof is on the property owner to prove that the property is not subject to forfeiture. After property is seized, the property owner must post a cost bond in order to contest the forfeiture. This bond requirement does not entitle the property owner to the return of the property, but merely allows the claimant to contest the forfeiture. If the property owner files a claim to the property, the government has up to five years to file a complaint for forfeiture. 
   The legislation agreed to today increases protections for property owners, while respecting the interests of law enforcement. Among other provisions, the bill places the burden of proof in civil forfeiture cases on the government throughout the proceeding; places reasonable time limits on the government in civil forfeiture actions; awards attorney fees and costs to property owners who prevail against the government in civil forfeiture cases; authorizes the court to release property pending trial in appropriate circumstances; eliminates the cost bond; and provides a uniform innocent owner defense to all federal civil forfeitures affected by the bill. 
   All of us here are committed to depriving criminals of the proceeds of crime. To further this goal, the bill increases the ability of the Justice Department to target criminal proceeds. The bill also extends criminal forfeiture authority to any Federal statute in which civil forfeiture authority exists in order to encourage the use of criminal forfeiture. In addition, the bill contains several mechanisms to deter and punish frivolous claims to seized property. Senator SESSIONS will describe these provisions in detail. 
   A broad coalition of organizations support this bill, including the Chamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association, the National Association of Homebuilders, the National Association of Relators, the Institute for Justice, Americans for Tax Reform, the National Rifle Association, the American Bar Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In addition, six former Attorneys General--William Barr, Richard Thornburg, Edwin Meese, Benjamin Civiletti, Griffin Bell, and Nicholas Katzenbach--have endorsed the bill. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Senators SESSIONS and SCHUMER for their patience and cooperation. This agreement would not be possible without their hard work and dedication. Senator SESSIONS is to be especially commended. As a former United States Attorney and state Attorney General, he has more experience in civil forfeiture actions that any member of Congress. Senator SESSIONS has been an outstanding representative of the law enforcement community, and I am proud to have his support. 
   Finally, I would like to thank House Judiciary Chairman HENRY HYDE. No one has done more to advance the cause of civil forfeiture reform than Chairman HYDE. His 1995 book on civil forfeiture helped draw national attention to the need for reform. Last June, the House overwhelmingly passed the Hyde-Conyers civil forfeiture reform bill. This victory for forfeiture reform was due in large measure to HENRY HYDE's stature and commitment. 
   Thank you for your attention to this important reform legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a very significant bill--the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Protection and Privacy Act. 
   There is a gun control frenzy taking place in Washington. There are about 1,070 bills either regulating or dealing with firearms pending in the House and Senate. These range from imposing new Federal regulatory standards on the manufacture of firearms to those requiring background checks at gun shows. And President Clinton has written a letter informing me that he will not sign long overdue, worthwhile and comprehensive youth violence legislation unless it includes most of this gun control agenda. 
   I have become convinced that, for conscientious and reasonable defenders of the Second Amendment, it is not enough to simply oppose the gun control communities legislative agenda. Instead, we just redouble our efforts and set out to pass an affirmative legislative agenda which safeguards the right to keep and bear arms. 
   Many gun control advocates claim that it is not their goal to interfere with the rights of law abiding gun owners. Many question sincerity. The bill I am introducing today will afford gun control advocates the opportunity to prove their critics wrong. This important bill is a first step in what I hope will become a bipartisan campaign to safeguard the rights of law abiding gun owners. 
   Simply put, this plainly written bill would end burdensome and frivolous suits against law abiding firearm manufacturers, dealers, and owners, and preclude new ones, except in those cases where plaintiffs could show that the manufacturer or seller knew that the firearm would be used to commit a Federal or State crime. Thus, if it can be shown that manufacturers and sellers knew that a specific product would be used to a commit crime, then they will be subject to a civil action, if not a criminal prosecution. The provision also has the beneficial effect of striking a blow against ``legislation through litigation,'' which has enriched the trial lawyers while harming many of our nation's law abiding citizens and businesses. 
   In addition, the bill also addresses the concerns of gun owners and advocates of the Second Amendment that the federal regulatory process will be misused by the government to abridge the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The bill thus contains the following provisions: (1) a prohibition against the government charging a background check fee in connection with the transfer of a firearm; (2) a gun owner privacy protection component which requires immediate destruction of background check records for approved firearms buyers; and (3) establishes a civil remedy for private citizens aggrieved by government violations of the background check fee or gun owner privacy provisions. After all, if firearms manufacturers 
   should be subjected to civil liability for illegal acts, why shouldn't the government be liable if a law abiding gun owner's privacy protections are violated? 
   As a Senior proudly representing the people of Utah, I take seriously our oath of office to defend our Union's defining document--the Constitution of the United States. I truly concur with the remarks of the great British Prime Minister William Gladstone when he wrote in 1878 that the ``American Constitution is *.*.* the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.'' 
   So too, I am an avid supporter of the Second Amendment. I believe, following the teachings of virtually all the Founders of our Republic, that the right of citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as, in the words of the learned Justice Joseph Story, ``the palladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation  and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.'' 
   It is astonishing to me that despite this pedigree of the Second Amendment, the enemies of the right to keep and bear arms, those advocates of state-ism and the politics of the left, have stooped to new lows in their crusade to diminish the God-given liberties of the American people. Seeing that radical gun control measures are unpopular and cannot pass Congress and state legislatures, those hostile to the Second Amendment have resorted to a new tactic in a not-so-veiled attempt to undermine the right to keep and bear arms. 
   They have resorted to misusing our civil litigation system by bringing law suits against the source of guns: firearms manufacturers. They seek damages from firearms manufacturers for any harm caused by gun wielding criminals, even though the manufacturers are not responsible for the crimes. This violates traditional precepts of American law, which is based upon the free-will notion that only those responsible should be held liable. 
   More specifically, over the past few years the firearms manufacturing industry has been subjected to these numerous ``junk'' lawsuits seeking damages or injunctive relief for harm caused by third-party criminal actors. Many of these cases have been brought by local government entities, including approximately thirty American cities. The Clinton Administration had announced that it would support these lawsuits and publicly threatened that the Department of Housing and Urban Development would commence an action against the firearms manufacturers. 
   Generally, the plaintiffs in these cases argue that although the firearms are legal products and despite the criminal actions of third parties, manufacturers and sellers should be held liable because of the negligent fashion in which they designed, marketed, and sold their products. This novel theory stands traditional tort law on its head. 
   These radical lawsuits are onerous and may well bankrupt many firearms manufacturers. 
   If a maverick judge were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs in one of these cases, the industry could face financial ruin. Indeed, the Louisiana state judge handling the City of New Orleans lawsuit recently refused to dismiss that lawsuit notwithstanding the enactment of a state law that nullified the cause of action. The net result may very well be the disappearance of a lawful product--firearms--from interstate commerce. 
   Let me mention a junk lawsuit brought by the City of Chicago against 12 suburban gun shops, 22 gun manufacturers, and four gun distributors. The Chicago Tribune, in an editorial dated November 14, 1998, agreed that the mayor's anger at the misuse of handguns was understandable, but called his lawsuit ``wrongheaded and ill-advised'' because ``it represents an abuse of the tort liability system and a dangerous extension of the tactic employed in similar lawsuits against the tobacco industry of using potentially bankrupting lawsuits to force makers of legal but unpopular products to quit.'' 
   To one federal district court, such lawsuits are ``an obvious attempt unwise and unwarranted to ban or restrict handguns through courts and juries, despite the repeated refusals of state legislatures and Congress to pass strong, comprehensive gun-control measures.'' [Patterson v. Rohm Gessellschaft, 608 F. Supp. 1206, 1211 (N.D. Tex. 1985)]. 
   Indeed, in characterizing the federal lawsuit against the tobacco producers and the HUD suit threatened against the firearms industries, and in complete candor, former Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich noted that:  
   *.*.*.the biggest problem is that these lawsuits are end runs around the democratic process. We used to be a nation of laws, but this new strategy presents novel means of legislating--within settlement negotiations of large civil suits initiated by the executive branch. This is faux legislation that sacrifices democracy to the discretion of administrative officials operating in secrecy.  
   [Robert Reich, ``Don't Democrats Believe in Democracy,'' The Wall Street Journal, Wednesday, January 12, 2000]. 
   Furthermore, these junk lawsuits seek to reverse the well-established tort law principle that manufacturers are not responsible for the criminal misuse of their products. For instance, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Martin v. Harrington and Richardson, Inc., [743 F. 2d 1200, 1205 (7th Cir. 1984)], held that criminal misuse of a handgun breaks the causal connection between the manufacturers action and the injury ``because such criminal activity is not reasonably forseeable.'' 
   A judge from a federal district court noted that ``under all ordinary and normal circumstances in the absence of any reason to expect the contrary, the actor may reasonably proceed with the assumption that others will obey the criminal law.'' [Bennett v. The Cincinnati 
   Checker Cab, 353 F.Supp. 1206, 1209 (E.D. Kent, 1973)]. It is important to note that in his opinion the judge cited the noted tort expert, the late Professor Prosser, for the proposition that entities are not liable for criminal acts of others because such acts are generally unforeseeable and thereby cut the chain of proximate causation. [Prosser, Torts, 3d ed. at 176]. 
   Moreover, these lawsuits suffer from the same defect that some, if not all, of the courts in the federal tobacco lawsuit suffer from: lack of standing. Government entities, absent specific statutory authority--which is not present in either the federal tobacco case or these gun manufacturers cases--may not recoup medical and other expenses paid by government agencies from manufacturers of products alleged to cause the harm to ``third party'' beneficiaries of government programs. For instance let me mention two cases. Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., [503 U.S. 258, 268-69 (1992)] and Laborers Local 17 Health Benefit Fund v. Phillip Morris, [191 F. 3d 229 (2nd Cir. 1999)]. These cases stand for the proposition that a complaint is too ``remote'' when a plaintiff seeks to recover damage to a third party. Therefore, the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the suit. 
   This is exactly what Connecticut Superior Court Judge Robert McWeeny held when he recently dismissed the City of Bridgport's ``junk lawsuit'' complaint for recoupment against Smith & Wesson. [Ganim v. Smith & Wesson, [No. CV 000003198S (Superior Ct. Conn., Dec. 10, 1999)]]. 
   Our judiciary is being transformed by these misguided advocates of gun control from courts of justice into tribunals of the gun control lobby. That is why this legislation is needed. The Congress has both a duty to protect federal constitutional rights such as the right to keep and bear arms, as well as to step in and reform our tort system when it is being abused and the abuse has a significant impact on interstate commerce. 
   Let me say a few words about last Friday's announcement of the agreement between Smith & Wesson and HUD. Basically, the agreement mandates that Smith & Wesson would provide trigger locks within 60 days and make their handguns child resistant within a year. Smith & Wesson also agreed to a ``code of conduct'' whereby the manufacturer would sell its products only to ``authorized dealers and distributors'' who agree to have their contract terminated if ``a disproportionate number'' of crimes were traced to the firearms they sell. Some sort of outside board will police the settlement. In return, the federal government agreed not to bring suit against the firearms manufacturer and eleven of the thirty cities and local governments dropped their actions. 
   I believe that this so-called ``deal'' is the latest attempt by the Administration to play on the fear of the American people for pure political advantage. It makes the Administration look 
   good. It makes it seem that the Administration is doing ``something'' about gun violence. But the record makes clear that the Administration has done little to enforce the federal laws on the books against gun wielding criminals. So this settlement masks the truth. The Administration has been inept in preventing gun violence. 
   Let me say, first of all, that I don't believe that the Administration ever really intended to see its lawsuit against the firearms manufacturers to verdict. Indeed, in announcing the projected lawsuit against the gun manufacturers, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo admitted to the press that the whole effort was simply a bargaining ploy. 
   So let's call it what the federal lawsuit really is: extortion. It is an attempt to bypass the legislative process  and the Constitution to achieve a gun control agenda that the public's elected officials oppose. Sue the industry and have them cave in or face imminent financial ruin by having to defend an avalanche of legally dubious lawsuits and bad publicity. That's their game plan. 
   Well, Smith & Wesson caved in. Why? Published reports have it that the owner of Smith & Wesson, Tompkins PLC of Great Britain, could not find a buyer for the $161 million company with lawsuits hanging over its head. And Tompkins understands that three California gun companies have gone out of business and that legal fees may very well bankrupt the industry. So Tompkins surrendered. 
   And the reward for their surrender: it was announced on Saturday that HUD and the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit and Miami directed their law enforcement agencies to give preferences to Smith & Wesson when purchasing firearms. [``Smith & Wesson Earns Preference,'' @ Home Network, AP, March 18, 2000] This is outrageous. Not only does this deal undercut the Second Amendment, it undercuts the principle of competitive bidding. It creates an incentive that tax payers will be gouged. It punishes innocent firearms manufacturers. It weakens the rule of law because innocent manufacturers are denied their day in court. It weakens democracy because the heavy hand of big government is used as a tool of despotism. 
   But it is the ``code of conduct'' term of the settlement that is the most peculiar. Again, this provision mandates that Smith & Wesson sell its products only to ``authorized dealers and distributors'' who agree to have their contracts terminated if ``a disproportionate number'' of crimes are traced to the firearms they sell. Well, how is this to be determined? What is a disproportionate number of crimes? And how will this be traced to the dealer or distributor? And what if the dealer or distributor were innocent of any wrongdoing? 
   It seems to me that this settlement term suffers from the same defect as the underlying 
   ``junk lawsuits''--innocent parties are being held liable for the criminal acts of third parties. 
   The settlement represents the misuse of governmental power. It represents a weakening of our democracy and the rule of law. 
   Mr. President, let me turn to the provisions of the bill that will (1) prevent illicit fees to be charged for background checks, and (2) that protect the privacy of gun owners from federal intrusion. 
   The Brady Handgun Control Act of 1993 is silent on whether the government may charge a fee for the instant background check required under 18 U.S.C. &#167;922(t). And let me add that it was never contemplated that the government would charge such a fee when Brady was debated and passed. 
   Nonetheless, despite no explicit legal authority, the Administration has repeatedly attempted to require the payment of such a fee by licensed firearms dealers--which fees would almost surely be passed along to purchasers through higher prices. This would truly amount to ``taxation without representation.'' 
   Section 5 of our bill adds Section 540C to Title 28. This new section prohibits the Administration from promulgating a tax without Congress' approval. It codifies a prohibition on charging or collecting ``any fee in connection with any background check required in connection with the transfer of a firearm.'' The prohibition would apply both to the Federal government and ``State or local officers or employees acting on behalf of the United States.'' 
   This section thus prohibits an unauthorized fee that may be considered to be a ``tax'' on the exercise of a constitutional right--in this case, to buy a firearm. 
   Finally, under the Brady bill, if the instant background check reveals that the buyer is eligible to purchase the firearm, the government is required to ``destroy all records of the system with respect to the call and all records of the system relating to the person or the transfer.'' [18 U.S.C. &#167;922(t)(2)(C)]. The Brady bill also prohibits the government from using the instant check system to establish a registry of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transfers, except with respect to persons prohibited from receiving a firearm. [Pub. L. 103-159, Sec. 103(i)]. 
   Despite the law, the Administration promulgated regulations in 1998 that allowed the FBI to retain for 6 months information pertinent to an approved firearms sale gathered as part of the 
   instant check system. [See C.F.R. &#167;25.9(b)(1)]. 
   But, I concur with those Second Amendment advocates who view these record retention periods as veiled attempts by the government to establish a national firearms registry. Furthermore, the only way to ensure the privacy and security of the information in the instant check system is to immediately destroy the records of approved firearms transfers. 
   To address these concerns and preempt the Administration's efforts to undermine the Brady bill's ban on a national firearms registry, my bill would establish a new statute, Section 931 to title 18, that would prohibit the use of the instant check system unless the system ``require[s] and result[s] in the immediate destruction of all information, in any form whatsoever or through any medium,'' about any person determined not to be prohibited from receiving a firearm. 
   The destruction requirement, however, would not apply to (1) ``any unique identification number provided by the [instant check] system,'' or (2) ``the date on which that number is provided.'' These exceptions parallel the exceptions contained in the Brady bill [see 18 U.S.C. &#167;922(t)(2)(C)] and allow the government to trace a firearm to a dealer, but not to a purchaser. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to prevent extortion against the manufacturers of a lawful product, firearms. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to prohibit a tax on the exercise of constitutional right--the Second Amendment's guarantee of the right of the American citizen to keep and bear arms. And I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that protects the privacy of citizens who lawfully and peaceably possess firearms from federal intrusion.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week the Senate acted resoundingly and passed the critically needed conference report for funding the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). I commend the efforts of our majority leader, Senator LOTT, the Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator STEVENS, and Budget Committee chairman, Senator DOMENICI. My colleagues here and over in the House have worked hard to arrive at this consensus. Both as a Senator and frequent flyer, I appreciate their efforts. 
   At this time, I would like to reiterate several points I made during last year's debate in the Senate having to do with allowing exemptions to the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. I believe that the conference report balances the interests of states inside the perimeter with those of us from Western States who lack convenient access to Reagan National. 
   I know my colleagues are aware of my support for efforts to ensure that these limited exemptions must benefit citizens throughout the West. I believe we must make it clear that these limited number of exemptions should not be awarded solely or disproportionately to one carrier. I fully anticipate that the Department of Transportation will ensure that the maximum number of cities benefit from these slots. 
   While I would have preferred to eliminate the perimeter rule altogether, which I believe would have substantially improved access to the West, I am hopeful that DOT will ensure that small and midsized communities in West, especially in the Northern tier, have improved access through hubs like Salt Lake City. 
   I believe an important component of aviation reform is to improve air service for communities that have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to the extent large markets have. Today, Utahns must double or even triple connect to fly into Reagan National. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the DOT to ensure that citizens in the west have improved access and a variety of options when they travel.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in strong support for H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, which the Senate will begin considering tomorrow. 
   Seniors in my home State of Utah and around the nation have waited a long time for the relief H.R. 5 will bring. I am so pleased that not only did the House pass this bill on March 1 by a vote of 422 to 0, and the Senate is very likely to follow suit tomorrow, but also that the President has finally come around and has indicated he will sign the bill. 
   Under current law, over 800,000 Social Security recipients between the ages of 65 and 70 are affected by the so-called earnings limit. Over 6,100 of these live in Utah. This limit provides that senior citizens who this year earn more than $17,000 in wages or self-employment income will lose some of their Social Security benefits. More specifically, for every $3 earned over the $17,000 threshold, $1 in benefits is lost. The bill we will take up tomorrow will remove this unfair limitation. 
   There are at least five reasons why H.R. 5 should be passed by this body with a resounding margin so this oppressive limitation, which holds back senior citizens to the detriment of everybody in this country, can be lifted. 
   First, the earnings limit is plainly unfair to senior citizens. What kind of a message does the current law send to a worker turning age 65, Mr. President, when he or she learns that there will be a 33 percent penalty for continuing to work once his or her earnings exceed $17,000? 
   Yet, at the same time, senior citizens who are fortunate enough to have interest, dividend, or capital gains income from stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, or income from a private pension, are not penalized, no matter how much of these kinds of income they receive. Even if the earnings limit otherwise had merit, which it doesn't, it punishes the very people who most need to work to makes ends meet. 
   Second, the earnings limit is outdated. The limit was a feature of the original Social Security Act in 1935. It was included to encourage seniors to retire so their jobs 
   would be available to the millions of younger workers who were unemployed in the difficult job market of the Great Depression. That was a different era. What was appropriate in 1935 is clearly not appropriate in 2000, when it is workers, not jobs, that are scarce. 
   Third, the earnings limit places extremely high marginal tax rates on workers between the ages of 65 and 70 who continue to work. Consider the example of a 66-year-old plumber I will call Howard. Along with his son, Howard has run a small plumbing business in Ogden, UT, for over 20 years. Now that he is over 65, Howard has decided to turn the management of the business over to his son. However, Howard still wants to work, and because of an aged mother whom he takes care of, he still needs some income. Howard works three days a week and earns $35,000 per year. 
   Believe it or not, when the earnings limit penalty of 33 percent is combined with the income tax rate of 28 percent, the self-employment tax rate of 15.3 percent, and the effect of taxing his Social Security benefits at 85 percent, Howard faces a marginal tax bracket of 88.8 percent, not counting the Utah income tax. This high a marginal tax rate is unconscionable and indefensible any way you look at it. 
   Fourth, the earnings limit is terrible for our economy. The biggest problem our economy faces right now is a severe shortage of workers. This is especially true in the high technology fields, where our shortages are so severe that we must increase the number of H-1B visas allowed this year so our high tech firms can stay competitive. 
   However, turning to overseas workers is only a temporary solution. We need a long-term answer to this problem, which is only going to be exacerbated by current demographic trends, and the retirement of the baby boom generation. Our senior citizens are a wonderful resource that is not being tapped enough. Only 17 percent of males over age 65 are now working, compared with 47 percent in 1948. These workers are experienced, and in many cases, they want to keep working. In  order for this to happen, though, we need to scuttle outdated relics like this Social Security earnings test. 
   Finally, the earnings limit 
   is no longer relevant, considering the growing longevity of Americans. In 1935, when the earnings limit was added to the Social Security Act, life expectancy in this country was 62 years. Now, it is 77 years. Moreover, senior citizens are the fastest growing segment of our population. There is absolutely no reason these citizens cannot keep on working if they desire to do so. I have read articles that the life expectancy of the American people may soon be approaching 85. 
   Therefore, I am very gratified to see that this earnings limit repeal is about to pass the Senate. And again, I am especially pleased that President Clinton has agreed to put aside election year politics and sign this legislation. 
   As important and long awaited this earnings limit repeal is, I want to emphasize that it does not lessen the need for comprehensive Social Security reform. Besides the repeal of the earnings test, there are many other vital issues that must be addressed to ensure the long-term viability of the system. These include the large and difficult question of how to best increase the system's rate of return in order to lessen the need for any benefit cuts or payroll tax increases once the Social Security trust fund runs out of spending authority. Other important issues that need to be addressed in the context of fundamental Social Security reform include work disincentives for blind workers. 
   Many of our blind citizens are also subject to a type of limit on their earnings, in which they lose Social Security disability payments once their earnings reach $14,040 per year. For many of the same reasons that the earnings limit is unfair to senior citizens, the ``substantial gainful activity'' limit is unfair to those workers disabled by blindness. 
   I wish H.R. 5 could accommodate this unfairness by ameliorating this earnings limit and removing the disincentive these workers face today. I wish President Clinton would have used some of his political capital in this final year of his Presidency to lead the way to major Social Security reform. Regrettably, the President has made it clear that broad reform will have to wait for the leadership of another President. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes for H.R. 5 and let's finally repeal the unfair earnings limit on senior citizens. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was listening in the past hour to the eloquent statement of Senator MURKOWSKI explaining why the Ninth Circuit ought to be split. His statement comes 2 days after Senator MURKOWSKI and I introduced legislation that would split that circuit into two more manageable circuits. 
   It strikes me that this subject is precisely the one that this body ought to be debating today as the real solution to the stated concerns about the Ninth Circuit. 
   As I explained recently on the Senate floor, the massive size of the circuit's boundaries has confronted the circuit's judges with a real difficulty in maintaining the coherence of its circuit law. 
   I will not let my concerns regarding the Ninth Circuit--many of which appear to me to be structural in dimension--affect my judgment on the confirmation of Judge Paez, who is an innocent party with regard to that circuit's dubious record. Doing so would force him into the role of Atlas in carrying problems not of his own making. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of federal district Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   I have to say, I have served a number of years in the Senate, and I have never seen a ``motion to postpone indefinitely'' that was brought to delay the consideration of a judicial nomination post-cloture. 
   Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could still delay a final vote on a nomination. A parliamentary ruling to this effect means that, after today, our cloture rule is further weakened. 
   But on occasion, like Justice Holmes' statement about the law, the life of the Senate is not logic but experience. And I have no interest in quibbling further with this ruling. 
   As I turn to the merits of the situation before us, I want to begin by commending the efforts of my colleague from Alabama for his legal acumen and tenacity in presenting his case why a further postponement in considering Judge Paez's nomination would be warranted. I am proud to have worked with Senator SESSIONS on legislation involving civil asset forfeiture, and involving youth violence, and a whole raft of other issues, as well. Senator SESSIONS' prosecutorial talents have not left him, and my respect for him as a principled advocate has never been greater than today. 
   The same goes for Senator SMITH. 
   Still, I must take exception to the point that he has so forcefully advocated. I must explain why the time has finally come for an up-or-down vote to be cast on Judge Paez's nomination. 
   Senator SESSIONS' request for a postponement is grounded in Judge Paez's handling of the Government's case against John Huang. 
   Let us begin with the determinative fact: Though Mr. Huang may have been involved in illegalities in connection with the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign of 1996, he was not charged with a single such count. 
   The Assistant United States Attorney who was asked why no such charges were brought responded by saying that: ``we investigated all the allegations and felt that the charges in this case fully addressed his culpability.'' 
   Ultimately, Mr. Huang pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of conspiring to violate Federal election law. In that plea, he admitted to laundering a $2,500 contribution to an unsuccessful contestant in Los Angeles' 1993 mayoral campaign, and $5,000 to an entity called the California Victory Fund '94, the funds of which were shared by a Democrat candidate, the Democratic Party, and two Democrat committees. 
   Prosecutors--in exchange for Mr. Huang's guilty plea to this single charge--recommended that Mr. Huang receive no jail time, but instead be ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and provide 500 hours of community service. 
   Judge Paez accepted the prosecutor's recommendation, which was consistent, by the way, with the report of the probation office. 
   So with this factual premise, I would like to address Senator SESSIONS' argument that Mr. Huang's sentence--which he concedes was the one recommended by the prosecution--was insufficiently harsh. 
   From that premise, there are only a few possibilities: 
   First, that Judge Paez should have ignored the Federal prosecutors and handed down a stiffer penalty than the one they recommended. But let's consider this. From a man like Senator SESSIONS who believes--as I do--in judicial restraint, it is anomalous to suggest that judges should depart from the adversarial system and impose their own view of an appropriate punishment. 
   A second alternative is that the prosecution should have recommended a stronger punishment, and that Judge Paez ought to have accepted it. That may indeed be correct. I am on record as expressing similar concern about the level of punishment sought. I am very upset about what the prosecutors did in this matter. 
   But the problem with this hypothesis is that it is just that --a hypothesis. The prosecution did not recommend a stronger sentence. And we should not castigate Judge Paez for the acts of another--in this case, the prosecution--by holding him accountable for the prosecution's failure to make a stronger case against John Huang. 
   In any event, neither of these scenarios is one in which Judge Paez can fairly be faulted for not 
   acting more aggressively. 
   Of course, there is nothing to suggest any sort of impropriety pursuant to which Judge Paez acted in sync with prosecutors to ensure a lenient handling of a case so sensitive to the Clinton administration. Nor is there any evidence at all to suggest that a departure was made in this case from the automated, random case-assignment system utilized in the Federal court for the Central District of California. 
   Yes, I believe some inside and outside this administration have engaged in fraud upon fraud against the laws, ethical norms, and the people of this country. 
   But I cannot accept, in the absence of any supporting evidence, that two  branches of Government engaged in a conspiracy to alleviate a defendant of responsibility for violations of Federal law. 
   This speculative theory should not become the basis for any further delay by the United States Senate. There is no reasonable basis--let alone any hint of evidence--to suggest that further delay would amount to anything other than further delay. 
   Of course, I can understand and appreciate fully why it is that some of my colleagues remain so dubious about the results of the Huang prosecution. It is because that prosecution was born out of an egregious conflict of interest with the President's own prosecutors--subject always to his own oversight and control--being asked to investigate a matter that, if ultimately prosecuted in an appropriately zealous fashion, could have led to enormous embarrassment to the President. 
   The result is that the prosecution's decision not to prosecute any of the wrongdoing alleged in connection with the President's reelection campaign can be objectively viewed as a cover-up, and as favoritism to the President. No less a person than Senator SESSIONS, among many others in this body, retain such doubts. And if they have doubts, it is to be expected that the American people have doubts, thereby undermining the public's faith in the rule of law in this country. 
   This is precisely why I called so insistently upon our Attorney General to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate all alleged illegalities involving our Federal campaign laws in connection with the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. 
   The Judiciary Committee, under my direction, was the first to formally request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate alleged illegalities in connection with the President's 1996 reelection campaign. And the Judiciary Committee has formed a formal task force, led by Senator SPECTER, to inquire into the Department of Justice's handling of this and other campaign finance investigations. 
   But for purposes of our vote today, the determinative point is that our concerns about the manner in which our Federal campaign finance laws have been flouted do not at all implicate Judge Paez. 
   So we must now proceed to put this matter to a vote, and end the lengthy delay in this matter by choosing--on the basis of the abundant evidence known to us at this time--whether it shall be yea or nay on Judge Paez' nomination. No further information or delay is needed to cast an intelligent and knowing vote on this nomination. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to make this statement.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the nominations of Ms. Berzon and Judge Paez, and spoke yesterday urging my colleagues to do the same. 
   I would hope my remarks prove persuasive. But if they do not, my colleagues of course are free to reasonably disagree with my view and to cast a vote against these candidates. 
   It is quite another story, however, for members of this body to frustrate a majority vote on these nominees by forcing a super-majority cloture vote. 
   I have reached this conclusion after having been part of this process for over 20 years now, and having served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for more than half a decade. 
   There are times when legislators must, to be effective, demonstrate their mastery of politics. But there are also times when politics--though available--must be foresworn.  
   I am reminded of the great quote of Disraeli, which I will now paraphrase--``next to knowing when to seize an opportunity, the most important thing is knowing when to forego an advantage.'' I hope my colleagues will forego the perceived advantage of a filibuster. 
   Simply put, there are certain areas that must be designated as off-limits from political activity. Statesmanship demands as much. The Senate's solemn role in confirming lifetime-appointed Article III judges--and the underlying principle that the Senate performs that role through the majority vote of its members--are such issues. Nothing less depends on the recognition of these principles than the continued, untarnished respect in which we hold our third branch of Government. 
   On the basis of this principle, I have always tried to be fair, no matter the President of the United States or the nominees. Even when I have opposed a nominee of the current President, I have voted for cloture to stop a filibuster of that nominee. That was the case with the nomination of Lee Sarokin. 
   To be sure, this body has on occasion engaged in the dubious practice of filibusters of judicial nominees. But such episodes have been infrequent and, I shall add, unfortunate. 
   During a number of occasions in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, my colleagues on the other side engaged in filibusters of judicial nominees. Frequently, they backed off, ostensibly realizing there were enough votes to stop a filibuster. 
   And just last year, I watched with sadness as the minority made history by filibustering one of its own party's nominees. Forcing a cloture vote on Clinton nominee Ted Stewart--who is now acquitting himself superbly as a district judge in Utah--reflected nothing more than a political gambit to force action on other judicial nominees. Fortunately, the effects of that 
   filibuster were short-lived, as the minority recognized the errors of its ways. 
   These unfortunate episodes do not a precedent make. The fact that these actions precede us does not establish a roadmap for the Senate's handling of future nominations. 
   Moreover, these filibusters were limited in number. During some of the Reagan and Bush years, I thought our colleagues on the other side did some reprehensible things in regard to Reagan and Bush judges. But by and large, the vast majority of them were put through without any real fuss or bother, even though my colleagues on the other side, had they been President, would not have appointed very many of those judges. We have to show the same good faith on our side, it seems to me. 
   My message against filibusters of judicial nominees is one I hope to make abundantly clear to my colleagues in the majority. This is so because, to the extent our majority party gives repeated credence to the practice of filibustering judicial nominees, we can expect the favor to be returned when the President is one of our own. We hope in earnest that the next President will hail from our party. And if we are gratified in that hope, how short-sighted it will have been that we gave a fresh precedent to the minority party in this body to defeat--by requiring not 51 but a full 60 votes--that Republican President's judicial nominees. 
   It is important to remember another reason against filibustering judicial nominees. Most of the fight over a nomination has occurred well before a nominee arrives at the Senate floor. Proverbial battles are fought between people in the White House and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
   As a general matter, when nominees get this far, most of them should be approved. Though there are some that we will continue to have problems with, it is our job to look at them in the Judiciary Committee. That is our job--to look into their background. It is our job to screen these candidates. 
   In the case of both Ms. Berzon and Judge Paez, each was reported favorably to the floor. And now we have the unusual situation of a Democrat President, the Republican and Democrat Senate Leaders, and Republican and Democrat Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, all agreeing that votes on the nominees should go forward. But certain Senators who oppose these nominees have nonetheless elected to thwart such votes. 
   At bottom, it is a travesty if we establish a routine of filibustering judges. We should not play politics with them.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of federal district Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Judge Paez was first nominated for this judgeship during the second session of the 104th Congress--a time when all nominees to the Ninth Circuit got bound up with the difficulties we were having in deciding whether to divide the Circuit. Once we established a Commission to study the matter, we were able to begin processing nominees to that court. 
   Judge Paez was renominated at the beginning of the 105th Congress, but due to questions surrounding his record on the bench and comments he made about two California initiatives, his nomination elicited heightened scrutiny. 
   Some have attributed this delay in Judge Paez's consideration by the full Senate to sinister or prejudicial motives. And I can only respond by stating what those very critics already know in their hearts and minds to be true: such aspersions are utterly devoid of truth, and are grounded in nothing more than sinister, crass politics. 
   As we all know, before any judge can be confirmed, the Senate must exercise its duty to provide assurance that those confirmed will uphold the Constitution and abide by the rule of law. Sometimes it takes what seems to be an inordinate amount of time to gain these assurances, but moving to a vote without them would compromise the integrity of the role the Senate plays in the confirmation process. 
   And so, it has taken a considerable amount of time to bring Judge Paez's nomination up for a vote. Indeed, it was not before a thorough and exhaustive review of Judge Paez's record that I have become convinced that questions regarding Judge Paez's record have, by and large, been answered. 
   Because such questions have been answered does not, in all instances, mean they have been answered to my complete satisfaction. But on the whole, I am persuaded that Judge Paez will be a credit to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In so concluding, I do not want to diminish the seriousness of the concerns raised about certain aspects of Judge Paez's record. 
   I was troubled by comments Judge Paez made about two California initiatives on April 6, 1995, while sitting as a U.S. District Court Judge. At that time, Judge Paez gave a speech at his alma mater, Boalt Hall School of Law, criticizing the passage of Proposition 187 and criticizing the ballot measure that would later be known as Proposition 209. He described Prop 209 as ``the proposed anti-civil rights initiative'' and said it would ``inflame the issues all over again, without contributing to any serious discussion of our differences and similarities or ways to ensure equal opportunity for all.'' Judge Paez went on to opine that a ``much more diverse bench'' was essential in part because how ``Californians perceive the justice system is every bit as important as how courts resolve disputes.'' 
   When questioned at his hearing about these and other comments contained in the speech, Judge Paez stated that he was referring only to the potential divisive effect Prop 209 would have on California. He acknowledged that the Ninth Circuit had in fact upheld the constitutionality of Prop 209 and that this 
   ruling resolved any question as to the legitimacy of the initiative. He also stated that he disagreed with the use of proportionality statistics in Title VII or employment litigation. And, perhaps most telling of his judicial philosophy, Judge Paez stated that federal judges must ``proceed with caution, and respect that the vote of the people is presumed constitutional.'' 
   Legitimate questions have been raised concerning whether his comments were consistent with the Judicial Canon governing judges' extra-judicial activities, and Judge Paez maintains that his remarks fit within the exception set out in that Canon that permits a judge to make a scholarly presentation for purposes of legal education. 
   I also raised concerns about a decision of Judge Paez's that would allow liability to be imposed on a U.S. company for human rights abuses committed by a foreign government with which the U.S. company had engaged in a joint venture. But it is a single moment in a lengthy catalog of cases in which Judge Paez appears to have handed down solid, legally-supported, precedent-respecting decisions. 
   Moreover, Judge Paez has earned a good deal of bipartisan support within his home state of California and his native state of Utah, and has given me his word that he will abide by the rule of law and not engage in judicial activism. 
   For these reasons, I am not willing to stand in the way of this nominee's confirmation. It was during the Committee's thorough review of his record that I became aware of Judge Paez's credentials and career of public service. He is a Salt Lake City native who graduated from Brigham Young University and he received his law degree from Boalt Hall. 
   Before becoming a Judge on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, he served as an attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, the Western Center on Law and Poverty, and the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles--and during that time provided legal representation to a Korean War veteran in danger of losing his home to foreclosure, victims of intentional racial discrimination, and others. In 1994, President Clinton nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Judge Paez to sit on the district court bench in the Central District of California. 
   Although I share many of my colleagues' concerns regarding the stability of the Ninth Circuit, none of us can in good conscience foist those concerns upon Judge Paez--an entirely innocent party with regard to that Circuit's dubious record of reversal by the Supreme Court--and force him into the role of Atlas in carrying problems not of his own making. 
   Indeed, that Circuit's problems--many of which appear to me to be structural in dimension--call for an altogether different solution than that which this body would seek to impose through its advice and consent powers. And to that end, I have just [this morning] introduced legislation with Senator MURKOWSKI that is being held at the desk so as to enable immediate action by the full Senate--that would divide the 28-judge behemoth of a circuit into two manageable circuits. 
   To return to the different subject of Judge Paez, I must concede that I have had concerns about his nomination. But on balance I do not believe that Judge Paez will contribute to the roguery that appears to have infiltrated this circuit. I would not, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, vote for the confirmation of any nominee who I believed would abdicate his or her duty to interpret and enforce, rather than make, the laws of this Nation. 
   For these reasons, I will cast a vote in favor of the nomination of Judge Paez to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I hope a majority of my colleagues will do likewise. 
   Mr. President, I also rise to speak on behalf of the nomination of Marsha S. Berzon for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Based upon Ms. Berzon's qualifications as a lawyer, I support her nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  
   It cannot be disputed that Ms. Berzon's training and experience qualify her for a life of public service as a federal appellate judge. Indeed, Ms. Berzon's qualifications are unimpeachable, and her competence is beyond question. Ms. Berzon completed her undergraduate studies at Harvard/Radcliffe College, and then was graduated from the Boalt Hall Law School at the University of California. After law school, Ms. Berzon served as a judicial clerk--first for Judge James R. Browning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and then for Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. of the United States Supreme Court. 
   For the last 25 years, Ms. Berzon has built a national reputation as an appellate litigator at a private law firm in San Francisco. She has argued four cases and filed dozens of briefs before the United States Supreme Court, and has argued numerous cases before State and federal trial and appeals courts. In addition to representing private clients, Ms. Berzon also has represented the States of California and Hawaii, and the City of Oakland, California. Ms. Berzon is uniformly described as honest, intelligent and fair-minded. Attorney J. Dennis McQuaid, whom she opposed in a case, later stated that ``unlike some advocates, she enjoys a reputation that she is devoid of any remotely partisan agenda and that her service on the court will be marked by decisions demonstrating great legal acumen, fairness and equanimity.'' Another opposing counsel, Carter G. Phillips, said that in a case involving delicate federalism issues, Ms. Berzon  
   ..... did an extraordinary job of presenting her clients' position aggressively without overreaching. She presented solid limiting principles that would allow the lawsuit to go forward without placing too much of a burden on the State. I thought her submissions, both written and oral, demonstrated a significant effort to balance the respective interests implicated by the legal issue. . . . Her advocacy demonstrated skill, integrity and sound judgment. These are precisely the traits I would want in a federal appellate judge.  
   Simply put, Ms. Berzon appears to have the intellect, integrity and impartiality to serve as a federal judge. 
   The fact that many of Ms. Berzon's clients have been unions should not disqualify her from being confirmed. That Ms. Berzon has advocated on behalf of unions--and, by all accounts, advocated well--cannot, I think, be determinative of her qualifications. In her testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Berzon testified that she is committed to following the Supreme Court's Beck decision, which sets forth the statutory rights of employees who object to their union dues being used for political activities. Moreover, Ms. Berzon testified that, if confirmed, she will make decisions based upon the law and the facts of the particular case before her. No one has shown me evidence why I should not take Ms. Berzon at her word. 
   In addition to having excellent legal training and experience as a lawyer, Ms. Berzon also has experience in legal academia. She has taught law students as a practitioner-in-residence at Cornell University Law School and at Indiana University Law School, and has published articles on various legal topics. In my view, she will bring to the Ninth Circuit a significant measure of intelligence, experience and legal scholarship. 
   In conclusion, Ms. Berzon is well-qualified to assume a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. She enjoys a reputation among colleagues and opposing counsel for being a fair-minded, well-prepared, and principled advocate. I therefore will cast my vote in favor of Ms. Berzon's confirmation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak this morning to discuss legislation that I have introduced with Senator MURKOWSKI that would divide the Ninth Circuit into two manageable circuits. 
   I have been told of a children's song that, with its circular and repetitious melody, is called ``the song without an end.'' And that might be an apt description of our efforts to reach some resolution with the nagging problem of the Ninth Circuit's boundaries. 
   Indeed, I am told that calls to reexamine the boundaries of what is presently called the Ninth Circuit were first made more than a century ago. In more recent history: 
   A congressional commission--the Hruska Commission--recommended a split of the Ninth Circuit--not just the Fifth Circuit-- in 1973; 
   In 1995 I held a hearing before the Judiciary Committee to examine a proposal to split the circuit; 
   In 1997, as part of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill, the Senate passed a split proposal which was ultimately replaced with a provision creating a commission to report on structural alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals--and the Ninth Circuit in particular; and 
   Last year, Senator MURKOWSKI, and others, introduced legislation to implement the recommendation of that commission, which would have maintained the circuit's structural boundaries, but partitioned its Court of Appeals into three semi-autonomous divisions. 
   Yet here we stand, like Sisyphus with the boulder at his feet, with nothing to show for years of effort. 
   All the while, the problems perceived in the Ninth Circuit itself have not disintegrated with the passage of time. 
   Rather, as we look at that circuit's boundaries, what is immediately apparent is its gargantuan size. That factor, in itself, by no means justifies a remedy in the form of a change in boundaries. But it does serve as a necessary starting point from which to explain many of the criticisms that have been lodged against the circuit. 
   Stretching across nine States and two territories, and constituting some 14 million square miles, the Ninth Circuit serves the largest U.S. population by far--more than 51 million people. The Ninth Circuit is authorized by statute to maintain 28 active 
   Court of Appeals judges. The next largest circuit--the Fifth--has only 17 active judges, and most other circuits have 12 or fewer judges. 
   Though the size of the circuit is not in itself a reason to modify its boundaries, the problems resulting from the circuit's size are. 
   Most notably, the massive size of the circuit's boundaries has confronted the circuit's judges with a real difficulty in maintaining the coherence of its circuit law. This is because there are enormous obstacles both, one, to keeping abreast of the circuit's decisions, and, two, to correcting those decisions that stray from the law of the circuit. 
   With regard to the first concern, various conscientious judges on the Ninth Circuit have stated they are unable to read the number of published decisions being issued by their colleagues, given the sheer volume of such opinions. They have stated that frequently,  there is no time to do anything more than review the head notes of such decisions. 
   This is a serious problem from which other problems ensue. Absent the ability of each active judge on the Ninth Circuit to read each such published decision, there can be no assurance that calls will be made for en banc review of those cases which judges believe merit rehearing by a larger component of the court. 
   With regard to the second concern--the ability to correct decisions that stray from the circuit law--the large size of the Ninth Circuit presents a tremendous impediment. At present, a special exception has been made by Congress to better enable the Ninth Circuit to review 3-judge decisions en banc, and that process--known as limited en banc--involves the empaneling of only 11 judges, rather than the circuit's full complement of 28 judges. 
   In my view, this system is being utilized with insufficient frequency. And the result is that the stated aim of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35--to secure or maintain uniformity of the court's decisions--is being thwarted. 
   Moreover, the mechanism is imperfect, and simple math proves the point. It is entirely conceivable that a limited en banc decision could be handed down by an 11-to-0 vote, and yet not reflect the views of a majority of the circuit's judges. Nor is it any answer to say that the Ninth Circuit's rules allow for full en banc hearings with all 28 judges, since no such hearing has ever taken place. 
   The problems with the lack of internal decisional consistency within the Ninth Circuit have become all too obvious. Three terms ago, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate before the U.S. Supreme Court exceeded 95 percent. 
   It is no cause for celebration to note that during the last two terms, the Ninth Circuit reversal rate averaged 77 percent, and this term I have noted that the Ninth Circuit is not faring particularly well, with a record of 0 to 7 before the Supreme Court. What is really wrong is there are literally thousands of cases they hear that they are probably making the wrong decisions on that will never go to the Supreme Court because the Court doesn't have time to listen to thousands of cases from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. So we are having all kinds of injustice out there just because of judges who are out of control, who are activist judges ignoring the law itself. 
   I believe these problems will be corrected when we streamline the circuit, leaving two more manageable circuits in place to more carefully and exactingly do the work currently undertaken by one. I believe the system of error correction and the assurance of coherence of circuit law will be a more manageable task in two circuits where the judges of each will have one-half as many of their colleagues' opinions to read for compliance with and correction of their circuit law. 
   To this end, Senator MURKOWSKI and I have drafted a measure we believe reflects sound public policy. It would continue to denominate as part of the Ninth Circuit the States of California, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as the island territories currently within the Ninth Circuit. The proposal would place Hawaii and the Northwest States within a new Twelfth Circuit. Such a proposal results in a logical split. Indeed, the contours of this very proposal were set out as an alternative option in the final report of the Commission on Structural Alternatives. And it maintains geographic coherence by avoiding the type of gerrymandered circuit that would have resulted from the split proposal passed by the Senate in 1997, although I could very easily go for that as well. 
   As a final word, I express for the record my appreciation for the very substantial work performed by the members and staff of the Commission on Structural Alternatives. Its final work product is a most capable report, and the Commission's work under Justice White will truly become part of the history of relations in this country before the Congress and the Judiciary. 
   With that thanks, I will close my remarks on this by urging my colleagues to act on this sensible proposal to solve a problem that has persisted for far too long. There are some of our colleagues who are very upset at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and its record of reversal by the Supreme Court. I just raised the issue that there may be thousands of cases that need to be reversed, but the Supreme Court doesn't have time to do that. I think they would be much more concerned about voting for and passing this split of the Ninth Circuit than they would attacking some of the judges who are up for nominations.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Mack-Hatch amendment that is currently before the Senate. This is an important issue both as a matter of educational policy and as a matter of fairness in tax policy. I congratulate the Senator from Florida for joining me in bringing it up as a part of the debate on this bill. 
   There has been a lot of discussion in recent months about the problem of the so-called marriage tax penalty. Actually, if we were to be totally accurate, we would talk about the marriage penalties. The American Institute of CPAs has found that the Internal Revenue Code contains at least 66 separate  provisions that can cause a marriage penalty--66. Think about it. Many of our colleagues may not realize this, but at the same time we were supporting legislation to eliminate marriage penalties, we were busy creating new ones. 
   This brings me to the purpose of our amendment. The bill we are debating today would expand the education savings account Congress created in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This is a great idea, and I fully support it. However, the provision creating the education savings account in 1997 contained a flaw--a marriage penalty. This penalty is found in the fact that the phaseout threshold for married couples found in joint returns is less than twice as high as the threshold for single taxpayers. 
   The amendment before us would correct this problem by raising the threshold for married couples from the current level of $150,000 to $190,000, which is twice the $95,000 threshold for individuals. It is that simple. 
   Some may argue that this is a trivial matter. Why are we taking up the Senate's valuable time on such a minor change. While to some this may not be the important tax change we should consider if this one problem is viewed by itself, this issue is much larger than that. 
   First, let's start with the obvious. We are debating S. 1134 to provide incentives for American families to save for their children's education: tuition payments, books, tutoring, computers, and other things. The idea, of course, is to benefit children. The goal is to further their educational opportunities. But without the Mack-Hatch amendment, we discriminate against some two-parent families who wish to take advantage of an education savings account. In some cases, the allowable resources in the account available for their children's education would be greater if mom and dad merely divorced and set up separate accounts. That is not what we want in this country. 
   Second, it is time we raise the consciousness of the Senate about how seemingly minor boilerplate provisions in tax bills can eventually harm taxpayers in big ways. I would venture a guess that one of the reasons we have 66 separate marriage penalties built into the Tax Code is that Congress simply copied over and over, year after year, the faulty language referring to returns filed by single taxpayers and married couples. 
   Once enacted, of course, they spread like a computer virus. 
   Later today, I plan to offer another amendment that would correct yet another marriage penalty we created in 1997, this time in the student loan interest deduction. I hope my colleagues will support Senator MACK and I on behalf of these amendments. 
   These amendments represent a good start on finding and correcting some of these tax inequities that riddle the Internal Revenue Code. I am looking forward to working more on this issue when the Finance Committee takes up marriage penalty legislation in the next few weeks. I congratulate Senator ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, for making meaningful relief in this area a high priority. 
   In listening to my constituents talk about the issue of taxes, I continue to hear one thing over and over again. The No. 1 complaint I hear from Utahans even more than that of taxes being too high is that of the Internal Revenue Code's complexity and unfairness. In my view, few things in our jumbled up Tax Code are more unfair than the provisions that make taxpayers pay more just because they are married. 
   Let's take this simple first step and eliminate this one marriage penalty by adopting this amendment. Then later, when I bring up my amendment on the student loan interest deduction marriage penalty, let's take on that one as well. Later this spring, we can do even more with the larger marriage penalty bill. We should fix all 66 of these marriage penalties, even if we have to do it one by one. 
   Let's strike a blow for tax fairness. I urge the adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my amendment addresses a specific and serious problem for Americans repaying student loans. Many of our colleagues may not be aware of it, Mr. President, but there is a severe marriage penalty lurking in the deduction for student loan interest expense that Congress enacted in 1997. 
   This marriage penalty arises because, when Congress established the deduction for student loan interest, we targeted it so that only taxpayers with incomes below a certain amount could use it. For single taxpayers, that income threshold is $40,000. For taxpayers with Adjusted Gross Income above $40,000 the deduction begins to phase out. The deduction is fully phased out over the next $15,000 of income, so that when a single taxpayer's income reaches $55,000, there is no deduction allowed. 
   For married taxpayers filing a joint return, there is a different threshold--$60,000. This is where the deduction begins to phase out, and it is gone at an income level of $75,000. This is the heart of the problem, Mr. President. Because the threshold for married taxpayers filing a joint return is less than twice as high as the threshold for singles, there is a marriage penalty. 
   Let me illustrate the problem with an example. Let's consider a couple from my home state. Dave and Joann met at Utah State University and married right after graduation last year. Dave is the assistant manager of a grocery store an earns $38,000 per year. Joann is a computer programmer making $40,000 annually. These are not high income people, Mr. President, although their income puts them in the 28 percent marginal tax bracket. 
   Dave and Joann each borrowed to finance their education, and each has $2,000 in interest expense from their student loans. The full $2,000 interest expense would be fully deductible if they were single, saving them each $560 in taxes. However, simply because Dave and Joann are married, and their combined income exceeds $75,000, they lose the full $4,000 student loan interest deduction. 
   Unfortunately, the $1,120 marriage penalty inherent in the student loan interest deduction is only the tip of the marriage penalty iceberg for Dave and Joann. This is only one of at least 66 marriage penalties that resides in the Internal Revenue Code. Not every one of these 66 marriage penalties affect every married couple in America, but many couples are hit with at least one, and often more than one, marriage penalty. In our example here, Dave and Joann are hit with two other marriage penalties. 
   As you can see, the total amount of marriage penalty affecting Dave and Joann is a whopping $2,650. This means their tax burden is 27 percent higher than it would be if they were single, Mr. President! This is simply not fair. It is poor tax policy, it is poor education policy, and it is poor family policy. Taxpayers should not pay more in taxes just because they are married. 
   The other marriage penalties affecting Dave and Joann stem from the fact that the standard deduction for married couples is less than twice the amount of the standard deduction of singles, and from a similar problem that exists in the tax rate schedules. These two marriage penalties are not the subject of this amendment. 
   I will note, however, that H.R. 6, the marriage penalty alleviation bill passed by the House in early February, would correct most of this marriage penalty for Dave and Joann. I know that Chairman Roth plans to take up marriage penalty legislation in the Finance Committee in the next few weeks. I look forward to working with him to solve these other problems. 
   The marriage penalty problem the House bill would not correct, however, is the one inherent in the student loan interest deduction. The solution to this marriage penalty is simple. This amendment merely increases the income threshold for joint returns to $80,000, twice the level of the single taxpayer threshold. 
   The marriage tax penalty problem is a complex one. We are not going to solve it all at once. I am gratified to see the Congress focusing on this important family issue, and I hope we can see real progress on alleviating the problem this year. 
   This amendment is a good place to start. Some might argue that this is relatively minor marriage penalty. And, compared with some of the other ones. maybe it is. However, it is not small to Dave and Joann and to the millions of young Americans who pay more in taxes simply because they have formed the basic unit of society--a family. 
   This small step today will eliminate the marriage penalty that hurts married taxpayers who are repaying educational loans. Then, in a few weeks when the Finance Committee takes up broader marriage penalty legislation, we can address some of the other problems.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Maine, and I thank her for her leadership in bringing this issue before the Senate at this time. 
   Mr. President, no debate on tax incentives for education would be complete without a discussion of teachers and how they are taxed as professionals. In my view, the current law treatment is seriously deficient in this area. 
   First, let me review the technical points. Like any other professional, elementary and secondary school teachers incur a number of expenses in order to keep themselves current in their fields of knowledge. These include subscriptions to journals and other periodicals. In addition, many teachers invest in their own development by taking courses to improve their knowledge or skills. Under current law, these expenses are deductible, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. However, there are two practical limitations that effectively make these expenses non-deductible for most teachers. 
   The first limitation is that the total amount of a taxpayer's deductible miscellaneous expenses must exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income before they begin to be deductible. The second hurdle is that the amount in excess of the 2 percent floor, if any, combined with all other deductions the taxpayer has, must exceed the standard deduction before any of them are deductible. 
   Let's consider just how difficult these limitations can be, Mr. President. I will use the example of a fifth-year high school science teacher in Utah who I will call Robin Stewart. Robin is single and makes $35,000 per year. She incurred $840 of expenses last year for science periodicals and for a course she took over the summer to increase her knowledge of chemistry. 
   Under current law, Robin's $840 expenditures are deductible, subject to the limitations I mentioned. The first limitation says that her expenses must exceed 2 percent of her income before they are deductible. Two percent of $35,000 is $700. Thus, only $140 of her $840 is deductible--that portion which exceeds $700. 
   As a single taxpayer, Robin's standard deduction for 2000 is $4,400. Her total itemized deductions, including the $140 miscellaneous deduction, fall short of this threshold. Therefore, not even the $140 is deductible for Robin. What the first limitation did not block, the second one did. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, this is the case for most of the school teachers in our nation. In 1997, the last year for which the Internal Revenue Service has statistics, only 29.9 percent of taxpayers were able to itemize their deductions. So even in the rare case where the 2 percent limitation does allow a significant deduction, chances are very good that it will not help the teacher because he or she cannot itemize. 
   The amendment before us is a good step in the right direction. It would remove the first limitation--the 2 percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions. Ideally, I would like to see the second limitation removed as well and make these kinds of expenses deductible by teachers regardless of whether or not they itemize. I hope that my colleagues on the Finance Committee will take a close look at the idea of an above-the-line deduction for teachers. 
   Mr. President, the second part of the amendment before us is also very important. It recognizes that many of our dedicated teachers incur personal expenses for materials for their classrooms. Under current law, these types of expenses are, once again, deductible, but only to the extent they exceed 2 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. 
   Many Americans may be unaware that many teachers subsidize their schools out of their own pockets. It is not unusual for teachers to have to pay for copying extra worksheets or articles, purchasing art supplies, or providing tablets and pencils to some students who are without. Many teachers buy library books, educational games, and puzzles for their classes with their own money. 
   Rather than treating these expenses the same as teacher development expenses, and exempting them from the 2 percent floor, this amendment goes one step further and grants a tax credit of up to $100 per taxpayer for materials the teacher supplies for his or her class. This means the teacher receives a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability. 
   Some people may argue that teachers don't have to do this--why should they get a special tax credit? 
   The fact is that those teachers who love teaching and care about their students have been subsidizing their classrooms for years. They do it because our public schools frequently nickel-and-dime the classroom in order to concentrate resources on required big ticket items. 
   And, Mr. President, there is one key difference between school teachers and other professionals that, in my mind, justifies this tax change. Teachers--unlike lawyers, accountants, physicians, or others who may take the existing deduction--are engaged in non-profit public service. 
   This amendment gives proper recognition to the personal sacrifice that many of our teachers make, year after year, toward improving the education of our children. 
   As in the other part of this amendment, Mr. President, this provision is not perfect. I would like to see this credit also extended to those parents in Utah and throughout the country who choose to teach their children at home. Their expenditures, which likely far exceed $100, also deserve the tax credit, and I hope the Finance Committee can look for ways in other legislation to extend such a credit to parents to teach at home. 
   But, the Collins-Kyl-Coverdell-Hatch amendment is a good step toward recognizing the dedication of our elementary and secondary school teachers and in helping them to meet the costs of their profession. 
   We say that we want our public school teachers to be the best.  
   We say we want our children and grandchildren taught by teachers who are competent and up-to-date not only in the subject matter they are teaching, but in the pedagogy of teaching it. 
   We say we want teachers who know how to exploit fully new learning technologies, including the Internet. 
   We say we want teachers who can recognize the signs of struggling or troubled students. 
   We say we want teachers who can inspire our kids. 
   We say we want teachers who are willing to go the extra mile. 
   Mr. President, this amendment, offered by Senator COLLINS, is not unlike an amendment I introduced myself. This amendment, like my own, is designed to get our tax policy in sync with our goals for education. 
   This amendment will provide modest tax relief for teachers who, for too long, have been footing the bill for improving the quality of teaching by themselves. It is time we helped out. 
   I urge the adoption of this amendment. 
   I compliment my colleagues for the good work they are doing.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I would like to offer congratulations to the University of Utah on the 150th anniversary of its founding. 
   In 1850, just three years after the pioneers reached the dusty and desolate Salt Lake Valley, the General Assembly of the State of Deseret passed an ordinance to create the first university to be established west of the Missouri. Despite some stressful financial times, it persevered; and, in 1892, the territorial legislature changed its name to the University of Utah. 
   The Utah pioneers began an institution that would serve as the intellectual and cultural cornerstone for the state of Utah and for the West. With its humble beginnings in a private home, the University of Utah has become the embodiment of the pioneering spirit that conceived it. 
   The University of Utah--the ``U''--has led the way in a number of areas, including research, teaching, and public service. 
   Academically, the University makes significant contributions in the West and in the nation. The Honors Program is the third oldest in the nation. The graduate school of Architecture has the Intermountain West's only program in historical preservation. The College of Humanities has the Intermountain West's only joint master of public administration in Middle East studies. 
   Additionally, the University of Utah's work in health sciences, where the first artificial heart was developed, in supercomputing and computer modeling, and in cosmic-ray research, where the U is home to the one-of-a-kind ``Fly's Eye,'' has contributed significantly to the University's growing reputation both nationally and internationally. The University of Utah currently ranks in the first tier of American research institutions according to the Carnegie Foundation. 
   Henry Eyring, a world renowned chemist and professor noted in 1946 that, ``the stature of the university would rise through advancements of science and technology.'' And so it has. The faculty and students representing all 50 states and 102 foreign countries have built the U into a premier research institution. 
   A pioneer in computer graphics, David Evans, after studying electrical engineering at the University, became chair in 1965 of the fledgling department of computer science. He oversaw the education of individuals who went on to groundbreaking careers in computing including, Alan Kay, vice president of Disney Imagineering; Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, Inc.; John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe Systems; and, Edwin Catmull: co-founder of Pixar. 
   The medical school, started in 1905, has made great strides in medicine that are recognized throughout the world. Dr. Philip Price, former chair of the Department of Surgery said, ``The essence of the pioneer spirit as I see it, is the courage to tackle an un-ideal situation, trying hard with faith and intelligence to build something ideal out of it. That's what I would like to see done, and have a part in.'' 
   In 1946, the U.S. Public Health Service awarded its first grant to a medical school so that the University of Utah could study muscular dystrophy. The receipt of this first grant for medical research set the stage for the University's subsequent success in medical research. 
   Dr. Willem Kolff began the division of Artificial Organs and the Institute for Biomedical Engineering in 1967. His pioneering work on both an artificial kidney and heart led to a number of medical breakthroughs, including the world's first artificial heart transplanted into Dr. Barney Clark in 1982. 
   That was a great thrill for all of us from Utah. 
   More recently, there have been a number of major leaps taken in genetic research at the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics. Scientists have found dozens of genes for human diseases including cancer, heart disease, neurological conditions, birth defects, and blindness. And, the Huntsman Cancer Institute is becoming an international leader in the discovery of new ways to diagnose, treat, cure, and prevent cancer. 
   The University of Utah has also played a central role in the development of Utah in the arts and athletics. In 1948, the Utah Symphony was invited to make its home on the campus, establishing the University as home for various cultural events for the public. For the past decade, the Modern Dance Department ranks among the top three in North America along with the ballet program, which is the nation's first college ballet degree program. 
   The University of Utah's skiing and women's gymnastics programs have each won ten national titles, and the Runnin' Utes basketball team made it to the NCAA national championship finals in 1998. The football team has made numerous bowl game appearances. 
   Of course, to me, as an alumnus of BYU, the best thing to come out of the University of Utah was in 1875 when the University's Provo branch was split off to become the Brigham Young Academy and eventually Brigham Young University. It would be impossible for any Utahn not to at least mention this historic rivalry.  
   It is difficult to do justice to the myriad of accomplishments of the University of Utah's faculty and alumni in this brief statement. 
   Suffice it to say that, after 150 years, the University of Utah still draws on the courageous and adventurous spirit of Utah's pioneers. The achievements and ideas of the faculty and graduates have multiplied across the geographic and academic frontiers of our country. The University's proud heritage and traditions have established its values and lighted the path; but, without a doubt, the trail is still being blazed. 
   I might add that as a young boy living in Pittsburgh, PA, wanting to support anything from Utah, I can remember the great University of Utah championship basketball teams with Arnie Ferrin, Vern Gardner, Wat Misaka, and others who were terrific athletes who made the University of Utah a household name in basketball during those years. Of course, they have been an inspiration to me ever since. In fact, it has been a thrill for me to meet some of those people, and especially become a friend of the great Arnie Ferrin who was the University of Utah's great All American during those years and later played professional basketball as well. 
   Again, my congratulations to the students, alumni, faculty, and administrators of the University of Utah on reaching this significant milestone. It is a great university. I support it very strongly, and I think everyone in Utah does as well. I am grateful to be able to make this statement on its behalf. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend the majority leader, Senator LOTT, for proceeding today with votes for these judicial nominees. As I have stated, we will continue to process the confirmations of nominees who are qualified to be federal judges. In that respect, the Senate Judiciary Committee held its first nominations hearing of this Session on Tuesday, February 22, and I expect to see more judicial nominees moving through the process in the coming months. There is a perception held by some that the confirmation of judges stops in election years. This perception is inaccurate, and I intend to move qualified nominees through the process during this session of Congress. 
   That said, in moving forward with the confirmations of judicial nominees, we must be mindful of problems we have with certain courts, particularly the Ninth Circuit. It was reported yesterday that the Ninth Circuit has a record of 0-6 this supreme court term. In addition, the President must be mindful of the problems he creates when he nominates individuals who do not have the support of their home-State Senators. In this regard, I must say that it appears at times as if the President is seeking a confrontation with the Senate on this issue, instead of working with the Senate to see that his nominees are confirmed. 
   During this Congress, despite partisan rhetoric, the Judiciary Committee has reported 42 judicial nominees, and the full Senate has confirmed 36 of these--a number comparable to the average of 39 confirmations for the first sessions of the past five Congresses when vacancy rates were generally much higher. In total, the Senate has confirmed 340 of President Clinton's judicial nominees since he took office in 1993. 
   I am disturbed by some of the allegations that have been made that the Senate's treatment of certain nominees differed based on their race or gender. Such allegations are entirely without merit. For noncontroversial nominees who were confirmed in 1997 and 1998, there is little if any difference between the timing of confirmation for minority nominees and non-minority nominees. Only when the President appoints a controversial female or minority nominee does a disparity arise. Moreover, last session, over 50% of the nominees that the Judiciary Committee reported to the full Senate were women and minorities. Even the former Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator JOE BIDEN, stated publicly that the process by which the committee, under my chairmanship, examines and approves judicial nominees ``has not a single thing to do with gender or race.'' That is from the transcript of a Judiciary Committee hearing on judicial nominations on November 10, 1999. 
   The Senate has conducted the confirmations process in a fair and principled manner, and the process has worked well. The Federal Judiciary is sufficiently staffed to perform its function under article III of the Constitution. Senator LOTT, and the Senate as a whole, are to be commended.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my good friend from Vermont, the distinguished Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, the ``Anti-Tampering Act of 2000.'' In short, this bill prohibits tampering with product identification codes--a practice that threatens the health and safety of US consumers, frustrates legitimate forensic activities of law enforcement, and impairs manufacturers' ability to protect their distribution channels, thereby exposing them to significant product liability exposure. 
   Let me take just a moment to explain the need for this bill. Manufacturers code their products in order to protect their consumers and to assist law enforcement in investigating consumer complaints, as well as in conducting recalls of tampered products. These codes assist the manufacturer and law enforcement in tracing goods back to a particular lot, batch or date of production. They include batch codes, expiration dates, lot numbers, and other information that one can typically see imprinted on the bottom or side of most products. 
   Legitimate goods produced by manufacturers are obtained by ``illegitimate decoders'', frequently by fraud, theft or false pretenses. These decoders then decode and otherwise tamper with product labeling to avoid detection so that they may sell these ill-gotten goods to unauthorized points of sale. The frightening aspect of this activity, Mr. President, is that a substantial portion of the US-made goods sold by illegitimate decoders have been adulterated or otherwise tampered with after manufacture, and present health and safety risks to consumers. 
   Incredible as it may seem, thieves routinely tamper with product identification codes on stolen goods; counterfeiters affix fake codes on gray market goods that are then mixed with counterfeits; and distributors who have broken their distribution contracts with manufacturers typically obliterate product identification codes. 
   Because gray market activity is largely lawful in the US, the diverters' distribution channels have been used by professional thieves and counterfeiters to traffic in their illegal merchandise. There appears to be a connection between counterfeit and decoded imports, and anti-counterfeiting enforcement efforts will be frustrated unless greater controls are placed on the importation of such decoded products. Regrettably, gray market networks are increasingly being used for the distribution and sale of counterfeit goods. Distributors have been found to sell counterfeit goods--from baby shampoo to infant formula to cosmetics and fragrances--purchased through gray market channels. 
   In short, Mr. President, goods are decoded to hide evidence of fraudulent, unlawful conduct and to traffic in stolen, counterfeit, misbranded, out-of-date and unlawfully diverted merchandise. 
   Let me offer you a few examples of the significant health and safety risks presented by this activity. As noted by the International Formula Council, product identification codes are, without question, the single most important factor in a successful recall. In recent years, this link between product coding and consumer protection has become increasingly evident. Following the Tylenol poisonings of 1982, product coding enabled Johnson & Johnson to identify the tainted production lots and issue a nationwide recall of potentially dangerous products. Similarly, the manufacturers of automobiles, toys, food products and other consumer goods have consistently relied upon product coding to identify and recall goods that fail to meet consumer quality and safety standards. 
   Last year, the FDA used product codes to quickly identify a shipment of contaminated strawberries that had caused an outbreak of hepatitis in Michigan schools. More recently, the Slim Fast Corporation relied on product codes to identify and recall 192,000 cans of its ready-to-drink diet shakes because, according to the New York Times (Apr. 18, 1999), some of the cans might have been filled with a diluted cleaning solution. In addition, this summer, a leading manufacturer of infant formula used its product codes to identify and recall 7,000 cases of infant formula after a labeling error resulted in distribution of infant formula cans that may have contained an adult nutritional supplement that could have been harmful to infants. (USA Today, June 9, 1999.) 
   An undercover investigation by the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigation in New York involved wholesale purchases of expensive fertility drugs. Fraudulent code numbers appeared on the counterfeit packaging containing these injectible products. Although laboratory analysis indicated the presence of the active ingredient in these products, the FDA was not able to determine the place or conditions of their manufacture because of the absence of legitimate batch code data. 
   Fraudulent product identification coding has even been used in schemes involving bulk food products such as metric tons of frozen shrimp. For instance, a Florida indictment charged an importer with criminal offenses involving the repeated ``washing, mixing and soaking'' of putrid and decomposed shrimp in a solution containing copper sulfate, chlorine, lemon juice and other chemicals to conceal the inferiority of the product. Central to this scheme was the ``re-coding'' of product lots as they were repeatedly rejected by buyers, chemically treated, and re-sold to others who did not know the products' history. 
   In short, without product coding, the task of identifying and recalling defective goods becomes infinitely more difficult and often impossible, leaving consumers exposed to potential harm, illness and even death. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
   Commission, there were 273 product recalls last year and, on average, one high profile recall each week. 
   In addition to the health and safety risks presented by this conduct, Mr. President, there is an additional, equally significant public policy interest served by this bill: codes play a vital part in traditional law enforcement activities. They assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity, and they further aid in tracking stolen goods. They play a critical role in certain criminal investigations, allowing law enforcement officers to pinpoint the location and in some cases--including the World Trade Center bombing--the identity of the offender. In cases of stolen or tainted goods, product codes point to the source of the product and the site of the crime. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, there is no single federal statute that adequately addresses the problem of product identification code tampering of all consumer products. Federal law only applies to a limited category of consumer products. Moreover, federal law only applies if the decoder or tamperer  exhibits criminal intent to harm the consumer. It does not address the vast majority of decoding cases that could result in harm to the consumer, but do not involve the specific intent to harm the consumer. Moreover, violations of current federal law result in only a misdemeanor. 
   By criminalizing tampering with product identification codes, we hope to send a clear message to the professional criminals: We value the lives and well being of Americans and will not tolerate this conduct any more on our soil. You, the professional criminal, will persist in this activity at your economic and personal peril. 
   Under the bill, tampering with product codes of pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medicines consumer products, health and beauty aids, and other goods will constitute a criminal offense. Criminalizing this conduct will result in strengthened law enforcement tools, greater consumer protections and greater security for manufacturers' products. 
   Mr. President, I believe it would be instructive to identify what this bill does not do, as there has been some misinformation about this measure. The bill does not restrict, prohibit, criminalize or otherwise impair lawful, arms-length diversion activity. In short, Mr. Chairman, the bill does not affect the legality or illegality of the gray market. It simply prohibits tampering with product identification codes. Diverters can continue to engage in parallel importing to the same extent after passage of this measure as they have in the past. However, to be clear, Mr. Chairman, they must do so without obliterating the product identification codes or affixing fake codes on the goods. 
   Moreover, unintentional acts of decoding or other activities associated with decoded products are not subject to criminal or civil action, because the bill provides for a knowledge standard and protection for innocent violators. Thus, the innocent store clerk who merely scans merchandise at the check out counter and unwittingly permits the sale of decoded merchandise need not worry. Nor should either the innocent trucker who 
   transports this merchandise or the innocent distributor who engages in distributing this merchandise to the retailer have cause for concern. 
   Others have expressed concern that enactment of the bill will result in the end of discount retailers and discount prices. It is difficult to understand this objection. I cannot conceive why discounting would require altering the expiration dates or the source identifiers of the goods, unless all discounts are illegally diverted or are product that should be recalled. But risking the health and safety of American consumers, or selling them inferior or fake goods to keep alive a certain brand of ``discounting'' does not seem like much of a bargain to me. Discounts are routinely offered when inventories build up or styles change. Manufacturers and retailers will continue to discount when this bill is enacted. But consumers will have greater assurance that the discount they are receiving is not coming with an offsetting risk that the product is contaminated or defective. 
   Finally, Mr. President, some argue that the bill's application to all products is unnecessarily broad. The bill's several important public policy goals require that it apply to all products. Let me explain why. The bill is intended to ensure effective and targeted product recalls, to enhance law enforcement investigations, and to protect American consumers and the legitimate businesses who serve them from the depredations of illegitimate diverters. Product recalls apply to all products and law enforcement investigations implicate all products. For instance, the codes on the batteries in the Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, Georgia were used to exonerate the security guard then under suspicion in that case, Richard Jewell. The code on the microprocessor chip on the bomb in the Pan Am air crash linked the bombing to terrorists. And even on a more pedestrian level, the code on a crowbar in a recent New York burglary led police to the criminal.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend the majority leader, Senator LOTT, for proceeding today with votes for these two judicial nominees. We will continue to process the confirmations of nominees who are qualified to be Federal judges. In that respect, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its first nominations hearing of this session on Tuesday, February 22, and I expect to see more judicial nominees moving through the process in the coming months. There is a perception held by some that the confirmation of judges stops in election years. That perception is inaccurate, and I intend to move qualified nominees through the process during this session of Congress. 
   That said, in moving forward with the confirmations of judicial nominees, we must be mindful of problems we have with certain courts, particularly the ninth circuit. In addition, the President must be mindful of the problems he creates when he nominates individuals who do not have the support of their home-State Senators. In this regard, I must say that it appears at times as if the President is seeking a confrontation with the Senate on this issue, instead of working with the Senate to see that his nominees are confirmed. 
   Last session, despite partisan rhetoric, the Judiciary Committee reported 42 judicial nominees, and the full Senate confirmed 34 of these--a number comparable to the average of 39 confirmations for the first sessions of the past five Congresses, when vacancy rates were generally much higher. In total, the Senate has confirmed 338 of President Clinton's judicial nominees since he took office in 1993. 
   I am disturbed by some of the allegations that have been made that the Senate's treatment of certain nominees differed based on their race or gender. Such allegations are entirely without merit. For noncontroversial nominees who were confirmed in 1997 and 1998, there was little, if any, difference between the timing of confirmation for minority nominees and non-minority nominees. Only when the President appoints a controversial female or minority nominee does a disparity arise. Moreover, last session, over 50 percent of the nominees that the Judiciary Committee reported to the full Senate were women and minorities. Even the Democratic former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator JOE BIDEN, stated publicly that the process by which the Committee, under my chairmanship, examines and approves judicial nominees ``has not a single thing to do with gender or race.'' 
   The Senate has conducted the confirmations process in a fair and principled manner, and the process has worked well and, in my opinion, will continue to work well. The Federal Judiciary is sufficiently staffed to perform its function under article 3 of the Constitution. Senator LOTT, and the Senate as a whole, are to be commended. 
   I want to make sure we make those points in the RECORD before we start voting on these judicial nominees. When the Judiciary Committee reports a nominee to the floor, it does not even consider telling Senators what the nominee's race or ethnicity or anything else is. The nominee's race or ethnicity or gender is irrelevant as far as we are concerned. We report judicial nominees because we believe them to be qualified. We report them because the President of the United States has the constitutional right to nominate judges. The Senate has right to confirm or not confirm them. 
   I have to say, the big battles are behind the scenes where we determine, in consultation with the White House, whether or not people should be nominated at all. That process is participated in by virtually every Senator in this body, and certainly by the leaders of the Judiciary Committee. 
   I wish to set the record straight because I see continual politicization of the judiciary by this administration whereby this administration tries to make appointments that literally do not deserve to be made. 
   Naturally, having said all this, during a Presidential election year the nomination process does slow down. It ultimately ends during that year, and historically has done so whether there has been Republican or Democrat control of the Senate, and whether there has been a Republican or Democrat in the White House. 
   Another point I believe must be emphasized: We in the Senate cannot take action on nominees we do not have. 
   Yesterday, at a Democratic National Committee event in Texas, President Clinton took the Senate to task for not acting swiftly enough on his judicial nominees. Given the fact that this is his last year in office, and that he was speaking at a DNC event, President Clinton is bound to say anything. 
   The nominees we will confirm today will bring the total number of Clinton judges confirmed by the Senate Republicans to 340. Approximately 40 percent of the total federal judiciary now are Clinton judges--judges confirmed by Republicans. 
   I note this: The President has made nominations for less then half of the vacancies that currently exist. For all the bad-mouthing this administration does from time to time regarding the confirmation of judges, it is important to note there are presently 79 vacancies, and to date we have received only 38 nominees--4 of which we received just today, so, in essence, just 34 nominees until today. There are 41 vacancies for which the President has not even made a nomination. That needs to be said. 
   I want to work with the President. I want to treat him fairly. I think we have been more than fair with him. I intend to be fair in the future as well,  but I would appreciate it if he would speak a little more fairly himself.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will help restore public confidence in the Department of Justice by reforming the way that the Office of Pardon Attorney investigates candidates for executive clemency. This bill, the Hatch-Nickles-Abraham Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act, which is co-sponsored by Senators LOTT, THURMOND, KYL, ASHCROFT, SESSIONS, SMITH of New Hampshire, and COVERDELL, addresses the problems that led to the widespread public outrage at the Department of Justice's role in President Clinton's decision last September to release 11 Puerto Rican nationalist terrorists from prison. 
   The beneficiaries of President Clinton's grant of clemency were convicted terrorists who belong to violent Puerto Rican independence groups called the FALN and Los Macheteros. They were in prison for a seditious conspiracy that included the planting of over 130 bombs in public places in the United States, including shopping malls and restaurants. That bombing spree--which killed several people, injured many others and caused vast property damage--remains the most prolific terrorist campaign within our borders in United States history. 
   The Judiciary Committee has thoroughly investigated the facts and circumstances surrounding the decision to release those terrorists from prison. We read thousands of documents produced by the Department of Justice and the White House. We interviewed law enforcement officials knowledgeable about the FALN and Los Macheteros organizations. We spoke to victims, and we held two hearings on the many issues raised by the grant of clemency. Our investigation has led me to a very troubling conclusion: the Justice Department ignored its own rules for handling clemency matters, exercised very poor judgment in ignoring the opinions of law enforcement and victims, and sacrificed its integrity by bowing to political pressure to modify its original recommendation against clemency. 
   I do not come to this conclusion lightly. I base it on an examination of the facts. The facts show that the clemency recipients were never asked for information relevant to open investigations or the apprehension of fugitives--despite the fact that one of their co-defendants, Victor Gerena, is on the FBI's ``ten most wanted'' list. Many of the killings associated with the FALN bombings, including the infamous Fraunces Tavern bombing, remain unsolved. The failure to ask for such information from the clemency recipients, several of whom held leadership positions in the FALN, means that the rest of the perpetrators of those crimes may never be brought to justice. My legislation will require the Justice Department to notify law enforcement of pending clemency requests, and to assess whether a proposed clemency recipient could have information on open investigations and fugitives. 
   Our investigation also revealed that the White House and the Justice Department ignored the many victims of FALN crimes, even while senior officials were holding numerous meetings with the terrorists' advocates for clemency. While top government officials actually gave strategic advice to the terrorists, no one lifted a finger to find, interview, or even notify the victims about the pending clemency request. My legislation would help ensure that the Justice Department remembers who it is supposed to be working for by requiring it to notify and seek input from victims. 
   Finally, a disturbing connection has come to light between the FALN, Los Macheteros and the Cuban government.  Jorge Masetti, a former Cuban intelligence agent, has stated that Cuba helped Los Macheteros to plan and execute the $7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery--the biggest cash heist in US history--by providing funding, training and assistance in smuggling the money out of the country. Some sources estimate that 4 million dollars from the robbery ended up in Cuba. We don't know whether the Pardon Attorney knew of or told the President about this Cuban connection because the Pardon Attorney currently has no obligation to contact intelligence agencies for information relevant to proposed grants of executive clemency. My legislation would require the Justice Department to solicit from law enforcement and intelligence agencies necessary information concerning the nature of the threat posed by potential clemency recipients so that the Pardon Attorney can properly advise the President whether a particular grant of clemency will impact future crime or terrorism. 
   Before describing how this bill works, I want to explain how the Office of Pardon Attorney currently operates. The job of the Office of Pardon Attorney is not complicated: it is to investigate potential grants of clemency and, in appropriate cases, to produce a report and recommendations to the President. Ordinarily, this work begins when the office receives a petition from a prisoner or someone who has already completed a prison sentence. The Department's rules require that an individual seeking clemency submit such a petition to the Pardon Attorney. After receiving a petition, the Pardon Attorney makes an initial determination of whether the request has enough merit to warrant further investigation. If so, the Pardon Attorney researches the potential clemency recipient and prepares a report analyzing the information in light of the grounds for granting clemency. As described by the United States Attorneys' Manual, those grounds ``have traditionally included disparity or undue severity of sentence, critical illness or old age, and meritorious service rendered to the government by the petitioner.'' 
   It is to be expected that the Administration and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC'') would question the constitutionality of this bill by asserting an expansive view of executive power. That is their nature. This is the same Administration and Department that resisted any oversight of the FALN clemency decision. The OLC and the Department have a history of taking a liberal view of laws and privileges that would shield the President from scrutiny. This is evidenced by the Department's sound defeats on assertions of government attorney-client privilege and its ill-fated attempt to create a protective function privilege out of whole cloth. Anyone examining the merits of the OLC's attacks against this bill, therefore, must acknowledge that the Administration and the Department have a track record of overstating executive power. 
   With that background, let me clarify that the Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act was carefully drafted to avoid offending the separation of powers. The Act does not attempt to dictate how the President uses the pardon power. Far from it. The Constitution gives that power to the President, and this bill does not restrict it in any way. This bill affects only those cases where the President delegates the responsibility to investigate a particular potential grant of clemency. Nothing in the bill requires the President to ask the Pardon Attorney for assistance or requires the Pardon Attorney to take any particular position or recommend any particular 
   outcome. It doesn't even require the Department to submit a report to the President, but simply make it available. Furthermore, the bill does not require the President to read any report, consider any particular information, or avail himself of any resource. The President will still be able to disregard the Justice Department's reports, use another agency, ask anyone in the world for advice, or exercise the ``pardon power'' without anyone's counsel. Only if the President chooses to ask the Justice Department for assistance will the procedural requirements of this bill apply--and they will apply only to the Justice Department, not to the President. 
   The Act is consistent with the Supreme Court's opinions relating to the pardon power. The Act neither ``change[s] the effect of ..... a pardon'' as described in United States v. Kline, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1872), nor will it ``modif[y], abridge[], or diminish[]'' the President's authority to grant clemency as discussed in Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256, 266 (1974). In fact, the Act will have no effect whatsoever on the President's ability to exercise the pardon power as he or she sees fit. 
   Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress can legislate in areas that touch upon the pardon power. In Carlesi v. New York, 233 U.S. 51 (1914), the Court found that it was within the power of the legislative branch to determine what effect a pardon would have on future criminal sentences. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that the pardon power has limits; the President cannot use that power as an excuse to wield power over departments that he or she otherwise could not. In Knote v. United States, 95 U.S. 149 (1877), the Court held that the pardon power does not give the President authority to order the treasury to refund money taken from a prisoner--even though that prisoner had just been pardoned for the crime that gave rise to the government's seizure of that money. 
   It is Congress, not the President, that has the authority--indeed, the responsibility--to examine and legislate the manner in which the Justice Department performs its work. Congress created an ``attorney in charge of pardons'' within the Department of Justice in 1891, and appropriated money for an ``attorney in charge of pardons'' in that same year. To this day, the Office of the Pardon Attorney depends on funds appropriated annually by the Congress. In the most recent appropriations legislation, the Congress appropriated $1.6 million for the Pardon Attorney for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000. This Congressional involvement--creation and funding of the office--provides a compelling basis for the Judiciary Committee's investigation and the present legislation. 
   ``The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.'' Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957). The scope of this power ```is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.''' Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U.S. 491, 504 n. 15 (1975) (quoting Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 190, 111 (1959)). The Supreme Court has also recognized ``the danger to effective and honest conduct of the Government if the legislative power to probe corruption in the Executive Branch were unduly hampered.'' Watkins, 354 U.S. at 194-95. Once having established its jurisdiction and authority, and the pertinence of the matter under inquiry to its area of authority, a committee's investigative purview is substantial and wide-ranging. Wilkinson v. United States, 365 U.S. 408-09 (1961). 
   Congress also has broad powers under the Constitution to ``make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department of Officer thereof.'' The areas in which Congress may potentially legislate or appropriate are, by necessary implication, even broader. Thus, in determining whether Congress has jurisdiction to oversee and enact legislation, deference should be accorded to Congress' decision. 
   Because of this legal history, the administration of the Department of Justice and its various components has long been considered an appropriate subject of Congressional oversight. Early this century, in McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 151 (1927), the Supreme Court endorsed Congress' authority to study ``charges of misfeasance and nonfeasance in the Department of Justice.'' In that case, which involved a challenge to Congress' inquiry into the DOJ's role during the Teapot Dome scandal, the Court concluded that Congress had authority to investigate ``whether [DOJ's] functions were being properly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected, and particularly whether the Attorney General and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in  respect of the institution.'' Id. at 177. These precedents make clear that the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction to investigate the Pardon Attorney's role in the pardon process, and to enact legislation concerning the way in which that office operates. 
   We have discussed this bill with the Department of Justice, and we have reviewed the regulations the Department has proposed. The problems with the Office of the Pardon Attorney, however, cannot be fixed by a mere change in department regulations. It has been six months since the public outcry over the FALN clemency shined a spotlight on the Pardon Attorney's practices. Despite having half-a-year to reform itself, the Department has suggested only minimal changes in the way it does business. In its draft regulations, the Department agrees that it should ascertain the views of victims, but only in cases involving ``crimes of violence.'' Victims of other crimes deserve the right to be heard, too. Victims of so-called identity theft, for example, have compelling stories of the horror of being forced into bankruptcy to avoid collections lawyers, losing their jobs due to issues related to wage garnishments, and trying to rebuild their lives without the ability to obtain credit or sign an apartment lease. Victims of such crimes also deserve to be heard. Similarly, the Department's proposed regulations acknowledge the need to determine whether releasing a particular prisoner would pose a risk, but limit their focus to past victims and ignore other possible targets including witnesses, informants, prosecutors and court personnel. The Department's proposal also fails to notify victims when it undertakes a clemency investigation, when it completes its report to the President, or when the President makes a decision. Under the Department's scheme, victims may still learn of a prisoner's release from prison by watching the event on TV. 
   Equally important, the Department's suggested regulations ignore the Department's main job: to protect law-abiding people from criminal acts. The Department does not see a need to require the Pardon Attorney to talk to law enforcement officials about whether a particular person could provide helpful information about criminal investigations or searches for fugitives. Nor does the Department see the value of asking law enforcement whether a potential release from prison would pose a risk to specific people other than victims or to a broader societal interest such as enhancing a particular criminal organization or decreasing the deterrent value of prison sentences. The Department's proposed regulations also ignore the importance of whether a potential clemency recipient has accepted responsibility for, or feels remorse over, criminal acts. 
   Even if the Department's proposed regulations were identical to this bill, moreover, those regulations could not overcome what is perhaps the most important weakness of all: Regulations are not law. They do not have the force of statutes, and they can be changed very easily. The FALN case proves the need for a statute because the Attorney General ignored even the current, weak regulations in the FALN matter. Although the Justice Department and the White House refuse to let anyone in Congress review the reports produced by the Pardon Attorney about the FALN clemency, it is clear that the Pardon Attorney did not follow the Justice Department regulations when analyzing the issues for the President. For starters, the Pardon Attorney began investigating a potential grant of clemency for the FALN terrorists even though no personal petitions for clemency had been filed. That's right--these terrorists had not asked for clemency prior to the Justice Department's efforts to free them. Indeed, no such petitions were ever filed. And the absence of petitions was not a mere oversight: the FALN terrorists refused to file such petitions because they do not recognize that their criminal acts were wrongful or that the United States government had the right to punish them for committing those acts. 
   I have the utmost respect for the career men and women at the Justice Department. It appears, however, the Department caved in to political pressure in this case. Although it submitted a report in December 1996 recommending against the granting of clemency for the FALN terrorists--which should have ended its involvement--the Pardon Attorney produced another report two-and-a-half years later reportedly changing its recommendation. The second report did not recommend either for or against the granting of clemency, violating the Justice Department regulation requiring that in every clemency case the Department ``shall report in writing [its] recommendation to the President, stating whether in [its] judgment the President should grant or deny the petition.'' 
   Why did the Justice Department's recommendation change? What happened between the first report in December 1996 and the second one in the summer of 1999 that justified a reexamination and change of the Department's conclusion? Because of the President's assertion of executive privilege, we may never know for sure. It was a mistake for the President to let politics affect such an important clemency decision, but is much worse than a mistake when political pressure forces an independent agency to alter its advice against its better judgment. 
   The Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act will help prevent this from happening again. It will make available to the President access to the most pertinent facts concerning the exercise of executive clemency, including information from law enforcement agencies about the risks posed by any release from prison. It will also help ensure that--if the President chooses to have the Department of Justice conduct a clemency review--the victims of crime will not be shut out of the clemency process while terrorists and their organized sympathizers have access to--and obtain advice from--high government officials. In other words, this Act will insure that the tax-payer funded Justice Department will, when assisting the President in a clemency review, focus on public safety, not politics. Let me be clear that the Department of Justice is an agency which I have great respect for. Its employees are loyal, dedicated public servants. This bill is aimed at helping the Department, not hurting it. 
   Specifically, our bill will do the following: 
   1. Give victims a voice by insuring that they are notified of key events in the clemency process and by giving them an opportunity to voice their opinions. 
   2. Enhance the voice of law enforcement by requiring the Pardon Attorney to notify the law enforcement community of a clemency investigation and permitting law enforcement to express its views on: the impact of clemency on the individuals affected by the decision--for example, victims and witnesses; whether clemency candidates have information which might help in other investigations; and whether granting clemency will increase the threat of terrorism or other criminal activity. 
   Of course, it is the hope of all the co-sponsors--and all Americans--that presidents will use the congressionally created and funded Office of the Pardon Attorney in order to make the best possible decisions regarding executive clemency. I believe that when Congress passes this bill--and should President Clinton sign it into law--future Presidents, victims, and the American public will be well served. If President Clinton wants to help in this effort to restore integrity to the clemency process, he will announce his support for this bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce what I believe is one of the most important pieces of legislation the Senate will consider this year, the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act. 
   At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to my two lead cosponsors, Senator ABRAHAM and Senator GRAMM. Both have worked tirelessly with me to craft this legislation. Senator ABRAHAM, of course, as chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, has long led the way on this matter. I also thank our Democrat sponsors, Senators GRAHAM, LIEBERMAN, and FEINSTEIN, as well as our majority leader and assistant majority leader for their contributions to this effort. 
   Last month, the national jobless rate hit 4 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. That jobless rate is even lower in my home State of Utah at 3.3 percent. That's great news; but at the same time, serious labor shortages threaten our continued economic prosperity and global competitiveness. A recent study, for example, concluded that a shortage of high-tech professionals is currently costing the U.S. economy $105 billion a year. 
   A look at last Sunday's Washington Post makes the problem very clear. High-tech jobs even have their own separate section of help wanted ads. Twenty-one pages of jobs, jobs, jobs. 
   The Clinton administration recently projected that in the next 5 years, high-tech and related employment will grow ``more than twice as fast as employment in the economy as a whole.'' The growth of the high-tech industry is being felt across this country, and nowhere more than in my State of Utah. Common sense tells us that we must allow American high-tech companies to fill their labor needs in the United States, or they will be forced to take these opportunities of growth abroad. 
   We want the high tech industry to thrive in the United States and to continue to serve as the engine for the growth of jobs and opportunities for American workers. If Congress fails to act promptly to alleviate today's high-tech labor shortage, today's low jobless rate will be a mere precursor to tomorrow's lost opportunities. 
   The purpose of our important bipartisan legislation is twofold: (1) To allow for a necessary infusion of high-tech workers in the short term, and (2) to make prudent investments in our own workforce for the long term. 
   It is clear that in the short term we need to raise the limits of the number of temporary visas for highly skilled labor. Our bill does this by increasing the cap to 195,0000 visas over each of the next 3 years. We also exempt persons from the cap who come to work in our universities and persons who have recently received advanced degrees in our educational institutions. 
   But this, by itself, is not a satisfactory solution either in the short item or long term. Thus, we need to redouble our efforts to provide training and educational opportunities for our current and future workforce. Thus, we raise an additional $150 million for scholarships and training of American workers for these jobs for a total of $375 million for education and training under this program over 3 fiscal years. Our legislation, in other words, seeks  to address both the short and long term needs. 
   My hope is that the administration will come to support this important high-tech legislation. In our new knowledge-based economy, where ideas and innovations rather than land or natural resources are the principal well springs of economy growth, American competitiveness depends greatly on intellectual assets and capacity. The most successful economics of the 21st century will be those which maximize intellectual assets. In recognition of this fact, the administration has worked with me over the years to improve intellectual property protection and to encourage developing nations to invest in doing likewise. For this reason, I believe that the administration appreciates the need for this legislation. In the end, I hope they will have the smarts to listen to Alan Greenspan--who has testified about the need for this bill--and that the administration will support its passage.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the San Rafael Western Legacy District and National Conservation Act. I am proud to sponsor this legislation which is a result of local citizens working together with federal land managers to produce a plan that promotes and protects one of our nation's finest natural treasures, the San Rafael Swell in Emery County, Utah. 
   This is by no means a standard one-size-fits-all land management scheme. It reflects both local and national interests. I wish to congratulate the elected officials of Emery County, Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt, local citizen groups, and local Bureau of Land Management professionals for their willingness to come to the table and craft this proposal. It is a testament to what I have always believed: that those who live on and around our public lands love the land and, given the chance, will find ways to help protect it. I hope that this effort to work out solutions to land issues with meaningful local input will become the norm for federal land policy. 
   Mr. President, under this legislation, 2.8 million acres will be designated as the San Rafael Western Legacy District. Visitors to the San Rafael will be able to see where Kit Carson, Chief Walker, Wesley Powell, Butch Cassidy and many others became famous, or infamous as the case may be. Backpackers and day hikers will be surprised by petroglyphs that tell stories of Native American ancestors and that give a picture of life as it once was. Families will enjoy access to one of the largest sources of fossils in the New World. They will also enjoy a variety of quality museums that already exist in the area which take us back in time, whether it be the time of dinosaurs, Native Americans, pioneers and the wild west, early explorers, or even the early atomic arms race. 
   A the core of this Western Legacy District will be the San Rafael National Conservation Area, which will withdraw approximately 1 million acres from development. Mr. President, Congress cannot create spectacular geologic formations, such as the San Rafael Swell, but this legislation will protect what God has given us. The San Rafael Swell is vast and can accommodate all types of experiences including wilderness, wildlife viewing, fishing, mountain biking, and other activities. The specifics for these uses will be detailed in a forty year planning process led by the Secretary of Interior. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce this legislation along with my good friend and colleague Senator ROBERT BENNETT. A companion measure in the House is sponsored by Representative CHRIS CANNON. 
   The San Rafael Swell is an area rich in history, beauty, culture, and tradition. This legislation protects the San Rafael for all citizens in a manner that reflects the needs of those directly affected by its bounties. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the confirmation of Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. 
   Mr. President, our economy has just completed its 107th month of expansion--a record period of growth in peacetime or war in our Nation. Our economy is the marvel of the world, and for good reason. The unemployment rate is at a record low, and the Gross Domestic Product grew at a rate of almost 6 percent in the second half of 1999. 
   Despite this low unemployment and high growth, factors that can typically bring about strong inflation, inflation has been kept in check. Part of the reason for this is due to increases in productivity, which resulted in large part from the pro-growth economic policies of the 1980s as well as stunning technological advances. 
   These technological advances are revolutionizing the way America does business and are changing the face of our economy. Some are calling it a ``new economy,'' because it seems to defy some of the conventional forces that shaped the economy in the past. Some are going so far as to suggest that the economic cycle may be dead and that we do not need to worry as much about these old forces. 
   Now that the economy has surpassed all previous records of growth, there are signs that it is perhaps overheating. Yesterday, the Federal Open Market Committee and the Federal Reserve, under the leadership of Chairman Greenspan, raised the federal funds and the discount rates as a further measure to counter this possible overheating. Some are criticizing these moves, saying they are unnecessary and that the ``new economy'' does not need the same kind of restraint as did the old. 
   But, Mr. President, I would certainly be cautious about second-guessing the wisdom of Alan Greenspan. Over the past 13 years, Alan Greenspan has been the voice of steady reason and common sense for our monetary policy. His policies have shown prescience, and his stewardship has been confident and strong. Chairman Greenspan has been the voice of common sense that the financial markets listen to and respect. I believe we are indeed fortunate to have had the services of Chairman Greenspan over the past 13 years, and I commend the President for reappointing him to this key post. I am greatly pleased and relieved that he is willing to serve another term. We need his experience. We need his wisdom. And we need his continuing steady hand at the helm of our monetary policy. 
   Whether or not we truly have a new economy that will continue to defy traditional forces, I don't know. But I am very pleased that Alan Greenspan is here to guide us and I enthusiastically support his confirmation and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, bankruptcy law already covers willful, malicious, intentional conduct about which the distinguished Senator from Washington has been talking. 
   I rise to speak in opposition to this amendment offered by the Senator from New York. Nobody in this body condones violence of any kind. There is no excuse for it; that is, whether it is committed at an abortion clinic, whether it is committed by labor unions, or whether it is committed against churches, or for any other reason. But this amendment has nothing legitimate to do with bankruptcy reform. In my view, we should focus on our task of providing real bankruptcy relief for the American people. 
   This amendment is unnecessary. It provides that debts and liabilities arising from abortion clinic violence would not be dischargeable in bankruptcy. There simply is no need to place damages regarding access to abortions in a special class with special protections above other damages for other actions, including, for example, actions under civil rights laws. Not only is it poor policy to segregate certain classes of violence for special status in bankruptcy, but the bankruptcy code already allows for the nondischargeability of debts for ``willful and malicious injury by the debtor.'' This is already taken care of, if that is what the Senator is really concerned about, willful and malicious injury caused by the debtor. Indeed, I asked to include a summary of a recent case in the RECORD. 
   In that case, the Behn case, it is said, in a newspaper report of that case:  
   A veteran anti-abortion protester cannot use bankruptcy to erase a debt of more than $50,000 in court-imposed fines, legal fees and interest she owes a Buffalo clinic that performs abortions, a federal judge has ruled. 
   ``If anyone thought they might escape penalties for violating a judge's order through bankruptcy,'' said Glenn E. Murray, a lawyer who represented the clinic, ``they should read this decision.''  
   Already the law takes care of what the distinguished Senator from New York would like to have taken care of. 
   Notwithstanding that this amendment is entitled ``Nondischargeability of Debts Incurred Through the Commission of Violence at Clinics,'' its reach extends much more broadly. That is where the danger comes in. 
   For example, the amendment, by its own terms, is not limited to acts of violence, as the title would lead us to believe, but covers acts of ``interference with'' a person seeking an abortion, whatever that means. In addition, the amendment refers to ``an actual or potential action under any Federal, State, or local law'' having to do with providing abortions. 
   As I read this language, it goes far beyond the discrete issue of violence at abortion clinics. In fact, if you read this language in the actual amendment, it has some very strange language in it. It says, in paragraph (3)(C):  
   an actual or potential action alleging the violation of any Federal, State, or local statutory or common law, including chapter 96 of title 18 and the Federal civil rights laws (including sections 1977 through 1980 of the Revised Statutes) that results from the debtor's actual, attempted, or alleged--(i) harassment of, intimidation of, interference with, obstruction of .....  
   Then it gets into injury to, threat to, or violence against any person. Look at that language: harassment, intimidation, 
   interference. My goodness. 
   I urge my colleagues to read the actual text of the amendment before they vote. If they believe they are voting on an amendment that strictly covers acts of violence at abortion clinics, they are mistaken. Who knows how this amendment is going to be applied otherwise. The bankruptcy law already takes care of violence, abortion clinic violence, if you will. It does not discharge that in bankruptcy. The cases so state. I do not think we should fail to recognize that the bankruptcy code already provides or allows for the nondischargeability of debts ``for willful and malicious injury by the debtor.'' 
   This goes far beyond real injury. This actually could be used to oppress people who legitimately feel otherwise than the abortion clinic does. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. At the appropriate time, I am sure the distinguished Senator from Iowa or myself will move to table the amendment. I hope we can reject this amendment. I hope it is not necessary for the Vice President to come and break a tie vote on this matter. I think this would be catastrophic language in the bankruptcy code, which already does take care of violence at abortion clinics. Case law so states. 
   This is just another overreach by those who want to make a political issue out of something that does not deserve to be in the bankruptcy code, although I believe it is a sincere overreach that perhaps is not considered such by my dear friend from New York, for whom I have a lot of esteem in the law. I am concerned about this kind of language. It is very broad, very undefined. No question that it goes far beyond actual injury, far beyond malicious conduct, far beyond willful and malicious injury that the bankruptcy code already covers. We have enough in the code to take care of problems at abortion clinics without putting in harassment, intimidation, interference, and obstruction into the bankruptcy code.  
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, look, let's not get this amendment mixed up. The current law takes care of actual injury. It takes care of malicious injury and willful injury by the debtor. That is not discharged in bankruptcy. So it has nothing to do with violence. The current law takes care of that. 
   None of us condone violence. That is not what this amendment is about. Look at the doggone language of this amendment. It is unbelievable. What it says here is, ``an actual or potential action alleging the violation of any Federal, State, or local statutory or common law'' and ``that results from the debtor's actual, attempted, or alleged harassment.....'' 
   What does that mean? ``Intimidation of.....'' What does that mean? If somebody says ``boo,'' are they intimidating and they could not be discharged in bankruptcy, in an unjust case in bankruptcy where they haven't caused any harm or willful malicious injury? Interference with? Obstruction of? This is an overreach if there ever was one, since we already have bankruptcy law that provides nondischargeability of debts of a debtor who has caused willful or malicious injury to another person, or even to the clinic, I suppose. We should not get into a type of social engineering in the bankruptcy code since we already take care of willful and malicious activities. When you start talking about harassment, intimidation, obstruction, interference--these are words that can be used in a criminal code, but they should not be used in the bankruptcy code which already provides for willful, malicious injury by the debtor as 
   nondischargeable in bankruptcy. I think when we get into that stuff we are getting into areas that basically disrupt the code and should not be part of the code. 
   None of us tolerate or approve of violence at the abortion clinics. Some of these anti-abortion people who have committed violence should be punished to the full extent of the law. They should not be allowed to get away with it. Whichever side you are on in this issue ought to be a side of debate and a side of honest debate, not a side of violence. But we take care of willful and malicious injury, which may not even be violence. It may be something that even involves negligence, I suppose. We take care of it in the current code. 
   Why should we amend the code just because some would like to do so with this strange and very undefined language. Plus, it is something that everybody ought to think about--improper and illegal, or should I say nonlegal, to argue that this amendment is all about violence. It is not at all. It is about extending what is already covered to areas that literally do not involve violence or malicious injury or willful and violent and malicious conduct. That is not what the bankruptcy code should be all about. I hope our colleagues will vote this amendment down. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the end of this matter we are going to vote on these amendments. Then we will have a managers' amendment and finish the bill. 
   I want to personally express my respect for and appreciation of both Senators GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, and others for the hard work they have done in bringing this bill through the subcommittee and through the Judiciary Committee and on to the floor. Senator SESSIONS has been a very solid supporter of good bankruptcy legislation, as well as others on the Judiciary Committee--I hate to leave anybody out--but especially Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI. They deserve a lot of respect for what was a very difficult bill to bring through even a subcommittee, let alone the full committee and the floor. 
   I am hopeful we will get this bill all the way through and signed by the President. It is a bill that will make a great deal of difference in everybody's lives and, I think, will set the bankruptcy code in the direction it should go and stop some of the fraud and some of the misuses of bankruptcy that are going on currently in our bankruptcy system. 
   There are some things we will have to work on in conference; there is no question about that. We will try to perfect this bill as best we can, hopefully, so that both sides are pleased with it. There are some problems that naturally do exist, but we will work with our friends on the other side and see what we can do to resolve any conflicts we have. 
   Again, I thank the distinguished ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY. He and his staff have played an excellent role, along with the staffs of Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI, in helping to bring this about. 
   I thank my own staff for the work they have done. All of these staff members have worked diligently to do what is a very good job on bankruptcy. 
   Having said that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, many Members have come to different conclusions as to the need for this amendment concerning the dischargeability of debts related to abortion clinic violence. It is clear from today's debate, nobody in the Congress supports violence at abortion clinics, or at any other venue. Those of us who support bankruptcy reform do not believe that the bankruptcy laws should be used to shield any acts of violence. 
   Many of us believe that current law already precludes those found guilty of violent activities at abortion clinics from discharging debts arising from such activity in bankruptcy. But apparently the sponsors of the amendment believe there is more than can be done in this area. 
   Although I believe this amendment to be tremendously flawed, the majority leader, Senator GRASSLEY, and I recommend that members on both sides vote for this amendment. We will, in good faith, in conference correct the amendment and resolve these problems at that time. With this amendment accepted, nobody will be able to politically demagogue this issue in the context of true bankruptcy reform. 
   We pledge to work with our friends on both sides of the aisle who are interested in this issue during conference to make sure that the law is clear, that with due respect for the first amendment, debts arising from violent acts cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. 
   Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have said before, this amendment bars firearm manufacturers and sellers, including retailers, from business reorganization under the bankruptcy code by not allowing the discharge of debts that might result from one of these recently filed tort suits. That means a major retailer could go bankrupt and would not be able to reorganize to be able to pay off their debts. It would just gradually be sold off to meet the needs of this particular amendment. Manufacturers that could pay off injured parties substantially in full over time would simply not be able to do so under this amendment. Instead, they would be forced into liquidation. 
   It is both poor policy and a dangerous precedent to single out an unpopular industry for unfavorable treatment under the bankruptcy code. This is political correctness gone awry. As I recall, there are 18 exemptions on the personal side but none on the corporate side in this bill so far. Let us keep the bankruptcy laws nondiscriminatory in the sense of attacking and loading it up on an unpopular business just for political purposes. That is the wrong political correctness to be used. In this particular case, it just doesn't make sense. We ought to want them to go into reorganization so the debts could be paid and the business might be able to survive. That is why this amendment needs to be voted down. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, S. 625, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, is one of the most important legislative efforts to reform the bankruptcy laws in decades. 
   I want to thank a few of the people who have worked on this bill. Let me first acknowledge the Majority Leader, who has worked very hard to keep this bill moving forward. Given the demanding Senate schedule, it would have been easier for him to have refused to take up the bill, but because of his dedication to the important reforms in this bill, we now have legislation that makes enormous strides in eliminating abuse in the bankruptcy system. I am also grateful to the assistant majority leader, Senator NICKLES, along with Senators DASCHLE and REID for their efforts in working with us to move the legislation forward. 
   Let me also acknowledge the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, who has worked tirelessly to reach agreement on many of the bill's provisions, and who ably managed the bill for his side of the aisle. I also want to commend  my colleagues, Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI, the Chairman and ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, respectively, for their tremendous efforts in crafting this much needed legislation. I particularly appreciate the dedication they have shown in making the passage of this bill an inclusive and bipartisan process. 
   Also, let me express my thanks to Senator SESSIONS who has shown unwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this bill, to Senator BIDEN for his efforts over the past two years in helping see sensible reform through the Senate, and to the many other members of the Senate for their hard work and cooperation. 
   At the Committee staff level, let me acknowledge a few people who have worked very hard on this bill. Kolan Davis and John McMickle of the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee staff, along with Ed Haden, Kristi Lee and Sean Costello of the Youth Violence Subcommittee staff deserve praise for their impressive efforts on this legislation. In addition, Judiciary Committee Counsels Makan Delrahim, who was the lead counsel on this bill, Rene Augustine, and Kyle Sampson, as well as staff assistant Karen Wright, are to be commended for their hard work on this important bill. Thanks as well should be given to the Judiciary Committee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Manus Cooney, one of the most able and hard-working Chief Counsels the Committee has had. 
   On Senator LEAHY's Committee staff, I want to acknowledge Minority Chief Counsel Bruce Cohen, along with counsel Ed Pagano for their efforts. In addition, I want to recognize the tireless efforts of Eric Shuffler and Jennifer Leach of Senator TORRICELLI's staff, as well as the hard work of Jim Greene of Senator BIDEN's staff, the Youth Violence Subcommittee's Minority Chief Counsel Sheryl Walter, as well as Ben Lawsky of Senator SCHUMER's staff. 
   I also want to commend Jim Hecht of the majority leader's staff, Stewart Verdery, Eric Ueland, and Matt Kirk of the assistant majority leader's staff, Jonathan Adelstein of Senator DASCHLE's staff, and Eddie Ayoob and Peter Arapis of the Minority Whip's staff for their efforts on this legislation. 
   The compelling need for this reform is underscored by the dramatic rise we have seen over the past several years in bankruptcy filings. The Bankruptcy Code was liberalized back in 1978, and since that time, consumer bankruptcy filings have risen at an unprecedented rate. 
   Mr. President, the bankruptcy system was intended to provide a ``fresh start'' for those who truly need it. We need to preserve the bankruptcy system within limits to allow individuals to emerge from severe financial hardship. What we do not need is to preserve the elements of the system that allow it to be abused--that allow some debtors to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool rather than as a last resort. I firmly believe that by allowing people who can repay their debts to avoid their financial obligations, we are doing a disservice to the honest and hardworking people in this country who end up paying for it. 
   Mr. President, again I would like to applaud the bipartisan efforts of my colleagues who have made S. 625 a broadly-supported bill. The impact of this important legislation not only will be to curb the rampant number of frivolous bankruptcy filings, but also will be to give a boost to our economy.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendments offered by the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. His amendment is, in fact, two amendments--one to the bankruptcy laws and one to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 
   The debt collection amendment would prohibit anyone, such as a grocery store or a hotel, who cashes  checks for a fee and defers depositing the check from notifying the writer of a check which is later bounced that they will seek civil or criminal penalties for that bounced check. It is important to keep in mind that under most State laws writing bad checks is a crime and many States allow for civil and/or criminal penalties against those who write fraudulent checks. 
   The other part of this amendment would disallow in bankruptcy claims arising from a deferred deposit loan--a so-called payday loan--if the annual percentage rate of the loan exceeds 100 percent. 
   Although well intentioned, this amendment is misplaced. So-called payday loans are made when a borrower writes a check for the loan amount plus a fee. The lender typically gives the borrower the loan amount and holds the check until a future date. In making payday loans, these lenders provide a vital service to the poorest borrowers. Because sometimes it is more convenient to go to a hotel, grocery store, gas station, or other similar businesses that may keep longer hours than banks, many consumers choose to cash a check at these types of places when they need small amounts of money to overcome an emergency. 
   With this check cashing service, borrowers can get the emergency cash they need without telling the boss they need a cash advance or giving up their televisions and furniture. This is a legitimate service that many honest consumers use and in which established businesses engage. 
   If adopted, this amendment may operate to the detriment of the very people it is intended to help. So I urge colleagues to vote against that amendment. 
   The lifeline account amendment would disallow the bankruptcy claims of certain banks and credit unions. In particular, it would disallow claims by larger institutions, such as banks with more than $200 million in aggregate assets that offer retail depository services to the public, unless they offer the specific services required by this amendment. First, these institutions would be required to offer both checking and savings accounts with ``low fees'' or no fees at all. Second, they would have to offer ``low'' or no minimum balance requirements for checking and savings accounts--and to any consumer, regardless of income level. Further, the ``penalty'' for not providing these particular services is the disallowance of the bank's claim in bankruptcy. That is a harsh penalty, indeed, and a windfall for bankrupts. 
   Let me explain what this means. It means someone with the resources of, let's say, Steve Forbes can walk into one of these banks, and if he is denied a ``low fee'' or no fee account, then any claim that bank has in any bankruptcy proceeding--not just Steve's bankruptcy--then the bank's claims are disallowed. I emphasize that any claim in any bankruptcy will be disallowed because the bank did not offer Steve Forbes a ``low'' or no fee checking account. Let me substitute Bill Gates' name for Steve Forbes here. 
   I should also note that this amendment does not describe what a ``low fee'' account is. Whose standard of low are we to base this dictated fee on? This is bad policy that would effectively dictate to banks the specific services they must offer, whether or not consumers need or want them. This is Government interference with free markets at its worse. Whenever such rules are forced on businesses, the offsetting costs inevitably occur. In other words, consumers will end up paying for mandated low fee or free checking in the form of higher prices for other services. Alternatively, other services by banks may be discontinued to offset the costs of these new requirements, not to mention the costs of the penalties. I don't believe this kind of regulatory interference with the markets is either warranted or wise. I urge colleagues to oppose this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan. This amendment makes debts owed by a corporation on account of firearms non-dischargeable in a chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy proceeding if the debt arose out of an action for fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, nuisance, or product liability. In addition, this amendment excepts such  debts from the automatic stay protection provided in a bankruptcy proceeding. 
   This amendment effectively singles out both gun manufacturers and those who legally transfer guns, including major retailers who sells guns in compliance with all laws, and prevents them from successfully reorganizing under the bankruptcy laws, if they should need such reorganization. If a large product liability suit succeeds against a gun manufacturer, this amendment virtually ensures that the companies affected will be driven out of business and its workers will lose their jobs. 
   In addition to being just bad policy, the amendment is also self-defeating. Here is why: it effectively assures that only a fraction of the judgment against the affected company will be paid, if at all. That is because those manufacturers that could pay off the judgment over time will not be able to do so, and will be forced into liquidation. This is neither good for the lawful business, nor for those other investors or creditors with legitimate claims against the company. 
   I also want to point out to my colleagues that as a matter of longstanding bankruptcy policy in the United States, it has been universally recognized that if a company with manufacturing expertise suffers an unexpected financial setback--whether from a huge products liability judgment or business reverses--everyone is better off if it can at least try and restructure the business to preserve its legitimate business lines. Workers can save their jobs and creditors can be paid off over time from the operating revenues of the restructured company, receiving much more than they would from liquidation. It is not as if this amendment, much to the dismay of its supporters, will wipe out the second amendment's protection to bear arms. What this amendment will do is ensure that the manufacture of legal arms, and the corresponding jobs it creates, will move overseas. 
   Longstanding bankruptcy policy in this country has been that bankruptcy laws should apply to all lawful products and industries in a similar fashion; not pick and choose between unpopular, but legal, industries. This amendment unfairly singles out one industry for unfavorable treatment, and does so in an unprecedented fashion. In my view, Congress should be loathe to single out companies that legally manufacture or sell lawful products for unfavorable treatment, simply because they are unpopular. Which industry will be targeted next? 
   We should not be setting the precedent that lines of business that are unpopular with some in the Congress, but legal, will be denied the ability to reorganize in bankruptcy. If we do this to firearms manufacturers, what about companies involved in other industries, such as medical devices, drug manufacturing, or automobile makers? The basic social policy that it is better to keep the company operating and paying off the judgment than liquidating it should not be narrowed company by company, industry by industry. 
   Plain and simple, this amendment is designed to encourage lawsuits by trial lawyers against gun manufacturers and retailers who sell guns. And I think this amendment is part of an effort to put the firearms industry out of business. 
   Let me emphasize that I am very concerned about the gun violence our country has experienced in recent years. However, I am a firm believer in second amendment rights. The amendment encourages the new wave of lawsuits we have all been hearing about, in which gun manufacturers are being sued for the conduct of third-party criminals. Liberals have been unable to eliminate the second amendment or the gun industry through direct legislation, so they are attempting to eliminate it through this kind of backdoor ``policy through litigation'' approach. 
   This amendment promotes an issue that has nothing to do with real bankruptcy reform and sets an undesirable precedent. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
   It is time for us in the Congress to grow up with regard to firearms matters in our country. There is no use kidding ourselves. We have passed some 20,000 rules, regulations, and laws in this country against the use of firearms that have limited our second amendment rights and privileges. There are some legitimate arguments against this type of legislation. I believe it is far preferable for us to uphold second amendment rights and privileges and get tougher on criminals. 
   Our problem in this country, and especially over the last 7 years, is that this administration has not been serious about getting tough on criminals. Under Project Triggerlock, the number of gun prosecutions under that approach, which was working very well under President Bush, has now dropped by 50 percent. No wonder the President in his State of the Union Address said: We are going to start doing something about gun crimes. 
   They caught 12,000 people illegally taking guns to school in the last few years, and there have been only 13 prosecutions. Last year, up to January 1, they caught 100,000 people under the instant check system. They call that Brady, as if that were a victory by the administration. Brady was first a 7-day waiting period which devolved into 5 days. In order to not prevent decent, law-abiding citizens from purchasing their guns, we instituted the instant check system, and it has worked magnificently. 
   Of the 100,000 people they caught last year trying to illegally purchase weapons, I do not recall one single prosecution. I understand that 200 have been recommended for prosecution, one-fifth of 1 percent. I could go on and on. 
   This administration has not been serious about gun crimes, and we have not had a lot of help from people who are opposed to the second amendment in helping to resolve these problems. The juvenile justice bill is caught up in a conference that is impossible to resolve unless we get rid of this issue and do what has to be done in the interest of juvenile justice. 
   The fact of the matter is, there is always going to be somebody trying to--and sincerely so--make political points on the issue of guns and weapons. 
   This is not the bill on which they should be making those political points. This would be a very disastrous approach towards bankruptcy law. It means that anytime you find enough popular business a majority of Members of Congress can stick it to, they are going to be able to do it under the bankruptcy laws. That is ridiculous. When we start showing preferences for certain political points of view in bankruptcies to the exclusion of common sense, then it seems to me we are all going to suffer. Sooner or later, it is going to affect something that each one of us treasures or thinks is particularly important. 
   I speak in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would do an injustice to the bankruptcy laws. In the process, I think we will not accomplish what my friends on the other side, who are sincere about it--at least I believe most of them are sincere about it--really want to do. It is better for us to battle out these issues in Congress. I, for one, will be opposed to any diminution in our second amendment rights and privileges. If you want to diminish the second amendment, then you ought to do it by constitutional amendment. You shouldn't be doing it by bits and tatters. It ought to be done straight up, and it ought to be done in a way that is constitutionally justifiable, and not in these bits and pieces that literally make political points but do not belong in something as important as this bankruptcy bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as we come to the end of the first month of the new millennium, I want to make a few remarks about the great promise of biotechnology in benefitting the American public. In fact, January 2000 has been very appropriately designated as Biotechnology Month. 
   In my view, this first century of the new millennium will be remembered by historians for revolutionary advances in biomedical research. It is fitting that in the next few months scientists will complete the mapping of the human genome--the basic blueprint of the structure of human beings. This event ranks very high in the technological achievements of mankind. 
   It is also noteworthy that this task required the confluence of some of the best minds in the medical sciences and computer technology. Frankly, the mapping of the human genome simply would not have been possible at this time absent the development of the low-cost, high-speed computers that have been available to scientists in recent years. Over the next few decades perhaps no more valuable cargo will travel down the information highway of the Internet than the gene maps. 
   This new knowledge will not sit idly in digital databases. For once the detailed genetic structure is known and accessible, researchers will be better able to understand the function of individual genes and complex interactions among collections of genes. Once both structure and function are ascertained, diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents and preventives such as vaccines can be more easily developed. It is the American public who stands to benefit most from this new knowledge and products. 
   It would be difficult to underestimate the effect that biotechnology will have on health care delivery and, more to the point, on the health status of the American public and our neighbors throughout the world. In the area of cancer, for example, we are positioned to make substantial gains in knowledge that will make traditional treatments obsolete. I am pleased that the University of Utah and Myriad Genetics, a small Salt Lake City biotech firm, are at the forefront of the battle against breast cancer. Their work on the BRCA-I gene has contributed substantially to our understanding of how this terrible disease is triggered genetically. All of us wish success to these Utah scientists and their colleagues throughout the world in their efforts to curtail breast cancer. 
   Advances in biotechnology will also emanate from the medical device industry. For example, Paradigm Medical Industries, another Salt Lake City firm, is refining existing laser technology in order to develop a new ``cold'' laser that promises to reduce the adverse reactions rate associated with cataract surgery. While I may not be expert in all the scientific underpinnings of this new photon phacoemulsification system, I can say that since over 3 million cataract procedures are performed annually it is in the interest of the public to cut down on the current corneal burn rate of about 1,000 per day. 
   As a representative of the people of Utah, I am proud to report that my state is home to over 120 companies in the biosciences. These firms employ over 11,000 Utahns and an additional 2,500 individuals outside of Utah. Total annual revenues of these Utah bioscience firms is in excess of $1.6 billion. The aggregate estimated market value of these firms exceeds $8 billion. 
   The success of Utah in the exciting arena of biotechnology has been facilitated by the efforts the Utah Life Science Association--ULSA--and the State of Utah's Division of Business and Economic Development. I must commend the leadership of Governor Leavitt and Brian Moss of ULSA for their tireless efforts to promote the expansion of Utah's biotechnology sector. 
   Utah is certainly not alone in its activity in biotechnology. Nationally, there are over 1300 biotech companies. Collectively, these firms employ over 150,000 people. The biotechnology industry accounts for over $10 billion in research and discovery activities annually and revenues of over $18 billion. 
   Frankly, despite this impressive record of success, we have only scratched the surface of the future promise of this industry. About 90 biotechnology products have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. More telling of the growing strength of this industry is the fact that over 350 biotechnology products are in late stage clinical trials. As these products move to the FDA approval stage, it seems foreseeable that in the next few years this research intensive sector, which recorded a net loss of $5 billion in 1998, will move into and stay in the black. 
   As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as a Senator with a long time interest in health care, I can assure my colleagues that I will do all in my power to ensure that our intellectual property laws are structured in a way to help assure that the promising work in biotechnology laboratories can be delivered to the bedside of American patients in a fair and expeditious manner. To meet the goal of delivering new therapies to the patients, we must also work to ensure that the FDA regulatory system promptly and consistently renders judgments based on science and that the laws affecting international trade do not result in unnecessary barriers to delivering these new breakthroughs worldwide. 
   In closing, I think it only fitting that the Senate has taken special note of the almost limitless frontier of biotechnology at the dawn of a new century and new millennium.

   Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I thank my colleagues. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that we have finally reached an agreement to complete floor consideration of the bankruptcy reform legislation. It was my intention that we finish consideration and pass this bill tonight, but we cannot get it done so we will do it next Tuesday. To that end, I hope any Member who intends to offer an amendment under the agreement comes down and begins debating it as soon as possible. 
   First, I commend everyone who has worked hard to make this agreement a reality. It took a lot of effort and cooperation to come together and get to where we are today. My staff, the majority and minority leadership and floor staffs, Senator LEAHY's and Senator REID's staffs, Senator GRASSLEY's staff, and Senator GRAMM's staff all worked literally the whole day yesterday to craft the agreement we are operating under. We have a lot of work still ahead of us. We not only have the 13 amendments we must consider today, but we have a number of major issues to resolve in conference. This bill is far from becoming law at this point, but I am optimistic that we can work together as we have done in the past to have a fair and balanced reform bill that the President can sign. 
   Mr. President, I have stood here on the Senate floor many times and professed the need for reforming our bankruptcy system. I stand before you again today and say that the Senate has enjoyed a lengthy deliberative process. Along with my Senate colleagues, I have debated the legislation and many of its amendments at great length over the past several years. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, chaired by my good friend Senator GRASSLEY, has held numerous hearings on the issue of bankruptcy reform, gaining insights from literally dozens of witnesses. 
   I am optimistic that we will restore fairness and integrity to our bankruptcy system. I am encouraged by what has transpired in the House of Representatives with respect to bankruptcy reform: the House bill is more stringent in terms of reform than the bill we are considering here in the Senate, and it nonetheless passed by an overwhelming, veto-proof margin of 313 to 108. 
   Not long ago in our Nation's past, there was an expectation that people should repay what they have borrowed. Hand in hand with this expectation was a stigma that attached to those who filed bankruptcy. The bankruptcy system, as it was originally envisioned, was truly a last resort. It was intended to give those who needed it--those in serious financial difficulty, with no way out of their hard times--a fresh start. As our bankruptcy system has evolved over the years, this original mission has become lost. 
   Our current system, I am sorry to say, allows some people who are able to repay their debts to avoid doing so. It does this by treating income as irrelevant, and by allowing people to exploit various loopholes. When I talk with the hardworking folks both from my state of Utah, and more recently all across this great Nation, I simply cannot defend the current system. I cannot find an adequate explanation for why our current laws let people who have the capacity to repay their debts use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. I cannot justify the more than $400 hidden tax our current bankruptcy system imposes on every American family every year. 
   It is no mystery that when someone borrows money or buys something on credit, and then files a bankruptcy of convenience, someone does not get paid back. This is true whether the creditor is a large lending company in which a retiree's pension funds may be invested, or a small family business. Under the current system, when bankruptcies of convenience are filed, everyone loses except for the unscrupulous person who games the system. Studies have been conducted that show that between 6 and 15 percent of filers are using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, running up debts and erasing them without any noticeable impact on their lifestyle. When we look at the daunting number of bankruptcy filings we have seen in recent years, these abuses are a major problem. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans filed for bankruptcy. As I have pointed out before, more Americans filed bankruptcy than graduated from college, were on active military duty, or worked in the post office. During these days of great economic prosperity, these record filings are outrageous. 
   We must put an end to the system that allows people to live high on the hog. 
   The bill also puts the brakes on an abuse known as ``loading up,'' when debtors take out large cash advances on their credit cards and buy luxury goods on the eve of their filing for bankruptcy. 
   The bill is also designed to enhance consumer protections by imposing penalties on creditors who overreach. Penalties are imposed on creditors who refuse to negotiate in good faith with debtors prior to declaring bankruptcy, who willfully fail to properly credit payments made by the debtor in a chapter 13 plan, and who threaten to file motions in order to coerce a reaffirmation without justification. The bill also contains provisions designed to eliminate abusive reaffirmation practices. 
   The bill protects debtors by imposing requirements on lawyers who represent debtors in bankruptcy. These provisions are intended to target the practices of so-called bankruptcy mills, which aggressively promote bankruptcy to people with financial problems when bankruptcy may not be in their best interests. 
   I am particularly proud of the advancements this bill makes in helping people to avoid bankruptcy and avoid repeating financial problems. The bill provides for education for debtors with respect to their alternatives to bankruptcy, along with financial management education and credit counseling. 
   This bill also protects our children. Anyone who knows my record in the Senate knows I have been a strong advocate for children for many years. It is not surprising that this is a particularly important aspect of the bill. From the time this bill was being drafted and through the process of committee markup and floor consideration, I made it a top priority to ensure that the bill included provisions to prevent deadbeat parents from using bankruptcy to get out of paying child support and alimony. Under my provisions, the obligation to pay child support and alimony is moved to a first-priority status, as opposed to its current place at seventh in line, behind attorney's fees and other special interests. If you really want to know the truth, my measures make improvements over current law in this area that are too numerous to mention here at this time, but they work to facilitate the collection of child support and alimony and effectively prevent deadbeats from getting their obligations discharged. 
   I am also proud that one of my provisions on S. 625, which is supported by  AARP and many other important organizations, ensures that retirement savings will be treated equally in bankruptcy so that schoolteachers and church workers will no longer be at a disadvantage relative to people with retirement savings that happen to fall into other categories. 
   I also made sure that education was protected in this bill. Under my education savings amendment, already accepted as part of S. 625, which I developed with the help of Senators GREGG, DODD, and others, contributions made for educational expenses to education IRAs and qualified State tuition savings programs will be protected in bankruptcy. I believe protecting these savings accounts is important because college savings accounts encourage families to save for college and increase access to higher education. My amendment ensures that the ability to use dedicated funds to pay the educational costs of children and grandchildren will not be jeopardized by the bankruptcy of a parent or a grandparent. At the same time, I have included conditions on the protection of these accounts to prevent fraud 
   and abuse. 
   In effect, this bill tightens up the bankruptcy laws to ferret out abuses on all sides, from the unscrupulous debtor to the overreaching creditor to the dishonest lawyer. At the same time, it works to stop the cycle of indebtedness through education. It makes sure that children, our retirement savings, and access to education are all protected. 
   It is wrong for this country to have a system that makes honest, hard-working, bill-paying citizens foot the bill for those who have the ability to pay but who choose not to. A recent study shows that 76 percent of all Americans believe individuals should not be allowed to erase all of their debts in bankruptcy if they are able to repay a portion of what they owe. I am pleased to say that that is precisely what S. 625 would accomplish. This study is heartening to me because it indicates that this country hasn't lost sight of the principle that individuals should take responsibility for their own actions. 
   We are enjoying a wonderful period of economic prosperity. To the people who, despite their high levels of income, choose a bankruptcy of convenience, I say the game is over. No longer will the hard-working people of my State of Utah and in the rest of the country foot the bill for the people who are abusers of the system. The American people deserve better. With passage of the bankruptcy reform bill, the bankruptcy system will again return to the last resort for those who truly need it. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to urge colleagues to come down here sooner rather than later to debate amendments, or let us know if they don't intend to offer them. It is my and the leader's intention, and I believe the intention of Senators LEAHY and DASCHLE, that we debate these amendments in a timely manner today and vote on final passage next Tuesday. I hope we can get through all these amendments today, and next Tuesday we will have a full day of voting. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend, the Senator from Idaho. This amendment is needed to clarify that if an individual has pledged  his property for money and is not obligated to redeem it, and indeed does not redeem the property within the time he or she agreed to redeem it, then the bankruptcy laws are not abused to attempt to get that property back. 
   What this amendment does is basically recognize and respect the right of individuals and businesses to be able to pledge property for money for an agreed period of time. Essentially, those businesses engaged in this type of transaction, namely pawnbrokers, provide cash loans to people in exchange for a pledge of personal property. The pawnbroker charges interest on the loan, but the customer is under no obligation to redeem the pledged property. When the individual does not redeem the pawned item within the contractual period, the property becomes part of the pawnbroker's inventory for sale. It does not continue to be the property of the individual. 
   Some debtors have attempted to subject their pawn transactions to the operation of the bankruptcy code's automatic stay, after the time under the contract for redeeming the property has expired. Most courts that have considered the matter have held that if the debtor or the trustee does not redeem the property within a typical period of 60 days from the date of filing for bankruptcy, then full title to the property vests with the pawnbroker. This is the sensible result, because the debtor has no obligation to redeem the property. 
   This is a sensible clarification amendment, without which, certain individuals could abuse the system to the detriment of other consumers who use and need the pawnbroker's services. Let's close this loophole and support this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont. He is a dear friend and the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. We work well together. His comments are very deeply felt by me. When both he and Senator KENNEDY offered to come to Iowa and New Hampshire to speak against me, I think I made a big mistake by not asking them to do it. I think I would have done much better. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator WELLSTONE call up his two amendments today and that we reserve 1 hour between 9:30 and 10:30 next Tuesday morning for the debate on both of those amendments, including up until 12:30 today.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Montana for his eloquent remarks on methamphetamine and the destruction it is wreaking not only on Western States such as Montana and Utah but throughout the country. We passed a methamphetamine bill out of the Senate. We have to get it through the House. I ask my dear friend from Montana to help us work with House Members to get that through. If we get that through, it will immediately start taking effect. 
   What these kids don't realize, and their parents, is once they are hooked on meth, it is almost impossible to get them off. I had a situation where a very strong friend of mine had a son, a good kid, but he was picked up and put in jail once for meth. He promised to be OK. He had quite a bit of time to get OK, came outside, he had perfect intentions, wanted to be everything he possibly could be. Then, all of a sudden, he started making meth in his apartment, got picked up again. The father called me and said: I know he has to go to jail. I hope you can get the help for him. 
   I called the top people and they said they will try and get him into a Federal rehabilitation center, but it would take at least 3 years just to get him to be able to handle it, not ever get rid of the desire, but just to handle it. 
   So you parents out there, if you don't realize how important what Senator BAUCUS has been talking about is, then you better start thinking. If your kids get hooked on meth, it is going to be a long, hard road to get them off. Their lives may be gone. 
   We have to pass that bill. I appreciate the distinguished Senator's remarks for the most part. I thank him for being here. I hope we will all work together to get that bill through Congress so we can solve this terrible scourge.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes at the beginning of the second session of the 106th Congress to comment on several legislative initiatives I authored in the first session, and which I am pleased to say either passed or were substantially incorporated into other bills that were approved and signed into law by the President last year. 
   One of the most important issues for my state of Utah is the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) Amendments of 1999, S. 1515, which I introduced last year. I am delighted that the Senate passed this important legislation in November. 
   This bill will guarantee that our government provides fair compensation to the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the mining of uranium and from fallout during the testing of nuclear weapons in the early post-war years. 
   Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL; the distinguished Senate Minority Leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE; Senator JEFF BINGAMAN; and Senator PETER DOMENICI all joined me in introducing this legislation. 
   In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) was enacted in law. RECA, which I was proud to sponsor, required the federal government to compensate those who were harmed by the radioactive fallout from atomic testing. Administered through the Department of Justice, RECA has been responsible for compensating approximately 6,000 individuals for their injuries. Since the passage of the 1990 law, I have been continuously monitoring the implementation of the RECA program. 
   Quite candidly, I have been disturbed over numerous reports from my Utah constituents about the difficulty they have encountered when they have attempted to file claims with the Department of Justice. I introduced S. 1515 in response to their concerns. 
   This bill honors our nation's commitment to the thousands of individuals who were victims of radiation exposure while supporting our country's national defense. I believe we have an obligation to care for those who were injured, especially since, at the time, they were not adequately warned about the potential health hazards involved with their work. 
   Another issue which many of my constituents contacted me about over the past year was the Medicare provisions contained in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and the impact of these provisions on health care providers and Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I am extremely pleased that the House and Senate approved the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Adjustment Act of 1999 and that President Clinton signed the measure into law. 
   This important bill will help to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can continue to receive high-quality, accessible health care. 
   Overall, the bill increases payments for nursing homes, hospitals, home health agencies, managed care plans, and other Medicare providers. It will also increase payments for rehabilitative therapy services, and longer coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. 
   Over $17 billion in legislative restorations are contained in this package for the next 10 years. 
   Clearly we now know that there were unintended consequences as a result of the reimbursement provisions contained in the BBA. Many of the changes provided for in the BBA resulted in far more severe reductions in spending that we projected in 1997. 
   As a result, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and hospitals have been particularly hard hit from these changes in the Medicare law. 
   In 1997, Medicare was in a serious financial condition and was projected to go bankrupt in the year 2001. The changes we made in 1997 saved Medicare from financial insolvency and have resulted in extending the program's solvency until 2015. 
   Nevertheless, the reductions we enacted in 1997 created a serious situation for many health care providers who simply are not being adequately reimbursed for the level and quality of care they were providing. 
   This situation is particularly evident in the nursing home industry. 
   Many skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, are now facing bankruptcy because the current prospective payment system, which was enacted as part of the BBA, does not adequately compensate for the costs of care to medically complex patients. 
   As a result, I introduced the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999, S. 1500, which was designed to provide immediate financial relief to nursing homes who care for medically complex patients. 
   The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, was the principal cosponsor of this important legislation. And I would like to take this opportunity now to thank him for the extraordinary effort he made in helping to have major provisions of our bill incorporated into the final conference agreement on the BBA refinement bill. 
   Moreover, I want to thank the other 44 Senators who cosponsored S. 1500 and who lent their support in helping to move this issue to conference. 
   This is an important victory for Medicare beneficiaries who depend on nursing home care. 
   As we have seen over the past several years, those beneficiaries with medically complex conditions were having difficulty in gaining access to nursing home facilities, or SNFs, because many SNFs simply did not want to accept these patients due to the low reimbursement levels paid by Medicare. 
   The current prospective payment system is flawed. It does not accurately account for the costs of these patients with complex conditions. 
   The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has acknowledged that the system needs to be corrected. 
   Under the provisions of the BBA Restoration bill we are passing today, reimbursement rates are increased by 20% for 15 payment categories, or the Resource Utilization Groups--RUGs--beginning in April 2000. These increases are temporary until HCFA has fine-tuned the PPS and made adjustments to reflect a more accurate cost for these payment categories. 
   Moreover, after the temporary increases have expired, all payment categories will be increased by 4% in fiscal year 2001 and 2002. 
   These provisions will provide immediate increases of $1.4 billion to nursing home facilities to care for these high-cost patients. 
   In addition, the bill also gives nursing homes the option to elect to be paid at the full federal rate for SNF PPS which will provide an additional $700 million to the nursing community. 
   I would also add that I am pleased the conference report includes a provision to provide a two-year moratorium on the physical/speech therapy and occupational therapy caps that were enacted as part of the BBA. 
   As we all well know, these arbitrary caps have resulted in considerable pain and difficulty for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who have met and exceeded the therapy caps. 
   I joined my colleague and good friend, Senator GRASSLEY, as a cosponsor of this important legislation and I want to commend him for his leadership in getting this bill incorporated into the final BBA refinement conference report. 
   There are many other important features of this bill that are included in the conference report agreement and, clearly, these provisions will do a great deal to help restore needed Medicare funding to providers. 
   The bottomline is all of this is ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to quality health care. We need to keep that promise and I believe we have done that through the passage of this legislation. 
   Overall, $2.7 billion is restored to SNFs under this legislation. 
   With respect to other providers, I would briefly add that the bill contains funding for home health agencies as well. The bill will ease the administrative requirements on home health agencies as well as delay the 15 percent reduction in reimbursement rate for one year. This reduction was to have taken effect on October 2000 but will now be delayed for one year until October 1, 2001.  
   I have worked very closely with my home health agencies in my state who were extremely concerned over the impact of the 15% reduction next year. I am pleased to tell them that we have addressed their concerns by delaying this reduction for another year. I think this time will give us an opportunity to focus on this provision to determine what other adjustments, if any, may be required in the future. 
   Overall, the bill adds $1.3 billion back into the home health care component of Medicare. 
   So I believe we have taken some significant steps to ensure that home health care agencies will be able to operate without the threat of increased Medicare reductions on their bottomline. 
   We have also taken steps to help hospitals and teaching hospitals with over $7 billion in Medicare restorations. These increases will help to smooth the transition to the PPS for outpatient services--an issue that was brought to my attention by practically every hospital administrator in my state. 
   On the separate, but equally important issue of children's graduate medical education funding, I am especially pleased that the House passed legislation that will authorize, for the first time, a new program to provide children's hospitals with direct and indirect graduate medical education funding. 
   Indepednet children's hospitals, including Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, receive very little Medicare graduate medical education funding (GME). This is because they treat very few Medicare patients, only children with end stage renal disease, and thus do not 
    benefit from federal GME support through Medicare. 
   I cosponsored legislation to provide greater GME funding for children's hospitals. The bill passed the Senate and House, and was signed into law by the President. 
   Moreover, $40 million is contained in the omnibus FY 2000 appropriation's bill that will serve as an excellent foundation on which to provide assistance to children's hospitals. 
   I am also pleased that provisions from S..1626, the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act, were included in the BBA refinement bill. 
   These important provisions guarantee senior citizens access to the best medical technology and pharmaceuticals. Currently, Medicare beneficiaries do not always have access to the most innovative treatments because Medicare reimbursement rates are inadequate. And I just don't think that it's fair to older Americans. My provisions contained in the conference report change this by allowing more reasonable Medicare reimbursements for these therapies. 
   Take John Rapp, my constituent from Salt Lake City. 
   Mr. Rapp, who is 71 years old, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last May. He was presented with a series of treatment options and decided to have BRACHY therapy because it was minimally invasive, he could receive it as an outpatient and it had fewer complications than radical surgery. 
   This new innovative therapy implants radioactive seeds in the prostate gland in order to kill cancer cells. The success rate of this therapy has been overwhelming. 
   So, what's the problem? Without my legislation, services such as BRACHY therapy would not be available in the hospital outpatient setting to future Medicare patients due to the way the outpatient prospective payment system is being designed. 
   Life saving services such as BRACHY therapy would be reimbursed at significantly lower-reimbursement rates, from approximately $10,000 to $1,500, and, therefore, it would not be cost-effective for hospitals to offer this service. Fortunately, the provisions included in the conference report change all of that--innovative treatments, such as BRACHY therapy, will now be available to future prostate cancer patients. 
   We must get the newest technology, to seniors as quickly as possible. Government bureaucracy should not stand in the way of seniors receiving the best care available. 
   We must put Medicare patients first, not government bureaucracy. That is why my legislation is necessary and I am so pleased that it was included in the Medicare package of the conference report. 
   Mr. President, there are numerous other provisions in this BBA refinement package that I will not take the time to comment on now, but they are equally important and I want to commend the leadership in the Senate and House for working to put together this important measure that will clearly help millions of Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Today, the Senate adopted a significant measure against date rape and other heinous crimes associated with abusing certain types of drugs. I want to make a few comments on this bill, S. 1561, which addresses the abuse of the dangerous drug GHB which has been used to commit date rape and other crimes. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am proud that it was a member of our Committee, Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM, who introduced and has played the key leadership role in Senate passage of S. 1561, The Samantha Reid and Hillory J. Farias Date Rape Prohibition Act of 1999.'' I am also proud that other members of the Judiciary Committee, Senators DEWINE, FEINSTEIN, and GRASSLEY have joined Senator ABRAHAM in co-sponsoring this legislation. 
   It is only through the hard work and insistence of Senator ABRAHAM that this bill will pass the Senate today. I also want to commend his able staff, especially Lee Otis and Chase Hutto, who have spent considerable time and effort in improving this legislation. Their efforts were in the best tradition of staff of the United States Senate. 
   I also want to thank my friend on the other side of the aisle, Senator BIDEN, who has long been in the forefront of controlled substances and other drug abuse issues. I must also recognize the efforts of Ms. Marcia Lee of his staff for her diligence and creativity in developing this language. 
   I must also recognize the efforts of Chairmen THOMAS BLILEY and FRED UPTON for their work in developing and sheparding the House companion to S. 1561, H.R. 2310, through that body. In this regard, I must mention the efforts of John Manthei of the House Commerce Committee as well as Ms. Jane Williams of Rep. UPTON's staff. Both of them deserve recognition for their dedication to passing this bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the measure before us contains some technical amendments to various provisions of the Copyright Act, including sections  111 and 119, which deal with the cable and satellite compulsory licenses, respectively. It is important to emphasize that these technical amendments make no change whatsoever in the key definitional provisions of these two compulsory licenses. Section 111(f) defines ``cable systems,'' and section 119(d)(6) defines ``satellite carrier.'' Neither of these definitions is changed by the measure before us.

   Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct. In other words, if a facility qualified as a ``cable system'' under section 111(f) prior the enactment of this measure, it should also qualify after enactment. Conversely, if a facility did not meet the definition of ``cable system'' before this measure was enacted, it still would not meet that definition after enactment, and therefore the operations of that facility could not rely upon the cable compulsory license established by section 111. And an entity which was not entitled to claim the section 119 compulsory license because it did not meet the definition of a ``satellite carrier'' prior to enactment of the measure before us would be in exactly the same position after enactment, that is, it could not claim the satellite compulsory license under section 119.

In reply to that question, I would say that certainly under current law, Internet and similar digital online communications services are not, and have never been, eligible to claim the cable or satellite compulsory licenses created by sections 111 or 119 of the Copyright Act. To my knowledge, no court, administrative agency, or authoritative commentator has ever held or even intimated to the contrary.

   Mr. HATCH. The Copyright Office studied this issue exhaustively in 1997 and came to the same conclusion which I have just stated. In fact, in undertaking the study, the Copyright Office asked the fundamental question whether a statutory license should be created for the Internet. The underlying assumption of the question was that there was not, and never was, a statutory license applicable to the Internet. In response, there was little or no comment challenging that assumption. And I would point out that valid exercises of the Office's statutory authority to interpret the provisions of these compulsory licensing schemes are binding on the courts.

And along the same lines, I have received a letter on this issue from one of America's most distinguished copyright scholars, Professor Arthur Miller of Harvard Law School. Professor Miller's interpretation of the scope of eligibility for these compulsory licenses under current law appears to be very similar to the Register's, and his letter also underscores the point I was making earlier, that there is no legal significance to the fact that this legislation omits certain technical amendments to the definition of ``cable system'' and ``satellite carrier'' that appeared in earlier versions of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator from Vermont. And I would clarify one other point relating to a minor modification we made to the definition of ``unserved household'' in the distant signal satellite statutory license found in section 119 of Title 17 of the United States Code. The conferees decided to add the word ``stationary'' to the phrase ``conventional outdoor rooftop receiving antenna'' in Section 119(d)(10) of the Copyright Act. As the Chairman of the Conference Committee and of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over copyright matters, I should make clear that this change should not require any alteration in the methods used by the courts to enforce the ``unserved household'' limitation of Section 119. The new language states only that the antenna is to be ``stationary''; it does not state that the antenna is to be misoriented (i.e., pointed away from the station in question). Any interpretation that assumed misorientation would be inconsistent with the basic premise of the definition of ``unserved household,'' which defines that term in relation to an individual TV station rather than to all network affiliates in a market--and speaks to whether a household ``cannot'' receive a Grade B intensity signal from a particular station. If a household can receive a signal of Grade B intensity with a properly oriented stationary conventional antenna, it is not ``unserved'' within the meaning of Section 119. In addition, if station towers are located in different directions, conventional over-the-air antennas can be designed so as to point towards the different towers without requiring the antenna to be moved. And reading the definition of ``unserved household'' to assume misoriented antennas would mean that the ``unserved household'' limitation had no fixed meaning, since there are countless different ways in which an antenna can be misoriented, but only one way to be correctly oriented, as the Commission's rules make clear. 
   With that clarification, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Appropriations conference report before us contains most of the text of the Conference Report accompanying H.R. 1554, a reform of the Satellite Home Viewers Act. In addition to Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act, this legislation contains two other major intellectual property bills, a major reform of the patent system and a bill to protect against the growing problem of ``cybersquatting,'' whereby the valuable names of businesses and individuals are registered by others in bad faith to either trade on those names or damage their value. These three pieces of legislation are major reforms that help American consumers and American businesses. I will briefly discuss these reforms in turn. 
   As the Chairman of the Conference Committee and sponsor of the original Senate copyright legislation underlying the Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act, I am delighted that the conferees have been able to put together a comprehensive package of consumer-friendly reforms for satellite viewers. The bill reflects an enormous effort on the part of members and their staffs on both sides of Congress from both parties, and represents a major advance in copyright and communications law. 
   The world of video communication has changed enormously since television began some 70 years ago in the small home workshop of inventor and Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth, who, together with his wife and colleagues, viewed the first television transmission: a single black line that rotated from vertical to horizontal. At the risk of offending those who may disagree, I think TV programming has greatly improved since the Farnsworths' rotating black line. Since that day in the Farnsworths' workshop, television viewers have benefitted from steady advances in technology that have brought increased access to an ever more diversified range  of programming choices. The television industry has progressed from one or two over-the-air broadcast stations, to a full range of broadcast networks delivering local and syndicated national programming, to cable television delivering both broadcast and made-for-cable programming. And in the past decade, satellite carriers, delivering to customers with both large and, increasingly, small dishes are emerging as new and potent competitors in the television delivery business. 
   The legislation before us today will--for the first time --allow satellite carriers to provide local subscribers with their local television signals. This means every television viewer in Utah can have access to Utah news, weather, sports, and other locally-relevant programming, as well as national network programming. Emerging technology now makes this possible, and our bill will make it legal. The bill also reduces the copyright fees that are passed along to subscribers. As a result, eligible viewers in parts of Utah unserved by over-the-air television will enjoy access to network stations at lower prices. 
   Let me illustrate some of the benefits of this legislation for Utah and for Utahns. Similar benefits can accrue across the country if this legislation is fully utilized. Many areas of Utah are unserved by over-the-air television or even by cable systems. Satellite service has been the only television option for many Utahns. Up until the passage of this conference report, these Utahns were able to get network stations, but usually from cities outside of Utah, such as New York or Los Angeles. And, those Utahns who had satellite dishes but lived in areas which did receive local television over-the-air could not legally get any network television programming using their satellite dishes, but had to get them with an off-air antenna or by cable. Under the provisions of this conference report, every Utahn will be able to get local network programming, which includes both national network shows like ``ER'' and ``The X-Files'' and local news, weather, sports, and public affairs programming. And those people who live in the so-called ``white areas'' that are unserved by local television can get local programming from Salt Lake City, as well as keep their distant signals if they wish to. Making Utah information and entertainment available to all Utahns is a great benefit to us as a state, and helps bind us together as a community. And in 2002, the satellite carriers will be required to carry all the local television stations, just like cable. This means that viewers will have the same range of local programming as they have come to expect from cable, and that the viewers, rather than satellite carriers, will be able to choose which local stations to watch. 
   Making local television signals available to all Utahns, and citizens of similar communities across the country, is the most important reason for this legislation. But there are many other benefits to consumers: copyright rates for satellite signals are cut almost in half, and the local signals are free. The Federal Communications Commission will work to ensure that eligibility decisions for distant network signals are clearer and prompter. Some satellite subscribers have expressed frustration that they do not get prompt responses from local television stations to distant signal eligibility waiver requests, although the situation is better in Utah than in some other places. To remedy the problem, we included a provision that says if a subscriber asks a local station for a waiver to allow them to get distant network signals, this conference report requires a response in 30 days or the waiver is deemed approved. There was a provision in the previous law that required cable subscribers to wait 90 days after unhooking their cable before they could get satellite service. We removed that waiting period so that Utahns who want to switch from cable can do so immediately. 
   We heard from the owners of recreational vehicles that they wanted to be able to put satellite dishes on their RV's when they go camping or traveling. In this bill, we allow RV owners who comply with certain documentation requirements to get satellite service. So Utahns do not need to leave their satellite service behind when they travel. The same rules would apply to long-haul truckers. 
   Recent lawsuits enforcing the distant signal eligibility rules under the copyright act have put many satellite subscribers in danger of losing their distant network signal service. Let me be clear that I do not condone or support what appears to have been law-breaking by the satellite carriers. But I am concerned about subscribers being caught in the middle, especially those who are not clearly served by over-the-air television from their local broadcasters. So, in this legislation, we protect the eligibility for satellite service received by current subscribers have who do not get a city-grade or Grade A signal. In this way, we can protect those subscribers who 
   may have been misled about their eligibility and who may be in an area that is not clearly served, so that they will not be out their investment. With regard to the signal intensity rules that make up the eligibility standard for distant signals, we have asked the FCC to give us their best judgment about how we should reform the law, so that we can have their best input before we consider any further major reforms on this issue. 
   I have talked about the benefits that will accrue to satellite subscribers if the satellite carriers take full advantage of these copyright license reforms. But the benefits are not just limited to satellite subscribers. There will be benefits to cable subscribers, too, that will come from a satellite industry equipped to compete with cable head on in the market. Satellite service consistently ranks high on consumer surveys for service satisfaction. It has a vast array of channels for viewers to choose from. As I mentioned earlier, the growth of the satellite television business has been phenomenal, even without the ability to deliver local television stations. Recent consumer surveys indicate that 85 percent of respondents said that the lack of local signals is the reason why consumers who considered buying satellite service decided not to. Imagine the growth in this industry now that they will be able to compete with cable with the offering of local programming. What does this all mean for cable subscribers? One of the reasons why many believe cable is rated low on customer satisfaction is that it usually does not have a real competitor. Many local cable systems know its customers have nowhere else to go, so they do not exert themselves as much to please the customer as they might with a competitor. Armed with local signals, as well as the rest of the benefits satellite offers, there should be a new spark of competition in those areas where local satellite service is available. That will lead to lower prices, increased choices, and happy customers for both satellite and cable, and all television viewers. 
   Today we are also considering a patent reform package which contains the most significant reforms to our nation's patent code in half a century. This bill, which Senator LEAHY and I introduced as the ``American Inventors Protection Act,'' is one of the most important high-tech reform measures to come before this body. It is widely supported by an overwhelming majority of members on both sides of the aisle, by the Administration, and by a broad coalition of industry, small businesses, and American inventors. Its consideration here today is imminently appropriate on the eve of a new millennium in which America's ability to compete and the strength of our economy will depend on the strength of the patent system and the protections it affords. 
   Intellectual property, and patents in particular, are among our nation's greatest assets. From semiconductor chip technology, to computer software, to biotechnology, to Internet and telecommunications technology, the United States remains the undisputed world-leader in technological innovation. In fact, according to Newsweek Magazine, the United States is home to seven of the world's top ten technology centers, which includes my own state of Utah. Moreover, American creative industries now surpass all other export sectors in foreign sales and exports. As the Internet, electronic commerce, and new innovative technologies increasingly drive the growth of our economy, the strength of our patent system and its ability to respond to the challenges of new technology and global competition will be more important than ever. This bill will enable our patent system to meet these challenges and to protect American inventors and American competitiveness into the next century.  
   As many of my colleagues know, this bill is a compromise bill that reflects years of discussion and extensive efforts to reach agreement on all sides. Since first introducing this bill as an omnibus measure in the 104th Congress, we have literally engaged in countless hours of discussions and adopted over 100 amendments to this bill in order to forge a consensus on a package of responsible patent reforms. The Senate made significant progress toward consensus in the last Congress when the Judiciary Committee reached several key compromises to strengthen the bill's protections for small businesses and independent inventors. I was pleased to see those efforts continued in the House this year, where the supporters and former opponents of the bill agreed to sit down and work through their differences in an effort to produce a constructive patent reform bill. As a result of these cooperative efforts in the House and Senate, the bill before us now enjoys overwhelming bipartisan, bicameral support, and it is now endorsed by the most vocal opponents of earlier reform measures. 
   This broad support is reflected in the several votes that have already occurred on this measure this year. The House has passed this bill three times this year, including by a 376-43 vote on the bill as stand alone measure in August and by a 411-8 vote on the bill as part of the conference report on the ``Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act.'' The Senate Judiciary Committee also passed the bill by an 18-0 roll call vote earlier this month. 
   Having touched upon some of the compromises that have brought people together on this bill, let me take just a minute to highlight what this bill will do for American inventors. 
   1. The bill protects against fraudulent invention promoters which prey upon novice inventors. 
   2. It reduces patent fees for only the second time in history, saving American inventors an estimated $30 million each year. The bill will also ensure that patent fees are not used to subsidize trademark operations and will require the PTO to study alternative fee structures to encourage maximum participation by small inventors. 
   3. It protects American companies and their workers from patent infringement suits as a result of recent policy changes that have allowed patents to begin to issue on internal business methods that were previously thought to be unpatentable and which have been used under trade secret protection. 
   4. It guarantees that every diligent inventor with a patentable invention will receive at least 17 years of patent protection (which is what they would have received pre-GATT); most will receive a great deal more. 
   5. It allows American inventors and innovators to see foreign technology at least 12 months earlier than today, while allowing American inventors to maintain protections of existing law that allow them to keep their inventions secret during patent pendency. It also gives 
   American inventors new protections by given them provisional rights during the pendency of internationally published applications. 
   6. It creates a new optional administrative procedure in the Patent and Trademark Office to reduce litigation costs for patent owners and to allow members of the public to participate in testing the validity of patents, all while fully protecting patent holders against repetitive challenges. 
   7. It restructures the Patent and Trademark Office to eliminate red tape and provide greater oversight by the American inventing community, especially by small businesses and independent inventors. 
   8. It protects our national security by requiring the PTO to maintain a program with the Office of Personnel Management to identify national security positions at the PTO and by protecting strategic information from disclosure. 
   9. Finally, it restricts the ability of the PTO Commissioner to exchange U.S. patent data with certain foreign nations. 
   In short, this is one of the most important technology-related bills to come before Congress in recent memory. It has been years in the making and reflects the input of many, many people from all sides. The time to act on this package of reforms has clearly come, and I am pleased that the Senate is finally taking this measure up. 
   I am also pleased that the Senate will complete action on the ``Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act'' and send that legislation to the President. In short, this is another key high-tech bill that will curb the harmful practice of ``cybersquatting''--a term used to refer to the deliberate and bad-faith registration of Internet domain names in violation of the rights of trademark owners. Cybersquatting is a very serious threat to consumers and the future growth of electronic commerce. For example, we heard testimony in the Judiciary Committee of consumer fraud being perpetrated by the registrant of the ``attphonecard.com'' and ``attcallingcard.com'' domain names, who set up Internet sites purporting to sell calling cards and soliciting personally identifying information, including credit card numbers. Sammy Sosa had his name cybersquatted and used for a website that implied his endorsement of the products being sold. There are countless other similar examples of so-called ``dot-con'' artists who prey on consumer confusion and trade on the goodwill of others. 
   The fact is that if consumers cannot rely on brand-names online as they do in the world of bricks and mortar store-fronts, few will be willing to engage in e-commerce. Those who do will bear substantial risks of being confused or even deceived. Few Internet users would buy a car, fill a prescription, or even shop for books online if you they cannot be sure who they are dealing with. 
   This legislation will go a long way to ensure this sort of online brand-name protection for consumers. At the same time, the bill carefully balances these interests of consumers and trademark owners with the interests of Internet users and others who would make fair or otherwise lawful uses of trademarked names in cyberspace. 
   As with trademark cybersquatting, cybersquatting of personal names poses similar threats to consumers and e-commerce in that it causes confusion as to the source or sponsorship of goods or services, including confusion as to the sponsorship or affiliation of websites bearing individuals' names. In addition, more and more people are being harmed by people who register other peoples names and hold them out for sale for huge sums or money or use them for various nefarious purposes. I am particularly troubled at the prospect of what someone might do with websites bearing the name of such people as Mother Teresa, which I understand are currently being offered for $7 million by a cybersquatter. 
   For this reason, I was pleased that the House amendments to the Senate bill clarified that famous names that enjoy service mark status, such as celebrity actors and very likely Mother Teresa, are included. As I have said, however, this bill should not be just about protecting celebrities. I am thus pleased that the legislation in this conference report goes further to protect those whose names don't meet the relatively high threshold of a famous mark, but who are nonetheless targeted by cybersquatters. For example, ESPN has reported that a number of cybersquatters have targeted the names of high-school athletes in anticipation that they may some day become famous. Earlier versions of the House and Senate bills would not have protected these individuals, but this legislation will. Furthermore, this bill directs the Commerce Department to report to Congress on ways to better protect personal names against cybersquatting and to work in conjunction with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to include personal name disputes in the ICANN dispute resolution policy. 
   This a key measure to promote electronic commerce and to protect consumers and individuals online. While I recognize the global nature of the cybersquatting problem, I believe this legislation is an important start to a worldwide solution--as evidenced by the fact that the latest ICANN dispute resolution policy reflects a number of the policies embodied in the Senate bill. I appreciate Senator ABRAHAM's effort to move this bill through Congress, and I am pleased we will pass it today. 
   These are important intellectual property reforms that are helpful to American consumers and American  businesses. They are the product of the hard work of many people. Mr. President, I would like to thank many people who have worked hard to get this conference report agreed to and passed. First, let me thank and personally congratulate each of my colleagues on the Conference Committee for their diligent work in achieving this goal, especially my distinguished Ranking Member and original co-sponsor Senator LEAHY, as well as Chairman MCCAIN, and Senators THURMOND, STEVENS, DEWINE, HOLLINGS, and KOHL, all of whom made important contributions. On the House side, I extend my gratitude and congratulations to Chairman HYDE 
   and Chairman BLILEY and to Representatives Coble, Tauzin, Goodlatte, Oxley, Dingell, Conyers, Markey, Berman, and Boucher. Of course, this successful result is also the product of tireless efforts by our capable staffs, who have worked through many late nights and weekends, to make this successful resolution possible. Among the many Senate staff members who have made critical contributions are Manus Cooney, Shawn Bentley, and Troy Dow of my staff; Bruce Cohen, Ed Barron, Beryl Howell of Senator LEAHY's staff; and from the other Senate conferees, Mitch Rose, Pete Belvin, Maureen McLaughlin, Paula Ford, Al Mottur, Gary Malphrus, Jim Hippe, Pete Levitas, Jon Leibowitz, John Schwantes, and many others on the Senate side. Let me congratulate each of them on their work. Tony Coe of Senate Legislative Counsel and Bill Roberts of the Copyright Office both put in many long hours to provide technical assistance. I know I speak for all of the Senate conferees in expressing my gratitude to all these first-rate staff members, as well as to the fine staff on the House side. The leadership staff from both houses, particularly Jim Sartucci and Renee Bennett from Senator LOTT's staff and Doug Farry from Representative ARMEY's office were key liaisons in this process. 
   On patent reform, let me note my very sincere appreciation to the Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, with whom I have worked for the better part of three Congresses to bring about these important reforms. His leadership on the Democratic side has been a key part to getting this bill done. I want to also recognize the extraordinary efforts of our House colleagues on this bill. Chairman COBLE, who is the bill's primary sponsor in the House, along with the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Congressman BERMAN, as well as Chairman HYDE and Ranking Member CONYERS, have all dedicated tremendous time and effort over the last four years to moving this legislation forward. Their able leadership is reflected in the support this bill received in the House. But I want to mention in particular Congressman ROHRABACHER and Congressman CAMPBELL who in years past had led the opposition in the House to this bill. It is because of their efforts to work cooperatively with the proponents of this legislation in the House to craft a package of truly responsible reforms on behalf of American inventors that we have a bill before us today. I want to recognize them for their leadership, and for their good faith both in the House and in the Senate this year. 
   Finally, with respect to cybersquatting legislation, I want to again commend the Senator from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, for his sponsorship of this legislation, as well as the Ranking Member, Senator LEAHY, with whom I have again worked hand in hand to bring this bill to final passage. 
   All of these people and others were instrumental in the success of this legislation, but let me express an especially warm thanks to Senator LEAHY, with whom I have worked closely on these and so many other intellectual property matters, and to the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS. We worked particularly closely in the satellite reform conference, and he played a unique and crucial role in the ultimate passage of this package of important intellectual property legislation. I thank him for his leadership and his steadfast support. And let me single out the efforts of Mitch Rose of Senator STEVENS' staff who worked along with my staff and Steve Cortese of Senator STEVENS' Appropriations Committee staff, under Senator STEVENS' leadership, to ensure that these important intellectual property matters were ultimately enacted into law despite the difficulties encountered in the process. They are superb public servants and they work for one of the finest members of this August body with whom I have had the pleasure of working. Finally, let me mention Bruce Cohen, Ed Barron, and Beryl Howell of Senator LEAHY's staff, who, along with Senator LEAHY, work with me and my staff with exceptional cooperation on intellectual property matters. We have had a particularly productive relationship on these important matters, and I look forward to continuing that relationship. On my own staff, I express my appreciation for the work of Shawn Bentley and Troy Dow, who have labored long and hard to successfully enact this legislation, and I thank their families for their support of their efforts on behalf of American innovators, creators, and consumers. Finally, let me thank my Chief Counsel, Manus Cooney, for overseeing all of this fine work, and putting in countless hours of strenuous effort to ensure its completion. He is a consummate leader, and I thank him for his stellar service.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as the Senate finishes its consideration of the last in a package of four very important intellectual property related ``high-tech'' bills that Senate LEAHY and I introduced earlier this year. Three of those bills--the ``Trademark Amendments Act of 1999,'' the ``Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act of 1999,'' and a Copyright Act technical corrections bill--were passed by the House and Senate and signed into law in August of this year. The fourth of those bills--the ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act'' (S. 1257)--was passed by the House with an amendment and returned to the Senate. Each of these bills is designed to promote the continued growth of vital sectors of the American economy and to protect the interests and investment of the entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators who fuel their growth. 
   Technology continues to be the driving force in the American economy today, and American technology is setting new standards for the global economy, from semiconductor chip technology, to computer software, Internet  and telecommunications technology, to leading pharmaceutical and genetic research. In my own state of Utah, these information technology industries contribute in excess of $7 billion each year to the State's economy and pay wages that average 66 percent higher than the state average. Their performance has placed Utah among the world's top ten technology centers according to Newsweek Magazine. Similar success is seen in areas across the country, with the U.S. being home to seven of the world's top ten technology centers and with American creative industries now surpassing all other export sectors in foreign sales and exports. 
   Underlying all of these technologies are the intellectual property rights that serve to promote creativity and innovation by safeguarding the investment, effort, and goodwill of those who venture into these fast-paced and volatile fields. Strong intellectual property protections are particularly critical in the global high-tech environment where electronic piracy is so easy, so cheap, and yet so potentially devastating to intellectual property owners--many of which are small entrepreneurial enterprises. In Utah, 65 percent of these companies have fewer than 25 employees, and a majority have annual revenues of less than $1 million. Intellectual property is the lifeblood of these companies, and even a single instance of piracy could drive them out of business. What's more, without adequate international protection, these companies would simply be unable to compete in the global marketplace. 
   That is why we enacted a number of measures last year to provide enhanced protection for intellectual property in the new global, high-tech environment. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) implemented two new World Intellectual property Organization Treaties setting new global standards for copyright protection in the digital 
   environment. We also paved the way for new growth in online commerce by providing a copyright framework in which the Internet and other new technologies can flourish. 
   The ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act'' builds upon those protections by raising the Copyright Act's limit on statutory damages to make it more costly to engage in cyber-piracy and copyright theft. Section 504(c) of the Copyright Act provides for the award of statutory damages at the plaintiff's election in order to provide greater security for owners, who often find it difficult to prove actual damages in infringement cases--particularly in the electronic environment--and to provide greater deterrence for would-be infringers. The current provision caps statutory damages at $20,000 ($100,000 in cases of willful infringement), which reflects figures set in statute in 1988 when the United States joined the Berne Convention. The combination of more than a decade of inflation and revolutionary changes in technology have rendered those figures largely inadequate to achieve their aims. The bill before us updates these statutory damage provisions to account for both these factors. 
   Under the bill, the cap on statutory damages is increased by 50 percent, from $20,000 to $30,000, and the minimum is similarly increased from $500 to $750. For cases of willful infringement, the cap is raised to $150,000. This will not mean that a court must impose the full amount of damages in any given case, or even that it will be more likely to do so. In most cases, courts attempt to do justice by fixing the statutory damages at a level that approximates actual damages and defendant's profits. What this bill does is give courts wider discretion to award damages that are commensurate with the harm caused and the gravity of the offense. At the same time, the bill preserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce the award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of innocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in certain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, archives, or public broadcasting entities. 
   The House of Representatives amend the bill to include an amendment to the ``No Electronic Theft (NET) Act.'' The NET Act--enacted to curb digital piracy by expanding criminal copyright infringement to include certain electronic infringements done without an intent to profit--directed the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revise the sentencing guidelines for crimes against intellectual property to ensure that the applicable guideline range is sufficiently stringent to deter such crimes and to provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the infringed upon items with respect to which the crime against intellectual property was committed. This directive, and its specificity, reflected the concern on the part of Congress that the existing guidelines' reliance on the value of the infringing items (i.e., the street value of a bootlegged video) both underestimates the true economic harm inflicted on copyright owners and results in penalties that are so disproportionately low that U.S. attorneys are simply unwilling to prosecute such cases. Despite Congress' directive, the old guidelines remain in place unamended. The result is that today, nearly two years later, there has been only one case brought under the NET Act, and electronic piracy continues as a significant and growing concern. 
   The House amendment to S. 1257 would revise the outstanding NET Act directive to require the Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement based upon the retail price of the legitimate items that are infringed upon and the quantity of the infringing items, as well as to require the Commission to act within a set time. While the proposed revision is consistent with Congress' intent to strengthen the sentencing guidelines applicable to intellectual property-related crimes and to better reflect the economic harm in cases of electronic piracy, there was some concern that the amended guidelines would overstate economic harm or have other unintended consequences with respect to infringements not involving digital reproductions. 
   The amendment Senator LEAHY and I are offering today--which is the result of many hours of discussions and the subject of widespread agreement--will leave the existing NET Act directive unchanged, but will require the Commission to act on that directive within the later of 120 days from the bill's enactment or 120 days from the first date on which there are sufficient voting members of the Sentencing Commission to constitute a quorum. I expect that the Sentencing Commission will move expeditiously once its commissioners are in place to complete revision of the applicable sentencing guidelines as directed by the NET ACT, and that it will do so in a manner that is consistent with Congress' intent to provide improved deterrence in this area. 
   In sum, this bill is an important high-tech measure that will spur creativity and enhance protection for American copyrighted works at home and abroad. I want to thank Senator LEAHY for his assistance, cooperation, and leadership in this process, and I look forward to the Senate swiftly passing this bill with the Hatch-Leahy Amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, enough is enough. Hard-working American people are being denied common-sense legislation that they overwhelmingly support, because some on the Democratic side are insisting on votes relating to the politically charged issues of abortions and guns. At some point, I would hope that this will stop, and we can move ahead with the people's agenda, instead of trying to win political points. 
   We have been on the bankruptcy bill for two weeks now. The Democrats demanded the ability to have votes on other politically motivated, non-relevant issues. We debated and had a vote on minimum wage. We have agreed to or voted on 31 Democrat amendments. These are amendments in addition to the Grassley-Torricelli package amendment which included numerous other provisions insisted upon by the Democrats. 
   This is a fair, bipartisan bill, drafted jointly by Senators GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, BIDEN and SESSIONS. This legislation was developed in a fair and inclusive manner. With the more than 31 amendments, plus additional amendments jointly developed by Republicans and Democrats, such as the Grassley-Torricelli healthcare amendment, the Hatch-Torricelli domestic and child support amendment, the Hatch-Dodd amendment on protecting educational savings accounts, among many others, this is a much improved bill that provides unprecedented consumer protections, while preserving the bankruptcy system for those who truly need it. What also is included in this bill are unprecedented consumer disclosures that are not even bankruptcy related, but are banking law amendments which Senators TORRICELLI and GRASSLEY have taken the leadership to develop, and I commend them for that. 
   Mr. President, throughout the process of consideration of this bill, at both the drafting stage, at the Committee level, and here on the floor, we have worked hard to address any concerns any member has with the bill. Senators GRASSLEY, LOTT and I have been more than patient and cooperative. It is apparent, however, that efforts were underway to defeat this important legislation this year by insisting on extraneous political agenda items, regardless of all the progress we made. 
   We are open to further debate. But this bill, which the Minority had said would only take two days to complete, was on the floor for two weeks. They did not agree to a time limit for debate, but it is now clear why that was. 
   I hope we can get the cooperation of the Minority to drop their remaining politically-motivated items and pass legislation early next year that provides meaningful and much-needed reform to the bankruptcy system. Rampant bankruptcy filings are a big problem, and last year over 1.4 million Americans filed for bankruptcy. In the same year, about $45 billion in consumer debt was erased in personal bankruptcies. Under current law, families who do not file for bankruptcy are unfairly having to subsidize those who do. This is our opportunity to do something about it. I would hope that my colleagues would take the time over these next few months and consider the desires of the American public. Let's do what is right and pass this important legislation early next year. Thank you.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to report on the success that the Senate has enjoyed this session in performing its constitutional advice and consent duties with respect to judicial nominees. The Judiciary Committee and the Senate have maintained a low vacancy rate in the federal Judiciary, reached an agreement to have votes on certain controversial nominees, and maintained a fair and principled confirmations process. 
   At the end of the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee and the Senate had reduced the number of vacancies in the federal Judiciary to 50--the lowest vacancy level since the expansion of the Judiciary in 1990. Indeed, in his January 1999 report on the state of the federal Judiciary, Chief Justice Rehnquist applauded the work of the Senate in bringing the vacancy number to such a low level, stating: ``I am pleased to report on the progress made in 1998 by the Senate and the President in the appointment and confirmation of judges to the federal bench. .....'' 
   This session, despite partisan rhetoric, the Senate has maintained a low vacancy rate. The Judiciary Committee reported 42 judicial nominees, and the full Senate confirmed 34 of these--a number comparable to the average of 39 confirmations for the first sessions of the past 5 Congresses when vacancy rates were generally much higher. In total, the Senate has confirmed 338 of President Clinton's judicial nominees since he took office in 1993. 
   In addition, the Committee reported 22 Executive Branch nominees to the Senate floor this Session. The Senate has confirmed all of these nominees,  bringing the total number of confirmations for President Clinton's non-judicial nominees for which the Committee has jurisdiction to 277 since 1993. 
   After all of these confirmations, we have reduced the number of judicial vacancies to 56--very close to the lowest number of vacancies since the expansion of the Judiciary in 1990. Indeed, the number of vacancies at the end of this Session of Congress is 7 less than the 63 vacancies that existed when Congress adjourned in 1994 when Bill Clinton was President and the Democrats controlled the Judiciary Committee. Moreover, we were able to create 9 new district court judgeships for a few districts in which the caseloads are very high. 
   In addition, the Committee reported two controversial nominees--Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez--to the Senate floor this Session. And Senator LOTT worked in a bipartisan manner with Senator DASCHLE to reach an agreement to vote on these controversial nominees and other nominees by March 15, 2000. 
   A controversial nominee will, of course, move more slowly than other nominees because it takes longer to garner a consensus to support such a nominee. And, depending on the nature of the controversy, the Committee may have to conduct an even more exacting examination of that nominee's credentials and respect for the rule of law. Nonetheless, a controversial nominee will be treated with the utmost respect and fairness The more controversial a nominee, however, the more crucial the support of the nominee's home state senators and home state grass roots organizations. 
   It was deeply disturbing that earlier this year some implied or expressly alleged that the Senate's treatment of certain nominees differed based on their race or gender. Indeed, a so-called independent group claimed that the Senate treated female and minorities nominees less favorably than white male nominees. 
   After a flurry of rhetoric, however, the facts began to surface. First, the so-called independent group--Citizens for Independent Courts--was discovered to have prepared its report with the assistance of the Democratic, but not Republican, Judiciary Committee staff. Second, a close review of the report revealed that for noncontroversial nominees who were confirmed, there was little if any difference between the timing of confirmation for minority nominees and nonminority nominees in 1997 and 1998. Only when the President appointed a controversial female or minority nominee who was not confirmed did a disparity arise. Third, in 1991 and 1992, when George Bush was President, the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed female and minority nominees at a far slower pace than white male nominees. Fourth, this year, over 50% of the nominees that the Judiciary Committee reported to the full Senate have been women and minorities. Finally, even the Democratic former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator JOE BIDEN, stated publicly that the process by which the committee, under my chairmanship, examines and approve judicial nominees ``has not a single thing to do with gender or race.'' 
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I take the constitutional duties of advice and consent and the responsibility for maintaining the institutional dignity of the Senate very seriously. Although the President has occasionally nominated controversial candidates, under my tenure as chairman, not one nominee has suffered a public attack on his, or her, character by this committee. Not one nominee has had his, or her, confidential background information leaked to the public by a member of this committee. And not one nominee has been examined for anything other than his, or her, integrity, competence, temperament, and respect for the rule of law. 
   The Senate has conducted the confirmations process in a fair and principled manner, and the process has worked well. As the first session of the 106th Congress comes to an end, the federal Judiciary is once again sufficiently staffed to perform its function under Article III of the Constitution. Senator LOTT, and the Senate as a whole, are to be commended.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes in these final hours of the First Session of the 106th Congress to comment on several legislative initiatives I authored this year, and which I am pleased to say have either passed or were substantially incorporated into other bills that were approved and will be sent to the President. 
   One of the most important issues for my state of Utah is the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) Amendments of 1999, S. 1515, which I introduced earlier. I am delighted that the Senate passed this important legislation earlier today. 
   This bill will guarantee that our government provides fair compensation to the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the mining of uranium and from fallout during the testing of nuclear weapons in the early post-war years. 
   Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL; the distinguished Senate Minority Leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE; Senator JEFF BINGAMAN; and Senator PETE  DOMENICI all joined me in introducing this legislation, and I appreciate their support. 
   In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) was enacted in law. RECA, which I was proud to sponsor, required the federal government to compensate those who were harmed by the radioactive fallout from atomic testing. Administered through the Department of Justice, RECA has been responsible for compensating approximately 6,000 individuals for their injuries. Since the passage of the 1990 law, I have been continuously monitoring the implementation of the RECA program. 
   Quite candidly, I have been disturbed over numerous reports from my Utah constituents about the difficulty they have encountered when they have attempted to file claims with the Department of Justice. I introduced S. 1515 in response to their concerns. 
   This bill honors our nation's commitment to the thousands of individuals who were victims of radiation exposure while supporting our country's national defense. I believe we have an obligation to care for those who were injured, especially since, at the time, they were not adequately warned about the potential health hazards involved with their work. 
   Another issue which many of my constituents contacted me about over the past year was the Medicare provisions contained in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and the impact of these provisions on health care providers and Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I am pleased that the House has given its approval to the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Adjustment Act of 1999 which is now ready for Senate consideration and passage today. 
   This important measure will help to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can continue to receive high-quality, accessible health care. 
   Overall, the bill increases payments for nursing homes, hospitals, home health agencies, managed care plans, and other Medicare providers. It will also increase payments for rehabilitative therapy services, and longer coverage of immunosuppresive drugs. 
   Over $27 billion in legislative restorations are contained in this package for the next 10 years. 
   Clearly we now know that there were unintended consequences as a result of the reimbursement provisions contained in the BBA. Many of the changes provided for in the BBA resulted in far more severe reductions in spending tham we projected in 1997. As a result, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and hospitals have been particularly hard hit from these changes in the Medicare law. 
   In 1997, Medicare was in a serious financial condition and was projected to go bankrupt in the year 2001. The changes we made in 1997 saved Medicare from financial insolvency and have resulted in extending the program's solvency until 2015. 
   Nevertheless, the reductions we enacted in 1997 created a serious situation for many health care providers who simply are not being adequately reimbursed for the level and quality of care they were providing. 
   This situation is particularly evident in the nursing home industry. Many skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, are now facing bankruptcy because the current prospective payment system, which was enacted as part of the BBA, does not adequately compensate for the costs of care to medically complex patients. 
   As a result, I introduced the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999, S. 1500, which was designed to provide immediate financial relief to nursing homes who care for medically complex patients. 
   The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, was the principal cosponsor of this important legislation. And I would like to take this opportunity now to thank him for the extraordinary effort he made in helping to have major provisions of our bill incorporated into the final conference agreement on the BBA Restorations bill. 
   Moreover, I want to thank the other 44 Senators who cosponsored S. 1500 and who lent their support in helping to move this issue to conference. 
   This is an important victory for Medicare beneficiaries who depend on nursing home care. As we have seen over the past several years, those beneficiaries with medically complex conditions were having difficulty in gaining access to nursing home facilities, or SNFs, because many SNFs simply did not want to accept these patients due to the low reimbursement levels paid by Medicare. 
   The current prospective payment system is flawed. It does not accurately account for the costs of these patients with complex conditions. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has acknowledged that the system needs to be corrected. 
   Under the provisions of the BBA Restoration bill we are passing today, reimbursement rates are increased by 20% for 15 payment categories, or the Resource Utilization Groups--RUGs--beginning in April 2000. These increases are temporary until HCFA has fine-tuned the PPS and made adjustments to reflect a more accurate cost for these payment categories. 
   Moreover, after the temporary increases have expired, all payment categories will be increased by 4% in fiscal year 2001 and 2002. 
   These provisions will provide immediate increases of $1.4 billion to nursing home facilities to care for these high-cost patients. 
   In addition, the bill also gives nursing homes the option to elect to be paid at the full federal rate for SNF PPS which will provide an additional $700 million to the nursing community. 
   I would also add that I am pleased the conference report includes a provision to provide a two-year moratorium on the physical/speech therapy and occupational therapy caps that were enacted as part of the BBA. As we all well know, these arbitrary caps have resulted in considerable pain and difficulty for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who have met and exceeded the therapy caps. 
   I joined my colleague and good friend, Senator GRASSLEY, as a cosponsor of this important legislation, and I want to commend him for his leadership in getting this bill incorporated into the final BBA Restoration conference report. 
   There are many other important features of this bill that are included in the conference report agreement and, clearly, these provisions will do a great deal to health restore needed Medicare funding to providers. Overall, $2.7 billion is restored to SNFs under this legislation. 
   The bottomline is all of this is ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to quality health care. We need to keep that promise and I believe we have done that through the passage of this legislation today. 
   With respect to other providers, I would briefly add that the bill contains funding for home health agencies as well. The bill will ease the administrative requirements on home health agencies as well as delay the 15 percent reduction in reimbursement rate for one year. This reduction was to have taken effect on October 2000 but will now be delayed for one year until October 1, 2001. 
   I have worked very closely with my home health agencies in my state who were extremely concerned over the impact of the 15% reduction next year. I am pleased to tell them that we have addressed their concerns by delaying this reduction for another year. I think this time will give us an opportunity to focus on this provision to determine what other adjustments, if any, may be required in the future. 
   Overall, the bill adds $1.3 billion back into the home health care component of Medicare. 
   So I believe we have taken some significant steps to ensure that home health care agencies will be able to operate without the threat of increased Medicare reductions on their bottomline. 
   We have also taken steps to help hospitals and teaching hospitals with over $7 billion in Medicare restorations. These increases will help to smooth the transition to the PPS for outpatient services--an issue that was brought to my attention by practically every hospital administrator in my state. 
   On the separate, but equally important issue of children's graduate medical education funding, I am especially pleased that the House has passed legislation that will authorize, for the first time, a new program to provide children's hospitals with direct and indirect graduate medical education funding.  
   Independent children's hospitals, including Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, receive very little Medicare graduate medical education funding (GME). This is because they treat very few Medicare patients, only children with end stage renal disease, and thus do not benefit from federal GME support through Medicare. 
   I cosponsored this legislation in the Senate which passed earlier this year. The measure has now cleared the House and will soon be sent to the President who is expected to sign the measure into law very soon. 
   Moreover, $40 million is contained in the appropriation's bill that will serve as an excellent foundation on which to provide assistance to children's hospitals. 
   I am also pleased that provisions from S. 1626, the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act, were included in the BBA Restoration measure. 
   These important provisions guarantee senior citizens access to the best medical technology and pharmaceuticals. Currently, Medicare beneficiaries do not always have access to the most innovative treatments because Medicare reimbursement rates are inadequate. And I just don't think that it's fair to older Americans. My provisions contained in the restoration bill change this by allowing more reasonable Medicare reimbursements for these therapies. 
   Take, John Rapp, my constituent from Salt Lake City, Utah. Mr. Rapp, who is 71 years old, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last May. He was presented with a series of treatment options and decided to have BRACHY therapy because it was minimally invasive, he could receive it as an outpatient and it had fewer complications than radical surgery. 
   This new innovative therapy implants radioactive seeds in the prostate gland in order to kill cancer cells. The success rate of this therapy has been overwhelming. 
   So, what's the problem? Without my legislation, services such as BRACHY therapy would not be available in the hospital outpatient setting to future Medicare patients due to the way the outpatient prospective payment system is being designed. Life saving services such as BRACHY therapy would be reimbursed at significantly lower-reimbursement rates, from approximately about $10,000 to $1500, and, therefore, it would not be cost-effective for hospitals to offer this service. Fortunately, the provisions included in the omnibus spending bill change all of that--innovative treatments, such as BRACHY therapy, will now be available to future prostate cancer patients. 
   We must get the newest technology, to seniors as quickly as possible. Government bureaucracy should not stand in the way of seniors receiving the best care available. We must put Medicare patients first, not government bureaucracy. That is why my legislation is necessary and I am so pleased that it was included in the Medicare package. 
   Finally, I am pleased that this package also addressed the serious concerns of the community health centers. The community health centers community came to us because there were concerns about the financial hardship that the Balanced Budget Act would have imposed on these health centers and their patients. I worked hard with Finance Committee Chairman ROTH, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator BAUCUS to resolve this important issue. I believe that the conference committee came up with a good solution, however, I intend to monitor this situation closely over the next couple of years. 
   Mr. President, there are numerous other provisions in this restoration package that I will not take the time to comment on now, but they are equally important. I want to commend the leadership in the Senate and House for working to put together this important measure that will clearly help millions of Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota that would impose an 18-month moratorium on mergers in the food processing industry. While I oppose this amendment, I understand Senator WELLSTONE's motivation in offering it. I share his concern over the rapid vertical and horizontal integration in the food processing industry and the effect this trend may have had on family farmers. 
   The livestock industry for beef cattle and hogs has experienced low prices for too long. In fact, the price for live hogs recently reached its lowest level since the Great Depression. Family farms are the backbone of our rural communities, yet family farms are failing. Farmers now receive 36 percent less for their products than they did 15 years ago. Mr. President, there are not many other honest, hardworking Americans who can say that their salaries have gone down by 36 percent over the last decade. Some farmers have complained that the concentration within the industry has restricted their choice of buyers for their products. 
   Many factors have contributed to the troubles farmers have faced recently--consolidation within the food processing industry may not be the sole cause of these troubles, though I recognize it could well be a cause. The recent rate of consolidation, however, is a concern to me, and for this reason I recently pledged a full and comprehensive review of this matter by the full Senate Judiciary Committee. We need to look at the entire spectrum of the food industry to explore the extent to which consolidation within the industry is adversely affecting family farmers. We also need to examine whether existing antitrust statutes are being adequately enforced and whether any changes to federal law are warranted. 
   While I sympathize with the amendment offered by Senator WELLSTONE, I am afraid that it does nothing to shed further light on the matter. Not only does the amendment fail to address the heart of the matter, it may even do more harm than good for our farmers. We cannot possibly understand all of the implications of placing an 18-month moratorium on agribusiness mergers. It is very likely, Mr. President, that smaller food processing plants will rely on mergers with larger processors if they are to survive. Placing a moratorium on mergers could actually cause smaller firms to go out of business. In such a case, this amendment would surely stop a merger, but putting a smaller firm out of business is a less desirable outcome than allowing mergers to go forward. Many of these smaller processors are actually owned by farmers. 
   We cannot afford to lose our family farms in this country, and I think everyone recognizes that. Let us deal with this issue pragmatically. Let us get to the bottom of this problem. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. We should first allow the Judiciary Committee to fully examine these issues and prudently determine what effect, if any, consolidation in the industry has on the plight of the family farmer. The type of market interference proposed by this amendment is simply wrong and I urge my colleagues to reject it. 
   Mr. President, I would like to make some additional remarks regarding concentration in the food processing industry. I have been as concerned about concentration in the food processing industry as any Member of this body. My concern over the concentration in the food processing industry led me to break the logjam on the Livestock Concentration Report Act in the 104th Congress and get it through the Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate. 
   My concern over concentration in the processing industry led me to introduce the Interstate Distribution of State-Inspected Meat Act of 1997 in the 105th Congress. This bill would have helped to shore up and enhance competition in the meatpacking industry. 
   My concern over this issue led me to pass an amendment in the fiscal year 1999 Agriculture appropriations bill that required the USDA to produce a proposal with regard to the interstate distribution issue. I am also considering legislation, along with Senator DASCHLE, to codify the USDA's proposal, which goes even further toward shoring up competition in the meatpacking industry. 
   Finally, I have recently unveiled my plan for the Judiciary Committee to provide a full and comprehensive review of the concentration issue. So far, we have had some excellent studies on this issue. Here is just a small sampling of the many studies already completed with regard to consolidation in the food processing industry:

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in its current form, the bankruptcy reform bill attempts to resolve a major area of bankruptcy abuse, known as ``load up.'' In plain terms, load up occurs when a debtor goes on a spending spree shortly before filing for bankruptcy. 
   Under S. 625, limits are placed on a debtor's ability to buy luxury goods and take out large cash advances on the eve of bankruptcy. The bill accomplishes this by creating a rebuttable presumption that certain debts are not dischargeable. Specifically, the bill provides that debts of more than $250 per credit card for luxury goods, that are incurred within 3 months of bankruptcy, and cash advances of more than $750, incurred within 70 days of bankruptcy, are presumed to be fraudulent and are non-dischargeable. 
   These provisions, while an improvement over current law, are by no means a solution to the load up problem. Debtors still essentially are free to take out a cash advance of $750 and buy luxury goods valued at $250 on each of their credit cards before even the presumption of nondischargeability kicks in. It also is important to note that under the bill, luxury goods specifically exclude ``goods or services reasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor.'' 
   Many have complained that these provisions do not go far enough to close the load up loophole. The amendment by the Senator from New York, in contrast, undermines the bill's modest anti-load up provisions by applying them only to those with income above the national median. Simply stated, the amendment would create an unjustified double standard, with those who fall under the national median income being permitted to load up on luxury goods and cash advances before filing for bankruptcy, as permitted by current law. 
   If we seriously intend to reform our bankruptcy laws and eliminate fraud in the system, we cannot let this major loophole continue without any reasonable limits.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to the recent retirement of Air Force Brigadier General John L. Clay who is retiring after 28 years of dedicated service to our country. 
   General Clay, a native of Utah, joined the Air Force following his graduation from the United States Air Force Academy. He has served honorably and professionally in a variety of research and development assignments encompassing armaments, missiles and space programs. 
   He is renowned as a developer and manager of many space systems programs and currently serves as the Director of Space and Nuclear Deterrence in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. 
   His outstanding leadership, management expertise, and foresight have been the foundation for the success of major ICBM and space force improvements and the effective use of $50 billion of the defense budget. 
   General Clay directed the effort to replace the Minuteman missile guidance system. This vitally important accomplishment now provides the nation with a key element of our strategic deterrence capability. This was the first major modification to the Minuteman system in almost 30 years. 
   Additionally, he was instrumental in the comprehensive national review of our nation's space launch program, including the innovative Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program which has resulted in the establishment of two internationally competitive commercial families of vehicles capable of meeting government and commercial needs. 
   General Clay also established the Shared Early Warning System program following the September 1998 summit agreement between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin. This program is a milestone in strategic partnerships as it allows the United States and partner countries to share early warning data. It also establishes a first-ever Center for Strategic Stability in Colorado Springs for the upcoming Y2K changeover. This Center will provide launch information to a jointly manned U.S.-Russian operations team during the Y2K rollover period. 
   Unquestionably, Brigadier General John L. Clay is a man of unwavering loyalty and dedication. He has earned the respect of his colleagues in the Air Force, defense contractors, and members of Congress. 
   On behalf of the Senate, I am pleased to convey to General Clay, my fellow Utahns, and his wife, Beverly, our best wishes on the occasion of his retirement and express our appreciation for his service to our country. We wish them well as they embark on this new chapter in their lives.

   Mr. HATCH. 
   Mr. President, today Senator LEAHY and I are introducing a civil asset forfeiture reform bill. 
   First and foremost, I want to emphasize that civil asset forfeiture is an important tool in America's fight against crime and drugs. Last year, the federal government seized nearly $500 million in assets. It is vitally important that the fruits of crime and the property used to commit crimes are forfeited to the government. In recent years, however, there have been numerous examples of civil asset forfeiture actions that should not have been taken. While the vast majority of civil asset forfeiture actions are justified, there have been cases in which government officials did not use good judgment. Some would even say that civil asset forfeiture has been abused in some instances by overzealous law enforcement officials. 
   I will mention just a few examples of such imprudent civil forfeiture actions. In United States v. $506,231, 125 F.3d 442 (7th Cir. 1997), the court dismissed a forfeiture action involving $506,231 and scolded the government for its conduct. In this case, state authorities obtained a warrant to search a pizzeria for stolen goods. During the search of the restaurant, authorities did not find any stolen goods, but they did discover a large amount of currency. Criminal charges were not filed against the owners of the restaurant. Nevertheless, alleging that the currency was related to narcotics, the federal government filed a civil complaint for forfeiture of the $506,231. 
   Four years after the money was seized, the court dismissed the forfeiture complaint and returned the currency to its owner. The court found that the evidence ``does not come close to showing any connection between the money and narcotics,'' that ``there is no evidence that drug trafficking was going on at the pizzeria,'' and that ``nothing ties this money to any narcotics activities that the government knew about or charged, or to any crime that was occurring when the government attempted to seize the property.'' At the conclusion of the case, the court stated that ``we believe the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be desired.''  
   Even more disturbing is United States v. $14,665, 33 F. Supp. 2d 47 (D. Mass. 1998). In this case, airline officials informed the police that a passenger, Manuel Espinola, was carrying a large amount of currency in a briefcase. The police questioned Espinola about the $14,665 in cash. Espinola, a 23-year-old man who purchased the plane ticket in his own name, told the police that he and his brother earned the money selling personal care products for a company called Equinox International. When the police asked Espinola what the money was going to be used for, he stated that he was planning to move to Las Vegas and intended to use the cash as a down payment on a home. Espinola told police that he did not deposit the currency in a bank 
   because he was afraid that it might be attached due to a prior credit problem. Espinola also gave the police a pager number of a co-worker who he said could verify his employment and his plans in Las Vegas. 
   Based on Espinola's explanation, the police officer seized the money because the officer believed it was related to purchase narcotics. The officer did not arrest Espinola, who had no criminal record. 
   After the seizure, in an attempt to get his money back, Espinola submitted documents that largely confirmed his explanation of the currency, including receipts for personal care products from Equinox International and copies of a settlement check from a personal injury claim. By contrast, the government offered no additional evidence that the currency was related to drugs and was subject to forfeiture. 
   The court granted summary judgment to Espinola and, in its order, harshly criticized the forfeiture action. The court stated: ``Even in the byzantine world of forfeiture law, this case is an example of overreaching. The government's showing of probable cause is completely inadequate, based on a troubling mix of baseless generalizations, leaps of logic or worse, blatant ethnic stereotyping.'' Nearly two years after the police seized his money without any evidence it was related to narcotics, the court returned the currency to Espinola. 
   Other federal courts have also criticized federal civil forfeiture actions. For example, in 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated: ``We continue to be enormously troubled by the government's increasing and virtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes and the disregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.'' 
   While I believe that these and other cases prove the need for some reform of civil asset forfeiture law, I want to take this opportunity to praise federal law enforcement officials. Federal law enforcement does an outstanding job fighting crime under the most difficult circumstances. In short, Mr. President, I believe that the problems with civil asset forfeiture have much more to do with defects in the law than with the character or competency of federal law enforcement officials. Senator LEAHY and I drafted this bill to improve civil asset forfeiture law and ensure the continued use of civil asset forfeiture in appropriate cases. 
   The Hatch-Leahy bill makes important improvements to existing law. I will describe a few of these improvements today. The first major reform places the burden of proof in civil asset forfeiture cases on the government throughout the proceeding. Under current law, the government is only required to make an initial showing of probable cause that the property is connected to criminal activity and is thus subject to forfeiture. After the government makes this modest showing, the burden then shifts to the property owner to prove that the property was not involved in criminal activity. Not surprisingly, the fact that the property owner bears the burden of proving the property is not subject to forfeiture has been extensively criticized by the federal judiciary and numerous legal commentators. As one federal court that has been particularly critical of civil asset forfeiture noted, placing the burden of proof on the property owner is a ``constitutional anomaly.'' United States v. $49,576, 116 F.3d 425 (9th. Cir. 1997). The court in 
   $49,576 even questioned whether requiring a property owner to bear the burden of proof in a civil forfeiture action is constitutional: ``We would find it surprising were the Constitution to permit such an important decision to turn on a meager burden of proof like probable cause.'' 
   I, too, believe that placing the burden of proof on the property owner contradicts our nation's traditional notions of justice and fairness. Under the Hatch-Leahy bill, the government will have the burden in civil forfeiture actions to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that the property is connected with criminal activity and is subject to forfeiture. 
   Another major reform in the Hatch-Leahy bill involves what is known as the cost bond. Under current civil forfeiture law, a property owner must post a cost bond of the lessor of $5,000 or 10 percent of the value of the property seized in order to contest a seizure of property. It is important to note that the cost bond merely allows the property owner to contest the forfeiture. It does not entitle the property owner to the return of the property pending trial. 
   I believe that it is fundamentally unfair to require a person to post a bond in order to be allowed to contest the seizure of property. For example, what if the government required persons who were indicted to post a bond to contest the indictment? Such a requirement would be unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment. I believe that requiring a property owner to post a bond to contest the seizure of property is no less objectionable. Such a requirement, Mr. President, seems un-American. The framers of our Constitution would be appalled to know that the federal government, after seizing private property, required the property owner to post a bond in order to contest the seizure. 
   The Justice Department argues that the cost bond requirement reduces frivolous claims. To address this concern, the Hatch-Leahy bill requires that a person who challenges a forfeiture must file his claim to the property under oath, subject to penalty of perjury. I predict that eliminating the cost bond will produce, at most, minor inconveniences because persons who file frivolous claims will be deterred by the substantial legal fees and costs incurred in contesting the forfeiture. After all, who is willing to hire counsel and pay other expenses to litigate a frivolous claim, especially when subject to penalty of perjury? 
   Another reform in the Hatch-Leahy bill addresses the situation in which the government's possession of seized property pending trial causes hardship to the property owner. Under current law, the government maintains possession of seized property pending trial even if it causes hardship to the property owner. A common example of such hardship is where the government seizes an automobile, and the seizure prevents the property owner or members of the property owner's family from getting to and from work pending the forfeiture trial. The Hatch-Leahy bill changes current law to allow, but not require, the court to release property pending trial if the court determines that the hardship to the property owner of continued possession by the government outweighs the risk that the property will be damaged or lost. This is a common sense reform that allows the court to release property in appropriate cases. 
   Another reform in the Hatch-Leahy bill involves reimbursement of attorney fees. The Hatch-Leahy bill awards attorney fees and costs to property owners who prevail against the 
   government in civil forfeiture cases. The costs of contesting a civil forfeiture of property can be substantial. The award of attorney fees and costs to property owners who prevail against the government in civil forfeiture cases is justified because unlike criminal forfeiture actions, the property owner is not charged with a crime. Instead, the government proceeds ``in rem'' against the property. Given that the government does not sue or indict the property owner, it is unfair for the property owner to have to incur attorney fees and costs when the government does not prevail in civil forfeiture actions. 
   The award of attorney fees is also justified because the government only has to prove its case against the property by a preponderance of the evidence. By contrast, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that property is subject to forfeiture in  criminal forfeiture actions. If the government decides to pursue a civil forfeiture action instead of the more difficult to prove criminal forfeiture action, it should be obligated to pay the attorney fees and costs of the property owner when the property owner prevails. 
   Mr. President, I would like to emphasize that while the Hatch-Leahy Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act contains important reforms; it retains civil forfeiture as an important tool for law enforcement. In fact, the Hatch-Leahy bill is a cautious, responsible reform. Some would even argue that this bill is too modest. 
   A comparison of the reforms enacted by the State of California in 1993 is instructive. For example, California changed its civil forfeiture law to require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and achieve a related criminal conviction in most civil asset forfeiture cases. The exception to this rule in California involves seizures of currency in excess of $25,000. In these cases, the State must prove the currency is subject to forfeiture by clear and convincing evidence. Also, California abolished the cost bond in civil forfeiture cases. 
   In short, California's reforms go far beyond anything in the Hatch-Leahy bill, but these reforms have not undermined civil asset forfeiture as a law enforcement tool. The modest reforms in the Hatch-Leahy bill will add much needed protections for property owners at no significant costs to law enforcement. By making these needed reforms, the Hatch-Leahy bill will preserve civil forfeiture as a law enforcement tool for the future. 
   Lastly, I would like to thank Senator LEAHY and his staff for their tireless effort on this legislation. Senator LEAHY has been an advocate for civil asset forfeiture reform for many years. He is one of the leading champions of civil liberties in the Senate. This legislation would not have occurred without his interest and persistence, and I thank him for his efforts.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, occasionally in Washington, an individual crosses our paths whose talents go beyond legal and government relations skills or polished representation of political and policy issues, and extend to an elusive higher level. At this level, we think of him not as a creature of the policies he advocates but as a person--a man of integrity and decency. Mike Petrina is such a man. Generous and unfailingly courteous, Mike has represented the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association with intelligence, savvy, and charm. In doing his job well, he also has achieved what is often very difficult in this town--an excellent reputation as a genuinely nice guy. 
   Before he joined CTFA, Mike worked as legislative counsel to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, as an attorney both in private practice and in community legal services, and as a legislative assistant to the late Representative Silvio Conte. In each of these capacities, his watchword was integrity and his purpose was to achieve the goal without compromising either his own principles or the credibility of his employer. 
   It is clear that among the defining moments of Mike's life--those moments that signaled how successful he would be here in wonk universe, were his quiz show triumphs. If winning on Jeopardy doesn't tell us anything else about a person, it tells us that he will always be able to produce an obscure fact and that he can react instantaneously to a totally unexpected question or comment. Surely those two skills suited Mike superbly for his fruitful Washington career. 
   Mike has chosen to retire early in the year 2000, when he is young enough to enjoy his retirement and to have a long time to do it. I wish him well, and want him to know that many of us here will miss him. With Mike and CTFA president Ed Kavanaugh, the industry made a lasting mark on the Utah Children's Charities through contributions of products to our golf tournament each August. I have been grateful for the contribution and, more importantly, for the spirit of good will that always characterized my interactions with CTFA and with Mike. 
   Mike illustrated, through effective use of his talents, the sense of humor that always tided him over the tough moments, and his gentle approach to people, what the poet and artist J. Stone once said: ``the most visible creators I know of are those artists whose medium is life itself ..... They neither paint nor sculpt--their medium is being. Whatever their presence touches has increased life.'' 
   I am sure I speak for all those who worked with Mike in thanking him for all he did here to make our work together so pleasant and productive. I wish Mike Petrina a long and enjoyable retirement, and urge him to remember always the words of Robert Browning: ``The best is yet to be, the last of life for which the first was made.''

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of myself, Senators ASHCROFT, ABRAHAM, HUTCHINSON, HELMS, GRAMS, and ALLARD that contains new and responsible measures aimed primarily at curbing the manufacturing, trafficking, and abuse of methamphetamine, a destructive drug that is sweeping across our country. We must act now to stop this plague before it destroys the lives of many of our fellow citizens. 
   I hope that the administration will take advantage of this legislation and finally begin, in its seventh year, to take serious steps to enforce our drug laws. Sadly, the Clinton-Gore administration has failed miserably at keeping drugs away from our youth. The administration recently boasted that reported illicit drug use by children 12 to 17 years of age is down this year. What the administration is trying to conceal, however, is that, since it took office, drug use among this same group of children more than doubled. Even with the current dip, the rate is still nearly twice what it was when President Clinton and Vice-President GORE took office. America's history of fighting illegal drugs has been long and tiring, but with so many Americans' lives being ruined by this drug, now is not the time to give up--it is a time to fight smarter and harder.  
   This amendment will provide law enforcement with several effective tools, including proven prevention and treatment programs, that will help us turn the tide of proliferation of methamphetamine use. A significant portion of this amendment reflects language that was passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee earlier this year. This language, which enjoyed the sponsorship of Senators LEAHY, ASHCROFT, FEINSTEIN, DEWINE, BIDEN, GRASSLEY, THURMOND, and KOHL, represented a bipartisan effort to combat methamphetamine manufacturing and trafficking in America. 
   Methamphetamine, also known on the streets as ``meth,'' ``speed,'' ``crank,'' ``ice,'' and ``crystal meth,'' is a highly toxic and addictive stimulant that severely affects the central nervous system, induces uncontrollabe, violent behavior and extreme psychiatric and psychological symptoms, and eventually leads some of its abusers to suicide or even murder. Methamphetamine, first popularized by outlaw biker gangs in the late 1970's, is now being manufactured in makeshift laboratories across the country by criminals who are determined to undermine our drug laws and profit from the addiction of others. 
   So what can we do about the problem? Three years ago, I authored, and Congress passed, the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. This legislation, which also enjoyed bipartisan support, aimed at curbing the diversion of commonly used precursor chemicals and mandated strict reporting requirements on their sale. This law has allowed the DEA, along with the help of industry, to stop large quantities of precursor chemicals from being purchased in the United States and being used to manufacture methamphetamine. But, as the methamphetamine problem continues to grow, more can and should be done to help law enforcement uncover, arrest, and hold accountable those who produce this drug. 
   The methamphetamine threat differs in kind from the threat of other illegal drugs because methamphetamine can be made from readily available and legal chemicals, and because it poses serious danagers to both human life and the environment. According to a report prepared by the Community Epidemiology Work Group, which is part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine abuse levels ``remain high ..... and there is strong evidence to suggest this drug will continue to be a problem in west coast areas and to spread to other areas of the United States.'' The reasons given for this ominous prediction are that methamphetamine can be produced easily in small, clandestine laboratories, and that the chemicals used to make methamphetamine are readily available. 
   This threat is real and immediate, and the numbers are telling. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration--DEA, the number of labs cleaned up by the administration has almost doubled each year since 1995. Last year, more than 5,500 amphetamine and methamphetamine labs were seized by DEA and State and local law enforcement officials, and millions of dollars were spent on cleaning up the pollutants and toxins created and left behind by operators of these labs. In Utah alone, there were 266 lab seizures last year, a number which elevated Utah to the unenviable position of being ranked third in the Nation for highest per capita clandestine lab seizures. 
   The problem with the high number of manufacturing labs is compounded by the fact that the chemicals and substances utilized in the manufacturing process are unstable, volatile, and highly combustible. The smallest amounts of these chemicals, when mixed improperly, can cause explosions and fires. And of course, most of those operating methamphetamine labs are not scientists, but rather unskilled criminals, who are completely apathetic to the destruction that is inherent in the manufacturing process. It is even more frightening when you consider that many of these labs are found in residences, motels, trailers, and even automobiles, and many are operated in the presence of children. 
   I will never forget the tragedy of the three young children who were burned to death when a methamphetamine lab, operated by their mother in a trailer home in California, exploded and caught fire, as reported in an article: 
   ``Meth Madness: Home deaths ruled felony murder,'' in the San Diego Union Tribune, 11/30/96. I honestly do not know which is worse: using methamphetamine or manufacturing it. Either way, methamphetamine is killing our kids. 
   Another problem we face is that it doesn't take a lot of ingenuity or resources to manufacture methamphetamine. This drug is manufactured from readily available and legal substances, and there are countless Internet web sites that provide detailed instructions for making methamphetamine. Anyone who has access to the Internet has access to the recipe for this deadly drug. In fact, one pro-drug Internet site contains more than 70 links to sites that provide detailed information on how to manufacture illicit drugs, including methamphetamine. 
   Let me take a moment to highlight some of the provisions of this amendment that will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in preventing the proliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing in America. 
   This amendment will bolster the DEA's ability to combat the manufacturing and trafficking of methamphetamine, by authorizing the creation of satellite offices and the hiring of additional agents to assist State and local law enforcement officials. More than any other drug, methamphetamine manufacturers and traffickers operate in small towns and rural areas. Unfortunately, rural law enforcement agencies often are overwhelmed and in dire need of the DEA's expertise in conducting methamphetamine investigations. In addition, this amendment will assist State and local officials in handling the dangerous toxic waste left behind by methamphetamine labs. 
   Another important section of the bill will help prevent the manufacture of methamphetamine by prohibiting the dissemination of drug recipes on the Internet. As mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of sites on the Internet that describe how to manufacture methamphetamine. These step-by-step instructions will be illegal under this bill if the person posting the information or the person receiving the information intends to engage in activity that violates our drug laws. 
   In 1992, Congress passed a law that made it illegal for anyone to sell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia. This law resulted in the closing of numerous so-called ``head shops.'' Unfortunately, now some merchants sell illegal drug paraphernalia on the Internet. This bill will amend the anti-drug paraphernalia statute to clarify that the ban includes Internet advertising for the sale of controlled substances and drug paraphernalia. The provision will also prohibit a web site that does not sell drug paraphernalia from allowing other sites that do from advertising on its web site. 
   This amendment contains many references to the drug amphetamine, a lesser-known, but no-less dangerous drug. Other than for a slight difference in potency, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and used in the same manner as methamphetamine. And, amphetamine labs pose the same dangers as methamphetamine labs. Indeed, every law enforcement officer with whom I have spoken agreed that the penalties for amphetamine should be the same as those for methamphetamine. For these reasons, this amendment seeks to equalize the punishment for manufacturing and trafficking the two drugs. 
   To counter the dangers that manufacturing drugs like methamphetamine inflict on human life and on the environment, this amendment imposes stiffer penalties on manufacturers of all illegal drugs when their actions create a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment. The inherent dangers of killing innocent bystanders and contaminating the environment warrant a punitive penalty that will deter criminals from engaging in the activity. 
   This amendment also seeks to keep all drugs away from children and to punish severely those who prey on our children, especially while at school away from their parents. Indeed, studies indicate that drug use goes hand in hand with poor academic performance. To this end, this amendment would increase the penalties for distributing illegal drugs to minors and for distributing illegal drugs near schools and  other locations frequented by juveniles. The amendment also would require school districts that receive Federal funds to have policies expelling students who bring drugs on school grounds either in felonious quantities or with an intent to distribute in the same manner as students who bring firearms to school. Additionally, this amendment would allow school districts to use Federal education funds to provide compensation and services to elementary and secondary school students who are victims of school violence as defined by state law. 
   While we know that vigorous law enforcement measures are necessary to combat the scourge of illegal drugs, we also recognize that we must act to prevent our youth from ever starting down the path of drug abuse. We also must find ways to treat those who have become trapped in addiction. For these reasons, the amendment contains several significant prevention and treatment provisions. 
   Arguably, the most important treatment provision in this amendment offers an innovative approach to how opiate-addicted patients can seek and obtain treatment. As science and medicine continue to make significant strides in developing drugs that promise to make treatment more effective, we must pave the way to ensure that these drugs can be prescribed in an effective manner and in an appropriate treatment setting. Indeed, this provision does exactly this, by fostering a decentralized system of treating heroin addicts with the new generation of 
   anti-addiction medications that are under development. 
   By cutting the existing redtape that serves as a substantial disincentive for qualified physicians to treat drug addicts, this amendment acts as a spur for private sector pharmaceutical firms, working in close partnership with academic and government researchers and the drug abuse treatment community, to develop the next generation of anti-addiction medications for opiate addicts. This new system to treat heroin addicts can also act as a model that can be expanded in the future, as anti-addictive medications are developed, to encompass the treatment of other forms of drug addiction. 
   I want to commend Senators LEVIN, BIDEN, and MOYNIHAN who have worked tirelessly with me in the best spirit of bipartisanship to bring about not just this measure but also to bring about the day in the future that this new treatment paradigm becomes the norm for treating patients addicted to drugs. I also want to recognize the efforts of the experts at the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services for providing their views on this measure. 
   Learning how to treat drug addiction is an essential component in America's battle to conquer drug abuse. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues in creating this new approach that undoubtedly will improve the ability for many to obtain successful treatment. 
   I also support the provision of this amendment that contains the Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act of 1999. This measure strengthens Federal law by increasing the penalties against powder cocaine dealers by reducing from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person must be convicted of distributing in order to receive a mandatory 5-year minimum sentence in Federal prison. By increasing the penalty for powder cocaine offenses, this measure fairly and effectively reduces the sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine. 
   It is important to our criminal justice system that the disparity in sentences between powder and crack cocaine be reduced. Many people whom I respect, including law enforcement officials and academics, believe that the harsher penalties for crack cocaine generally unfairly affect minority Americans and the poor. Senator SESSIONS, whom I admire a great deal, was an accomplished Federal prosecutor for 12 years. He believes passionately that Congress should reduce the disparity in sentences between powder and crack cocaine. While my own solution for reducing the disparity differs somewhat from that suggested by Senator SESSIONS, he offers a prominent example of an experienced prosecutor who believes that this disparity should be reduced. 
   This legislation will reduce the differential between the quantity of powder and crack cocaine required to trigger a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1--the same ratio proposed by the administration. But this legislation will accomplish that goal--not by making sentences for crack cocaine dealers more lenient--but rather by increasing sentences for powder cocaine dealers. We should not reduce the Federal penalties for crack cocaine dealers. It would send absolutely the wrong message to the American people, especially given the disturbing increase in teenage drug use during much of the Clinton administration. 
   This measure is the right approach at the right time. I commend Senator ABRAHAM for his tireless efforts in this matter. Reducing the disparity between crack and powder cocaine will help maintain the confidence of all Americans in the Federal criminal justice system and will provide more appropriate punishment for powder cocaine violations. 
   The amendment I have offered also contains a provision that requires the FBI to prepare a report assessing the threat posed by President Clinton's grant of clemency to FALN and Los Macheteros terrorists. As is now well known, the grant of clemency freed terrorists belonging to groups that openly advocate a war against the United States and its citizens. And, the FALN and Los Macheteros--including the clemency recipients--have actively waged such a war by, among other acts, planting more than 130 bombs in public places, including shopping malls and restaurants. Those bombs killed several people, maimed others, and destroyed property worth millions of dollars. 
   Over the past several months, the Judiciary Committee has sought answers to the many questions raised by the President's clemency grant. Unfortunately, we have been repeatedly stymied by this administration's decision to deploy Executive privilege as a shield against public accountability. Despite this stonewalling, the committee's investigation has led to the troubling conclusion that the release of these individuals may well have increased the risk of domestic terrorism posed by the FALN and Los Macheteros. This amendment insures that the FBI can fully assess this risk, and that the Congress and the American people are fully apprised of the FBI's findings. 
   In conclusion, I believe that this amendment contains many tools essential to our struggle against illegal drug manufacturing and use. We can defeat those who make and sell illicit drugs, and we must fight this plague for the sake of our children and grandchildren. Drug use is a poisonous, nationwide epidemic; it is a battle we must fight until we have succeeded. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. DODD and others, which has many components that undermine the kind of bankruptcy reform we are seeking to accomplish in this bill. The amendment creates new windfalls for debtors in bankruptcy. It imposes an artificial definition of gross income which excludes major sources of income. This would undermine both the means test and the obligation that debtors pay all their disposable income to creditors in chapter 13 plans. Furthermore, the amendment undercuts the bill's definition of household goods, allowing virtually any frivolous item a debtor owns to qualify as a ``household good''. 
   The amendment claims to be ``pro-family'', but it takes a tremendous step backward with respect to families--particularly those who work hard to pay their bills every month. I have worked very hard, along with Senator TORRICELLI, provision by provision, to ensure that this bill is an important for families over current bankruptcy law. I described in considerable detail last week the particular provisions in the bankruptcy bill that are designed to help families, along with the amendment Senator TORRICELLI and I developed to further enhance these provisions. Therefore, I am deeply concerned by the fact that this amendment inexplicably allows debtors to discharge debts without being responsible to repay what they can afford. 
   A practical effect of this amendment is to allow rich debtors to defraud their creditors. Debtors with high income who are receiving child support could subtract child support from the calculation of their ability to repay. Thus, a debtor who earns $100,000 per year and receives an additional $25,000 in child support, and who has mortgage, car, and household expenses equaling $100,000, can go bankrupt in chapter 7 and walk away with $25,000 a year. This windfall to the debtor is passed on the hardworking families that end up subsidizing the cost of bankruptcies of others.  
   Furthermore, the definition of household goods in the amendment allows debtors to avoid a security interest in expensive items like $2,000 stereo systems. I am mystified by why windfalls to debtors of this kind are viewed as pro-family. I have been reminded many times during the course of this debate that bankruptcies end up costing every American family at least $400 per year. When these windfalls are incorporated into our bankruptcy laws, hardworking American families end up paying for them.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on November 11, 1918, an armistice was signed to end the ``War to end all wars.'' The country rejoiced. Then, as the jubilation subsided, the reality of what had occurred slowly entered the consciousness of the nation and shouts of joy turned to tears of grief and thanksgiving. For many who had gone to fight would never return to their homes. And those who did come home would forever be scarred by the sights, sounds, and atrocities of war. 
   How could we, as a nation, show our gratitude to those who had given so much? The answer, insufficient though it was, was to set aside a day to honor all those who had served--heroes and patriots--and to give thanks for their sacrifices for freedom. 
   Tomorrow is the day we have set aside. Tomorrow is the day we should take special care to remember our veterans. 
   Throughout our nation's history there have been men and women willing to wear the uniform of the United States of America --willing to give their lives for freedom. Some people have asked ``why?'' The answer is, in the words of President Reagan, spoken at the 40th anniversary of D-Day: ``It is because you all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.'' 
   Our nation depends on our armed forces. We depend on highly motivated and highly skilled men and women who are willing to go into harm's way at any time to defend American interests. And, when our troops leave the service, we should not forget them. 
   Although the nation may only officially recognize the sacrifices of veterans every November on Veterans Day or every May on Memorial Day, I know, personally, that in the hearts of the individual Americans, our veterans are remembered everyday. They are the husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of us all. Almost one-third of the nation's population--approximately 70 million persons--are veterans, dependents of veterans, or survivors of deceased veterans. I and my family honor and remember my brother Jess who died in World War II and  my brother-in-law Neil Brown, who died in Vietnam. 
   In the decades before the all-volunteer army and sophisticated high-tech weaponry, our military was made up of ordinary people. School teachers, ministers, machinists, truck drivers, bankers, and nurses, enlisted not just in the military, but in a noble enterprise. The story of America is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things and demonstrating uncommon endurance and valor. 
   Today, our armed forces are comprised of dedicated soldiers and sailors who have chosen to make the military a career or to contribute their skills for a time in an all-volunteer, professional fighting force. But, the fact that our nation's Army and Navy have become more reliant on technology does not negate the risks of warfare. Nor does it compensate for family separations, holidays spent thousands of miles from home, or meals eaten out of carton. 
   For Veterans' Day in 1954, President Eisenhower called upon us to ``solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts shall not have been in vain.'' 
   On this Veterans Day, I echo the words of President Eisenhower. I salute all our veterans. I know that as long as there are Americans willing to stand up and fight for our values, we will remain a free and just nation. 
   A while ago, I was moved to write a song about those who have sacrificed so much for our country. It is entitled, ``Morning Breaks at Arlington.'' It is an expression of the emotion and pride I feel whenever I think about the courage and dedication of our service men and women. Let me conclude with the lyrics: 
 Morning breaks on Arlington, Warmed by rays of golden sun, And all who pause in homage there Feel a soft hush in the air. Those who love their liberty Bow the head and bend the knee, And from their hearts they breathe a silent prayer. ``Thank God for those who rest in honor there.''  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD. It would require young adults under the age of 21 to obtain parental consent or demonstrate an ``independent means of repaying'' in order to get a credit card. This amendment also caps the amount of credit a young adult can get to $1,500. 
   Mr. President, I believe this amendment is well-intentioned. However, if adopted, it would unfairly put young adults between the ages of 18 and 21 at a disadvantage by putting serious obstacles in their way, or, in some cases, bar them from obtaining credit cards altogether. Young adults today, whether they are serving in our 
   Nation's military, or going to college, or trying to support a young family, do not need these hurdles placed in their path. This amendment would have an adverse effect on temporarily unemployed adults over the age of 18 who are independent of their parents, the twenty-year-old single mother, the twenty-year-old discharged from the military service, or a twenty-year-old worker between jobs--often the very person most needing the extension of credit. 
   I understand how difficult times can be for young adults. When I was 16 years of age, I was a skilled building tradesman. I knew a trade. I went through a formal apprenticeship and became a journeyman. I was proud of it. I was capable of supporting my family at that time. I worked as a janitor to put myself through college. I believe it is an insult to young adults to put in doubt their ability to get credit. 
   In addition, this amendment does not appear to be well thought out. For example, it makes absolutely no provision for young adults who may be estranged from their parents or whose parents or guardians may be deceased. It is also unclear what new burdens will be placed on lenders to verify the authenticity of a parent's or guardian's signature. I also can't resist pointing out that many of the very same folks who oppose parental consent for abortion are in favor of parental consent for getting a credit card. That seems a little odd to me. 
   I can appreciate that there have been some instances when young adults have been extended credit beyond their ability to repay. But it does not strike me as a reasoned public policy, in an effort to tackle the occasional abuse, to discriminate against the many honest, hard-working, decent young people between the ages of 18 and 21 who rely on credit to make their lives a little bit more livable, or even sustainable. 
   I also must point out that individuals under age 18 cannot enter into binding contracts, and therefore any credit inadvertently extended to them is unenforceable. 
   The amendment would undermine a fundamental purpose of bankruptcy reform: to make individuals take more responsibility for their personal finances. I believe that the vast majority of young adults between the ages of 18 and 21 are responsible citizens, and they do not need the big Government to tell them what they can or cannot do in this area. I oppose treating adults as if they are children; therefore, I have to oppose this amendment. 
   Let me make a correction. This amendment does not place a cap on the amount of credit a minor can get. I misspoke and I confused it with an amendment filed that was identical to this, only it does have the cap. So I will make that clear and make that correction.

   Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I will certainly make that correction. 
   I still believe we ought to treat them as young adults. We ought to recognize that many people who really qualify for credit cards in these age groups ought to be able to get them with or without anybody else's consent. Many of them live up to the obligations that they incur; in fact, most of them do. I don't think we should, as a public policy matter, make this particular change that my dear friend from Connecticut has suggested. We are sending these young men and women over 18 years of age to war. They can vote at 18. They can do almost anything. Now we want to take away their right to have a credit card. I think that is bad public policy. I hope our colleagues will defeat this amendment when it comes up for a vote. With that, I believe we are ready to recess.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank Senator DODD for his efforts and cooperation in working on this important amendment. 
   I am pleased to offer along with Senators DODD and GREGG, an amendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, that will protect education IRAs and qualified State tuition savings programs in bankruptcy. Education IRAs and qualified State tuition savings programs permit parents and grandparents to contribute funds for the tuition and other higher education expenses of their children and grandchildren. Under current bankruptcy law, creditors may access such accounts to satisfy debts owed by parents and grandparents. 
   The amendment I offer today balances the interest of encouraging families to save for college, with the interest of preventing the potential abuse of transferring funds into education savings accounts prior to an anticipated bankruptcy. Specifically, the amendment provides that contributions to education savings accounts made during the year immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing are not protected in bankruptcy and may be accessed by creditors; contributions up to $5,000 per beneficiary made in the second year prior to filing, however, are protected, as are all contributions made more than 2 years prior to the bankruptcy  filing. To combat potential abuse, debtors must disclose their full interest in such accounts in the statement of financial affairs filed with the bankruptcy court. With respect to education IRAs, there is no limit on the amount that may be excluded from the bankruptcy estate, though the size of education IRAs are effectively limited by the $500 annual contribution limit. With respect to qualified State tuition savings programs, the excluded amount is the full, State-established amount deemed necessary to provide for the qualified education expenses of a beneficiary. 
   College savings accounts encourage families to save for college, thereby increasing access to higher education. In my home State of Utah, 775 children, with account balances nearing $1.2 million, are beneficiaries of such accounts. Nationwide, over one million children benefit from such accounts. Bona fide contributions to such college savings accounts, which are made for the benefit of children, should be beyond the reach of creditors. The ability to use dedicated funds to pay the educational costs of current and future college students should not be jeopardized by a bankruptcy of their parents or grandparents. The amendment I offer today prevents bona fide educational accounts of children from being accessed by their parents' or grandparents' creditors, while also protecting this exclusion from being abused as a means of sheltering assets from the bankruptcy estate. 
   I urge your support of this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment unfairly discriminates against young adults, and I think it should be opposed. Adults between the ages of 18 and 21 can defend our country in the military. Yet under this amendment, they will not be able to even get a credit card without overcoming regulatory obstacles in their way. 
   Many young adults, some of whom are students and are supporting young families, need access to credit cards to make their lives just a little bit easier. So I oppose this paternalistic amendment. 
   I remember what it was like to work in a low-paying job as a janitor. I can appreciate the benefits that being able to obtain credit will provide to hard-working young adults. 
   Keep in mind, many in this group oppose parental consent for abortion, and you are going to impose parental consent on young adults who may be working, who may have families, who may be in the military, who may be as responsible as anybody else. It just plain isn't right. I do not think we should vote for that. 
   So I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my commitment again this year to reforming the bankruptcy laws in order to adequately protect children and ex-spouses that are owed domestic support. I am grateful that S. 625 includes the language I offered last year along with Senators GRASSLEY and KYL, providing extensive reforms to the bankruptcy laws in the area of child support. Also, I introduced additional enhancements to the bill's protection of domestic support obligations at the Judiciary Committee markup, and I accepted further changes by Senator TORRICELLI, with the agreement that we would continue working on the development of even further enhancements to the bill in this important area. I would like to express my gratitude to Senator TORRICELLI for working with me on these important provisions. 
   I have continued to work with domestic support enforcement groups and Senator TORRICELLI to improve the bankruptcy laws, and I offer this amendment, along with Senator TORRICELLI, to make a series of additional enhancements to the bill so that we can be certain that this important legislation enables women and children to collect the support and alimony payments they are owed. 
   Current bankruptcy law simply is not adequate to protect women and children. I have been outraged to learn of the many ways deadbeat parents are manipulating and abusing the current bankruptcy system in order to get out of paying their domestic support obligations. I have in front of me a how-to book called ``Discharging Marital Obligations In Bankruptcy.'' This is why we need to reform our bankruptcy laws. 
   I am proud of the improvements we are making over current law in terms of ensuring that parents meet their child support and other domestic support obligations in bankruptcy. 
   This chart indicates:  
   The Support Provisions Of This Bill Certainly Justify The Praise Given Them By The Most Significant National Public Support Collection Organizations In This Country.  
   That is a statement made by Phillip Strauss, Legal Division of the Family Support Bureau, the Office of the District Attorney of San Francisco on March 18, 1999, in testimony before the House of Representatives. 
   The bill's improvements over current law have the support of the country's premiere child support collection organizations. As you can see, the bill's child support provisions are endorsed by the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Child Support Enforcement Association, and all of them, and many others, support what we are trying to do today. I would also like to point out that literally dozens of ex-spouses who are owed domestic support obligations have expressed to me their support for these improvements to bankruptcy law. 
   We have all heard complaints by those who would attempt to politicize this issue that the bankruptcy bill is somehow harmful to families. I have worked tirelessly, provision by provision, both last year and this year to make this a bill that dramatically improves the position of children and ex-spouses who are entitled to domestic support. No one who actually looks at what the bill says can, in good conscience, say that this bill is not a tremendous improvement for families over current law. There may be those who do not want to see bankruptcy reform, but they cannot, with a straight face, argue that this bill is anything other than a huge positive step for our children. I believe that criticizing this bill without regard for what is in it, and using our children as pawns in the process, is shameful. 
   I challenge critics of the bill to stop with the vague allegations and take a look at what the bill itself actually does. 
   First, here is what S. 625 does apart from the additional improvements I have offered in the manager's amendment:  
   The bill prevents the use of the automatic stay from being used to avoid family support obligations: S. 625 stops deadbeat parents from using bankruptcy to avoid family support obligations. 
   For example, the bill prevents the automatic stay from being used to put a hold on the interception of tax refunds to be used to pay a domestic support obligation. 
   The bill enables revocation of driver's licenses and other privileges from deadbeats: The bill prevents the automatic stay from being used to prevent the withholding of driver's licenses when debtors default on domestic support obligations. This is a particularly important provision, given recent news reports about the effectiveness of suspending driver's licenses of people who aren't paying their child support. A Maryland initiative has resulted in $103 million in child support collections just since 1996. We do not want our bankruptcy laws to work as an impediment to effective programs like the one in Maryland. 
   Without these changes, a person could use current bankruptcy law to stave off a driver's license suspension by using the automatic stay, and undermine the effectiveness of these programs at getting child support to the kids who need it. 
   The bill gives child support first priority status: Domestic support obligations are moved from seventh in line to first priority status in bankruptcy, meaning they will be paid ahead of lawyers and other special interests. 
   The bill makes debt discharge in bankruptcy conditional upon full payment of past due child support and alimony. 
   It requires payment of domestic support obligations for plan confirmation: 
   And, S. 625 makes domestic support obligations automatically nondischargeable. This lets ex-spouses seeking to enforce domestic support obligations avoid the legal expenses of litigation that they incur under present law. 
   The bill provides single parents with new tools to help them collect from an ex-partner in the bankruptcy system. 
   The bill provides better notice and more information for easier child support collection. 
   The bill provides help in tracking deadbeats. For example, If there is non-payment of child support in a post-discharge situation, other creditors with non-dischargeable debt are required to provide the last known address of the debtor on request, a significant help in locating people who have skipped out on their child support obligations. 
   And, the bill allows for claims against a deadbeat parent's property. 
   In addition to these improvements over current law that have been part of the bankruptcy reform bill for months, I have worked with Senator TORRICELLI, the National Women's Law Center, and the National Association of Attorneys General to further enhance the domestic support provisions of the bill. I thank each of them for their commitment to further improving the bill, and I am proud of what we have accomplished. 
   Our amendment has many enhancements over current law. 
   For example, the amendment allows for the payment of child support with interest by those with means. The debtor can pay interest under the plan if he has sufficient income after paying all other allowed claims. 
   The amendment prevents bankruptcy from holding up child custody, visitation, and domestic violence cases. Essentially, the amendment exempts proceedings not involving money from being subject to bankruptcy's automatic stay provisions. These include civil cases regarding child custody or visitation, divorce--unless it involves a division of property--and domestic violence. 
   The amendment facilitates wage withholding to collect child support from deadbeat parents. It accomplishes this by adding a requirement that the trustee provide to the person owed support and the State child support collection agency the debtor's employer's last known name and address. Also, the amendment simplifies the ability of the person owed support to get information on the debtor's whereabouts from other creditors. These measures will assist greatly in the imposition of wage withholding orders if they 
   are not already in effect. 
   The amendment helps avoid administrative roadblocks to get kids the support they need. The amendment provides an expanded definition of ``domestic support obligation'' to cover those who have not been officially designated as a legal guardian, but who nonetheless are entitled to collect child support on a child's behalf. 
   Also, the amendment gives priority to parents over government. It divided the new ``first priority'' status into two sub-parts, giving parents who are not receiving benefits the top priority--whether or not the benefits have been formalistically ``assigned'' to the government for collection purposes--and giving next priority to obligations assigned to and owed directly to the government in exchange for the payment of benefits--such as where parents are liable for the costs of treating a child in a mental facility. 
   A key provision makes staying current on child support a condition of discharge. The amendment allows for conversion or dismissal of chapter 1, 12, and 13 cases where the debtor is not current on presently accruing domestic support obligations. Two checkpoints are imposed in the case at which the debtor must be current with payments: confirmation and prior to obtaining a discharge. This provides a new way of preventing debtors from not paying their domestic support obligations during the gap period between filing and confirmation. 
   Moreover, the amendment makes payment of child support arrears a condition of plan confirmation. It provides that the Chapter 13 plan must pay all 507(3) arrears claims (those owed to families not receiving benefits) in full, unless the creditor--that is, spouse or child--agrees otherwise. 
   The amendment puts responsible debtors over government. It permits the cram down of arrears claims over the objection of a 507(a)(4) government arrears claimant--that is, the government collecting in exchange for paying benefits, in Chapter 12 and 13 cases so long as the debtor agrees to commit all disposable income for a five-year period. 
   This level of detail would ordinarily not be necessary in discussing provisions in a bill on the Senate floor, but I have done so to put the issue to rest once and for all. Let me be clear: With my provisions in the bill, bankruptcy will no longer be used by deadbeat parents to avoid paying child support and alimony obligations. 
   If we take the time to look at the actual provisions in the bill, it is clear that the bankruptcy reform bill of 1999 provides enormous improvements over current law. I have had a long history of advocating for children and families in Congress, and I support a bill that moves the obligation to pay child support and alimony to a first priority status under S. 625, as opposed to its current place at seventh in line, behind bankruptcy lawyers and other special interests. I support a bill that requires debtors who owe child support to keep paying it when they file for bankruptcy. I support a bill that prevents debtors from obtaining a discharge from the court until they bring their child support and alimony obligations current. And, I support a bill that provides that if a debtor pays child support right before filing for bankruptcy, the child support payment can't be taken away from the kids. Let's take a stand for our nation's kids and pass the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 out of the Senate. 
   Again I thank my colleagues for the work they have done, especially Senator TORRICELLI, who has done a remarkable job working with Senator GRASSLEY on this bill as a whole, but in particular working with me on this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased we are finally considering the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. I would like to express my personal appreciation to Senator LOTT for his efforts, along with those of Senator DASCHLE, which resulted in this opportunity for floor consideration of the bill. Also, I am grateful for the hard work of Senator GRASSLEY, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, along with Senator TORRICELLI, the ranking Member of the subcommittee, for their tireless efforts in working out this bipartisan bill. I also thank Senators SESSIONS, BIDEN, and others for their dedication and hard work on this bankruptcy reform bill. 
   As I have said before, I remain confident that given the opportunity to consider the merits of this legislation, the Senate will pass this bill with overwhelming, bipartisan support. As we consider S. 625, I am hopeful that we will keep in mind the broad support for the substance of this important legislation. I hope we will see quick passage  of these much needed reforms to the bankruptcy system, because the reform proposals have been studied by Congress at length, they are bipartisan, and they are fair. 
   First, the reforms proposed in this bill have been deliberated at length. Indeed, Congress has been engaged in the consideration of this issue for several years, and the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which is chaired by Senator GRASSLEY, has held numerous hearings on the issue of bankruptcy reform. The subcommittee heard extensive testimony from literally dozens of witnesses on this subject. 
   Second, this bill is truly bipartisan. During our consideration of this bill at both the subcommittee and full Judiciary Committee levels, numerous changes suggested by the minority were included in the bill. We have been able to reach a number of compromises on this legislation in order to respond to the concern of both parties. I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI for their bipartisan efforts to create this balanced bill. 
   Finally, this bill is fair. One of the principles that guided the authors of our country's original bankruptcy laws, and which is guiding us as we overhaul these laws today, is the concept of a fresh start. 
   The bankruptcy system was designed to provide a fresh start to people in serious financial difficulty, who have no other way out of their predicament. Mr. President, S. 625 does just that. It ensures that people in the most serious financial difficulty will continue to have access to the debt relief they need. At the same time, this legislation ensures that more of the people who have the capacity to repay their debts are required to do so. 
   Depending on what study you believe, anywhere from 6 to 15 percent of bankruptcy filers are using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, running up debts and erasing them under laws that consider income irrelevant--all without any noticeable impact on their lifestyle. I would doubt that any of my colleagues feel that these are the sort of filers who need a fresh start. What they need is a lesson in personal responsibility. 
   I believe that S.625 accomplishes both goals. The bill continues to make bankruptcy an accessible option for those who truly need it. But, it makes it more difficult for spendthrifts--those people who have no desire to change their excessive lifestyles and see bankruptcy as a convenient way to erase their debts. 
   It is no secret that the current bankruptcy system is broken and that Congress must fix it to preserve the opportunity for those individuals in financial straits to obtain a ``fresh start.'' Despite this country's strong economy--unemployment is down and inflation is low--the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased dramatically. Instead of bankruptcy being a safety net, it has become for some a convenient financial management tool. 
   I find it unacceptable and inherently unfair that those who pay their bills have to foot the bill for those who are able to pay, but choose not to. It has been conservatively estimated that personal bankruptcies cost every household $400 per year, and it takes fifteen responsible borrowers to cover the cost of one bankruptcy of convenience. 
   The goal of our bankruptcy system has always been to protect those who need protecting--to provide those who experience genuine and serious financial hardship the opportunity to wipe the slate clean. We must return our system back to its original mission. 
   Bankruptcy reform is not a Republican or a Democratic issue--it is a consumer issue. According to a recent poll, 76 percent of Americans believe that individuals should not be allowed to erase all their debts in bankruptcy if they are able to repay a portion of what they owe. This survey merely reflects the American public's belief that individuals should be responsible for their own actions. S. 625 helps remedy the glaring problems of today's bankruptcy system be creating a needs-based system to determine the chapter under which a person should file for bankruptcy. 
   Mr. President, the House bankruptcy reform bill passed by an overwhelming margin of 313 to 108. Half of the House Democratic Caucus joined with every House Republican to support a bill with more stringent measures than those we are considering in the Senate.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1999. I also am pleased to note that joining with me in sponsoring this important bipartisan legislation are Senators DEWINE and KOHL the chairman and ranking member of the Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their efforts and cooperation in working to craft this balanced reform measure which is long overdue. 
   The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires companies contemplating a merger of acquisition to file a premerger notification with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission if the size of the companies and the size of the proposed transaction are greater than certain  monetary thresholds. These monetary thresholds have not been changed--even for inflation--since the legislation was originally enacted in 1976, over 23 years ago. When the statute was first enacted, Congress intended to limit the scope of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to very large companies involved in very large transactions. At that time, the House Judiciary Committee reported that the statute would apply ``only to the largest 150 mergers annually: These are the most likely to `substantially lessen competition'--the legal standard of the Clayton act.'' However, because the monetary thresholds in the statute have never been updated, nearly 5,000 transactions were reported. 
   Because these monetary thresholds have not been kept current, companies frequently are required to notify the Antitrust Division and the FTC of proposed transactions that do not raise competitive issues. As a result, the agencies are required to expend valuable resources performing needless reviews of transactions that were never intended to be reviewed. In short, current law unnecessarily imposes a costly regulatory and financial burden upon companies, particularly upon small businesses, as well as a sizable drain on the resources of the agencies. Because of the unnecessarily low monetary thresholds, the current Act simply fails to reflect the true economic impact of mergers and acquisitions in today's economy. 
   In addition, after a premerger notification is filed, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act imposes a 30-day waiting period during which the proposed transaction may not close and the Antitrust Division or the FTC conducts an antitrust investigation. Prior to the expiration of this waiting period, the agency investigating the transaction may make a ``second request''--a demand for additional information or documentary material that is relevant to the proposed transaction. Unfortunately, many second requests require the production of an enormous volume of materials, many of which are unnecessary for even the most comprehensive merger review. Complying with such second requests has become very burdensome, often costing companies in excess of $1 
   million to comply. Second requests also extend the waiting period for an additional 20 days, a period of time which does not begin to run until the agencies have determined that the transacting companies have ``substantially complied'' with the second request. This procedure results in many lawful transactions being unnecessarily delayed for extended periods of time. 
   Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today will correct these problems with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. First, the legislation increases the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $35 million, effectively exempting from the Act's notification requirement mergers and acquisitions that, based on the FTC's data, do not pose any competitive concerns. Such mergers make up at least one-third of transactions reported in 1999. Therefore, this modest legislation provides significant regulatory and financial relief for small- and medium-sized companies. In addition, the legislation indexes the threshold for inflation, so that the problem of an expanding economy outgrowing the statute's monetary threshold will not recur. 
   In addition to providing regulatory and financial relief for companies, another purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the Antitrust Division and the FTC efficiently allocate their finite resources to those transactions that truly deserve antitrust scrutiny. To ensure budget neutrality, the legislation adjusts the amount of the filing fee that parties must submit with their notification: For transactions valued between $35 million and $100 million, the filing fee remains unchanged at $45,000; for transactions valued at more than $100 million, the filing fee is increased to $100,000. I have worked with the business community to ensure that this filing fee adjustment is fair by imposing a higher fee on transactions which likely will require more of the agencies' resources to review. Although I would prefer that the filing fees be eliminated completely, in the interest of seeing the reforms in this bill become law, this legislation does not include such a measure. 
   Second, this legislation reforms the second request process by limiting the scope of the information and documents that the agencies may require transacting companies to produce. Under this legislation, second requests must be limited to information that (1) is not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative and (2) does not impose a cost or burden on the transacting parties that substantially outweighs any benefit to the agencies in conducting their antitrust review. If a company believes that the second request does not meet this standard, then that company may petition a United States magistrate judge for review of the second request. Similarly, if the company produces information and documents pursuant to a second request, but the agency determines that the company has not ``substantially compiled'' with the request, then the company also may petition the magistrate judge for a determination on substantial compliance. To ensure that proposed transactions are not unreasonably delayed, the bill provides deadlines by which the agency must notify a company of its failure to comply with a second request and also imposes certain controls, so that the process is not tied up in litigation by either the transacting party or the government. 
   Finally, this legislation requires that the Antitrust Division and the FTC jointly report to Congress annually regarding the second request process and jointly publish guidelines on how companies can comply with second requests. 
   Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today sets forth reforms to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that are long overdue. It provides significant regulatory and financial relief for businesses, while ensuring that transactions that truly deserve antitrust scrutiny will continue to be reviewed. As this bill moves through the legislative process, I remain willing to address any concerns any of my colleagues may have, and look forward to working with the Administration to see that this proposed legislation becomes law, thereby providing relief for small business that is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1999.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to remember my friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. 
   We were both elected to this great body in 1976. But, John was not your average freshman Senator. Whereas I had never held office before, John came to the Senate with a service record to his State and his country that was already exemplary. 
   He was a war hero, having fought with the Marines on Guadalcanal. He was a Rhode Island state legislator, Governor, and Secretary of the Navy. 
   But here, he was not content to rely upon past achievements, no matter how great those achievements were. He fought diligently for a cleaner environment, better health care, and a fair and fiscally sound Medicare and Medicaid system. Most recently, we worked together on the ``Caring for Children Act,'' a bill which would have responsibly taken our nation's child care policy into the next century, providing parents with more options and expanding the ability of states to meet the needs of low-income working parents. 
   It was my pleasure to serve with John Chafee on the Finance Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence. His leadership and understanding on these issues will be greatly missed. 
   I secretly admired John in another way as well. I understand that he could play a mean game of squash, which is a game I never learned. 
   Of all of John's titles--Governor, Secretary, Senator--I know that his favorites were ``Dad'' and ``Grandpa.'' I offer my deep condolences to John's wife, Virginia, and to their children and grandchildren. I know that spending more time with them and in his beloved Rhode Island following his retirement next fall was something that he looked forward to. The tragedy of his sudden death is all the worse because he was cheated out of this well-earned retirement. 
   John Chafee was a gentleman, a statesman, and a true public servant. There is no higher accolade that I can pay him. 
   Elaine and I send our deepest sympathies to his wonderful family and to all Rhode Islanders on this great loss.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, along with the Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, to introduce the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999. Simply put, this legislation reflects several years of discussions and consensus-building efforts in the Senate and the House, and represents the most important and most comprehensive reforms to our nation's patent system in nearly half a century. As we prepare to enter a new millennium built on high-tech growth, the Internet, and electronic commerce, in which American competitiveness will depend on the strength of the patent system and the protections it affords, this legislation could not be more timely. 
   The last time the Patent Act underwent a significant update was in 1952. Since then, our Nation has experienced an unprecedented explosion of technology growth and a tremendous expansion of the global market for the fruits of American ingenuity. Yet our patent laws have remained largely unchanged in the face of the new demands engendered by these developments. This legislation--which many of my colleagues will recognize as a compromise version of the Omnibus Patent Act passed by the Judiciary Committee with near unanimity more than 2 years ago--will effect targeted changes to the patent code to equip the patent system to meet the challenges of new technology and new markets as we approach the new millennium, while at the same time promoting American competitiveness and ensuring adequate protection for American innovators, both at home and abroad. 
   As many of my colleagues know, this legislation is the product of several years of discussion and extensive efforts to reach agreement on a responsible package of patent reforms. The Senate made significant progress toward consensus during the last Congress when several key compromises were reached in the Judiciary Committee to strengthen the bill's protections for small businesses and independent inventors and to preserve America's competitive edge in the face of increasing global competition. I was pleased this year to see those efforts continued in the House, where the supporters and former opponents of the bill agreed to sit down and work through their differences to produce a constructive patent reform bill. The result is H.r. 1907, which has 59 cosponsors in the House--including the most ardent opponents of prior reform measures--and was passed in the House by a 376-43 vote. 
   In many ways, the House-passed ``American Inventors Protection Act'' builds upon the compromises reached in the Senate during the last Congress. For example, the widespread agreement on 18-month publication of patent applicants is centered around the Senate compromise that allowed inventors to avoid disclosure of their applications by not filing their application abroad, where 18-month publication is now the rule. Similarly, estoppel provisions similar to those agreed to in the Senate form a key component on the broad-based agreement on patent reexamination reform. I 
    am pleased to see these compromises preserved and to see that the House has built upon them to reach the sort of broad consensus on patent reform that I have long advocated. 
   The bill Senator LEAHY and I are introducing today in the Senate preserves these important compromises and adds to them a number of important provisions. For example, our bill includes a title not in the House bill to reduce patent fees for only the second time in history (the first time fees were reduced was last year in a bill Senator LEAHY and I ushered through the Senate), to ensure that trademark fees are spent only for trademark-related operations, and to require a study of alternative fee structures to encourage maximum participation by the American inventor community. Our bill also adds important provisions to enhance protections for our national security by preventing disclosure of sensitive and strategic patent-related information and by helping to identify national security positions at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and obtain appropriate security clearances for PTO employees. The bill also prohibits the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks from entering into an agreement to exchange U.S. patent data with certain foreign countries without explicit authorization from the Secretary of Commerce. Also in our bill is a requirement that GAO conduct a study on patents issued for methods of doing or conducting business, which have been the subject of a 75 percent increase in applications at the PTO/ 
   Like the House bill, our legislation will achieve a number of important substantive patent reforms, consistent with the principles of protecting American inventors, our national competitiveness, and the integrity of our patent system. 
   First, the bill provides inventors with enhanced protections against invention promotion scams by creating a private right of action for inventors harmed by deceptive and fraudulent practices and by requiring invention promoters to disclose certain information in writing prior to entering into a contract for invention promotion services. An inventor who is harmed by any  material false or fraudulent statement or representation, or any omission of material fact, by an invention promoter, or by the invention promoter's failure to make the required disclosures, may recover actual damages or, at the plaintiff's election, statutory damages in an amount up to $5,000, as the court considers just, plus reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. A court may award increased damages, up to treble damages, where it finds such conduct to have been intentional and done with the intent to deceive the inventor. And, in an effort to provide better access to information for inventors, the Patent and Trademark Office is required to make publicly available all complaints received involving invention promoters, along with any response of the invention promoter. 
   Second, as noted above, the bill will reduce patent fees, protect trademark fees from being diverted to non-trademark uses, and require the PTO to study alternative fee structures to encourage maximum participation by American inventors. 
   Third, the bill provides a ``first inventor defense'' to an action for patent infringement for someone who has reduced an invention to practice at least one year before the effective filing date of the patent and commercially used the subject matter before the effective filing date of 
   such patent. The bill responds to recent changes in PTO practice and the Federal Circuit's 1998 decision in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, 149 F.3d 1360 (Fed Cir. 1998), in which it formally did away with the so-called ``business methods'' exception to statutory patentable subject matter. As a result, patent filings for business methods are up by 75 percent this year, and many who have been using business methods for many years pursuant to trade secret protection--believing such methods were not patentable--are now faced with potential patent infringement suits from others who, while they may have come later to the game, were first to reach the patent office after the bar to patentability for business methods was lifted. 
   Fourth, the bill will guarantee a minimum 17-year patent term for diligent applicants, addressing concerns that have been expressed since the United States went to a 20-year from filing term of protection with the adoption of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in 1994. 
   Fifth, the bill will place American inventors on a level playing field with their foreign competitors by providing for domestic publication in English of those patent applications that are now subject to foreign publication by foreign patent offices, while still retaining the option inventors now enjoy of preserving the secrecy of their application by not filing abroad. It also protects American inventors from broader disclosure of their invention through domestic publication than occurs in foreign publications by allowing the patent applicant to submit a redacted copy of their application for publication. This provision will effectively facilitate access to information that will enable inventors to target their resources more effectively while also providing, for the first time, effective interim protection for inventors during patent pendency. 
   Sixth, the bill is designed to reduce litigation in district courts and make reexamination a viable, less-costly alternative to patent litigation by giving third-party requesters the option of inter-partes reexamination procedures (in addition to the current ex parte reexamination procedures). Under this optional procedure, the third party is afforded an expanded, although still limited, role in the reexamination process through an opportunity to respond, in writing, to an action by a patent examiner when, but only when, the patent owner does so. These expanded rights for third parties are carefully balanced with incentives to prevent abusive reexamination requests, including broad estoppel provisions and severe restrictions on appeals. 
   Finally, the bill will make a number of miscellaneous, yet important patent reforms. 
   In short, the provisions of this bill now enjoy widespread bipartisan and bicameral support. The total package of changes that have been made to this legislation over the past several years are both responsive and comprehensive. The time to act on this package of reforms is now. Intellectual property, and patents in particular, are among our nation's greatest assets in this technology-dominated age. Our patent system must be equipped to handle the challenges of the new millennium and to protect our nation's creators into the next century. The strength of our economy depends upon it. If we do not, we will lose our edge in the ongoing race for technological and economic leadership in the world economy. 
   In the most simple of terms, we must have a patent system that is state of the art. The bill Senator LEAHY and I are introducing today will help to provide just that. I hope that my colleagues will join with me in giving their overwhelming support for this measure.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is a minor, technical clarification to the L visa program. The L visa is a temporary, nonimmigrant visa allowing a U.S. company which is part of an international business to make intra-company transfers from overseas of foreign executives, managers, and employees with specialized knowledge to America. In 1990, Congress clarified that international accounting firms and their related management consulting practices would be able to use the L visas. This specific provision in the Immigration Act of 1990 was thought necessary by Congress because, for legal and historical reasons, international accounting firms and their management consulting businesses are not organized the same way most international corporations are organized. The laws of various foreign countries relating to the accounting profession have caused the international accounting and associated management consulting businesses to be generally organized as partnerships held together by contracts with a worldwide coordinating organization. The INS regulations reflect congressional intent to be sure that international accounting firms and their associated management consulting businesses so organized would not be at a disadvantage under the L visa program. 8 CFR Section 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(L)(3). 
   My amendment will make sure that any international management consulting firm that separates from an international accounting firm, yet continues to maintain the qualifying worldwide organizational structure, may continue to use the L visa even if it is no longer connected to an accounting firm. Thus, no new category of beneficiaries may use the L visa. On the other hand, no business currently able to use the L visa will lose the right to do so under this amendment, including management consulting firms which have a relationship with an international accounting firm or which are organized in a more typical international corporate structure.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1692, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. At the outset, I would like to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, for his great efforts here this week, and over the past few years, in trying to seek passage of this measure. Few people can speak on this issue with the same passion and depth of understanding as Senator SANTORUM. 
   As we face this vote today, it is clear that the majority of the Senate supports this bill. It is a bipartisan effort. The hope we have, however, in the face of an inevitable veto, is that a number sufficient to override this veto will vote in favor of this bill. 
   Mr. President, I have spoken in past years on this important legislation. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I chaired a major hearing on this bill several years ago, and the graphic description of this procedure and the testimony I heard was compelling, even chilling. 
   This bill presents, really, a very narrow issue: whether one rogue abortion procedure that has probably been performed by a handful of abortion doctors in this country, that is never medically necessary, that is not the safest medical procedure available under any circumstances, and that is morally reprehensible, should be banned. 
   This bill does not address whether all abortions after a certain week of pregnancy should be banned or whether late-term abortions should only be permitted in certain circumstances. It bans one particular abortion procedure. 
   I chaired the Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill that was held on November 17, 1995. After hearing the testimony presented there as well as seeing some of the submitted material, I must say that I find it difficult to comprehend how any reasonable person could examine the evidence and continue to defend the partial-birth abortion procedure. 
   That procedure involves the partial delivery of an intact fetus into the birth canal. The fetus is delivered from its feet through its shoulders so that only its head remains in the uterus. Then, either scissors or another instrument is used to poke a hole in the base of the skull. This is a living baby at this point, in a late trimester of living. Once the abortionist pokes that hole in the base of the skull, a suction catheter is inserted to suck out the brains. This bill would simply ban that procedure. 
   The committee heard testimony from a total of 12 witnesses presenting a variety of perspectives on the bill. I wanted to ensure that both sides of this debate had a full opportunity to present their arguments on this issue, and I think that the hearing bore that out. 
   Brenda Shafer, a registered nurse who worked in Dr. Martin Haskell's Ohio abortion clinic for 3 days as a temporary nurse in September 1993, testified to her personal experience observing Dr. Haskell performing the procedure that would be banned by this bill. Dr. Haskell is one of only a handful of doctors who have acknowledged performing the procedure. 
   The committee also heard testimony from four ob-gyn doctors--two in favor  of the bill and two against--from an anesthesiologist, from an ethicist, and from three women who had personal experiences either with having a late-term abortion or with declining to have a late-term abortion. Finally, the committee also heard from two law professors who discussed constitutional and other legal issues raised by the bill. 
   The hearing was significant in that it permitted the issues raised by this bill to be fully aired. I think that the most important contribution of the hearing to this debate is that the hearing record puts to rest a number of inaccurate statements that have been made by opponents of the bill and that have unfortunately been widely covered in the press. 
   Because the Judiciary Committee hearing brought out many of the facts on this issue, I would like to go through the most important of those for my colleagues to clear up what I think have been some of the major misrepresentations--and simply points of confusion--on this bill. 
   The first and foremost inaccuracy that we must correct once and for all concerns the effects of anesthesia on the fetus of a pregnant woman. I must say that I am personally shocked at the irresponsibility that led some opponents of this bill to spread the myth that anesthesia given to the mother during a partial-birth abortion is what kills the fetus. 
   Opponents of the measure presumably wanted to make this procedure appear less barbaric and make it more palatable. In doing so, however, they have not only misrepresented the procedure, but they have spread potentially life-threatening misinformation that could prove catastrophic to women's health. 
   By claiming that anesthesia kills the fetus, opponents have spread misinformation that could deter pregnant women who might desperately need surgery from undergoing surgery for fear that the anesthesia could kill or brain-damage their unborn children. 
   Let me illustrate how widespread this misinformation has become: In a June 23, 1995, submission to the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee, the late Dr. James McMahon, the other of the two doctors who has admitted performing the procedure, wrote that anesthesia given 
   to the mother during the procedure causes fetal demise. 
   Let me note also that if the fetus was dead before being brought down the birth canal, then this bill by definition would not cover the procedure performed to abort the fetus. The bill covers only procedures in which a living fetus is partially delivered. 
   An editorial in USA Today on November 3, 1995, also stated, ``The fetus dies from an overdose of anesthesia given to its mother.'' 
   In a self-described fact sheet, circulated to Members of the House, Dr. Mary Campbell, Medical Director of Planned Parenthood, who testified of the Judiciary Committee hearing wrote:  
   The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously. A dose is calculated for the mother's weight, which is 50 to 100 times the weight of the fetus. The mother gets the anesthesia for each insertion of the dilators, twice a day. This induces brain death in a fetus in a matter of minutes. Fetal demise therefore occurs in the beginning of the procedure while the fetus is still in the womb.  
   When that statement was referenced to the medical panel at the Judiciary Committee hearing by Senator ABRAHAM, the president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Dr. Norig Ellison, flatly responded, ``There is absolutely no basis in scientific fact for that statement.'' 
   The American Society of Anesthesiologists was invited to testify at our hearing precisely to clear up this obvious misrepresentation. They sought the opportunity to set the record straight. 
   What was terribly disturbing about this distortion was that it could endanger women's health and women's lives. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has made clear that they do not take a position on the legislation, but that they came forward out of concern for the harmful misinformation. 
   The spreading of this misinformation strikes me as a very sad commentary on the lengths that those who support abortion on demand, for any reason, at virtually any time during pregnancy and apparently regardless of the method, will do to defend each and any procedure, and certainly this procedure. The sacrifice of intellectual honesty is very disheartening. 
   As Dr. Ellison testified, he was ``Deeply concerned.......that the widespread publicity given to Dr. McMahon's testimony may cause pregnant women to delay necessary and perhaps lifesaving medical procedures, totally unrelated to the birthing process, due to misinformation regarding the effect of anesthetics on the fetus.'' 
   He stated that the American Society of Anesthesiologists, while not taking a position on the bill, ``......have nonetheless felt it our responsibility as physicians specializing in the provisions 
   of anesthesia care to seek every available forum in which to contradict Dr. McMahon's testimony. Only in that way we believe can we provide assurance to pregnant women that they can undergo necessary surgical procedures safely, both for mother and unborn child.'' 
   Dr. Ellison also noted that, in his medical judgment, in order to achieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth abortion procedure, it would be necessary to anaesthetize the mother to such a degree as to place her own health in jeopardy. 
   In short, in a partial-birth abortion, the anesthesia does not kill the fetus. The baby will generally be alive after partly being delivered into the birth canal and before having his or her skull opened and brain sucked out. 
   Mr. President, if this description is distasteful, that is because the procedure itself is. 
   That is also consistent with evidence provided by Dr. Haskell describing his use of the procedure. In his 1992 paper presented before the National Abortion Federation, which is part of the hearing record, Dr. Haskell described the procedure as first involving the forceps-assisted delivery into the birth canal of an intact fetus from the feet up to the shoulders, with the head remaining in the uterus. He does not describe taking any action to kill the fetus up until that point. 
   In a 1993 interview with the American Medical News, Dr. Haskell acknowledged that roughly two-thirds of the fetuses he aborts using the partial-birth abortion procedure are alive at the point at which he kills them by inserting a scissors in the back of the head and suctioning out the brain. 
   Finally, in a letter to me dated November 9, 1995, Dr. Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina Medical School wrote, ``Although I have never witnessed this procedure, it seems likely from the description of the procedure by Dr. Haskell that many if not all of the fetuses are alive until the scissors and the suction catheter are used to remove brain tissue.'' 
   Simply put, anesthesia given to a mother does not kill the baby she is carrying. 
   Let me move on to the next misrepresentation. Another myth that the hearing record debunks is that the procedure can be medically necessary in late-term pregnancies where the health of the mother is in danger or where the fetus has severe abnormalities. 
   Now, there were two witnesses at the hearing who testified as to their experiences with late-abortions in circumstances in which Dr. McMahon's performed the procedure. Both women, Coreen Costello and Viki Wilson, received terrible news late in their pregnancies that the children they were carrying were severely deformed and would be unable ot survive for very long. 
   I would like to make it absolutely clear that nothing in the bill before us would prevent women in Ms. Costello's and Ms. Wilson's situations from choosing to abort their children. That question is not before us, and it is not one that we face in considering this narrow bill. 
   I also would like to point out that I have the utmost sympathy for women--and their husbands and families--who find themselves receiving the same tragic news that those women received. 
   Regardless of whether they aborted the child or decided to go through with the pregnancy, which is what another courageous witness at our hearing, Jeannie French of Oak Park, Illinois, chose to do--and as a result, her daughter Mary's heart valves were donated to other infants--their experiences are horrendous ones that no one should have to go through.  
   The testimony of all three witnesses was among the most heart-wrenching and painful testimony I have ever heard before the committee. My heart goes out to those three women and their families as well as any others in similar situations. 
   However, the fact is that medical testimony in the record indicates that even if an abortion were to be performed under such circumstances, a number of other procedures could be performed, such as the far more common classical D&E procedure or an induction procedure. 
   When asked whether the exact procedure Dr. McMahon used would ever be medically necessary--even in cases like those described by Ms. Costello and Ms. Wilson--several doctors at our hearing explained that it would not. Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing Ob-Gyn and clinical professor in Dayton, Ohio, stated that she had never had to resort to that procedure and that none of the physicians that she worked with had ever had to use it. 
   Dr. Pamela Smith, Director of Medical Education in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, stated that a doctor would never need to resort to the partial-birth abortion procedure. 
   This ties in closely to what I consider the next misrepresentation made about the partial-birth abortion procedure: the claim that in some circumstances a partial-birth abortion will be the safest option available for a late-term abortion. Testimony and other evidence adduced at the Judiciary Committee hearing amply demonstrate that this is not the case. 
   An article published in the November 20, 1995, issue of the American Medical News quoted Dr. Warren Hern as stating, ``I would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' Dr. Hern is the author of ``Abortion Practice,'' the Nation's most widely used 
   textbook on abortion standards and procedures. He also stated in that interview that he ``has very strong reservations'' about the partial-birth abortion procedure banned by this bill. 
   Indeed, referring to the procedure, he stated, ``You really can't defend it. I'm not going to tell somebody else that they should not do this procedure. But I'm not going to do it.'' 
   In fairness to Dr. Hern, I note that he does not support this bill in part because he feels this is the beginning of legislative efforts to chip away at abortion rights. But, his statement regarding the partial-birth abortion procedure certainly sheds light on the argument made by opponents that it is the safest procedure for late-term abortions. 
   Another misrepresentation that should be set straight concerns claims that the partial-birth abortion procedure that would be banned by this bill is, in fact, performed only in later-term pregnancies where the life of the mother is at risk or where the fetus is suffering from severe abnormalities that are incompatible with life. 
   I certainly do not dispute that in a number of cases the partial-birth abortion procedure has been performed where the life of the mother was at risk or where the fetus was severely deformed. 
   Substantial available evidence indicates, however, that the procedure is not performed solely or primarily where the mother's life is in danger, where the mother's health is gravely at risk, or where the fetus is seriously malformed in a manner incompatible with life. 
   The fact of the matter is--and I know this is something that opponents of the bill have not faced--this procedure is being performed where there are only minor problems with the fetus, and for purely elective reasons. 
   Most important, however, medical testimony at our hearing indicated that a health exception in this bill is not necessary because other abortion procedures are in fact safer and better for women's health. 
   Now, let me be perfectly clear that I do not doubt that in some cases this procedure was done where there were life-threatening indications. 
   However, I simply must emphasize two points. 
   First, those cases are by far in the minority. We should get the facts straight so that our colleagues and the American people understand what is going on here. 
   Second, the most credible testimony at our hearing--confirmed by other available evidence--indicates that even where serious maternal health issues exist or severe fetal abnormalities arise, there will always be other, safer abortion procedures available that this bill does not touch. 
   On that note, I would like to close by highlighting a statement made at our hearing by Helen Alvare of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. She remarked that opponents of this bill keep asking whether enacting it would be the first step in an effort to ban all abortions. 
   In her view, however, the real question should be whether allowing this procedure would serve as a first step toward legalized infanticide. I urge the bill's opponents to ask themselves this question. What is the real purpose of this procedure? 
   That is the fundamental problem with this procedure, It involves killing a partially delivered baby. 
   Let me say to my colleagues in the Senate that the evidence presented more than confirms my view that this procedure is never medically necessary and should be banned. 
   This evidence, regardless of one's view on the broader issue of abortion, provides ample justification for an ``aye'' vote on S. 1692. 
   I hope my colleagues will agree.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill corresponding to one introduced by Congressman HORN of California and passed the House of Representatives this week. The intent of this bill is to allow immigrant orphan siblings to stay together when being adopted by U.S. citizens. 
   Under current law, a U.S. citizen may bring an immigrant child they have adopted to the United States if the child is under the age of 16. This bill would allow U.S. citizens to adopt immigrant children ages 16-17 if the adoption would keep a group of siblings together. 
   Mr. President, I agree with Mr. HORN's conclusion that family unity is a frequently cited goal of our immigration policy, and this proposal would promote that goal. Under current law, if children are adopted by U.S. citizens and the oldest sibling is 16 or 17, the oldest sibling cannot come to the United States with his or her brothers and sisters under current law. It seems clear to me that siblings of these young ages ought not to be separated. 
   Further, foreign adoption authorities in some cases do not allow the separation of siblings. In such cases, if a U.S. citizen wanted to adopt a group of siblings and one of them is 16 or older, the citizen would lose the opportunity to adopt any of them under current law. 
   As Mr. HORN's analysis of the consequences of this bill confirm, this bill is unlikely to cause a significant increase in immigration levels overall. During fiscal year 1996, a total a 351 immigrant orphans older than age 9 were adopted by U.S. citizens, out of 11,316 immigrant orphans adopted by U.S. citizens overall that year. 
   I thank Congressman HORN for his leadership in this issue. I certainly hope that we can act of this measure before we adjourn.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce, along with Senator LEAHY of Vermont, a bill titled ``Denying Safe Havens to International and War Criminals Act of 1999.'' This is an important measure that I hope can move promptly through the Senate Judiciary Committee and through the Senate. The provisions contained in this bill are crucial in combating crime internationally. I believe that it will give law enforcement critical tools in more effectively pursuing fugitives and ware criminals. 
   I thank my ranking member for his work on this matter. This bill incorporates in title III, his own bill dealing with war criminals and it is an important component of this legislation. 
   I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the bill in the RECORD. 
   [Data not available at time of printing.] 
   .Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with Senator HATCH a bill to give United States law enforcement agencies important tools to help them combat international crime. The ``Denying Safe Haven to International and War Criminals Act of 1999'' contains a number of provisions that I have long supported. 
   Unfortunately, crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American interests abroad are part of our modern reality. Furthermore, organized criminal activity does not recognize national boundaries. With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with the push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and businesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and abroad. They can commit crimes abroad and flee quickly to another jurisdiction or country. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it. 
   This bill would help make needed modifications in our laws, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, and this bill gives additional tools to investigators and prosecutors to promote such cooperation, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals and terrorists now enjoy. 
   I initially introduced title I, section 4 of this bill, regarding fugitive disentitlement, on April 30, 1998, in the ``Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998,'' S. 2011, with Senators DASCHLE, KOHL, FEINSTEIN and CLELAND. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator BIDEN, on behalf of the Administration, the ``International Crime Control Act of 1998,'' S. 2303, which contains most of the provisions set forth in this bill. Virtually all of the provisions in the bill were also included in  another major anti-crime bill, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, that I introduced on September 16, 1998, along with Senators DASCHLE, BIDEN, Moseley-Braun, KENNEDY, KERRY, LAUTENBERG, MIKULSKI, BINGAMAN, REID, MURRAY, DORGAN, and TORRICELLI. In addition, Senator HATCH and I included title II, section 1 of this bill regarding streamlined procedures for MLAT requests in our ``International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998'', S. 2536, which passed the Senate last October 15, 1998. 
   We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete improvements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions may be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law enforcement priority. 
   Title I sets forth important proposals for combating international crime and denying safe havens to international criminals. In particular, section 1 would provide for extradition under certain circumstances for offenses not covered in a treaty or absent a treaty. Treaties negotiated many years ago specified the crimes for which extradition would be allowed. Developments in criminal activity, however, have outpaced the ability of countries to renegotiate treaties to include newly 
   developing criminal activity. Under the bill, extradition would nevertheless proceed as if the crime were covered by a treaty for ``serious offenses,'' which are defined to include crimes of violence, drug crimes, bribery of public officials, obstruction of justice, money laundering, fraud or theft involving over $100,000, counterfeiting over $100,000, a conspiracy to commit any of these crimes, and sex crimes involving children. The section sets forth detailed procedures and safeguards for proceeding with extradition under these circumstances. 
   Section 2 contains technical and conforming amendments. 
   Section 3 would give the Attorney General authority to transfer a person in custody in the United States to a foreign country to stand trial where the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that such transfer would be consistent with the international obligations of the United States. The section also allows for the transfer of a person in state custody in the United States to a foreign country to stand trial after a similar determination by the Attorney General and the consent of the State authorities. Similarly, the Attorney General is authorized to request the temporary transfer of a person in custody in a foreign country to face prosecution in a federal or state proceeding. 
   Section 4 is designed to stop drug kingpins, terrorists and other international fugitives from using our courts to fight to keep the proceeds of the very crimes for which they are wanted. Criminals should not be able to use our courts at the same time they are evading our laws. 
   Section 5 would permit the transfer of prisoners to their home country to serve their sentences, on a case-by-case basis, where such transfer is provided by treaty. Under this section, the prisoner need not consent to the transfer. 
   Section 6 would provide a statutory basis for holding and transferring prisoners who are sent from one foreign country to another through United States airports, preventing them from claiming asylum while they are temporarily in the United States. 
   Title II of the bill is designed to promote global cooperation in the fight against international crime. Specifically, section 1 would permit United States courts involved in multi-district litigation to enforce mutual legal assistance treaties and other agreements to execute foreign requests for assistance in criminal matters in all districts involved in the litigation. 
   Section 2 outlines procedures for the temporary transfer of incarcerated witnesses. Specifically, the bill would permit the United States, as a matter of reciprocity, to send persons in custody in the United States to a foreign country and to receive foreign prisoners to testify in judicial proceedings, with the consent of the prisoner and, where applicable, the State holding the prisoner. A transfer may not create a platform for an application for asylum or other legal proceeding in the United States. Decisions of the Attorney General respecting such transfers are to be made in conjunction with the Secretary of State. 
   Title III of the bill is the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' S. 1235, which I introduced on July 15, 1999, with Senator KOHL and is cosponsored by Senator LIEBERMAN. This bill has also 
   been introduced in the House with bipartisan support as H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3058. This title of the bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad. ``Torture'' is already defined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C.  2340, in a law passed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention Against Torture.'' Under this Convention, the United States has an affirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries regardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C.  2340A (1994). 
   This legislation would also provide statutory authorization for OSI, which currently owes its existence to an Attorney General order, and would expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, prosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission. The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse missions. 
   Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties. 
   These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend from Utah, Senator HATCH, for his help in making this bill a reality. Working together, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after 25 years of service to the country, the State of Vermont, and this body, Senator LEAHY has just cast his 10,000th vote. I should note that this milestone vote was cast in relation to substantively dubious campaign finance reform legislation. I can't say that I blame him for supporting the legislation given the fact that his Republican opponents in his last race spent no money and actually endorsed him. 
   All kidding aside, this is an occasion to reflect on Senator LEAHY'S impressive career. In 1974 Senator LEAHY joined this body as the youngest Senator ever elected to represent the state of Vermont. He was the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Vermont in more than a century. If political commentators thought that voting in PAT LEAHY was a one-time event, they were wrong. Senator LEAHY is currently serving his fifth 6 year term. I have had the privilege of working closely with Senator LEAHY for all of my years on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where I serve as chairman and he is my partner, the ranking member of that committee. 
   I have appreciated and benefited from his experience and expertise in may areas. When Senator LEAHY came to the Senate he was already an expert in the area of law enforcement having been named one of the three outstanding prosecutors in United States in 1974. We on the Judiciary Committee have looked to Senator LEAHY on these issues. On high-technology issues, as you all know, Senator LEAHY prides himself in his leadership and knowledge of the issues. His interest and expertise in these areas have helped move the Judiciary Committee forward in tackling these important issues. 
   We who know PAT LEAHY know that he has remained young at heart, as evidenced by his continued devotion to the Grateful Dead. But his devotion to the arts and his devotion to work in this body do not compare to Senator LEAHY'S devotion to his wife, his children, and recent grandson. 
   So, in conclusion, I want to pay tribute to Senator LEAHY and his wonderful family on this remarkable day which symbolizes years of hard work and dedication for which this institution and this country are grateful. While Members of the senate differ from time to time, we can all appreciate and admire the accomplishment of casting 10,000 votes. so when I leave the floor today, I'll tell Senator LEAHY, ``PAT you were, `Built to Last' and while you may be getting up there in years, it's `just a touch of gray. Kind of suits you anyway. That was all I have to say. It's all right.' ''

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill entitled the ``Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999.'' This bill would restore a 30-year-old practice under which a single court, to which several actions with common issues of fact were transferred for pre-trial proceedings, could retain the multidistrict actions for trial. 
   This bill is necessary to correct a statutory deficiency pointed out by the Supreme Court in Lexecon v. Milbert Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1997). It is an important bill for judicial efficiency and for encouraging settlements of multidistrict cases. And I am pleased that the Judicial Conference and the Multidistrict Litigation Panel support this bill. Moreover, I am pleased that this is a bipartisan bill with Senators LEAHY, GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, KOHL, and SCHUMER as cosponsors. 
   Section 1407(a) of title 28, United States Code, authorizes the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to transfer civil actions with common questions of fact ``to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.'' It also requires the Panel, on or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings, to remand any such actions to the district courts in which they were filed. However, for the 30 years prior to the Lexecon decision, federal courts followed the practice of allowing the single transferee court, upon the conclusion of pretrial proceedings, to transfer all of the actions to itself under the general venue provisions contained in 28 U.S.C. &#167;1404. This had the practical advantage of allowing the single transferee court to retain for trial the multiple actions for which it had conducted pretrial proceedings. This greatly enhanced judicial efficiency and encouraged settlements. 
   In Lexecon, however, the Supreme Court held that the literal terms of 28 U.S.C. &#167;1407 did not allow the single transferee court to retain the multidistrict actions after concluding pretrial proceedings. Instead, the Court held, the plain terms of &#167;1407 required the Panel to remand the actions back to the multiple federal district courts in which the actions originated. The Court noted that to keep the practice of allowing the single transferee court to retain the actions after conducting the pretrial proceedings, Congress would have to change the statute. 
   The bill would amend 28 U.S.C. &#167;1407 to restore the traditional practice of allowing the single transferee court to retain the multiple actions for trial after conducting pretrial proceedings. The bill also includes a provision under which the single transferee court would transfer the multiple actions back to the federal district courts from which they came for a determination of compensatory damages if the interests of justice and the convenience of the parties so require. 
   Mr. President, this bill is very similar to the first portion of a H.R. 2112 that passed the House of Representatives under the effective leadership of Congressman SENSENBRENNER. H.R. 2112 includes both the ``Lexecon fix'' and a provision to streamline catastrophe litigation. I believe that both provisions would make good law. However, the Lexecon matter constitutes an emergency for the Multidistrict Litigation Panel, which has a large number of these cases poised for remand if the retention practice is not restored. The catastrophe legislation would constitute an important improvement, but is not an emergency matter. Given this situation, I propose that we pass only the ``Lexecon fix'' during this session by unanimous consent and work to pass the catastrophe legislation during the second session. 
   Senators LEAHY, GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, KOHL, SCHUMER, and I look forward to passing the Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999 very quickly. The Judiciary awaits our prompt action.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week, the minority put the Senate in a take-it-or-leave, it position with respect to campaign finance reform. Using a parliamentary tactic that foreclosed other amendments from being offered, and then objecting to requests to take up other proposals, the proponents of S. 1593, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, got what they wanted--a vote on an unamended, and therefore unimproved, version of their bill. 
   Mr. President, there are many of us who agree that we should make changes in our campaign finance laws; but, we disagree that we should compromise the First Amendment to do it. 
   Today, I am introducing the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act,'' a bill that represents my thinking on campaign finance reform. 
   Many pundits and many colleagues here in Congress perceive that the American people think that our government has become too fraught with special interest influence, bought with special interest campaign contributions. We have all heard voters voice their frustrations about government. Given some of the games we play up here that affect necessary legislation--such as the bankruptcy bill to name just one example--this attitude is not surprising or unwarranted. 
   Yet, it may be a mistake to interpret these frustrations as widespread cynicism about the influence of special interests rather than about the government's inability to enact tax relief, inertia on long-term Social Security and Medicare reforms, and the tug-of-war on budget and appropriations. 
   Nevertheless, it goes without saying that maintaining the integrity of our election system and citizens' confidence in it has to be among our highest priorities. The question is: what is the right reform? 
   There are a number of flaws in the McCain-Feingold bill. The principal one is that the McCain-Feingold attempts, unconstitutionally, I believe, to gag political parties. What Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD forgot is that political parties are 
   organizational instruments for promoting a political philosophy and ideas. To ban the ability of parties to get their messages out to the people is an infringement on free speech. 
   The proposal I am introducing today has two main goals: (1) to open up our campaign finances to the light of day, thus allowing citizens to make their own judgments about how much influence is too much; and (2) to expand opportunities for individuals to participate financially in elections, thus decreasing the reliance on special interest money in campaigns. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act,'' would require all candidates and political committees to disclose every contribution they receive and every expenditure they make over $200 within 14 days on a publicly accessible website. This means people will not have to wade through FEC bureaucracy to get this information, and the information will be continuously updated. 
   People should be able to compare the source of contributions with votes cast by the candidate. They can decide for themselves which donations are rewards for faithfulness to a principle of representation of constituents and which contributions might be a quid pro quo for special favors. 
   Further, my proposal would encourage--not require--non-party organizations to disclose expenditures in a constitutionally acceptable manner the funds that they devote to political activity. Organizations that chose to file voluntary reports with the FEC would make individual donors to their PACs eligible for a tax deduction of up to $100. 
   This provision is designed to encourage voluntary disclosure of expenditures of organizational soft money.  Those organizations that did so would be shedding light on campaign finance not because they have to, but because it furthers the cause of an informed democracy. 
   An article in the Investor's Business Daily quoted John Ferejohn of Stanford University as writing that ``nothing strikes the student of public opinion and democracy more forcefully than the paucity of information most people possess about politics.'' 
   The article goes on to suggest that ``But many reforms, far from helping, would cut the flow of political information to an already ill-informed public.'' Citing a 
   study by Stephen Ansolabehere of MIT and Shanto Iyengar of UCLA, which demonstrates that political advertising ``enlightens voters,'' the IBD concludes that ``well-informed voters are the key to a well-functioning democracy.'' [Investor's Business Daily; 9/20/99] 
   Morton Kondracke editorializes in the July 30, 1999, Washington Times, ``Full disclosure would be valuable on its merits--letting voters know exactly who is paying for what in election campaigns. Right now, campaign money is going increasingly underground.'' 
   This is precisely the issue my amendment addresses. My amendment, rather than prohibit the American people from having certain information produced by political parties, it would open up information about campaign finance. Knowledge is power. My proposal is predicted on giving the people more power. 
   Additionally, my legislation will raise the limits on individual participation in elections. Special interest PACs sprung up as a response to the limitations on individual participation in elections. The contribution limit for individuals is $1000 and it has not been adjusted since it was enacted in 1974. 
   Why are these limits problematic? The answer is that if a candidate can raise $5000 in one phone call to a PAC, why make 5 phone calls hoping to raise the same amount from individuals? My legislation proposes to make individuals at least as important as PACs. 
   My bill also raises the 25-year-old limits on donations to parties and PACs. It raises the current limits on what both individuals and PACs can give to political parties. As the League of Women Voters has correctly pointed out, the activities of political parties are already regulated, whereas the political activities of other organizations are not. If we are concerned about the influence of ``soft'' money--that is, money in campaigns that is not regulated and not disclosed--and cannot be regulated or subject to disclosure under our Constitution--then we ought to encourage--not punish--greater political participation through our party structures. 
   We need to put individuals back as equal players in the campaign finance arena. Special interests--both PACs and soft money--have become important in large part because current law limits are not only a quarter century old, but are also higher for special interests than individuals. 
   Some people have argued that raising the limits on donations to political candidates and parties exacerbates the problem. Their concern is that there is too much money in politics, not that there is too little. 
   I will respond by saying that, first, all individual donations would have to be disclosed. The philosophy of the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act'' is that people have a right to make their own determinations about whether a contribution is tainted or not. 
   Second, the higher contribution limits for hard money donations make individual citizens more important relative to special interests in campaign finance. If one goal of campaign finance reform is to reduce the influence of special interests, then raising the limits on individual contributions is a way to do it. 
   Third, most of the increases in the bill are merely an adjustment for 25 years of inflation. While the contribution limits have remained unchanged, the costs of running a campaign have increased. The higher levels reflect reality. 
   Most importantly, while money is an essential ingredient in a campaign, and is necessary to get one's message to the voters, the real influence in campaigns is the public. Even if wealthy John Smith gives thousands of dollars to a party or candidate, the fact is that he only gets one vote on election day. Candidates and parties have to persuade people to their way of thinking. All the money in the world cannot compensate for a dearth of principles or unpopular ideas. 
   The McCain-Feingold approach represents a constitutionally specious barrier on free speech. It would, by law, prohibit political parties from using soft money to communicate with voters. Prohibitions are restrictions on freedom. 
   My bill, in contrast, does not prohibit anything. It does not restrict the flow of information to citizens. On the contrary, my proposal recognizes that citizens are the ultimate arbiters in elections. They should have access to as much information as possible about the candidates and the positions they represent. 
   Thus far, the information that is available to voters about campaign finance has been difficult to obtain and untimely. My bill, by empowering voters with this information, will put the role of special interests where it rightfully belongs--in the eye of the beholder, not the federal government.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, last Thursday, I listened aghast to the exchanges among Senators MCCAIN, BENNETT, FEINGOLD, MCCONNELL, and GORTON concerning the implication that an appropriation was provided to a project in my home in exchange for campaign money. 
   While my junior colleague from Utah made the case commendably, I do feel compelled to respond for myself since I have actively sought and promoted these appropriations for my State. 
   The Senator from Arizona seems to have confused representation with corruption. 
   Since when does standing up for one's State, its local governments, or its people constitute corruption? 
   I was under the impression that this is what we were sent here to do. 
   The Senator from Arizona is way out of line when he suggests that my colleague, Senator BENNETT, has done even one thing even remotely improper in advocating for our State and for the help necessary to host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. He should include me in that accusation as well. 
   My definition of ``pork'' is an appropriation that is unjustified (i.e., unneeded), not meritorious (i.e., the proposal is poorly conceived or too expensive), or it is solely to benefit the entity receiving the appropriation. The project that the Senator has labeled as ``pork'' is none of those things. 
   First, Salt Lake City was America's choice to host the Olympic games. These are America's games. There are certain things we are going to need help with and that can appropriately be done by the federal government. 
   The so-called pork barrel project he has cited was for Ogden, UT, for water, sewer, and storm water improvements. The Senator from Arizona has intimated on his website that this project received appropriated funds because members of the Senate--and I presume he means me and Senator BENNETT--have been improperly influenced by soft money. 
   I wonder if my colleague has actually thought about that. Does he really believe that Ogden, UT, is so tremendously wealthy that it can make campaign contributions or that its citizens would even countenance such a thing to achieve this project grant? Does the Senator from Arizona hear how ridiculous this sounds? 
   I have thought, while listening to the Senator's remarks, that we have been debating that old question about the tree falling in the forest. If a dollar flows into a campaign chest, but no one takes any action in relation to it, does that make it corrupt? Is acceptance of any campaign contribution de facto corrupt? That certainly seems to be what Senator MCCAIN is saying. 
   I was stunned by the personal nature of the Senator's remarks last week, particularly as regards my colleague Senator BENNETT, and most particularly since Senator MCCAIN could not  seem to cite any specific evidence that this line item for sewer improvements was included as a payoff for a soft money--or hard money for that matter--contribution. 
   No, the best he could do is to say that the appropriation was not authorized. 
   I am the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--it is an authorizing committee. And, I can't tell you the number of times I have debated jurisdiction with the Senator from Arizona. I am well aware of how strongly he feels about the authorization process. I agree with him on that. 
   But give me a break. The Judiciary Committee is not going to authorize every individual grant to a law enforcement agency. I can't believe the Senator wants to authorize $2 million for water, sewer, and storm water improvements in Ogden, UT. 
   And, I suspect that, if he were to be a spectator at the Olympic downhill in 2002, and he needed to use the restroom, he would appreciate those sewer improvements. 
   Moreover, the authorization process is not the good housekeeping stamp of approval. If campaign contributions can taint the appropriations process, they can also taint the authorization process. The logic of the Senator from Arizona is false on this point. 
   I will second the remarks made by Senator MCCONNELL with respect to the tenor of this debate. One would have hoped that we could debate our respective ideas about campaign finance reform without getting into accusing one another of soft money-for-pork deals. 
   But, I hope my colleagues will listen carefully when the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin attempt to smooth things over by saying, ``we're not accusing you; it's the system.'' 
   If these colleagues are not accusing us, then why do we need this bill? If members have not engaged in abuses--then this bill has no basis. 
   When I was a youngster I remember being terribly irritated when the teacher made the whole class stay after school because a couple of my classmates misbehaved. I remember too that sometimes the punishment was that the rules governing library privileges or playground activity became stricter because certain classmates broke the old ones. 
   Today, our Government reacts much the same way when there have been abuses of freedome--we want to legislate a means of prevention. We want to tighten up the rules. 
   Because the people are justifiably outraged at abuses, particularly at breaches of their trust, we feel compelled to respond. 
   We think if we rail loudly in sympathy with their outrage and introduce bills to address the cause of it, the people will think we are above it and have nothing to do with the dirty business. But, me thinks some doth protest too much. (So there will be no misunderstanding, I refer here to the Clinton administration which has yet to sanction the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the alleged campaign finance violations involving contributions to the Democratic National Committee.) 
   At the end of the day, the people will not be fooled. While there is no doubt in my mind that those who favor the McCain-Feingold legislation do so with the purest of motives, and I respect their views, I believe that what the people really want is not new law, but honest politicians. And, that, I say to my colleagues, cannot be legislated. 
   Moreover, to the extent that there have been abuses of campaign integrity, let alone existing law, the problem is not the lack of regulation, but the violation of it. Our efforts might be better spent in toughening both public and private oversight, enforcement, and penalties on the offenders. 
   But, we are instead debating legislation that would impose significant new regulations on the way we undertake the most fundamental of all American freedoms--elections for public office. 
   What on earth are we doing? Why are we even contemplating such sweeping changes--changes that would inevitably dampen free speech in our country? Changes that would damage the ``checks and balances'' that are inherent in our two-party system? 
   Well, in light of recent abuses of freedom in campaign fundraising and in light of what we politicians perceive to be mounting dissatisfaction among the electorate, we are debating a proposal for a new law. 
   That'll fix it. We will all put out our press releases. We will congratulate each other on our so-called ``reform'' legislation. And, if it's a ``reform'' bill, it must be good, right? 
   With all due respect to my colleagues Senators MCCAIN AND FEINGOLD, who have been working on this legislation for a long time and who I know are sincerely dedicated to improving our campaign process, I must say that, if we pass their bill, we will deliver broad-based reforms which we perceive to be popular at the moment. But, we will also be fundamentally changing the relationship between those running for public office and those who elect them for the long term. We will be imposing significantly more regulation governing who can give what to whom as well as how support can be given and how it can be received. 
   Let me comment briefly on this relationship. We all understand it--or we should. 
   When we throw our hats in the ring for public office, we do so because we believe we have ideas and a point of view that would benefit our home state constituents and our country. And, I think it is safe to say that we don't do it for the money--and we have pretty well ``deperked'' this place as well. 
   But, our success depends on the support of others. Our candidacies all began in someone's office or living room. There may have been 3, 5, 10, 15 people in the room. The first order of business was to get our views and ideas before the people with the hope that our platform would appeal to enough people that they would join our bandwagon. 
   How do you grow a campaign? First, people have to know who you are. So, you print some posters and campaign buttons. I might add that when I first ran in 1976, having never held public office before and running against a 3-term incumbent senator, I needed a lot of signs. 
   Then, since you can't really get much substantive information on a yard sign or button, you need some brochures. You need to put out some press releases. You need to buy some TV and radio advertising. 
   Assuming you get some positive response from the people to your views, you will need to hire some staff to organize volunteer efforts and precincts. Later on, you will need to have some phone banks and a get-out-the-vote program. 
   All of this requires money--that people who believe in your candidacy donate to your campaign. This is not money that is taxed and apportioned by some governmental entity. It is money voluntarily given because, in giving it, people are expressing their preferences for those who will represent them. It could be one dollar or a thousand dollars, but the act of contributing to a candidate for public office is an exercise of political freedom. 
   Now, the McCain-Feingold bill, for all of its good intentions, fails this crucial test: it imposes new restrictions on how people can participate financially in campaigns. 
   Previous incarnations of the McCain-Feingold bill would have outlawed all soft money contributions and issue advocacy by special interest groups. 
   The argument goes that sophisticated organizations are manipulating candidates and elections by donating large amounts of money. And, the argument goes further that this manipulation is poisoning the political process for all citizens. 
   So-called coffees at the White House, nights in the Lincoln Bedroom, receptions at Buddhist temples, fundraising from taxpayer-maintained territory, specious connections to foreign governments--that is what has affected people's faith in the electoral process. It isn't the direct mail letter, the cocktail reception, or the $10 per person summer weinie roast. People are pretty savvy. They know we have to raise the money to run, and they know it's not cheap. 
   But, this year, Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD have apparently accepted that their proposed ban was blatantly unconstitutional. They have opted for a half-ban--a ban on soft money contributions from political parties, but not on non-party organizations. 
   Let's be clear about one thing: political parties are already regulated by  law and regulation. These contributions and expenditures are already controlled. The Republican or Democratic National Committees cannot so much as buy a legal pad with 100 percent soft money. 
   This ban on party soft money merely elevates the importance of special interest soft money, which Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD have declared to be society's biggest evil. The League of Women Voters, which previously supported the McCain-Feingold bill, has now asked Senators to oppose it because it not only fails to correct the problem of soft money influence as they see it, but exacerbates it. 
   Additionally, this half-ban on soft money from political parties and its concomitant increase in the importance of special interest groups, serves to weaken our political parties. 
   I recognize that many Americans are frustrated with both parties--and, I admit, often for good reason. But, the fact is that a strong two-party system is what keeps American government working. Nations with multiparty systems often have extreme difficulty finding consensus and are plagued with frequent reversals in ministerial leadership, national policy, and unstable markets given political uncertainty. 
   The American two-party system is a healthy competition of ideas and viewpoints. And, national parties should not be curtailed in their efforts to build their state and local infrastructures and to support their slates of candidates. 
   A ban on the ability of national parties to send money to state and local parties and to candidates is like telling a major league baseball team that it cannot support its farm teams or give a bonus to its promising players. 
   Last, but certainly not least, the revised McCain-Feingold bill remains constitutionally specious. 
   Despite the sponsors recognition that the ban on all soft money violated free speech rights under the Supreme Court's decision ion Buckley v. Valeo, the half-ban still skates on very thin ice. 
   The Court stated:  
   The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government but the people--individually as citizens and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.  
   But, the bottomline for today is that, quite simply, political parties are entitled to promote their views. The McCain-Feingold bill would compromise that right. 
   Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts, balanced budgets, and health care have all been the subject of issue advertising. And, neither Republicans nor Democrats should be ``gagged'' by the provisions of this bill. Since a political party exists to promote a particular viewpoint or philosophy of government, the McCain-Feingold proposal quite simply infringes on its right to do so. 
   But, unlike my school teacher's withholding recess, the McCain-Feingold proposal is not a simple trade-off of privileges for accountability. It asks Americans to exchange a fundamental freedom, which is coveted throughout the world, for the vague promise of curtailing the influence of special interests in elections. 
   But, here again, the McCain-Feingold proposal misses the mark. Who are the special interests? I submit that the ``special interests are us.'' 
   One man's greedy special interest is another man's organization standing up for truth and the American way. It is impossible for this Congress--or any Congress--to make this distinction. 
   The prohibition on party soft money suggested by the McCain-Feingold bill does not even 
   allow the people to exercise their own judgments about the propriety of an expenditure or even about the candidates or the issue. It simply outlaws soft money activity out of hand. 
   Some have said to me, ``But this is a bipartisan bill. It is a good compromise.'' My response must be that just because a measure is bipartisan and called ``reform'' does not make it good. 
   Moreover, I remind my colleagues that the original plaintiffs in this suit included James Buckley, the conservative Senator from New York and Eugene McCarthy, liberal former Senator from Minnesota. 
   The diverse coalition of groups who have led the opposition to previous versions of McCain-Feingold include the National Right to Life Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
   In my view, Mr. President, this is not campaign finance reform. No legislation, certainly nothing called ``reform,'' should leave the people with less freedom. 
   Let's look at this issue. 
   Many pundits and many colleagues here in Congress perceive that the American people think that our government has become too fraught with special interest influence, bought with special interest campaign contributions. We have all heard voters voice their frustrations about government. Given some of the games we play up here that affect necessary legislation--such as the bankruptcy bill to name just one example--this attitude is not surprising or unwarranted. 
   It may be a mistake to interpret these frustrations as widespread cynicism about the influence of special interests rather than about the government's inability to enact tax relief, inertia on long-term Social Security and Medicare reforms, and the tug-of-war on budget and appropriations. 
   Nevertheless, it goes without saying that maintaining the integrity of our election system and citizens' confidence in it has to be among our highest priorities. The question is: what is the right reform? 
   The best way to reform our campaign finance system is to open it up to the light of day and to allow citizens to make the judgments about how much influence is too much. 
   For example, some people may believe that a single dollar from a tobacco PAC, an environmental lobby, or the AFL-CIO is too much. For others, such contributions may not be as much of a concern. 
   Under a system of more prompt, user-friendly disclosure, people can compare the source of contributions with votes cast by the candidate. They can decide for themselves which donations are rewards for faithfulness to a principle and representation of constituents and which contributions might be a quid pro quo for special favors. 
   I had planned to offer a substitute amendment to S. 1593. I called my proposal the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act.'' It would require all candidates and political committees to disclose every contribution they receive and every expenditure they make over $200 within 14 days on a publicly accessible website. This means people will not have to wade through FEC bureaucracy to get this information, and the information will be continuously updated. 
   Further, my proposal would encourage--not require--non-party organizations to disclose expenditures in a constitutionally acceptable manner the funds that they devote to political activity. Organizations that chose to file voluntary reports with the FEC would make individual donors to their PACs eligible for a tax deduction of up to $100. 
   This provision is designed to encourage voluntary disclosure of expenditures of organizational soft money. Those organizations that did so would be shedding light on campaign finance not because they have to, but because it furthers the cause of an informed democracy. 
   An article in the Investor's Business Daily quoted John Ferejohn of Stanford University as writing that ``nothing strikes the student of public opinion and democracy more forcefully than the paucity of information most people possess about politics.''

   Morton Kondracke editorializes in the July 30, 1999, Washington Times, ``Full disclosure would be valuable on its merits--letting voters know exactly who is paying for what in election campaigns. Right now, campaign money is going increasingly underground.''  
   This is precisely the issue my amendment addresses. My amendment, rather than prohibit the American people from having certain information produced by political parties, it would open up information about campaign finance. Knowledge is power. My proposal is predicated on giving the people more power. 
   Additionally, my legislation will raise the limits on individual participation in elections. 
   Special interest PACs sprung up as a response to the limitations on individual participation in elections. The contribution limit for individuals is $1000 and it has not been adjusted since it was enacted in 1974. 
   Why are these limits problematic? The answer is that if a candidate can raise $5000 in one phone call to a PAC, why make 5 phone calls hoping to raise the same amount from individuals? My legislation proposes to make individuals at least as important as PACs. 
   My bill also raises the 25-year-old limits on donations to parties and PACs. It raises the current limits on what both individuals and PACs can give to political parties. 
   As the League of Women Voters has correctly pointed out, the activities of political parties are already regulated, whereas the political activities of other organizations are not.

   Thus far, the information that is available to voters about campaign finance has been difficult to obtain and untimely. My amendment, by empowering votes with this information, will put the role of special interests where it rightfully belongs--in the eye of the beholder, not the federal government. 
   I regret very much that Senator DASCHLE has elected to use this parliamentary tactic--filling the amendment tree and objecting to consideration of other amendments--to foreclose all other amendments. He has put the Senate in a take-it-or-leave-it situation. 
   Some of us had ideas for amendments to the McCain-Feingold bill--or, such as the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act,'' a proposal for a complete substitute. The opportunity for amendments, however, has been scuttled. 
   The proponents evidently believe they have done such a marvelous job that they refused to consider any other amendment when Senator MCCONNELL asked consent to do so last Friday. 
   The proponents of McCain-Feingold will no doubt hit the airwaves and say that the opponents do not support reform. They will say that we voted to keep the status quo, that we support the so-called insidious corruption of soft money. 
   These would be false statements. Many of us do support reform--we simply want it to be fair and respectful of constitutional protections. 
   There is no righteousness whatsoever in voting for a reform bill that limits freedom. 
   I would have liked to offer my proposal. I would have liked the Senate to consider the merits of its approach. 
   But, inasmuch as I will not be able to do that, and other senators who may have supported my alternative will not be able to vote for it, we are left with the Reid amendment, which does not even contain the amendments offered by the Senator from Kentucky to beef up internal procedures for accountability. 
   We are left with an unamended, constitutionally flawed piece of legislation that has the effect of further bureaucratizing our electoral processes and gagging our two most prominent political organizations, thus shielding the people from information as if they are incapable of making evaluations on their own. 
   If this is ``reform,'' it is not reform worthy of support.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to submit a resolution designating the week beginning on November 21, 1999, and the week beginning on November 19, 2000, as ``National Family Week.'' Such a resolution has been passed in every Congress since 1976, and I am proud to support this tradition of honoring America's families. 
   The family is the backbone of our free nation and vital to the prosperity of the United States. We have all seen and, hopefully, have felt the tremendous impact a supportive family makes in the life of an individual. A strong family nurtures and teaches children the values they need to be successful in this world: hard work, honesty, loyalty and respect for others. 
   National Family Week is the week that includes Thanksgiving in both 1999 and 2000. This is a very fitting time to celebrate the institution that brings us together with those we love. 
   This resolution will officially recognize the great significance of the family in our society and encourages states and communities to emphasize the importance of the family with appropriate activities, celebrations, and ceremonies. 
   I hope my distinguished colleagues will join me in support of this resolution.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate debates an arms control treaty of idealistic intent, vague applicability, and undetermined effects. Given today's state of scientific, geopolitical and military affairs, I must vote against the resolution of ratification of  the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty that will lower confidence in our strategic deterrent while creating an international regime that does not guarantee an increase in this country's security. 
   On balance--and these matters are often concluded on balance, as rarely are we faced with clear-cut options--it is my reasoned conclusion that the CTBT does not advance the security of this nation. 
   Some people think that, by passing the CTBT, we will be preventing the horrors of nuclear war in the future. There is great emotional content to this argument. 
   But in deliberations about a matter so grave, I had to apply a rational, logical analysis to the affairs of nations as I see them. And, on reflecting on half a century of the nuclear era, I can only conclude that it is the nuclear strategic deterrent of this country that is the single most important factor in explaining why this country has not been challenged in a major military confrontation on our territory. We emerged victorious from the cold war without ever engaging in a global ``hot'' war. 
   Despite the security we have bought with our nuclear deterrent, the world we live in today is more dangerous than the cold war era. Today, we are faced with the emergence of new international threats. These include rogue states, such as Iraq, Sudan, and North Korea; independent, substate international terrorists, such as Osama bin Laden; and international criminal organizations that may facilitate funds and, perhaps, nuclear materials to flow between these actors. Some of these actors, of course, can and have developed the ``poor man's'' nukes, as they are called: biological and chemical weapons. 
   It is to the credit of the serious proponents of this treaty that they have not argued that this treaty can effectively prevent these new actors on the global scene from developing primitive nuclear weapons--which can be built without tests. The CTBT does not prevent them from stealing or buying tactical nuclear weapons that slip unsecured out of Russian arsenals. The CTBT cannot prevent or even detect low-yield testing by rogue states which have a record of acting like treaties aren't worth the paper they're written on. These are the threats we face today. 
   In this new threat environment, the proponents of this treaty suggest that we abandon testing to determine the reliability of our weapons, to increase their safety, and to modernize our arsenal. 
   Yet we have recent historical evidence that our nuclear deterrent is a key factor in dealing with at least some of these actors. Recall that, in the gulf war, Saddam Hussein did not use his chemical and biological weapons against the international coalition. This was not because Saddam Hussein was respecting international norms. It was solely because he knew the United States had a credible nuclear deterrent that we reserved the right to use. 
   Proponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty argue that scientific tests at the sub-critical level can replace testing as the methodology to ensure the reliability and safety of our nuclear arsenal, which, we all know, has not been tested since 1992. The question of reliability of our deterrent is absolutely essential to this nation's security. And yet the proponents of our science-based alternative program to testing--known as the Stockpile Stewardship Program--all acknowledge that this critical replacement to testing is not in place today and will not be fully developed until sometime in the next decade. 
   Even if the Stockpile Stewardship Program is fully operational in 2005, as the most optimistic representations suggest, that will be more than 10 years since we have had our last tests. After a decade of no testing, the confidence in our weapons will have declined. Throughout this period, we will be relying on a scientific regime whose evolution and effectiveness we can only hope for. 
   This is the concern of numerous national security experts, and their conclusions were not supportive of the CTBT. Addressing this central issue, six former Secretaries of defense (Schlesinger, Cheney, Carlucci, Weinberger, Rumsfeld, Laird) said:  
   The Stockpile Stewardship Program, which will not be mature for at least 10 years, will improve our scientific understanding of nuclear weapons and would likely mitigate the decline in our confidence in the safety and reliability of our arsenal. We will never know whether we should trust the Stockpile Stewardship if we cannot conduct tests to calibrate the unproven new techniques.  
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and former Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch said recently:  
   But the fact is that the scientific case simply has not been made that, over the long term, the United States can ensure the nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing ..... The Stockpile Stewardship Program is not sufficiently mature to evaluate the extent to which it can be a suitable alternative to testing.  
   I hasten to point out that the experts who have spoken against the CTBT have served in Republican and Democratic Administrations. Secretary Kissinger served in the Nixon administration, for example, which negotiated the Threshold Test Ban Treaty banning tests above 150 kilotons. This treaty was ratified during the Bush Administration. John Deutch, as we all know, was head of the CIA in the present Administration. 
   I support the Stockpile Stewardship Program, and will continue to support it. There may be a day when my colleagues and I can be convinced that science-based technology can ensure the reliability and safety of our arsenal to a level that matches what we learn through testing. That would be a time to responsibly consider a Comprehensive Test Ban. And that time is not now. 
   This central point on the reliability of our nuclear deterrent has not escaped the public's view of the current debate. Utahns have approached me on both sides of the argument. 
   Yes, we have seen numerous polls that suggest that the public supports the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. When people are asked, ``do you support a global ban on nuclear testing?'' majorities respond affirmatively. However, when people are asked, as some more specific polls have done, ``Do you believe our nuclear arsenal has kept this country free from attack?'' the majority always answers overwhelmingly affirmatively. When asked whether we need to continue to rely on a nuclear deterrent, the answer is always overwhelmingly affirmative, as it is when the public is asked whether we need to maintain reliability in our nuclear deterrent. Once again, I find the public more sophisticated than they are often given credit for. 
   When I speak with people about the limits of monitoring this global ban, and the numerous methods and technologies available to parties that wish to evade detection, confidence in the CTBT falls even lower. The fact is--and, once again, the proponents of the treaty concede this--that a zero-yield test ban treaty is unverifiable. 
   Small but militarily significant tests--that is, 500-ton tests, significant to the development and improvement of nuclear weapons--will not always be detectable. Higher yield tests--such as 5 kilotons--can be disguised by the techniques known as ``decoupling,'' where detonations are set in larger, either natural or specially constructed, subterranean settings. 
   Today we are uncertain about a series of suspicious events that have occurred recently in Russia, a country that has not signed the CTBT. Some Russian officials have suggested that they would interpret the CTBT to allow for certain levels of nuclear tests, a view inimical to the Clinton administration's proponents of the CTBT. These are troubling questions, Mr. President, which should cast great doubt on the hopes of the proponents of the CTBT. 
   But the proponents say, under a CTBT regime we could demand an on-site inspection. But the on-site inspection regime is, by the terms of the treaty, weak. It is a ``red-light'' system, which means that members of the Executive Council of the Conference of States Parties must vote to get affirmative permission to inspect--and the vote will require a super-majority of 30 of 51 members of the Council for permission to conduct an inspection. The terms of the treaty allow for numerous obstructions by a member subject to inspection. Some of these codified instructions appear to have come out of  Saddam Hussein's play book for defeating UNSCOM. 
   Some have suggested that Senate rejection of this treaty, which seems likely, will undermine this country's global leadership. It is said that, if we fail to ratify, critical states will not ratify the treaty. This assertion strikes me as highly suppositious. 
   Since the end of World War II, there are very few instances of the United States using its nuclear threat explicitly. Besides the Soviet Union, locked in a bipolar global competition with us 
   until its collapse in 1991, other nations' decision to develop nuclear programs were based, not on following ``U.S. leadership,'' but on their perception of regional balances of power, or on their desire to establish global status with a strategic weapon. Their decisions to cease testing will be similarly based. 
   The CTBT, it is argued, will prevent China from further modernizing its nuclear forces. It would be more accurate, in my opinion, to state that the treaty, if it works as its proponents wish, may constrain China from testing the designs for nuclear warheads it has gained through espionage. The debate over future military developments always hinges on the distinction between intentions and capabilities. China's current nuclear capabilities are modest, although it has a handful of warheads and the means to deliver them to the North American continent. 
   But I have to ask: Are the analysts in the Clinton administration confident that China's intentions are consistent with a view embodied in the CTBT that would lock China into substantive nuclear inferiority to the United States? 
   Is that what their espionage was about? Or their veiled threats--such as the famous ``walk-in'' in 1995, when a PRC agent showed us their new-found capabilities? And how about the PRC's explicit threat to rain missiles on Los Angeles? That was a reflection on intentions. 
   Those of us who study intentions and capabilities of such a key geopolitical competitor as China know that their capabilities are far inferior to us. But you have to wonder, based on their statements and other actions, whether the Chinese are willing to accept the current strategic balance that would be locked in with the CTBT. 
   And, does it make sound strategic sense for the defense of our country that the United States, in effect, unilaterally disarms our technological superiority by freezing our ability to modernize and test? 
   When we freeze our deterrent capability, we are, in effect, abandoning America's technological edge and mortgaging that deteriorating edge on the belief and hope that all of our geopolitical competitors will do the same. This reflects a view of the world that is far more optimistic than I believe is prudent. A substantial dose of skepticism should be required when thinking about the defense of our country. 
   To address these concerns, the administration has waived ``Safeguard F,'' which it will attach to the treaty. This addendum states that it is its understanding that if the Secretaries of Defense and Energy inform the President that ``a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme national interests'' clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.'' 
   This vaguely worded escape clause is the manifestation of what is known in international law as rebus sic stantibus. This famous expression is attributed to Bismark, who declared: ``At the bottom of every treaty is written in invisible ink--rebus sic stantibus--`until circumstances change'.'' This is a recognition common in international law, and now manifest in black-and-white in ``Safeguard F,'' that agreements hold only as long as the fundamental conditions and expectations that existed at the time of their creation hold. 
   The fundamental conditions that the CTBT seeks to address are where my fundamental reservations lie. There are too many factors that we cannot control and that will not be restrained by the best intentions of a testing freeze. 
   The world is changing, and alliances are subtly changing. Geopolitical competitors such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are undergoing radical--radical--social changes that are demonstrably affecting their governments, foreign policies, and militaries. An agreement on a test ban freeze today does not reconcile with these realities. 
   Even the most stalwart proponents of the treaty can only argue that U.S. ratification of the treaty may influence other states' behaviors. That is a hope, not a certainty. The need for a reliable nuclear deterrent, last tested in 1992, remains a certainty. I firmly believe that the CTBT will not control these external realities. While some countries may see a test ban regime in their interests, others, motivated not by the norms we hope for in the international community, but by the more historic realities of national interest and competition, may not. 
   The timing is simply wrong to pass this treaty. The science has not been sufficiently reassuring, and global developments have not been encouraging. 
   I must admit that my ongoing concerns about this administration's understanding of the world do not promote confidence in their support for this treaty. Under this administration, we have seen a precipitous decline in the funding of the military; we have seen an unacceptable resistance to missile defense; we have seen that it was Congress that had to promote sanctions on nuclear and missile proliferation from Russian firms spreading nuclear and missile technology to rough states. All of this belies confidence. 
   Combine this with a lack of confidence in the science-based alternative to testing promoted by the administration, which even its supporters recognize is not up to speed, and I must conclude that it is against the U.S. national interest to vote for the CTBT. 
   This vote is not about the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is about whether the nuclear deterrent that has kept this country secure for half a century and will keep this country secure for the foreseeable future. 
   Deterrence is not static, it is dynamic. The world is not static, it is unpredictable and dangerous. The CTBT is an attempt to impose a static arms control environment--to freeze our advantage--while gambling that our competitors abide by the same freeze. Today, that is unsound risk. 
   I will vote to oppose the resolution of ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about certain aspects of the FY 2000 funding level for the Food and Drug Administration. My greatest concern is that while the FY 2000 conference report provides about $70 million over FDA's 1999 funding level of $982,217 million, this is about $90 million below the agency's FY 1999 request of $1.142 billion. 
   While the conference report for FY 2000 does fund important new initiatives within the FDA such as food safety programs, other key priorities are not accommodated such as $20.4 million for phase I funding for construction of the agency's Los Angeles laboratory facility and $15.3 million for improvements to FDA's adverse event reporting system. 
   I thank the chairman for allowing me to bring these vital issues to his attention. If Congress can find resources to fund these important priorities, the American public will reap great benefits. Finally, I commend him for your demonstrated leadership and expertise in financing the operations FDA and I look forward to continuing to work with you on funding this key public health agency.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this month the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office is celebrating their sesquicentennial anniversary. The Sheriff's Office is a proud tradition of Utah, and I am grateful to them for keeping Salt Lake County a safe place to live and visit. 
   Pioneers first settled the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. In March 1849, they elected Brigham Young to be their Governor. Then, in October of the same year, John D. Parker was elected to serve as the first sheriff of what would become the state of Utah. Later, in 1852, after the federal government ratified the creation of the office of county sheriff, James B. Ferguson became John D. Parker's successor. Sheriff Ferguson was the first officially elected sheriff of Salt Lake County. This makes the Salt Lake County Sheriff's  Office one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the west. Today, the 1,254 employees of the Sheriff's Office continue that tradition. 
   Today, there are more than 835,000 citizens of Salt Lake County. These citizens are served by the Sheriff's Office through patrols, investigations, jails--which have held Ted Bundy, Mark Hoffman, and Charles Manson among others--court security, civil service, and specialized services, including K-9, air support, SWAT, and search and rescue units. The Sheriff's Office also coordinates local, state, and federal task forces. 
   Some of the more heroic deeds have received national recognition. Captain Lloyd Prescott is just one example of the kind of person we have working for the people of Utah. During a hostage situation at a Salt Lake County library, then Lieutenant Lloyd Prescott offered himself as an additional hostage to see if he could defuse the situation. After almost five hours, it was obvious that the suspect was becoming more agitated and that he would likely harm one of the hostages. Lieutenant Prescott then announced himself as a police officer and was forced to shoot the suspect. For this act of bravery and courage, Lieutenant Prescott was awarded the Presidential Commendation from President Clinton, the Governor's Commendation from Governor Leavitt, Officer of the Year from the International Association of the Chiefs of Police, Officer of the Year from the International Foot Printers Association, and Deputy Sheriff of the Year from the National Sheriff's Association. Captain Prescott continues to serve the citizens of Salt Lake County and the Sheriff's Office as the Division Commander for the Special Operations Division. 
   This is just one example of the many acts of courage, bravery, and simple acts of service performed daily by employees of the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office. I want to extend a public thank you to all the employees and deputies of the Sheriff's Office for their hard work, service, and dedication to upholding justice and the rule of law. I offer my hearty congratulations to them on this landmark anniversary.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Constitution provides that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint *.*.* Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States *.*.*'' Thus, the President has the power to nominate persons to serve as federal judges and the Senate has the power to render advice and consent on these nominations. And the Constitution requires that the President's power to nominate be exercised ``with'' the Senate's power to advise and consent in order for a final appointment to be made. To the extent such cooperation occurs, the appointment process will be fair, orderly, and timely. To the extent such cooperation does not occur, the appointment process will break down. 
   When I assumed the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, I inherited a process rocked by public strife and private in-fighting. I was determined to lower the temperatures on both sides of the Committee and to preside over a process that did not allow personal attacks on a nominee's character. To accomplish this I turned to the Constitution itself and its requirement that the President and the Senate work ``with'' each other in the appointment process and the Constitution's limits on the power of federal judges. 
   And it has worked. When the President has consulted with the Committee and with home-state Senators, a nominee has moved through the process smoothly. Under my Chairmanship, the Committee has focused its review on each nominee's, integrity, temperament, competence, and respect for the rule of law. To date Republicans have confirmed 325 of President Clinton's nominees to the federal bench. 
   When there have been problems with a nominee, or a potential nominee, the President's consultation with the Committee has enabled us to address those problems privately. For example, a senator on the Committee recently asked me to examine a potential nominee, and when there were problems with that nominee, that Senator and I were able to deal with the problem privately and I expect another candidate will be forthcoming soon. Thus, the process has worked without damaging a candidate's reputation or his family. 
   When the President works with the Senate the process will adequately staff the federal Judiciary. Indeed, after last year's extraordinary number of confirmations, the vacancy rate in the federal Judiciary was reduced to a very low 5.9%. The Chief Justice in his most recent report on the state of the federal Judiciary congratulated the President and the Senate, stating ``I am pleased to report on the progress  made in 1998 by the Senate and the President in the appointment and confirmation of judges to the federal bench ....'' 
   As of today, the Judiciary Committee has held 5 hearings for judicial nominees and have reported 30 nominees to the floor of the Senate. There are currently just 62 vacancies, yielding a vacancy rate of only 7.4%. This is 1 vacancy less than existed at the end of the 103rd Congress when Democrats controlled the Judiciary Committee. Further, should the Senate confirm the 8 nominees that are currently on the floor and the 4 nominees for which we held a hearing today, the number of vacancies will fall to 51, yielding a vacancy rate of just 6%. 
   This will be the lowest vacancy rate for any first session of Congress since the expansion of the judiciary in 1990. Moreover, it is virtually equivalent to the vacancy rate at the end of the last Congress, which was the lowest vacancy rate for any session of Congress since the expansion of the judiciary in 1990. When the President works with us and respects the constitutional advice and consent duties of the Senate, the process has, in fact, worked smoothly. 
   When the President fails to work with the Senate, however, the process does not work smoothly. This was the unfortunate case with Judge Ronnie White. The record shows that Judge White is a fine man. However, he has written some questionable opinions on death penalty cases. The record resulted in both Missouri Senators opposing his nomination on the floor. This record resulted in local and national law enforcement agencies opposing his nomination as well. Here are just some of the letters expressing concern or opposition to Judge White's nomination: 
   The Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs oppose the nomination; the National Sheriff's Association opposed the nomination; the Mercer County, Missouri prosecutor opposed the nomination; the Missouri Sheriffs' Association expressed deep concern over one of Judge White's dissents in a death penalty case involving the murder of one sheriff, two deputies, and the wife of another sheriff, and asked the Senate to consider that dissent in voting on Judge White's nomination. Indeed, 77 of 114 of Missouri's sheriffs asked for serious consideration of Judge White's record. The sheriff of Moniteau County, Missouri, whose wife was murdered by the criminal for whom Judge White would have reversed the death sentence wrote in opposition to the nomination.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, had the White House worked with these home-State Senators and with other Senators to achieve broad support for the nominee, perhaps Judge White would not have been defeated. I don't know. I might add, had both home-State Senators been opposed to Judge White in committee, Judge White would never have come to the floor under our rules. I have to say, that would be true whether they are Democrat Senators or Republican Senators. That has just been the way the Judiciary Committee has operated. Had the President diligently worked with Senators to determine that there would not be broad support for the candidate, he could have found an alternative, consensus candidate. But the President did not. Thus, Judge White's nomination failed on the floor of the Senate. 
   To compound the problem, the President and some of my colleagues in this body made the grave error of suggesting that race was the reason that Senate Republicans voted against Judge White. This transparently political accusation has, as the administration is well aware, no basis in fact. The Judiciary Committee, under my chairmanship, has not kept formal statistics on the race of any of these nominees, nor would we have informed Democrat or Republican members that Judge White is an African American. Many of my Republican colleagues were literally unaware of Judge White's race, and that is the way it has been. We just haven't made notice of anybody's race as we have confirmed these 325 judges that President Clinton has nominated. 
   Instead, they were aware of his record in death penalty cases. I admit that that awareness happened at a relatively late time in this matter. It caught me by surprise as well--the opposition at least. They were aware of the opposition of State and national law enforcement communities that arose after his committee hearing. They were aware of the opposition of both home-State Senators that was announced after his hearing. Indeed, I even had a Democratic Senator inform me that had that Senator known of the recent law enforcement opposition to Judge White's nomination, that Senator would have opposed the nomination as well. Senator BOND did support this judge at the hearing but later changed his position on this as he became more and more aware of the opposition by law enforcement. It was not race that defeated Judge White; it was his record and the opposition of the elected leaders of his State. 
   These same Republican Senators who opposed Judge White overwhelmingly supported the nomination of Charles Wilson, an African American, to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida. While Senate Republicans were mostly unaware of Judge Wilson's race, Members were informed of his outstanding record as a Federal Magistrate and U.S. Attorney, the strong Florida support for Mr. Wilson, and the support of both home-State Senators--1 Republican and 1 Democrat--for Mr. Wilson. Most members were not informed of his race. But these home-State Senators were for Mr. Wilson. And there was broad support in the Senate for Mr. Wilson's candidacy. It was not race that confirmed Mr. Wilson; it was his record and the support of the elected leaders of his State. 
   The same is true for other minority nominations. To mention a few, Victor Marrero, Carlos Murguia, Adalberto Jordan--nominees whose records show they were qualified and respected the rule of law, who had the support of home-State Senators, and who had broad support in the Senate. Thus, the suggestion that the Republicans in this  body voted against Judge White on the basis of race is no more true than a parallel 
   accusation that my Democratic colleagues voted against Clarence Thomas because of his race. I don't think any of us have made that suggestion. 
   I am also deeply disappointed by the patently false suggestions from the administration, and some in this body, that Republicans intentionally delay the processing of minority and women nominees based on their race and gender. This would be a surprise to Charles Wilson, who was nominated on May 27, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the floor of the Senate on July 22, and confirmed on July 30. This would also be a surprise to Marryanne Trump Barry, who was nominated on June 17, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the floor of the Senate on July 29, and confirmed on September 13. Both of these nominees had outstanding records reflecting respect for the law, strong home-State support, the support of both home-State Senators, and broad support in the Senate. Mr. Wilson, Judge Barry, and most of these other nominees proceeded smoothly through the confirmation process because the President worked with the Senate, not against the Senate. 
   The administration is very proud of its record of placing women and minorities on the bench, and it makes a point of informing the public of its work in this regard. In an address to the American Bar Association this summer, President Clinton called the collection of judges he has nominated to the Federal bench ``the most diverse group in American history.'' Nearly half are women and minorities, he said. 
   But each of these judges was confirmed by the Senate, and all were confirmed with Republican support. How can it be that a Senate which has directly participated in this record of accomplishment can become an institution of bias simply by opposing one nominee--a nominee opposed by both home-State Senators and by an overwhelming number of State and national law enforcement leaders? It cannot be. It simply cannot be. The record and the Department of Justice's own numbers speak for themselves. 
   According to the Clinton administration's own data, the Senate--whether it was under Democratic or Republican control--has done its duty and confirmed qualified women and minorities. For example, in 1998, based on Department of Justice data, approximately 32 percent of judicial nominees were women, and 21.5 percent were minorities. Even though the committee does not keep formal statistics, I had my staff manually compute the proportion of women and minorities reported to the Senate floor. So far this year, over 45 percent of the judicial nominees reported to the Senate floor are women or have been minorities. 
   Yes, some nominees take longer than others--but it is not because of their race or gender. My colleagues, I believe, know that. I believe the President and his people at the White House know that. Indeed, several of the nominees of the past that took longer to confirm had my strong support. These included Anne Aiken, Margaret Murrow, and Susan Mollway. I have been condemned for that by certain people on the far right almost on a daily basis ever since. 
   In the end, those who make these troubling accusations either, one, believe them to be true or, two, know they are not true, but want to politicize the issue. Either motivation is evidence of a serious problem within our noble institution, which I hope we, as leaders, can work to rectify. That is one reason I am taking this time today. Using race as a political tactic to advance controversial nominees is especially troubling. I care too much about the Senate and the Federal judiciary to see these institutions become the victims of base, cheap, wedge politics. 
   I would urge my colleagues and the President to reconsider this destructive and dangerous ploy. Instead, they should put aside this destructive rhetoric and work with us to do what is best for the Judiciary, the Senate, and the American people. 
   The Ronnie White nomination is an unfortunate example of what I believe is an increasing pattern on the part of the Clinton White House. I am referring to what appears to be a fire-sale strategy of knowingly sending up nominees who lack home-State support. Some time ago, I sent the White House Counsel a letter stating clearly that consultation was an essential prerequisite to a smoothly functioning confirmations process. But over the past several months, a number of nominees have been forwarded to the Senate over the objection--both private and public--of home-State Senators. Is this a pattern the aim of which is to get nominees confirmed, or is this a strategy, the object of which, is to create a political show down with the Senate. My concern is with the latter. 
   To find the answer to the current political crisis, I turn once again to the Constitution and its requirement that the President and the Senate work ``with'' each other in the nomination and advice and consent process. To enable us to return to working together instead of against each other, I propose that we take time for both sides to cool off. The President and the Senate should take a step back, cool off, and then return to working with each other in the nomination and confirmation process as the Constitution so plainly requires. 
   Mr. President, we have worked well with this President up to now. I have certainly taken my share of criticism for being as fair to this administration as I can possibly be. But this administration knows the rules up here--that when two home State Senators oppose a district court nominee, that district court nominee is not going to make it. That is the way it is. There is nothing I can do to change that because it is the correct rule. It is important that we work together and work with home State Senators in order to resolve this. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate that the Senate has finally acted on S. 82 to reauthorize the FAA and to deal with some of our Nation's air transportation issues. 
   In particular, I am pleased that the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia was adopted to allow exemptions to the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. I recognize that this is a serious matter affecting a number of cities and high-profile airports, and I commend my colleagues who worked long and hard to develop this amendment. 
   While I would have preferred that the final bill include the 48 exemptions contained in S. 82 as it was reported by the Commerce Committee, I recognize that reducing this number to 24 reflects a reasonable compromise. I believe the amendment proposed by Senators GORTON and ROCKEFELLER achieves the central objective, which was to maintain the current level of safety while improving air service for the flying public--which is now almost everyone at one time or another. The compromise also assiduously avoids adversely affecting the quality of life for those living within the perimeter. 
   Today, my constituents in Utah and in other western communities must double or even triple connect to fly into Washington, DC. The Gorton/Rockefeller amendment goes a long way to addressing this inconvenient and time-consuming process and to ensuring that passengers in Utah and the Intermountain West have expanded options. 
   I believe that use of this limited exemption should be to improve access throughout the west and not limit the benefits to cities which already enjoy a number of options. 
   Therefore, when considering applications for these slots, I think it is important for the U.S. Department of Transportation to consider carefully these factors and award opportunities to western hubs, such as the one in Salt Lake City, which connects the largest number of cities to the national transportation network. I want U.S. DOT officials to know that I will be carefully monitoring the implementation of the perimeter slot exemption. 
   I look forward to working with Transportation Department officials as well as my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the traveling public has the greatest number of options available to them. I thank the chair.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to support the confirmation of a judicial candidate who is the epitome of good character, broad experience, and a judicious temperament. 
   First, however, I think it appropriate that I spend a moment to acknowledge the minority for relenting in what I consider to have been an ill-conceived gambit to politicize the judicial confirmations process. My colleagues appear to have made history on September 21 by preventing the invocation of cloture for the first time ever on a district judge's nomination. 
   This was--and still is--gravely disappointing to me. In a body whose best moments have been those in which statesmanship triumphs over partisanship, this unfortunate statistic does not make for a proud legacy. 
   My colleagues, who were motivated by the legitimate goal of gaining votes on two particular nominees, pursued a short-term offensive which failed to accomplish their objective and risked long-term peril for the nation's judiciary. There now exists on the books a fresh precedent to filibuster judicial nominees with which either political party disagrees. 
   I have always, and consistently, taken the position that the Senate must address the qualifications of a judicial nominee by a majority vote, and that the 41 votes necessary to defeat cloture are no substitute for the democratic and constitutional principles that underlie this body's majoritarian premise for confirmation to our Federal judiciary. 
   But now the Senate is moving forward with the nomination of Ted Stewart. I think some of my colleagues realized they had erred in drawing lines in the sand, and that their position threatened to do lasting damage to the Senate's confirmation process, the integrity of the institution, and, of course, the judicial branch of Government. 
   The record of the Judiciary Committee in processing nominees is a good one. I believe the Senate realized that the Committee will continue to hold hearings on those judicial nominees who are qualified, have appropriate judicial temperament, and who respect the rule of law. I had assured my colleagues of this before we reached this temporary impasse and I reiterate this commitment today. 
   This is not a time for partisan declarations of victory, but I am pleased that my colleagues revisited their decision to hold up the nomination. We are proceeding with a vote on the merits on Ted Stewart's nomination, and we will then proceed upon an arranged schedule to vote on other nominees in precisely the way that was proposed prior to the filibuster vote. 
   Ultimately, it is my hope for us, as an institution, that instead of signaling a trend, the last 2 weeks will instead look more like an aberration that was quickly corrected. I look forward to moving ahead to perform our constitutional obligation of providing advice and consent to the President's judicial nominees. 
   And now, I would like to turn our attention to the merits of Ted Stewart's nomination. I have known Ted Stewart for many years. I have long respected his integrity, his commitment to public service, and his judgment. And I am pleased that President Clinton saw fit to nominate this fine man for a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Utah. 
   Mr. Stewart received his law degree from the University of Utah School of Law and his undergraduate degree from Utah State University. He worked as a practicing lawyer in Salt Lake City for 6 years. And he served as trial counsel with the Judge Advocate General in the Utah National Guard. 
   In 1981, Mr. Stewart came to Washington to work with Congressman JIM HANSEN. His practical legal experience served him well on Capitol Hill, where he was intimately involved in the drafting of legislation. 
   Mr. Stewart's outstanding record in private practice and in the Legislative Branch earned him an appointment to the Utah Public Service Commission in 1985. For 7 years, he served in a quasi-judicial capacity on the Commission, conducting hearings, receiving evidence, and rendering decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
   Mr. Stewart then brought his experience as a practicing lawyer, as a legislative aide, and as a quasi-judicial officer, to the executive branch in State government. Beginning in 1992, he served as Executive Director of the Utah Departments of Commerce and Natural Resources. And since 1998, Mr. Stewart has served as the chief of staff of Governor Mike Leavitt. 
   Throughout Mr. Stewart's career, in private practice, in the legislative branch, in the executive branch, and as a quasi-judicial officer, he has earned the respect of those who have worked for him, those who have worked with him, and those who were affected by his decisions. And a large number of people from all walks of life and both sides of the political aisle have written letters supporting Mr. Stewart's nomination. 
   James Jenkins, former President of the Utah State Bar, wrote, ``Ted's reputation for good character and industry and his temperament of fairness, objectivity, courtesy, and patience [are] without blemish.'' 
   Utah State Senator, Mike Dmitrich, one of many Democrats supporting this nomination, wrote, ``[Mr. Stewart] has always been fair and deliberate and shown the moderation and thoughtfulness that the judiciary requires.'' 
   I understand that the American Bar Association has concluded that Ted Stewart meets the qualifications for appointment to the federal district court. This sentiment is strongly shared by many in Utah, including the recent president of the Utah State Bar. For these reasons, Mr. Stewart was approved for confirmation to the bench by an overwhelming majority vote of the Judiciary Committee. 
   To those who contend Mr. Stewart has taken so-called anti-environmental positions, I say: look more carefully at his record. Mr. Stewart was the director of Utah's Department of Natural Resources for 5 years, and the fact is that his whole record has earned the respect and support of many local environmental groups. 
   Indeed, for his actions in protecting reserve water rights in Zion National Park, Mr. Stewart was enthusiastically praised by this administration's Secretary of the Interior. 
   Consider the encomiums from the following persons hailing from Utah's environmental community: 
   R.G. Valentine, of the Utah Wetlands Foundation, wrote, ``Mr. Stewart's judgment and judicial evaluation of any project or issue has been one of unbiased and balanced results.'' 
   Don Peay, of the conservation group sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, wrote, ``I have nothing but respect for a man who is honest, fair, considerate, and extremely capable.'' 
   Indeed, far from criticism, Mr. Stewart deserves praise for his major accomplishments in protecting the environment. 
   Ultimately, the legion of letters and testaments in support of Mr. Stewart's nomination reflects the balanced and fair judgment that he has exhibited over his long and distinguished career. Those who know Ted Stewart know he will continue to serve the public well. 
   On a final note, Ted Stewart is needed in Utah. The seat he will be taking has been vacant since 1997. So I am deeply gratified that the Senate is now considering Mr. Stewart for confirmation. 
   I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who helped get this up and resolve what really was a very serious and I think dangerous problem for the Senate as a whole and for the judiciary in particular. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of Judge Ronnie Lee White, of Missouri, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. We have heard thorough discussions of the nominee by the distinguished Senators from Vermont and from Missouri. In coming to my decision on this nominee, I have considered the fairness of the process under which Judge White has been reviewed, the deference due to the President, and the deference due to the Senators from the nominee's home State. This is a very difficult case. 
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have conducted thorough hearings and reviewed nominees in a fair and even-handed manner. As a result, we have seen a hearings process that does not include personal attacks on nominees and that maintains the institutional integrity of the Senate. On numerous occasions, even when several of my Republican colleagues voted against nominees, I maintained a fair process free from personal attacks on nominees. This was the case with Judge White. The committee held a fair and objective hearing on Judge White and thoroughly reviewed his record. 
   In considering any nomination, I believe that the President, in whom the Constitution vests the nominations power, is due a large degree of deference. Even though there are a large number of the President's nominees that I would not have nominated had I been President, I have supported these nominees in obtaining a floor vote because in my view, the Constitution requires substantial deference to the President. 
   Of course, the more controversial a nominee is, the longer it takes to garner the consensus necessary to move such a nominee out of committee. Such is the case with Judge White. I supported Judge White coming to the floor on two occasions. In the last vote in committee, no fewer than six of my Republican colleagues voted against reporting Judge White to the floor. At that point, however, I gave the President the deference of allowing a vote on his nominee and voted to report Judge White. 
   I must say that I am deeply disappointed by the unjust accusations from some that this body intentionally delays nominees, such as Judge White, based on their race. As the administration is well aware, it is not a nominee's race or gender that slows the process down, but rather the controversial nature of a nominee based on his or her record. 
   Indeed, nominees such as Charles Wilson, Victor Marrero, and Carlos Murguia, minority nominees, and Marryanne Trump Barry, Marsha Pechman, and Karen Schrier, female nominees, had broad support and moved quickly through the committee and were confirmed easily on the floor. And, although the committee does not keep race and gender statistics, a brief review of the committee's record so far this session shows that a large proportion of the nominees reported to the floor and confirmed consists of minorities and women. I categorically reject the allegation that race or gender, as opposed to substantive controversy, has ever played any role whatsoever in slowing down any nominee during my tenure as chairman. 
   After a fair and thorough review in committee and after paying the deference to the President to obtain a vote on the floor, I consider the position of a nominee's home State Senators. These Senators are in a unique position to evaluate whether a nominee instills the confidence in the people of a State necessary to be a successful Federal judge in that State. This is especially true for a district judge nominee whose jurisdiction, if confirmed, would be wholly limited to that particular State. Thus, there has developed a general custom and practice of my giving weight to the Senators from a nominee's home State. 
   There have been several instances where--notwithstanding some serious reservations on my part--I voted to confirm district court nominees because the Senators from the nominees home State showed strong, and in some cases, bipartisan support. The nominations 
   of Keith Ellison, Allen Pepper, Anne Aiken, Susan Mollway, and Margaret Morrow are examples of where I supported contested district court nominees and relied on the view of the home-State Senators in reaching my decision. 
   While I have harbored great concerns on the White nomination, I withheld my final decision until I had the benefit of the view of my colleagues from Missouri. I was under the impression that one of my colleagues might actually support the nomination, so I felt that the process should move forward--and it did. 
   Since the committee reported Judge White to the floor of the Senate, however, both of the Senators from Missouri have announced their opposition to confirming Judge White. Also, since the committee reported this nominee to the floor, the law enforcement community of Missouri has indicated serious concerns, and in some cases, open opposition to the nomination of Judge Ronnie White. And indeed, I have been informed that the National Sheriffs Association opposes this nomination. Opposition is mounting and it would perhaps be preferable to hold another hearing on the nomination. But if we must move forward today, it is clear to me that Judge White lacks the home-State support that I feel is necessary for a candidate to the Federal district court in that State. 
   For me, this case has been a struggle. On the one hand, Judge White is a fine man and the President is due a fair amount of deference. On the other hand, we are faced with the extremely unusual case in which both home State Senators, after having reviewed the record, are opposing this nomination on the floor. 
   Of course, had the President worked more closely with the two Senators from Missouri and then nominated a less problematic candidate, we would not be in this predicament. But the President did not. 
   When a nominee has a record of supporting controversial legal positions that call into question his, or her, respect for the rule of law, it takes longer to gain the consensus necessary to move the nominee. When the President has not adequately consulted with the Senate, it takes longer to gain the consensus necessary to move the nominee. And when both home State Senators of a nominee oppose as nominee on the floor of the Senate, it is almost impossible to vote for the confirmation of that nominee. 
   Regretfully, such is the case with Judge White. Judge White has written some controversial opinions, especially on death penalty cases that have caused some to question his commitment to upholding the rule of law. The President has not garnered broad support for Judge White. And both Senator ASHCROFT and Senator BOND oppose this nomination. It would have been better for all parties concerned--the President, the Senate, the people of Missouri, and Judge White, had we been able to reach this decision earlier. But I cannot rewrite the past. 
   After a painstaking review of the record and thorough consultation with the nominee's home State Senators, I deeply regret that I must vote against the nomination of Judge White. This is in no way a reflection of Judge White personally. He is a fine man. Instead, my decision is based on the very unusual circumstances in which the President has placed this body. I must defer to my colleagues from Missouri with respect to a nominee whose jurisdiction, if confirmed, would be wholly limited to that State. 
   I call on the President to nominate another candidate for the Eastern District of Missouri. He should do so, however, only after properly consulting with both Missouri Senators and thus respecting the constitutional advice and consent duties that this body performs in confirming a nominee who will serve as a Federal judge for life.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to offer the Aircraft Safety Act of 1999 as an amendment to S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act. I join with Senator LEAHY and Senator THURMOND in proposing this amendment, which will provide law enforcement with a potent weapon in the fight to protect the safety of the traveling public. This is one piece of legislation which could truly help save hundreds of lives. 
   Current federal law does not specifically address the growing problem of the use of unapproved, uncertified, fraudulent, defective or otherwise unsafe aviation parts in civil, military and public aircraft. Those who traffic in this potentially lethal trade have thus far been prosecuted under a patchwork of Federal criminal statutes which are not adequate to deter the conduct involved. Most subjects prosecuted to date have received little of no jail time, and relatively minor fines have been assessed. Moreover, law enforcement has not had the tools to prevent these individuals from reentering the trade or to seize and destroy stockpiles of unsafe parts. 
   While the U.S. airline industry can take pride in the safety record they have achieved thus far, trade in fraudulent and defective aviation parts is a growing problem which could jeopardize that record. These suspect parts are not only readily available throughout the country, they are being installed on aircraft as we speak. This problem will continue to grow as our fleet of commercial and military aircraft continues to age. Safe replacement parts are vital to the safety of this fleet. When you consider that one Boeing 747 has about 6 million parts, you begin to understand the potential for harm caused by the distribution of fraudulent and defective parts. 
   Where do these parts come from? Some are used or scrap parts which should be destroyed, or have not been properly repaired. Others are simply counterfeit parts using substandard materials unable to withstand the rigors imposed through daily use on a modern aircraft. Some are actually scavenged from among the wreckage and broken bodies strewn about after an airplane crash. For example, when American Airlines Flight 965 crashed into a mountain in Columbia in 1995, it wasn't long before some of the parts from that aircraft wound up back in  the United States and resold as new by an unscrupulous Miami dealer who had obtained them through the black market. 
   While the danger to passengers and civilians on the ground is substantial, this danger also jeopardizes the courageous men and women of our armed forces. The Army is increasingly buying commercial off-the-shelf aircraft and parts for their growing small jet and piston-engine passenger and cargo fleets. The Department of Defense will buy 196 such 
   aircraft by 2005 and virtually every major commercial passenger aircraft is in the Air Force fleet, although the military designation is different. In addition, there are dozens of specially configured commercial aircraft that have frame modifications to serve special missions, such as reconnaissance and special operations forces. The safety of all of these vehicles is dependent on the quality of the parts used to repair them and keep them flying. 
   The amendment we have proposed will criminalize: (1.) The knowing falsification or concealment of a material fact relating to the aviation quality of a part; (2.) The knowing making of a fraudulent misrepresentation concerning the aviation quality of a part; (3.) the export, import, sale, trade or installation of any part where such transaction was accomplished by means of a fraudulent certification or other representation concerning the aviation quality of a part; (4.) An attempt or conspiracy to do the same. 
   The penalty for a violation will be up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, however, if that part is actually installed, the violator will face up to 25 years and a fine of $500,000. And if the part fails to operate as represented and serious bodily injury or death results, the violator can face up to life in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. Organizations committing a violation will be subject to fines of up to $25,000,000. 
   In addition to the enhanced criminal penalties created, the Department of Justice may also seek reasonable restraining orders pending the disposition of actions brought under the section, and may also seek to remove convicted persons from engaging in the business in the future and force the destruction of suspect parts. Criminal forfeiture of proceeds and facilitating property may also be sought. The Attorney General is also given the authority to issue subpoenas for the purpose of facilitating investigations into the trafficking of suspect parts, and wiretaps may be obtained where appropriate. 
   This amendment is supported by Attorney General Reno, Secretary Slater, Secretary Cohen and NASA Administrator Goldin, and OMB has indicated that this amendment is in accord with the President's program. I ask my fellow Senators to join with Senators LEAHY, THURMOND and me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his amendment. 
   I have followed the activities of the NLRB for many years--since I came to the Senate, in fact. It is certainly not clear to me that this agency needs a $25 million increase over last year's level--particularly when the subcommittee was forced to be so frugal with a number of other high priority programs. 
   I support the reallocation of these funds to the Consolidated Health Services account for the Community Health Centers. We have long worried about access to primary health care for low-income families. This amendment is a way that we can provide such care for 83,000 more Americans. 
   The Senator from Iowa said that he was told the association representing community health centers did not request this amendment. I cam appreciate the rationale of the association. They, of course, recognize the hard work done by the subcommittee in putting together this bill and wish to support that by taking a neutral position on the Hutchinson amendment. 
   However, let's put the amendment in perspective. The NLRB is getting a $25 million increase--an unprecedented increase--over 10 percent. There has been no justification offered for this increase. The caseload has consistently declined over the decade. 
   Now, the appropriations committee has provided an increase for the community health centers of $99.3 million. This is badly needed, comparison with the NLRB notwithstanding. 
   The additional funds provided by the Hutchinson amendment would permit health centers to serve 83,000 more people. That is the most important point, to me. 
   Mr. President, let's compare: $25 million for 122 more federal employees and new computers versus health care for 83,000 Americans. This is a no brainer for me. 
   I hope it is for my colleagues as well. I urge Senators to support the Hutchinson amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, never in my years of service to the people of Utah and this country have I witnessed an administration more inclined to twist, deform, or ignore, the rule of law than the Clinton administration. The past 7 years are replete with exploits of legal manipulation. Indeed, the legacy of the administration may prove to be that its most significant exploits--infamous or otherwise--were accomplished by warping the law for blatant political purposes. Here are just a few of the most notorious examples: Attorney General Reno both misapplied and ignored the Independent Counsel Act in order to prevent the appointment of an independent counsel in the campaign finance investigation; the 1996 election fundraising scandal where soft money prohibitions were ignored and foreign donations were illegally and eagerly accepted; fundraising from the White House--it was deplorable the Escalante Proclamation, where a huge chunk of Southern Utah was effectively annexed by the Federal government without any prior consultation with Utah officials, to my knowledge--certainly not any elected officials; the misuse of FBI files by the White House--the myriad proclamations of Executive Orders as a vehicle to skirt the authority of Congress; and just to mention one more, the violation of the Vacancies Act to hold in office individuals lacking Senate confirmation. 
   This list does not even include the myriad events, dissemblance, and contempt for the law and our courts, which brought us the impeachment. 
   Given this record, I must confess that I wasn't shocked to learn that the Department of Justice may have misled Congress in sworn testimony and then filed suit against the tobacco industry. 
   Last Wednesday, the Department of Justice filed in Federal district court a multibillion dollar suit against the tobacco industry seeking recoupment of losses to Federal health care programs. 
   After reviewing the 131-page complaint, I have serious reservations concerning several key counts in the complaint. Moreover, I am skeptical of the entire lawsuit. 
   It is well known around here that I am no friend of tobacco use, nor an apologist for the tobacco industry. Indeed, I have never used tobacco products in my life and am opposed to tobacco use. I never inhaled or chewed tobacco. 
   Along with my cosponsor, Senator FEINSTEIN, I worked hard last Congress to pass legislation that would have gone a long way in helping Americans to kick the habit and in reducing teen smoking. The legislation required the tobacco companies to pay over $400 billion to settle existing lawsuits--$429 billion, to be more accurate. In return for the settlement of these lawsuits, the companies would have stopped targeting children and would have funded smoking cessation efforts. 
   While this measure has yet to pass, I strongly believe that the fairest and most effective solution to the use of tobacco is omnibus legislation such as the Hatch-Feinstein bill rather than relying upon legally dubious lawsuits. Litigation cannot effectively deal with important public policy problems, such as what measures the industry must take to reduce youth smoking or what effect will rising prices have on the black market for cigarettes. 
   Given my skepticism about the administration's fidelity to the rule of law, I have several questions concerning the Federal lawsuit. The first question I have is, What is the administration's motivation here? It has been reported that many attorneys at the Department of Justice opposed filing of a lawsuit because the Federal Government did not possess a valid cause of action or claim against the tobacco companies. 
   Indeed, Attorney General Reno, at the April 30, 1997, hearing before the Judiciary Committee, testified that no Federal cause of action existed for both Federal Medicare and Medicaid claims. I disagree with the assertion made by David Ogden, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division and the current nominee for that post, that Attorney General Reno was referring only to State actions. Ms. Reno's contention that no Federal cause of action existed was made clearly in response to a question by Senator KENNEDY, who asked whether the Federal Government could recoup both Medicare and Medicaid payments. 
   It was only after President Clinton, in his State of the Union Address in January, called for a suit against the tobacco industry that the Department of Justice changed its tune and, presto, announced that a legitimate cause of action may exist. 
   I have been criticized in the past for saying that the politically minded and partisan White House, and not the Attorney General, is in reality running the Department of Justice. In the case of the Federal tobacco litigation, it appears once more that the White House is directing the activities of the Department of Justice for political ends. This lawsuit is a horrible precedent that, if it continues, will erode the liberty of the American people. Here again, the rule of law is apparently being replaced by the rule of the politically correct and expedient. 
   I urge my colleagues to read the fine story appearing in last Friday's Wall Street Journal entitled ``Justice Reverses: Lobbying Effort Wins Turnabout On Tobacco Suit.''  
   This story chronicled the change in the Department's position concerning the viability of the Federal tobacco suit. The story demonstrated that the Department's attorneys were skeptical about a Federal lawsuit. It also established that the Department brought suit only after pressure from the White House and outside lobbyists, who apparently were paid by an outside consultant for their efforts to help convince the Department to change its viewpoints.

   Mr. HATCH. Another question I have is, Why wasn't Congress consulted? Months prior to the filing of the lawsuit, I had been attempting to ascertain on what legal theories the Department may base a lawsuit against the tobacco companies, but the Department has refused to share the information, even though the Department has asked for an additional $20 million to finance the suit. I assured them that the American people and the Congress will want to know what they are paying for. Congress is not in the habit of writing blank checks, and, in the absence of a straight answer, Congress appropriately refused the additional monies. 
   Notwithstanding the clear position of Congress, I learned of the filing of the suit from the newspapers. This is particularly galling since the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division and the nominee for that office, David Ogden, in written responses dated September 2 to my questions concerning the possible suit against the tobacco industry, wrote that the Department had not even decided whether to file the suit or on what legal theories to pursue any projected litigation. He stated at that time:  
   The Department is currently in active preparation for this litigation, and we are in the process of making decisions on whether it will be filed and, if so, based on what legal theories.  
   Now, less than 3 weeks later, the full-fledged suit has been filed.  
   I have yet another question. Does the Department of Justice have any chance of prevailing on the merits? The Department seeks to ``recoup'' the cost of medical care for treatment of tobacco-related illnesses for those on Medicaid, but the injury claimed by the Federal Government may be questionable. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service recently issued a study which concluded that tobacco use imposes no net cost to the Federal Government. Indeed, the Federal Government receives approximately $6 billion a year in tobacco tax revenue. Moreover, it is simply absurd for the Government to seek recoupment when it has been a vigorous partner with the tobacco industry in promoting tobacco use. 
   From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, the Federal Government worked hand in hand with the tobacco industry to develop so-called ``safe'' cigarettes. Until 1974, the Government provided free cigarettes in C rations to servicemen. 
   Furthermore, cigarettes continue to be sold at substantially discounted rates at military post exchanges. In 1997, the Department of Veterans Affairs blocked claims by veterans for tobacco-related illnesses, contending that these individuals should not be covered because they were responsible for their individual choices and the health problems that resulted from those choices. 
   Of course, the Federal Government yearly subsidizes tobacco growing. Perhaps the public interest groups should sue the Federal Government, which authorized and fostered the growing of tobacco and the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. Could one not argue that the Government was at least a joint tort-feasor under these circumstances? Furthermore, it is preposterous for the Federal Government now to claim that it did not know of the risks of tobacco use. 
   Since 1964, the Government has issued Surgeon General reports that warned consumers of the dangers of tobacco use. Since 1966, the Government has required warning labels on 
   cigarette packs. Indeed, everybody not on Mars for the past few decades has known that using tobacco can be harmful. 
   Besides this hypocrisy and the difficulty in seeing how the Federal Government has been harmed, I question the veracity of at least two main counts of the complaint. These involve alleged violations of the Medical Care Recovery Act, known as MCRA, and the Medical Secondary Payer Provisions, or MSP. The Department of Justice contends that these two statutes create an independent cause of action for the Federal Government to recover Medicaid benefits for tobacco-related illnesses. 
   Let me point out that the U.S. Supreme Court, in U.S. v. Standard Oil, in 1947, held that, in the absence of a statute, the Federal Government does not possess the independent right of action to recover the medical costs of servicemen. It was in response to Standard Oil that Congress passed the MCRA in 1962 and MSP in 1984. But these changes to Federal law were limited and discrete in scope. 
   For instance, MCRA allows the Federal Government to independently sue to recover the cost of medical treatment given to military service personnel, veterans suffering from disabilities unrelated to service, and other government workers who received medical help but were injured by negligent third parties. It does not apply to all Medicaid patients nor does it appear to allow the aggregation of all the individual claims in one massive lawsuit, which is what the Department of Justice has done here. Besides aggregating such claims, liability could be proven only through statistics, but I believe a trial based on statistics would be unconstitutional. 
   Furthermore, MSP allows only for suits against insurance companies providing liability insurance to tort-feasors, but not against the tort-feasors themselves. The MSP cause of action does not apply because the tobacco companies are in no way acting as insurers of their products. 
   I am still studying the other causes-of-action sounding in violations of the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization law, better known as RICO, and State civil fraud statutes. But as a preliminary matter, I have serious doubts about their legal viability. RICO, for instance, was enacted to deal with organized crime syndicates. Here we are talking about a legal product, a product that has not only been approved by the Federal Government but which has been subsidized by the Federal Government. RICO does not apply to lawful activities, such as the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, no matter how obnoxious those products may be. 
   For RICO and the State consumer statutes to apply here, the Department must demonstrate that the tobacco industry criminally and fraudulently marketed and sold their products. This is a difficult task that in almost every case has not been successful in a court of law because the harmful effects of tobacco products were well known. Indeed, the day the Department filed a civil suit, it announced that it was terminating the criminal investigation of the tobacco companies and tobacco executives for lack of viable evidence. 
   I believe these counts of the complaint were added to force the tobacco companies to settle. A successful RICO suit would force the tobacco companies to disgorge all their so-called illegal profits of hundreds of billions of dollars. This would bankrupt the tobacco industry. The Clinton White House is gambling that the tobacco companies will settle and not take the risk of corporate capital punishment in prohibition of all tobacco use. When all is said and done, it would seem that legislation is what is truly needed for a direct recovery suit against the tobacco companies. In short, it seems that this suit lacks merit. 
   This is not like the State suits against the tobacco companies. I supported the June 20, 1997, global settlement of those suits and conducted a half dozen or so hearings in an attempt to have Congress set a national tobacco policy. The difference is that the Federal suit appears to have no legal basis. 
   Let me ask rhetorical questions: What is the big deal? Why should anybody care about another suit filed against the big, bad tobacco companies? 
   I will tell you why. It is for the reasons I stated in this speech. No administration should be able to circumvent the Constitution and Congress' sole authority to raise and spend revenue for the general welfare by suing for billions of dollars and then spending the money without congressional appropriation. If there is no legitimate lawsuit, the action by the Department of Justice would violate separation of powers. That doctrine is a cornerstone of our Constitution's guarantee of liberty. Simply put, litigation should not replace legislation as the means to effect public policy in a democracy. 
   Granting the Federal Government the unfettered ability to sue any industry which happens to fall into disfavor in order to effectuate a social goal such as reduction in tobacco-related illnesses is a mistake. It would, in essence, allow the executive branch to bypass Congress and the law and set unilaterally our Nation's tobacco policy. 
   The way to solve the youth tobacco problem and other social problems is for Congress to legislate in an orderly and coherent manner. Litigation will produce ad hoc and incoherent results. Litigation cannot determine, for instance, whether the FDA should regulate tobacco. 
   There is a disturbing trend in misusing the litigation system for what appears to be social ends. Besides tobacco, Government-sponsored lawsuits have been filed against gun manufacturers and paint manufacturers. It was reported that suits are being considered to be filed against automobile manufacturers, the alcoholic beverage industry, manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Internet providers, the entertainment industry, the dairy industry, and even fast food restaurants are being discussed as potential targets. 
   Boy, it looks as if the trial lawyers of America got control of the Justice Department. They certainly have control of this administration and its projected successors in either AL GORE or Bill Bradley. Let me quote the distinguished legal scholar and former jurist, Robert Bork, who cogently discerned, in an article entitled ``Tobacco Suit is the Latest Abuse of the Rule of Law,'' published in a September 23 edition of the Wall Street Journal:  
   The Justice Department's complaint is only the most recent, and it will be by no  means the last, effort to use litigation to bludgeon private firms in order to accommodate a prohibition that government could not muster the political support to legislate. Gun manufacturers are beginning to face the same problem. Why not sue oil companies, whose gasoline leads to traffic deaths, or fast-food chains, whose products contribute to heart disease? 
   The only difference is political. If the product is sufficiently unpopular with the politically correct, massive public propaganda efforts will ultimately make lawsuits possible....... 
   Law has been warped for political purposes repeatedly, and never more so than in this Administration. Is there no judge who shall call this case what it is--an intellectual sham and a misuse of the courts to accomplish through litigation what cannot be won through legislation?

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today's tobacco lawsuit may be tomorrow's beef or dairy industry lawsuit. That is why about 100 trade associations, private business companies, policy organizations, as well as several Governors, have voiced their opposition to this Federal tobacco suit. They understand, as do I, that big government can be as harmful as big tobacco.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if we are going to solve this problem of tobacco, we need to face the music in Congress. We need to pass legislation that will solve it. One reason why the Hatch-Feinstein legislation would have worked is because we believe as high as it was, at $429 billion, the tobacco companies reluctantly would have had to agree with it. Therefore, we could have imposed the free speech articles on them that would have prohibited them from advertising, while at the same time causing them to have to advertise in a way that would help our youth to understand the evils of tobacco. That, we believed, should be done. I still believe that should be done. It was so fouled up in the last Congress that we were unable to get that done. 
   So I am concerned about the misuse of the law, to be able to punish any industry that whoever is presiding in the Federal Government decides they are against. I think it is a travesty of justice, and even though I don't like tobacco and I have never used the products, and even though I think something certainly needs to be done in this area, you don't do it by abusing the process of law, which I think this administration has repeatedly done, time after time after time. I think, as history views what has gone on in this administration, it is going to have to come to the conclusion that this is an administration that has not been dedicated to the rule of law, while it has been triumphantly pushing the rule of law upon other nations, hoping they could have something like we have in this country. 
   The fact of the matter is, it is hypocrisy, pure and simple. I am very concerned that if we allow our Justice Department to continue to act in this fashion, we are going to reap the whirlwind in this country and there will be no business that would be safe from the all mighty power of the Federal Government. There is one thing worse than big tobacco and that is an unrestrained big government. That is what this lawsuit is all about. It is a voracious desire to get money in an industry that should be gotten, but in a reasonably legal way, basically through legislation. 
   I hope everybody will look at this lawsuit for what it is. I hope the courts will dismiss it so we can get about legislating and doing what we should to resolve the problems about tobacco use and misuse in our country. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on June 9, 1999, Judge Giles S. Rich passed away at age 95, still serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after nearly 43 years as a Federal judge and as the oldest active Federal judge in U.S. history. Today, the Federal court will hold a memorial service in his honor. I rise today to add my voice to those of the participants in that memorial service in paying tribute to this man who contributed as much, if not more, than anyone else in this century to the development of U.S. patent policy and the promotion of American innovation. 
   Judge Rich was heard to say, ``You see, as I go along, practically everything I did was what I didn't intend to do.'' I believe that statement to be true in large part because Judge Rich was a man who didn't follow success, but was instead followed by success. Bright people and prestigious positions were drawn to him because of who he was. 
   Judge Rich was educated at Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1926. He went on to receive his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1929. Since Columbia University didn't have any patent law classes, Judge Rich decided to teach himself patent law, through an arrangement with a professor that allowed him to receive credit for a thorough and lengthy paper on patents. He in turn shared his knowledge and intellect with students as a lecturer on patent law at Columbia University from 1942 until 1956, as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center from 1963 to 1969, and as a lecturer on patent and copyright law as part of the Federal Judicial Center's training program for newly appointed judges from the program's inception in 1965 until 1971. 
   As a dedicated lawyer, professor, and judge, Judge Rich played a significant role in the development and evolution of intellectual property law in the United States. He practiced law in a private practice from 1929 to 1956, specializing in patent and trademark law. He became a member of the New York Bar in 1929 and was certified by the U.S. Patent Office in 1934. As a member  of a two-man drafting committee, he was one of the two people principally responsible for drafting the 1952 Patent Act, which served as the first codification of all our nations' federal patent laws and which has served this country well for half a decade without significant revision. In 1992, Judge Rich earned special recognition from President Bush for his contributions to the patent code of our nation's patent system. 
   Judge Rich served in private practice until 1956, when President Eisenhower appointed him as an associate judge for the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA). Then, in 1982, he was appointed as a Circuit Judge for the CCPA's successor court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which holds exclusive jurisdiction for patent appeals. From his seat on the Federal Circuit, Judge Rich authored landmark decisions clarifying some of the most difficult concepts in patent law, including decisions that have been hailed as laying the foundation for the modern biotechnology industry and important cases dealing with the complex area of software and computer-related inventions. 
   Judge Rich was the distinguished recipient of a host of awards during his career, ranging from the Jefferson Medal of New Jersey Patent Law Association in 1955 to the Oldest Active Judge in U.S. History Recognized by Chief Justices in 1997. He was the inaugural recipient of the Pesquale J. Federico Memorial Award for outstanding service to the patent and trademark systems, awarded by the Patent and Trademark Office Society. He was awarded the Charles F. Kettering Award and Distinguished Government Service Award from the George Washington University. He was awarded the Harlan Fisk Stone Medal from Columbia University. There is a law school moot court competition sponsored by the American Intellectual Property Law Association--now in its 28th year--named in his honor. There is even an Inn of Court named in his honor. He has been awarded recognition from intellectual property law associations in cities across the country and, in 1997, was awarded the Centennial Visionary Award by the American Intellectual Property Law Association upon the commemoration of its 100th anniversary. He holds honorary Doctor of Law degrees from the George Washington University, John Marshall Law School, and George Mason University School of Law. And these are but a few of the many accolades Judge Rich has received throughout life. 
   As with all judges, many of those who followed Judge Rich's decisions admired and agreed with his legal theories, while others disagreed. But all respected his intelligence, strength, and ambition. He wrote in the history of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals that ``[c]ourts are people and little else. Law evolves from their manners of thinking at particular times and from the interactions of people thinking.'' Judge Giles S. Rich, as a person, helped transform our federal courts. He contributed to a body of statutory and judicial precedent that is unparalleled throughout much of our nation's history. Chief Judge Archer said of Judge Rich in 1994 that Judge Rich was ``open-minded, flexible and respectful of the views of his colleagues. He [brought] to the art of judging the temperament and knowledge that are rarely equaled. It sets a high standard for all of us.'' And as John Reilly stated in eulogizing Judge Rich, he was ``a quiet jurist and gentle man who by his tireless scholarship and faithful devotion to the patent law, turned our American century into an inventive, productive powerhouse, to the benefit of us all.'' 
   Judge Rich began his career as an intellectual property law practitioner and scholar at a time when radio broadcasts were the latest emerging technology, yet he lived to set much of the patent policy that formed the foundation for the digital revolution. For these contributions to American jurisprudence and our patent system, his presence will always be remembered by legislators, lawyers, and judges who reflect on the law that was made by the feisty judge that wasn't going to stop hearing cases until something forced him to do so. 
   Judge Rich, at one time, told an attentive audience of a verse his mother would recite, ``The wise old owl lie in an oak. The more he saw, the less he spoke; the less the spoke the more he heard. Why can't we be more like that old bird?'' The intellectual property community and all of us can learn a great deal from the ``old bird,'' Judge Rich. John Witherspoon, one of Judge Rich's former law clerks, once said that, ``Giles Rich is a Master teacher--by which I mean, he doesn't teach at all; those around him simply learn.'' 
   Many will miss his presence and the experiences it brought. I send my condolences out to his family, and my gratitude to the man who worked so hard to contribute to American jurisprudence and the preservation of America's status as a nation of inventors.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI on this appropriations bill. I know that this has been a very difficult process, and I appreciate their efforts. 
   I would like to bring to the attention of the United States Senate a situation that is of great concern to me: long-term care for our veterans. In my state of Utah, we have a nursing home that is owned and operated by the State of Utah. This nursing home was certified by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and received monthly per diem payments, which comprise nearly half of the nursing home's budget. 
   Although the nursing home was certified in January, it did not see a single per diem payment from the Department of Veterans' Affairs until June. The payment for February and March also arrived in June; payment for April and May came in late June. The June payment was supposedly sent by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but it still has not been received. Payment of per diem for July and August was received in September. 
   I understand that other veterans homes around the country have similarly suffered from delayed and sporadic per diem payments. 
   To me, this is a fairly clear picture that the administration of per diem payments needs to be improved. I cannot believe that each and every payment for nine months is being deliberately held up because the veterans home is guilty of some unnamed compliance problem. In fact, the VA itself has advised me that this is not the case at least with respect to the Utah veterans home.  
   Let me be clear that I do not intend that deficient veterans homes are let off the hook. We expect accountability. I urge the VA not only to enforce applicable standards, but also to assist state veterans homes to meet these standards for care of our veterans. 
   But, I hope that the VA will give attention to designing a better system of payments so that state veterans homes can more effectively manage their resources and, therefore, provide better and more consistent care for our veterans.

   Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. The VA should certify homes as it has always done. Homes that are seriously deficient should be decertified. Technical assistance should be offered to homes having difficulty. 
   But, I would hope that proper quality control by the VA could be done in such a way so as not to unnecessarily disrupt the flow of payments to the home. Does the distinguished Senator from Missouri agree that a state veterans home cannot be effectively managed if the federal funds that are promised come in a haphazard manner? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-hatch-ut-3-19990924</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Yes. I agree that withholding per diem can be an appropriate action if the VA has previously notified the state veterans home that there are specific problems. The homes should have an opportunity to correct those problems so as not to miss a scheduled payment. 
   I also believe that if a state veterans home is recalcitrant in making improvements where necessary, either for substantive patient care or for administrative purposes, the VA should decertify the home. If violations are serious enough to withhold payments for a prolonged period of time, they are serious enough to warrant decertification. 
   I hope, however, that my colleagues will agree that state veterans homes cannot be effectively managed if the federal government is so unreliable in making these per diem payments. In the absence of any substantive quality issues, state veterans homes should be able to expect prompt payment. It is a promise we have made, and it is necessary that we keep it to maintain consistent and high quality of care for our veterans. That, I believe, is the goal we all share. 
   Mr. President, in deference to the members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I will not offer my amendment to require the Veterans' Administration to pay the per diem it owes to fully certified state veterans homes. 
   However, I want the record to show that this amendment is cosponsored by Senator CRAPO, Senator SNOWE, Senator COLLINS, and Senator CRAIG. It has the support of the National Association of State Veterans Homes and the American Legion. 
   Mr. President, for too long, state veterans homes have been getting that age-old promise from the federal government that the check is in the mail. 
   In my home state of Utah, the Utah State Veterans Nursing Home has experienced tremendous difficulties in receiving per diem payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Utah veterans home was certified in January 1999. But it did not see a single payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs until June 1999--six months. 
   Now, I ask my colleagues: what business can go without payment for six months without having to cut corners or stiff its own creditors? How are these veterans homes supposed to provide quality care if they do not know from month to month what their operating budget will be? How are they going to pay their personnel, their food service providers, linen services, and so on. How are they going to pay for routine repairs on the plant? The VA simply has to find a way to get these payments out on time. 
   In Utah's situation, the per diem payment for April and May came in late June. The payment for June still has not been received. The July and August payments were received in September. 
   Let me be clear about this point. The Department of Veterans Affairs was not withholding those funds because of quality of care or compliance problems in the Utah veterans' nursing home or because of the lack of funds. 
   On the contrary, the VA was forthright in saying that the paperwork got lost on somebody's desk. Now, I can understand that, and I certainly want to say that I appreciate getting an honest explanation for this. I have lost things, and I am sure all Senators have lost things from time to time. 
   My problem, however, is that this clearly was not a one-time occurrence. These late payments have become the rule not the exception, and the Utah veterans home has not been the only victim. I understand that veterans nursing homes all over the country have had to suffer these late per diem payments and that veterans homes in Oregon and Maine, for example, have had similar difficulties. As a veterans nursing home operator in Maine put it, ``It is something that we have learned to live with.'' 
   Mr. President, maintaining a quality nursing care 
   facility is a difficult enough job as it is without the federal government imposing the additional burden of not getting the funds out to these state veterans homes on time. 
   Our veterans homes should not have to ``learn to live with it.'' If the federal government has taken on this responsibility, then it needs to deliver. If the VA cannot fulfill this obligation under existing law, then it should report to the Veterans' Affairs Committees of the Senate and House and seek assistance to do so. 
   These state veterans homes are simply too critical a component in our effort to care for America's elderly veterans. By giving these state veterans homes short shrift, we give our veterans short shrift. I know that this is not what the VA intends. 
   It has been argued that the VA needs the authority to withhold per diem payments as leverage for corrective action taken by homes that may have compliance problems. 
   Mr. President, I absolutely agree that the VA should enforce the applicable quality standards for these veterans homes. I modified my amendment to address this concern. Deficiencies that affect patient care and safety should be promptly corrected, and my amendment allows the VA to withhold per diem payments is such deficiencies have been identified and the home is notified about them in writing prior to the due date of the expected payment. This would provide the home the opportunity to act on the deficiencies so as not to miss a payment. 
   Additionally, I believe that serious and ongoing deficiencies warrant decertification. No state veterans home that is not certified should receive payments. 
   But, Mr. President, neither we here in the Senate, nor the VA, should forget that the effective management of these veterans facilities needs reliable funding. We cannot expect the best quality of care for our veterans if the state veterans home is receiving only sporadic per diem payments. The haphazard manner in which the VA has made per diem payments has itself become a cause for concern about quality in these homes. 
   I trust that the VA, given the impetus of this amendment, will take steps to improve this payment process and get the per diem payments out on time. 
   Moreover, I urge my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs' Committee to take a serious look at this issue.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Senator NICKLES, and Senators BREAUX, GRASSLEY, MURKOWSKI, and BAYH in introducing this legislation. 
   While we all recognize that medical technologies and treatments are improving the lives of millions of Americans daily, gaining access to these innovations is becoming more difficult. Each day, new implantable medical devices are correcting or repairing failing organ systems in patients. People are receiving new tests that permit the diagnosis of diseases in their earliest stages without the use of surgery or other more complicated procedures.  Tens of thousands of individuals owe their lives to small, powerful miniature devices that monitor and regulate vital physiological functions and allow patients to live more productive lives. 
   The latest advances in pharmaceutical and biologics are not only extending the length of life, but significantly improving the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people. Lifesaving and life-enhancing innovations must be available to all Americans, and it is our duty to ensure that those patients who need them most, America's nearly 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, have access to them. 
   As part of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, we authorized the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to adjust periodically Medicare's coverage and payment systems to account for changes in technology, treatment, and medical care. Unfortunately, without Congressional input, there is no guarantee that these expedited procedures will take place. 
   The Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act of 1999 has arisen out of growing evidence that without intervention, Medicare beneficiaries will be denied access to the most modernized treatments and innovations in health care. 
   After medical technologies, devices, and drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they still must meet several critical HCFA requirements before they are available to Medicare beneficiaries. 
   First, before technologies are approved by HCFA for reimbursement, they must be covered, that is fulfill the definitions of ``reasonable and necessary.'' Second, they must have an identifying procedure code. New device technologies receive this ``procedure code,'' a four or five digit identification number that allows health care providers to submit claims to payers. Finally, the technologies must be reimbursed through one of Medicare's payment systems. The 
    problems arise because each of these levels is plagued by inefficiency, coding delays, and lack of data usage by HCFA. 
   My legislation addresses these concerns in five specific ways. 
   First, Medicare payment levels and payment categories will be adjusted at least annually to reflect changes in medical practice and technology. A recent Institute of Medicine study reported that most medical technologies have an average life span of 18 months with many modernizations occurring rapidly. These innovations must, therefore, be rapidly processed so that they are accessible to beneficiaries. While BBA 97 authorized HCFA to adjust payment systems ``periodically'' to account for changes in technology, there is little promise that this will occur in a systematic, timely and beneficial manner. 
   My bill requires HCFA to review and revise payment categories and payment levels for all prospective payment systems (PPS) at least annually. These prospective payment systems include hospital inpatient and outpatient, physicians, ambulatory surgery facility services. It also calls for public input on the review process. 
   Second, this legislation mandates that valid external sources of information be used to update payment categories if Medicare's data are limited in scope or, are not yet available. Traditionally, HCFA has only used its own data set, known as the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) data systems, to evaluate a given technology before assigning an appropriate code. The average waiting period for the assignment of a new code is 18 months or longer. 
   Furthermore, HCFA refuses to consider partial year or externally generated data in its decision-making processes. My bill directs HCFA to use external sources of data on the cost, charges and use of medical technologies. This language allows HCFA to utilize high quality data from private insurers, manufacturers, suppliers, providers, and other sources. 
   Third, my legislation will require that national procedure codes are updated more frequently to reduce delays in accessing new technologies. Currently, new products must have an identification code before they are eligible for appropriate reimbursement by Medicare. Assigning this code can take 18 months or longer because of the way HCFA has structured its calendar year. 
   This legislation allows HCFA to accept applications quarterly, on a rolling basis, thereby allowing the processing of new technologies throughout the year instead of bundling them at one annual submission. 
   Furthermore, the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act will eliminate the HCFA requirement that new products be on the market for six months before they are eligible for a new code. This provision will ensure that new technologies are brought to Medicare beneficiaries more rapidly. 
   Fourth, the bill guarantees that local procedure codes for medical technologies will continue to be used. HCFA has proposed to eliminate Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level III Local Codes beginning in 2000 and replace it with the Level II National Codes. This is potentially detrimental to new technologies that are often introduced into local, smaller health care systems before they are expanded into nationwide markets. Without the Level III Local Codes, new technologies must be placed into a ``miscellaneous'' code that is often rejected by payers thereby denying access of the technology to beneficiaries. The maintenance of the current system will ensure that technologies will be encoded at the earliest possible date and processed before moving to the national level. 
   Finally, the legislation authorizes HCFA to create an Advisory Committee on Medicare Coding and Payment. As a result, when HCFA has to make coding and payment decisions, it will be prompt, permit public participation, and will guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to the highest quality products and services. The panel would ensure that safe medical technologies are approved, covered, coded and paid by Medicare as expeditiously as possible. 
   In addition to the above authorizations, the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act proposes several refinements to the Administration's proposed outpatient prospective payment system (PPS). The legislation affects three changes to HCFA's implementation of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. 
   The first change mandates HCFA to restructure the proposed ambulatory payment classification (APC) system to create groups of procedures that are more similar in cost and most closely related clinically. The current HCFA proposal would create unusual financial incentives that would clearly discourage the use of the most appropriate, cutting-edge technology. Furthermore by grouping very disparate technologies, hospitals will face serious underpayments for certain procedures. I believe that illogical categorization creates disincentives to use newer, but more expensive products and procedures that provide far superior patient care. 
   The second change mandates that HCFA retain the current cost-based system for another four years to compile the cost studies and use data and conduct the analysis necessary to classify them in the appropriate APC. The development of these data sets are mandatory and without proper clarification. Therefore, these products could receive substantial underpayment, and, as a result, patient access to newer procedures and products could be limited. 
   Third, the implantable medical technologies should be reimbursed under the new APCs along with other similar medical technologies. They should not be reimbursed through the durable medical technology fee schedule. By placing the implantables within the DME propective payment system, the fee schedule will lock implantables into defined categories that will limit their use and inhibit their access to seniors. By placing them into the proposed APCs with the other medical devices, they will be treated as other new, innovative medical technologies. 
   Again, I am pleased to be joined by my Senate colleagues, Senators NICKLES, BREAUX, GRASSLEY, MURKOWSKI, and BAYH, in introducing this important piece of legislation. This bill supports both our Medicare beneficiaries and our technology, pharmaceutical, and biotechnical industries by continuing to promote life-enhancing innovations. I firmly believe that these significant improvements to our Medicare coding and payment systems will increase the access to modern medical innovation to Americans who need them most, our senior citizens.  
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this bill is a bipartisan bill, drafted jointly by Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI. This legislation has been developed in a fair and inclusive manner. 
   The reforms proposed in this bill have been carefully studied and have been deliberated upon at length. Indeed, Congress has been engaged in the consideration of this issue now for several years. The National Bankruptcy Review Commission spent two years comprehensively examining the bankruptcy system. The findings and opinions of the Commission, which were reported to Congress, have proved helpful in identifying the problems in the bankruptcy system and in finding appropriate solutions. 
   Furthermore, the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which is chaired by Senator GRASSLEY, has held numerous hearings on the issue of bankruptcy reform. The subcommittee heard extensive testimony on the subject from dozens of witnesses. Again, I would like to thank Senators GRASSLEY and TORRICELLI for their leadership in this important consumer bankruptcy reform, and also last session's ranking member of the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, Senator DURBIN, along with other members of the Senate, for their hard work on this issue. 
   Throughout the process of consideration of this bill, at both the subcommittee and full committee level, changes suggested by the minority were included in the bill. During this entire process, I have expressed my willingness to work to address any remaining concerns the minority has about the bill. It is apparent, however, that efforts are underway to defeat this important legislation by attaching irrelevant, extraneous ``political agenda'' items to it, such as minimum wage, guns, abortion and tobacco, to name a few. 
   I am open to full debate on relevant issues. Nevertheless, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to tie up consideration of this bill for what appears to be political points. 
   Despite the efforts of those in opposition, I remain hopeful and optimistic that we will be able to pass legislation this year that provides meaningful and much-needed reform to the bankruptcy system. 
   The House of Representatives passed a much more stringent bankruptcy reform bill by an overwhelming bipartisan majority earlier this spring. The time has come for us to rise above politics and to do what is right for the American people. It is time for meaningful and fair bankruptcy reform. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we may consider the substance of this important legislation and make our bankruptcy system better for all Americans. 
   The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 closes many of the loopholes in our bankruptcy system that allow unscrupulous individuals to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool rather than as a last resort. 
   Despite the White House's statement of opposition to the House's bankruptcy reform bill, H.R. 833, the House of Representatives realized that the time has come to restore personal responsibility to our nation's bankruptcy system. House Democrats and Republicans alike recognized that if we do not take the opportunity to reform our broken system, every family in my own State of Utah and throughout the country, many of whom struggle to 
   make ends meet, will continue to bear the financial burden of those who take advantage of the system. As a result, the House bill passed by an overwhelming margin of 313 to 108. Half of the House Democratic Caucus joined with every House Republican to support the bill. And notably, the House bankruptcy reform bill is more stringent in its reforms than the Senate bill before us today. 
   More than three decades ago, the late Albert Gore, Sr., then a Senator, commented on the moral consequences of a lax bankruptcy system. He said:  
   I realize that we cannot legislate morals, but we, as responsible legislators, must bear the responsibility of writing laws which discourage immorality and encourage morality; which encourage honesty and discourage deadbeating; which make the path of the social malingerer and shirker sufficiently unpleasant to persuade him at least to investigate the way of the honest man. (Cong. Rec. 905, January 19, 1965.)  
   I too believe that the complete forgiveness of debt should be reserved for those who truly cannot repay their debts. S. 625 provides us with the opportunity to prevent people who can repay their debts from ``gaming the system'' by using loopholes that are presently in place. 
   Mr. President, S. 625 provides a needs-based means test approach to bankruptcy, under which debtors who can repay some of their debts are required to do so. It contains new measures to protect against fraud in bankruptcy, such as a requirement that debtors supply income tax returns and pay stubs, audits of bankruptcy cases, and limits on repeat bankruptcy filings. It eliminates a number of loopholes, such as the one that allows debtors to transfer their interest in real property to others who then file for bankruptcy relief and invoke the automatic stay. And, the bill puts some controls on the ability of debtors to get large cash advances on their credit cards and to buy luxury goods on the eve of filing for bankruptcy. 
   At the same time, the Senate bill provides many unprecedented new consumer protections. It imposes penalties upon creditors who refuse to negotiate in good faith with debtors prior to declaring bankruptcy. Also, it imposes penalties on creditors who willfully fail to properly credit payments made by the debtor in a chapter 13 plan, and for creditors who threaten to file motions in order to coerce a reaffirmation without justification. Moreover, the bill imposes new measures to discourage abusive reaffirmation practices. 
   Mr. President, S. 625 addresses the problem of bankruptcy mills, firms that aggressively promote bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, and often end up hurting unwitting debtors by putting them in bankruptcy when it may not be in their best interest. The bill also imposes penalties on bankruptcy petition preparers who mislead debtors. 
   Importantly, the bill makes major strides in trying to break the cycle of indebtedness. It educates debtors with  regard to the alternatives available to them, sets up a financial management education pilot program for debtors, and requires credit counseling for debtors. I must commend Senator SESSIONS for his leadership on these important credit counseling provisions. 
   I am proud that the bill also makes extensive reform to the bankruptcy laws in order to protect our children. I have authored provisions of the bill to ensure that bankruptcy cannot be used by deadbeat dads to avoid paying child support and alimony obligation. Under my provisions, the obligation to pay child support and alimony is moved to a first priority status, as opposed to its current place at seventh in line, behind attorneys fees and other special interests. My measures also ensure the collection of child support and alimony payments by, among other things, exempting state child support collection authorities from the ``automatic stay'' that otherwise prevents collection of debts after a debtor files for bankruptcy, and by exempting from discharge virtually all obligations one ex-spouse owes another. A new amendment will make changes to a number of provisions in the bill to clarify that the provisions are not intended, directly or indirectly, to undermine the collection of child-support or alimony payments. 
   The bill includes a provision that I offered, which was accepted in the Judiciary Committee, which creates new legal protections for a large class of retirement savings in bankruptcy, a measure which is supported by groups ranging from the AARP, to the Small Business Council of America and the National Council on Teacher Retirement. 
   Rampant bankruptcy filings are a big problem. In 1998, 1.4 million Americans filed for bankruptcy. That was more Americans than graduated from college, were on active military duty, or worked in the post office. Indeed, more people filed for bankruptcy in 1998 than lived in the states of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, or Wyoming. 
   Last year, about $45 billion in consumer debt was erased in personal bankruptcies. Let me give this number some context. Forty-five billion dollars is enough to fund the entire U.S. Department of Transportation for a year. Losses of this magnitude are passed on the American families at an estimated cost--if we use low estimates--of $400 to every household in America every year. That $400 could buy every American family of four: five weeks worth of groceries, 20 tanks of unleaded gasoline, 10 pairs of shoes for the average grade-school child, 
    or more than a year's supply of disposable diapers. 
   Under current law, families who do not file for bankruptcy are unfairly having to subsidize those who do. Currently, our bankruptcy system is devoid of personal responsibility and is spiraling out of control. This is our opportunity to do something about it. 
   As noted scholars Todd Zewicky of George Mason Law School and James White of the University of Michigan Law School recently wrote:  
   Current law requires a case-by-case investigation that turns on little more than the personal predilections of the judge. This chaotic system mocks the rule of law, and has resulted in unfairness and inequality for debtors and creditors alike. The arbitrary nature of the process has also undermined public confidence in the fairness and efficiency of the consumer bankruptcy system.  
   I am proud to be proposing several enhancements to the bill that primarily are designed to protect consumers and further provide incentives for consumers to take personal responsibility in dealing with debt management. 
   In the area of domestic support, as I indicated earlier, Senator TORRICELLI and I intend to build upon the new legal protections we created, as part of the underlying bill, for ex-spouses and children who are owed child support and alimony payments. The changes will further strengthen the ability of ex-spouses and children to collect the payments they are owed, and will make changes to a number of existing provisions in the bill to clarify that they will not directly or indirectly undermine the collection of child support or alimony payments. 
   In the area of education, Senator DODD and I, along with Senator GREGG, have developed an amendment that will protect from creditors contributions made for education expenses to education IRAs and qualified state tuition savings programs. This is a significant protection for those who honestly put money away for the benefit of their children and grandchildren's educational expenses. The potential that education savings accounts will be abused in bankruptcy is addressed by the amendment's requirement that only contributions made more than a year prior to bankruptcy are protected. I believe that protecting educational savings accounts is particularly important because college savings accounts encourage families to save for college, thereby increasing access to higher education. Nationwide, there are more than a million educational savings accounts, meaning there are more than a million children who would benefit from this amendment. As much as I believe that the bankruptcy laws need to be reformed to prevent abuse and to ensure debtors take personal responsibility, the ability to use dedicated funds to pay the educational costs of children should not be jeopardized by the bankruptcy of their parents or grandparents. 
   I have also developed a debt counseling incentive provision, which builds on the credit counseling provisions currently in S..625. It removes any disincentive for debtors to use credit counseling services by prohibiting credit counseling services from reporting to credit reporting agencies that an individual has received debt management or credit counseling, and establishes a penalty for credit counseling services that do. Debt management education is vital to reducing the number of Americans who, because of poor financial planning skills, are forced to declare bankruptcy. Providing crediting counseling--instruction regarding personal financial management--to current and potential filers will help curb bankruptcy filing. 
   In addition, I intend to offer an amendment that is designed to curb fraud in filing. This amendment puts in place new procedures and provides new resources to enhance enforcement of bankruptcy fraud laws. It will require No. 1 that bankruptcy courts develop procedures for referring suspected fraud to the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office for investigation and prosecution and No. 2 that the Attorney General designate one assistant U.S. attorney and one FBI agent in each judicial district as having primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting fraud in bankruptcy. 
   I also plan to offer an amendment that will allow a victim of a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense or another party in interest to petition the bankruptcy court to dismiss a petition voluntarily filed by a debtor who was convicted of the crime of violence or drug trafficking offense. In order to protect women and children who may be owed payments by such a debtor, however, the amendment would still allow the bankruptcy petition to continue if the debtor can show that the filing of the petition is necessary to ensure his ability to meet domestic support obligations. Bankruptcy is not an entitlement--it is a process by which certain qualifying individuals with substantial debts may cancel their debts and obtain a ``fresh start.'' Under this amendment, violent criminals and drug traffickers--individuals who have chosen to engage in serious, criminal conduct--would be precluded from availing themselves of the benefits of bankruptcy protection. 
   Again, I thank Senator GRASSLEY, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, for his leadership and dedication to this effort, and look forward to working with him and the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator TORRICELLI, in passing this legislation. 
   Let's look at a couple of other charts. This one is done by Penn, Schoen and Bergland Associates, Inc.: 83 percent of the American people favor an income test in bankruptcy reform. Only 10 percent oppose it and 7 percent don't know. So we should have an income test in bankruptcy reform. 
   Americans agree that bankruptcy should be based on need. Ten percent believe an individual who files for bankruptcy should be able to wipe out all their debt regardless of their ability to repay that debt. Only 10 percent of our society believe that, and I am surprised that many people believe that. If somebody has the ability to pay a debt,  why should they stiff other people with their debts and why shouldn't they have to live up to paying off their debts? 
   Four percent refused to answer this. But 87 percent believe an individual who files for bankruptcy--all of this yellow--should be required to repay as much of their debt as they are able and then be allowed to wipe out the rest. 
   That makes sense. Otherwise, we have people who are using the bankruptcy laws as an estate planning device. We have people who every 5 years file for bankruptcy after running up all kinds of bills and enjoying the life of Riley during those intervening years. What we want to do is have people realize there are some disincentives for doing that and that they have to pay some of these bills themselves. 
   These particular charts show that the American people have their heads screwed on right, except for about 10 percent of them. If an individual has the ability to repay some of the debt, they ought to be able to and they ought to want to, they ought to do what is right, and 87 percent of the American people believe that is the case. Only 10 percent believe they should be able to wipe out any debts at any time by going into bankruptcy. 
   I hope we can get people to vote for cloture on this matter so we can proceed and so we will not have any further delay in passing what really will be one of the most important bills in this particular session of Congress.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I must begin by confessing my disappointment that the minority would refuse to avoid a filibuster of one of the nominees of its own administration, when the record of this Senate so dramatically proves the deference this Senate has shown to this administration's judicial nominees. But that is what has just happened this evening, and in the face of this blatant double standard by the minority, I will only say that I will continue to work in good faith to secure a vote on the merits on the President's nomination of Ted Stewart to be a Federal district court judge. 
   When I speak of the traditional deference the Senate has shown to the executive in matters of Federal judicial nominations, I believe I speak with considerable experience. Since the time I was first sworn into the Senate in 1977, I have participated in and witnessed the confirmation of 1,159 judges and Justices, and have voted in favor of almost all of them. 
   I have personally presided over the confirmation of 321 of President Clinton's judicial appointments. This accounts for almost a quarter of the entire Federal judiciary. And this session alone, I have held 4 judicial confirmation hearings, and reported 24 nominees out of committee. 
   This evening's cloture vote concerns me all the more because I had publicly stated, in response to some of my colleagues' concerns about moving forward with other judicial nominations, that we would hold another hearing in this month of September, yet another in October, and, if the Senate continued in session throughout November, that it had been my hope to hold yet another hearing during that time. 
   With these plans, we would have been on track to equal or exceed the historical average for first-session judicial confirmations by the Senate. And so I find it incredible that this distinguished body resorted to the unfounded criticism that we are not doing as much as we should to fill the ranks of the Federal judiciary. 
   And now, in light of today's vote on cloture, we shall have to reexamine the best way to move forward on judicial nominees so that we eliminate the double standard that has been applied tonight. 
   To take a step back, and apply some perspective to the matter at hand, I want to emphasize that I have made every effort to promote a fair nominations process, recognizing the defference a President is traditionally accorded in nominating judges akin to his political philosophy. I have done as much notwithstanding the sometime heated criticism of interest groups opposed to President Clinton's nominations. 
   Even nominees attacked by interest groups as liberal and controversial have received my support in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor. In fact, since I have been chairman, I have never voted against any of the 31 Clinton judicial nominations for whom there has been a roll call vote. I have supported these nominees not because I agreed with their philosophies, but because I have always believed that the judicial 
   nominations process should be as free from politics as possible. 
   But let me offer some specifics. I have supported getting out of committee controversial nominees such as Judge William Fletcher, Judge Richard Paez, Judge Lynn Adelman, and Marsha Berzon, even though I would not have nominated them had I been President. Rather, so long as a nominee is qualified and capable of serving with integrity in a position, and I have his/her assurance that they will follow precedent, I believe they deserve to be confirmed. 
   Judge Fletcher, Judge Paez, and Ms. Berzon were opposed by a number of conservative organizations; yet, I supported their report by the committee to the floor. Now, Mr. Stewart is being unduly attacked by liberal groups. In this same spirit of bipartisanship with which I have supported this administration's nominees, it had been and continues to be my hope that the Democrats would support the nomination of Ted Stewart. 
   I ultimately want this body to recognize that, in the same manner that I have been fair to this administration's nominees in the face of severe opposition, trust must be placed in the judgment of home State senators for a nominee whose jurisdiction would be confined wholly to that senator's State. So now, as I expect we will soon be considering Ted Stewart, I will ask you to extend your deference to President Clinton's choice and the Judiciary Committee's ranking member's support, but also to extend your trust to the judgment of both senators from Utah. 
   Ted is a good, honorable person, who has been deemed qualified for a position as District judge of the District of Utah and who will make a wonderful District Court Judge. I urge the Democrats to stop playing politics with this nomination and allow a vote expeditiously.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's kind remarks. I support Mr. Stewart's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same, and not to filibuster any nominee, let alone this nominee. 
   I am pleased, with regard to the judicial nominations that have been voted on so far this session--and there have been well over 300 since this President became President--that no one on our side, to my knowledge, has threatened to filibuster any of these judges. I think that is the way to proceed. 
   I think it is a travesty if we ever start getting into a game of filibustering judges. I have to admit that my colleagues on the other side attempted to do that on a number of occasions during the Reagan and Bush years. They always backed off, but maybe they did because they realized there were enough votes to stop a filibuster against Federal judges. I think it is a travesty if we treat this third branch of government with such disregard that we filibuster judges. 
   I also have appreciated the comments of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, who stated on this floor in the past:  
   I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or supported. .....  
   The Republican leadership, the Democratic President, the Republican chairman, and the Democratic ranking member of the Judiciary Committee all support Mr. Stewart's nomination. The nomination should not be filibustered. As I understand it, the only reason there would be a filibuster is because some Senators want their judges up. They have no real reason to filibuster Mr. Stewart. 
   The only way I could ever see a filibuster would be justified is if a nominee is so absolutely unqualified to sit on the Federal bench that the only way to stop that person is a filibuster. I can understand it under those circumstances. Even then, I would question whether that should be done. If a person is so unqualified, we ought to be able to beat that person on the floor. 
   Even when I opposed a nominee of the current President, I voted for cloture to stop the filibuster of that nominee. That was for Lee Sarokin. 
   We are dealing with a coequal branch of government. We are dealing with some of the most important nominations the President, whoever that President may be, will make. We are also dealing, hopefully, with good faith on both sides of the floor. 
   For years, I thought our colleagues on the other side did some reprehensible things with regard to Reagan and Bush judges--very few, but it was serious. By and large, the vast majority of them were put through without any real fuss or bother even though my colleagues on the other side, had they been President, would not have appointed very many of those judges. We have to show the same good faith on our side, it seems to me. 
   And unless you have an overwhelming case, then certainly I don't see any reason for anybody filibustering judges. I hope that we never get into that. Let's make our case if we have disagreement, and then vote. And I reach this conclusion after having been part of this process for over 20 years now and always trying to be fair, whoever is the President of the United States and whoever the nominees are. 
   It is important to not filibuster judicial nominees on the floor of the Senate. The fight over a nomination has to occur between honest people in the White House and honest people up here. And that is where the battles are. When they get this far, generally most of them should be approved. There are some we still have problems with in the Judiciary Committee, but that is our job to look at them. It is our job to look into their background. It is our job to screen these candidates. 
   We have had judicial nominees withdraw after we have approved them in the Judiciary Committee because something has come up to disturb their nomination. This was generally handled between the White House, the Senate, and the nominee. That is the way it should work. 
   We must remember that these are among the most important nominations that any President can make and that the Senate can ever work on. We should not play politics with them. 
   I have really worked hard on the Judiciary Committee to try to not allow politics. It is no secret that there are some on the right who decry the fact that I have put through Clinton judges. Some of them don't want any Clinton judges put through --some just because they are liberal. If we get to the point where we deny people a chance to serve because they are liberal or conservative, I think we will be in real trouble. Politics should not be played with judicial nominees. President Clinton did win this Presidency. He has a right to nominate these people, and we have an obligation to confirm them if they are qualified. In every case where we have confirmed them, they are qualified, even though there may be some questions in the minds of some. 
   In the case of Ted Steward, we have examined the whole record. The President has examined the whole record. The President and I and Senator BENNETT agree that Mr. Stewart is qualified to serve as an Article III, judgeship in Utah. The Judiciary Committee reported Mr. Steward's nomination favorably to the floor. 
   Now we have the unusual situation of a Democratic President and Republican Chairman and Democratic Ranking Member agreeing on a nomination, but certain Democratic Senators who really don't oppose Ted Steward's nomination want to hold the nomination hostage in order to get other judges up. The majority leader said he will try to do so in good faith, but he must consult with 54 other Senators on our side. 
   There is some angst on at least the background of two of the 9th Circuit Court judges on the part of some on our side. I could not disagree more with the threat of filibuster here. Unless there is an overwhelming case to be made against a judge that he or she is unqualified or will not respect the limited role which Article III prescribes for a judge, there should be no filibuster. 
   Mr. Steward is definitely qualified and will certainly respect the limited role that Article III provides for a federal judge. He will be a credit to the federal bench in Utah and throughout the country. 
   In sum, Mr. President, I oppose filibusters of judicial nominees as a general matter and I support Mr. Stewart's nomination in this specific case. I  would like to see these three judges go through today because we put them through the Judiciary Committee. I would like to see all of those on the list have an opportunity to be voted up or down. I will work to try to do that. 
   On the other hand, I understand the problems of the majority leader and I hope my colleagues on the other side do. I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will not hold up the business of the Senate to play politics with Ted Stewart's nomination. I have to say that I think we do a great injustice if we do not support this nomination. 
   Having said all of that, let me conclude by saying I have been willing to and have enjoyed working with my distinguished friend from Vermont. He has done a good job as the Democrat leader on the committee. I just have to say that I hope he can clear his side on these matters and that we can get them through because I intend to put more judges out from the committee and to move forward with as much dispatch as I can. 
   Earlier, when I said there was some angst concerning the background of some Ninth Circuit nominees, I was referring to their legal background and some of the matters that came before the committee. Be that as it may, I was really referring to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which seems to be out of whack with the rest of the country. It is reversed virtually all the time by the Supreme Court. There is a great deal of concern that Ninth Circuit court has become so activist that it is a detriment to the Federal judicial system. Some on our side believe that to put any additional activists on that court would be a travesty and would be wrong. I am concerned about that, too. 
   All I can say is that it is important we work together to try to get these nominees through, both in the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. Should we be fortunate enough to have a Republican President next time, I hope our colleagues on the other side will treat our nominees as fairly as I certainly did and the Senate Republicans as a whole treated the Democrat nominees who have been brought before the committee. We are going to keep working on them, and we will do the best we can to get as many of them through as we can. Thus far, I am proud of the record we have. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the status of the youth violence bill conference. Conferees from the House and Senate had planned to meet later today to complete consideration of the conference report. Last night, conference staff met jointly with Administration officials. And discussions on firearms and culture related issues are moving forward. Chairman HYDE felt that his talks with Mr. CONYERS are going very well. Accordingly, I felt we should keep working. however, my hope and plan is to meet next week so we can complete action on this bill this month. 
   I also want to comment briefly on why this bill is so important. Too many violent crimes involve juveniles. According to the Justice Department, the number of juvenile arrests for violent crime, including crimes committed with a firearm, exceeds 1988 levels by 48 percent. Our youth violence problem is a compel problems that demand comprehensive solution. Our legislation makes our schools safer; it empowers parents; it recognizes the importance of prevention; and it emphasize the need for enforcement and getting tough on violent criminals. Part of any comprehensive solution to deal with crime must be a commitment to enforcing the laws on the books. Actions speak louder than words, whether we're talking about how the government deals with gun offenders or how it deals with terrorists. 
   I am deeply saddened by the news out of Texas concerning a crazed gunman's senseless, hate-for-religion rampage at a Forth Worth church which left seven innocent people dead and many others wounded. My prayers go out to the victims and their families and my energies will be all the more dedicated towards trying to reach a consensus on the youth violence bill. This event--and others like it in recent months--have energized a well-deserved and beneficial debate about the criminal use of firearms. Limiting criminal access to firearms, beefing up prosecutions, and responding to a popular culture which glamorizes firearms violence should all be parts of our response. But as I just noted, violent crime--violent juvenile crime, in particular--is a complex problem which deserves a comprehensive response. 
   In today's Washington Post, which appropriately reports on the Texas shooting on its front page, is buried an article about how a Maryland juvenile court judge released from custody--over the objections of prosecutors--a 16-year-old, confessed violent sex offender who had been sent to Maryland's maximum security prison. He was released because the he was not receiving ``individualized counseling.''--Washington Post, Sept. 16, 1999, B-7. According to the article, the judge's view is that the purpose of the juvenile justice system is to ``rehabilitate rather than punish young offenders.'' The teenager in question--whose identity has been protected, by the way--was one of six teenagers who, in March of last year, lured a 15-year-old girl from a bus stop to a vacant apartment where they took turns raping, sodomizing, and beating her for three hours. Three teenagers who participated in the rape were sentenced to life but this offender has been set free by a soft-headed juvenile justice system. According to the article, this violent sex-offender (whose fellow offenders are serving life-terms) will live with his relatives in near-by Prince George's County and will be enrolling in High Point High School. 
   Where's the greatest threat to the public? Ask the parents of High Point High School this question. The greatest threat to the public is from criminals who are set free by a soft-headed justice system, be they rapists or terrorists. And criminals who commit crimes but are not prosecuted are left free to commit more crimes. yesterday, I released a report reported entitled ``Crimes Committed With Firearms--A report for Parent, Prosecutors, and Policy Markers.'' Our report found that over 90% of criminals age 18 to 24 who had an substantial arrest record prior to being imprisoned are rearrested within three years for a felony or serious misdemeanor. 
   I mention this article and our report to illustrate, as I have said repeatedly, that this is a complex problem which demands a comprehensive solution. Simply passing more laws which get printed in DOJ's law books but which go unenforced will not nothing to fight violent crime, let alone violent juvenile crime. And legislation which fails to make meaningful reforms which promotes juvenile accountability and juvenile record disclosure--as the Hatch-Sessions bill does--will prove to be a hollow accomplishment. 
   In closing, we must do all we can to come together and resolve our differences and reach consensus. When I hear members drawing lines in the sand over specific provisions in the youth violence bill, I get concerned because it tells me that the politics of party are trumping the obligation to lead and do what's right. 
   That is what I intend to do in this juvenile justice conference. I hope we have the cooperation of everybody on both sides. I hope the rumors that some want to play this as a political matter are not true. I think we need to pass a juvenile justice bill this year, and we need to do the very best we can do in doing that. I intend to get that  done, and I thank all those who cooperate in helping to get it done. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the PILT amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill, which increases payments to counties in lieu of taxes. I have worked closely with my good friend and colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, in crafting this amendment, and I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Senator from Michigan for his efforts in this regard. Senator ABRAHAM has consistently shown a sensitivity to and an understanding of the needs of rural Americans, especially those living in communities surrounded by public lands. 
   Most of my colleagues understand, by now, that 70 percent of my home state is either owned or controlled by the federal government. I believe that Utah's public lands stand out for their grandeur and unique beauty. Many of our Senate colleagues and staff members have visited these areas to hike, fish, ski, or mountain bike. 
   No one loves these public lands more than the citizens who live among them. But, for the local citizens, these lands can be both a blessing and a curse. For a number of Utah counties, as much as 90 percent of their lands are federally owned, which means they cannot generate tax revenue from these lands. 
   Where once public lands were a source of jobs and opportunity for rural America, these lands have increasingly been restricted to single-use activities, such as hiking, biking, or river running. Utah certainly provides excellent opportunities for these types of activities, and we welcome visitors from all over the world. 
   But, we shouldn't forget, Mr. President, that these visitors come with needs: they need roads to travel on, someone to put out their fires, law enforcement to keep them safe, someone to collect their trash, someone to come find them when they are lost, and someone to transport them to safety when they are hurt. Mr. President, the obligation to fulfill these needs falls on local county governments. With every new wilderness area, monument, or recreation area, county revenues shrink along with taxable economic activity; yet the influx of needy visitors increases. 
   The services counties provide are not money makers. To the contrary, they exact a tremendous cost on rural governments. The puny revenue local governments raise with their stunted tax base will never cover the costs of providing primary services to visitors over the entire area of their county. For this reason, Congress implemented the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program--known as PILT--which compensates rural counties for some of these services. 
   The problem is that this program has been funded at less than half the authorized level, and this has caused serious hardship for our counties. This amendment, we hope, will be the first installment in an overall plan to bring the PILT program to full funding. With small increases to PILT every year, our counties will eventually be made whole. We are not talking about a huge amount of money. We are talking $15 million in FY 2000. Last year Senator ABRAHAM and I were able to raise funding for PILT to $124 million, but this amount was cut back to $120 million in Conference. I hope that this year, we can maintain a strong increase in PILT funding. 
   If your child gets lost in Arches National Park, it will be a Grand County search and rescue team that will mobilize to find him. If you fall and break your ankle on the trail in Dixie National Forest, it will be a Garfield County helicopter and paramedics who will get you off the mountain and to the hospital. When you leave Zion National Park, it will be a Washington county solid waste truck that picks up your garbage. If someone should start a fire while camping in the Wasatch National Forest, the Wasatch County firefighters will be there to put it out. 
   Our rural governments do all this whether we pay them or not. But it is obviously unfair not to compensate them for it. Mr. President, I believe we should stop treating our rural governments as though they were unpaid chambermaids to the rest of the nation. Our rural areas don't mind providing services to tourists who come to enjoy public lands, but they deserve to be justly compensated by the owners of the land, the taxpayers, for the basic services they provide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the PILT amendment.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about S. 28, the Four Corners Interpretive Center Act. I was very pleased that the Senate saw fit to pass this bill by voice vote on September 9, 1999, and I fully expect that this legislation will pass the House and be sent to the President during this Congress. 
   This legislation could not have passed without the strong support of its cosponsors, Senators ALLARD, BENNETT, BINGAMAN, CAMPBELL, and DOMENICI. Chairman BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL and the staff of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee deserve special praise for going the extra mile in shepherding this proposal through the committee with speed and professionalism. 
   The Four Corners Interpretive Center Act will benefit the Four Corner states, the Navajo Nation, and Ute Mountain Ute tribe, and especially the throngs of visitors who make the special effort to visit the remote Four Corners region, the only location where the corners of four states converge. A quarter million tourists visit the Four Corners each year, only to find that there are no utilities, no permanent restrooms, no running water, no telephones, and no vending stations for their convenience. 
   Additionally, the Four Corners National Monument has unique historical, cultural, and environmental significance. The absence of any educational exhibits to help visitors appreciate the area is a wasted opportunity. The interpretive center authorized by this bill will enable all Americans who come to this area to learn about the ancient home of the Anasazi people as well as the area's geography, plant and animal species. 
   The objective of S. 28 is simple: to aid in the construction and maintenance of an interpretive center at the Four Corners National Monument. The bill calls for a cooperative agreement among the Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute tribe, affected local governments, and the four corners states to be approved by the Interior Department. Matching funds from each of the four states would also be required. Arizona has already committed funds. This is the type of intergovernmental partnership that has worked well on a variety of other projects throughout the country, and it is an appropriate model for the interpretive center. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate for passing this important legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Georgia. 
   On January 24, 1975, during a busy lunch hour, an explosion ripped through the historic Fraunces Tavern in New York City, killing four people and injuring 55 others. On August 3, 1977, during the morning rush hour, a powerful bomb was detonated in a busy New York office building, killing one man and injuring several others. Credit for both these bombings was proudly taken by a terrorist organization calling themselves the FALN, an acronym from a Spanish title meaning the Armed Forces for Puerto Rican National Liberation. 
   In March of 1980, armed members of the FALN entered the Carter-Mondale campaign headquarters, bound and gagged women and men inside, and held them at gunpoint as they ransacked the offices. The FALN took credit for bombings and incendiary attacks in New York City, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., attacks which took place in department stores, office buildings, restaurants, even a women's restroom. In all, the FALN has been linked to over 150 bombings, attempted bombings, incendiary attacks, kidnappings, and bomb threats, which have resulted in the death of at least six people and the injury of at least 70 others. 
   On August 11, 1999, President Clinton, who up to this point had commuted only three sentences since becoming President, offered clemency to 16 members of the FALN. This to me, was shocking. And quite frankly, I think I am joined by a vast majority of Americans in my failure to understand why the President, who has spoke out so boldly in opposition to domestic terrorism in recent years, has taken this action. 
   In subsequent spinning, the White House has pointed out that the 16 offered clemency were not convicted of the actual attacks that killed or maimed people. But many of these 16 were involved in building bombs, and in storing and transporting explosives, incendiary materials, and weapons. In one raid alone involving the terrorists President Clinton has released, law enforcement recovered 24 pounds of dynamite, 24 blasting caps, weapons, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, as well as disguises and false identifications. 
   The administration argues that none of these people were ``directly'' involved with activities that hurt people. But these people, to the contrary, were convicted of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. According to former Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Devaney, several of the FALN terrorists were captured in a van full of weapons and others were videotaped making bombs that they planned to use at military institutions. 
   It is only because of the good work of law enforcement that these terrorists were caught and convicted before these deadly devices were used to take additional innocent human lives. Osama bin Laden is on the FBI's Most Wanted List for conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. According to the administration's logic, he too should be let go, if captured, because he was not directly involved in acts of terrorism, although we all know he has been funding the terrorist acts. 
   The administration also argues that these prisoners received longer sentences than they would have under the sentencing guidelines. Well, there are thousands of people in jail who were sentenced before the guidelines. Does each of them deserve to have their sentences reduced? The President will have to pick up the pace of clemency offers if he is to right all these so-called wrongs in the 15 months left in his term. 
   This whole episode raises a number of questions about this administration's approach to law enforcement and the rule of law in general. Were the normal procedures followed in the processing of clemency opinions? What set these 16 prisoners apart from the more than 4,000 who have petitioned this President for clemency, or the other tens of thousands serving time across the country? What prompted the President to make this offer of clemency? Who recommended it? On what basis was it granted? 
   Whatever the administration's arguments, the bottom line is that the President's ill-considered offer of clemency has now been accepted by 12 of the 16 FALN members, many of whom are now back on the streets. 
   These are people who have been convicted of very serious offenses involving sedition, firearms, explosives, and threats of violence. The FALN has claimed responsibility for past bombings that have killed and maimed American citizens. I personally pray that no one else will get hurt. 
   This is yet another example of this administration sending the wrong message to criminals, be they foreign spies, gun offenders, or, in this case, terrorists. 
   In this case, it appears President Clinton put the interests of these convicted criminals ahead of the interests of victims, the law enforcement community, and the public. I think we need to know: Did the Justice Department do its job? 
   There are substantial questions as to whether the normal process was followed in this case. Reportedly, the President made his clemency offer over the strong objections of prosecutors, the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and the victims of crime. In the Wall Street Journal today, Mr. Howard Safir, the New York City police commissioner, asserts that:  
   In my 26 years as a Justice Department official, I have never heard of a clemency report being delivered to the President over the strenuous objections of these agencies. The Department of Justice and the Attorney  General apparently did not even take a formal position on the matter, even though the Department's own rules require doing so.  
   Here we have another example of what people suspect: The Attorney General is asleep at the switch while the White House runs the Justice Department. 
   As chairman of the Senate committee with oversight of the Department of Justice, I have requested copies of all relevant documents, including the Department's memo to the White House. Even our colleague, Senator SCHUMER from New York, believes we should have these documents. But so far the Department has refused to turn over anything. 
   The White House and the Justice Department are hiding behind their tired, old ploy of ``studying'' whether to assert executive privilege. If the President has confidence that his decision was a just one, then he ought to be willing to hold it up to public scrutiny. There may be a legitimate argument that executive 
   privilege applies to some materials. There is no legitimate reason, however, not to allow the Justice Department witnesses to appear before Senator COVERDELL's hearing this morning about the current status and activities of the FALN. Nor is there any legitimate reason to refuse to allow the Pardon Attorney to testify at my hearing tomorrow about how the clemency process works. Are the White House and the Justice Department studying or are they stonewalling? 
   At the Judiciary Committee hearing tomorrow, we will hear from the law enforcement community and the victims who have been affected by this grant of clemency. I have invited representatives of the FBI and the Justice Department's Pardon Attorney's Office. I hope the White House and the Department of Justice will allow them to testify. The American people deserve to hear this testimony, and I think the White House and the Justice Department should not be stonewalling this type of investigation by the appropriate branch of Government called the Congress of the United States. 
   I believe our entire Nation is being victimized by terrorism. A bomb at the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City Federal Building, or a U.S. Embassy abroad has an effect on all of us. 
   This clemency deal is an insult to every American citizen. This clemency deal is not humanitarian. It is not just. 
   Exactly what is this? A weak moment? Political favoritism? Another foreign policy miscalculation by this administration? I will tell you what it is. It is plain and simple. It is wrong. That is what it is. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Coverdell resolution so that the Senate will be on record as opposing the President's decision to grant clemency. 
   We cannot send mixed messages with regard to terrorism. One of the major problems this country is going to face in the future --as will every free country--will be acts of terrorism by people just like these FALN terrorists who put their own beliefs above doing justice and what right in society. If the United States continues to show that type of soft-headedness with regard to terrorist activities and terrorists themselves, then we are going to reap a whirlwind in this country, and we will see more acts of terrorism in this country than we ever thought possible. 
   I can say with impunity that there are better than 1,500 known terrorists and terrorist organizations in the United States of America today. Frankly, there are a lot more than that. Thus far, the administration, prior to this act, has done a pretty good job of offsetting terrorist activities in this country, mainly because of the FBI and its good work. I am suggesting that we get on top of this. The President should be ashamed for doing what he has done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, recently a handful of environmentalists have called for the draining of Lake Powell and the decommissioning of the Glen Canyon Dam. As the second largest man-made lake in the country, Lake Powell provides critically important water storage for the states of the Colorado River basin--the driest region in the United States. As many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle already know, Mr. President, draining Lake Powell is unsupportable. This amendment puts this issue to rest once and for all. This legislation simply prohibits the federal government from taking any action to drain Lake Powell or to decommission the Glen Canyon Dam without Congressional approval.

Mr. President, this amendment in no way gives assent to the Secretary of the Interior or any other government official to decommission other water projects without Congressional approval. Any effort by the administration to decommission a Bureau of Reclamation project without the approval of Congress or of those most affected by the action, in my view, would be unsupportable.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are considering a bill to return a portion of the surplus that is projected to be $2.9 trillion over the next ten years. This bill represents a balanced package that takes into account the problems as well as sharing in the good times. The bill will provide fiscally responsible tax relief over the next ten years while reducing the public debt and still save the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus. 
   Many of my colleagues have argued that $792 billion in tax cuts is too much--that we should save this money for Medicare and other spending. I strongly disagree. It is important that we not forget those who are responsible for the surplus--hard-working, over-paying taxpayers. After all, what is a surplus--it is excess revenues over the amount needed to fund government operations. 
   The $2.9 trillion surplus is large enough to balance our priorities. This Conference Report shows that we can provide meaningful tax cuts, provide for Medicare reform, and reserve the Social Security surplus. 
   I also marvel at how much we have recently heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about debt reduction. I never knew the depth of their convictions on this, particularly since they fought the balanced budget amendment so hard. The balanced budget amendment would have once and for all imposed spending restraints on Congress. The majority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argued vigorously against such constitutional restraints, implying that they wanted unlimited access to the government checkbook. 
   In my view, if we have a surplus, and we do not have a tax cut, the temptation of Congress to spend that surplus will be too great. I made this point many times during debate on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and I will make it again. If we have a surplus, this money will burn a hole in Congress' pocket. 
   This conference report provides tax cuts for everyone by cutting tax rates 1% across-the-board. This may not sound like much, but it represents real tax cuts for each and every taxpayer. In addition, couples filing married returns will see their marriage penalty eliminated. It is sending the wrong signal to American taxpayers when a couple in Utah faces a higher tax bill when they marry than they do as singles. The bill also helps our families struggling to finance a quality education for themselves and their children. 
   The bill also addresses the need for enhanced retirement security. It makes IRAs more widely available and improves retirement systems to increase access, simplify the rules, increase portability and provide small business incentives. 
   We have all heard about the challenge that providing adequate health care that is facing American families. This bill provides meaningful help for those who are struggling with the costs of insurance. 
   This bill also contains provisions that would help keep economic growth strong. There is a package of international tax relief that provides simplification and helps American companies which have operations overseas remain competitive and continue to grow. The expiring tax credits are extended. 
   I am disappointed that the research and experimentation tax credit was not made permanent. I still believe that our American research engine would be helped significantly by relieving the uncertainty that a sunsetted credit imposes. Nevertheless, the 5-year extension in this bill is a step in the right direction. I hope that we can revisit this issue in the future and provide for a permanent tax credit for research and experimentation. 
   This conference report contains some important improvements over the Senate bill. I am particularly heartened to see the full repeal of the estate tax and capital gains tax relief as part of this bill. 
   The ``death tax'' is unfair and inefficient. For every dollar that we collect, roughly 65 cents is spent complying and collecting this tax. This is the wrong way to use up our resources. 
   This bill also accelerates the capital gains tax rate cuts we passed in 1997. In addition, it will shorten the required holding period of assets from 5 years to 1. This will provide significant simplification for those taxpayers struggling to determine which capital gains rate applies and how long they have held their assets. This is true simplification and real relief. And, let's make no mistake: these tax changes will benefit more Americans than just the wealthy. These estate tax and capital gains tax provisions will benefit every American who owns a home, business, or family farm. It will benefit the increasing number of Americans who are investors in mutual funds and other securities. 
   It is easy for us to get lost in the debate over numbers and how we should spend the surplus. However, we must keep in mind who sent us the revenue that created the surplus. We are talking about families struggling to make ends meet, provide an educations for their children, or save for their retirement. They are the family funning the corner grocery store or landscaping business. They are bus drivers, day care providers, carpenters, and students. 
   This conference report is a balanced tax cut package that provides relief for middle class taxpayers. It gives American families a well-deserved tax break, simplifies the tax code, and provides pro-growth incentives to help keep the economy strong and growing. This $792 billion bill is the biggest tax cut since the Ronald Reagan presidency. Yet, it still represents a rebate of only one-quarter of the surplus dollars that the federal government has collected. I hope that the President can agree that we owe the American taxpayers that much and sign this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the community and Open Spaces Bonds Act (COSB). This bill provides assistance to our local communities in their continuous efforts to improve the quality of life through flexible, zero-cost financing options for protecting open spaces. 
   As the acreage of open space in this country continues to decline, we find ourselves in a battle of time against widespread urban sprawl. The American citizens have spoken out, demanding that this body take the action necessary to protect the remaining open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities that they have enjoyed since the founding of this great nation. The America Farmland Trust estimates that we have been losing farmland at approximately 3,000 acres per day since 1970. This growth is not only damaging to the agricultural industry, but all those who wish to enjoy this nations natural bounties. 
   I believe it is our obligation to respond to and remedy this situation. For this reason, I would like to thank my colleague Senator BAUCUS for taking the initiative in proposing legislation that provides incentives to those private land owning citizens who wish to protect our valuable open spaces. Our proposal makes available up to $1.9 billion annually for five years in bonding authority to state, local, and tribal governments. This voluntary approach allows the local community to lead the charge in projects that will improve the quality of life of its citizens, while the Federal government simply plays a supporting role. I think that is the way to do it. 
   These community based projects will be supported through proceeds from the sales of the bonds. The issuers would repay the principal at the end of 15 years, but the Federal government would pay the issuers' interest or borrowing costs through the tax credit during that period. As an incentive, the holder of the bond would get an annual tax credit equal to the corporate average AA bond rating, as posted by the Treasury, multiplied by the face amount of the bond.  
   This bill will spur even greater innovation than we already see at the local level in dealing with growth and urban sprawl issues. The flexibility of this proposal creates many opportunities in an often limiting system to raise funding for land purchases. We simply want to give communities a system that is entirely local driven, unlike that currently offered by the Federal government. The most dynamic aspect of this bill is that it restores to local governments the power to influence the future of their communities. 
   The Community Open Space Bonds Act can help respond to the need to protecting our beautiful lands and precious water supply, and I strongly urge my colleagues to join in this fight against the raging war of time. Action must be taken now, so that our children will enjoy the natural wonders we have come to love.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note today that the international community had a successful first conference on reconstructing Kosovo and southeastern Europe. Nearly 40 leaders met in Sarajevo last weekend. The presence of most of these heads of state, including President Clinton's commendable appearance, demonstrates that the international community will not shirk from the responsibility of rebuilding Kosovo from the inhumane devastation visited upon it by the ultranationalist brutes still in power in Belgrade. 
   The people of Kosovo have suffered nearly unspeakable brutality, and it is entirely appropriate that the international community--which invested a great deal in forcing the Serbian military, paramilitary, and other gangsters out of Kosovo--now recognizes that long-term stability will not be created until immediate humanitarian needs, as well as medium-term goals of building a functioning economy, establishing institutions to devise and protect the rule of law, and ejecting the ultranationalists in Belgrade, are met. 
   It is also appropriate, Mr. President, that the European powers shoulder the majority of this cost, as the U.S. shouldered the majority of Operation Allied Force. 
   When we look at the humanitarian response to the crisis in Kosovo, we must note with appreciation the participation of nongovernmental organizations around the world who rushed to aid the Kosovar victims. 
   The American Red Cross, for example, has been involved in the Balkans since 1993--more proof that Milosovic has been wreaking havoc in the region for years. 
   Doctors Without Borders has been addressing a myriad of public health problems and responding to injuries. 
   These are just two organizations who have responded to the overwhelming needs of these people. 
   Prominent among these groups were the aid organizations of most of the world's religions. 
   Again, to name only a few, Catholic Relief Services just last week shipped more than 1400 metric tons of food. It has contributed other supplies and volunteers as well. The Catholic Relief Services have also taken on the project of rebuilding the schools. 
   Church World Services, the relief arm of a consortium of protestant denominations, has shipped tents, food, bedding, and other supplies. 
   The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, affiliated with the United Jewish Appeal, in addition to food and shelter supplies, has activitied its medical registry of volunteer doctors and nurses to operate clinics in the refugee areas of Albania and Macedonia. 
   And I would like to highlight the significant efforts by my own church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
   In my address to the assembled members of our church last April, President Gordon B. Hinckley said, ``At this moment, our hearts reach out to the suffering people of Kosovo.'' He set in motion our church's efforts to help relieve that suffering. 
   The Church's initial response to the crisis was timely. On Tuesday, April 6, specific plans were approved to ship family food boxes on a chartered air cargo plane. That night, over 300 Church members in Salt Lake City packed 3,000 boxes with food to feed a family of four for one to two weeks. On Wednesday, the food boxes were loaded on the cargo plane arriving in Macedonia on Friday. Refugee families began receiving the food boxes on Saturday, April 10. A second chartered air cargo plane was sent to Macedonia two weeks later with 26,000 family hygiene kits, 14,000 pounds of soap and 600 additional food boxes. 
   Other shipments containing blankets, food, and clothing have been distributed to refugees in Macedonia. Also, blankets, food,and clothing have been consigned to the American Red Cross. More hygiene kits have been assembled by Latter-day Saints in Germany, England, California, and Utah for shipment to refugees in June. Student and teacher educational supply kits have been provided to refugee camps in Macedonia. Fresh fruits, vegetables and bread are being purchased locally by the Church in Macedonia and Albania and distributed to refugee camps and host families. 
   The Church has sent volunteer couples to Macedonia and Albania to coordinate distribution of humanitarian assistance. A third volunteer couple with experience in the helping professions will go to Albania for 3-6 months to assist refugee and host families with social-emotional needs. 
   To date, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has provided the following humanitarian aid to Kosovar refugees: 
   Food--133,000 pounds shipped, plus cash donations of $400,000 for local purchases; 
   Clothing and shoes--2 million pounds, soap--166,000 pounds, school kits and educational supplies--4,000 pounds; 
   Family hygiene kits--52,000, blankets--28,000; and 
   Cash contributions to the German Red Cross and the Mother Teresa Soceity--$110,000 
   Once all currently planned shipments are completed, the value of assistance rendered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will total approximately $5.2 million. The Church stands ready to evaluate and respond to future needs as circumstances may require and resources allow. 
   The Mormon Church today has as many adherents overseas as there are in this country. It is a global church. Its presence abroad contributes to an awareness of the need for public health, literacy, and development in other nations. But, more than that, it contributes to a greater understanding among nations and cultures. 
   The people of my state--not only LDS members--have always demonstrated a willingness to pitch in where there is need. Their contributions are obvious at home. But, we do not mention enough that their charitable spirit extends regularly to less fortunate people around the world. 
   While Utahans are fiscally conservative people and are not tolerant of the  financial waste perpetrated in Washington, they are also generous people. I am pleased to highlight their support for the Kosovar relief effort. 
   It is a tribute to America's generous spirit and sense of goodness that all of these organizations have mobilized to assist people suffering half a world away. There is no doubt that, despite the overwhelming challenge, these organization will collectively make the difference in the lives of these displaced Kosovar refugees and will provide hop for their future.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army Specialist T. Bruce Cluff of Washington, Utah. Specialist Cluff was one of five American soldiers from the 204th Military Intelligence Battalion stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, who perished when their U.S. Army surveillance plane crashed in the rugged mountains of Colombia while conducting a routine counter narcotics mission in conjunction with the Colombian government. 
   I am deeply saddened by the loss of this fine young man while in the service of our country. This is a greater tragedy by the fact that Specialist Cluff leaves behind a wife, Meggin, and two young children, Maciah and Ryker, with another child yet to be born. My heart and my prayers go out to them as well as to their extended family. 
   I also acknowledge and extend my sympathies to the families of the other four American soldiers who perished in the crash. I especially hope that Meggin Cluff, her children, and the other families of these soldiers will feel the immense gratitude that we have for the sacrifice of their loved ones. 
   Indeed, Specialist T. Bruce Cluff and his crew mates are heroes, as are all of the men and women of our armed forces who everyday unselfishly put life and limb at risk to defend our great nation. Specialist Cluff and his Army unit were engaged in a different type of war. Illegal drug trafficking has become the scourge of our society, and we are determined to stop this practice at its very roots. 
   The men and women of our armed forces assisting in these offshore interdiction efforts will not be deterred by  the tragic loss of this aircrew. In fact, I suspect they and their families will be all the more motivated to continue the ``war'' against drug trafficking. We should all take due notice of the costs associated with this effort, including the first loss of military lives. We should be unrelenting in our opposition to and our pursuit and prosecution of traffickers as well as pushers of dangerous drugs. 
   May God bless the memories of Specialist Cluff and his fellow crew members, and give comfort and peace to their families. And may we remember and continue to defend the principles for which these brave young people fought and died for. We owe that commitment to them, to their families, and to those who will continue their work.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today along with the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and other colleagues in introducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999.'' This bill will help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to vitally needed nursing home care services. 
   When Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the BBA, we created a new prospective payment system (PPS) for skilled nursing facilities (SNF). While the industry generally supported the SNF PPS, there clearly have been some unintended consequences as a result of the implementation the new payment system which is now beginning to affect patient care. 
   We have an obligation to Medicare beneficiaries, and particularly those in nursing homes as well as those who need to gain admission to nursing homes, to correct this problem. This legislation is designed specifically to address the problem with patient access to nursing home care. 
   The measure we are introducing today is designed to address two significant problems that have occurred as a result of the implementation of the PPS. 
   First, the bill provides additional monies to care for the so-called high-acuity SNF patients who require non-therapy ancillary services for conditions such as cancer, hip fracture, and stroke. 
   Second, with respect to the market basket update, the bill closes the gap between the inaccurate inflation market basket estimate and the actual cost increases between fiscal years 1995 and 1998. 
   It is my understanding that both solutions could be easily implemented by HCFA. 
   Mr. President, let me focus more specifically on each of the two provisions. 
   With respect to non-therapy ancillary care, the bill proposes to add-on additional monies under the federal per diem rate for 15 categories of care. We are now finding that high-acuity and medically complex patients are being shortchanged because the current case-mix system does not accurately measure or account for patients with high medical complexities which utilize greater ancillary services. 
   HCFA has even acknowledged that they do not have accurate data to properly compensate for such non-therapy ancillary care. According to HCFA, they believe that more accurate data reflecting the case-mix for sicker patients should be available in 2001. 
   Unfortunately, we now know that beneficiaries are having difficulty receiving non-therapy ancillary care today. For some, waiting 2 years for the HCFA data is simply not an option. 
   Accordingly, the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act'' will provide interim relief until HCFA has developed more complete and accurate data. The bill provides additional funds for 15 RUS III categories, or the so-called resource utilization groups. 
   These RUGS were chosen because they represent categories of services that closely match the diagnoses for high-acuity patients. Such additional funds would only be provided for a two-year period, or less, until the Secretary of Health and Human Services has corrected the data to properly reflect the costs of non-therapy ancillary care. 
   It is my understanding that HCFA believes they can implement a new case mix methodology within this time frame. 
   In response to concerns expressed to me by HCFA over Y2K problems and the difficulty of any systems' changes at this point in the PPS implementation, my bill provides for a simple, temporary add-on federal dollars to the federal per diem component. 
   Based on informal comments from HCFA officials, the bill should be easy for the agency to implement in time to have an immediate positive impact on patient care. 
   The second feature in our bill attempts to close the gap between the inflation adjuster--the market basket update--and the actual cost increases. Recent data are now showing that HCFA's market basket increase is well below actual inflation costs for nursing home care. 
   When Congress passed the BBA, the year 1995 was chosen as the base year for future inflation adjustments because it provided the most recent set of complete cost reporting data for PPS implementation. 
   HCFA was charged with developing a market basket of nursing home goods and services to trend forward to 1998, which was when PPS was implemented. Unfortunately, it appears that HCFA has underestimated the market basket index by not considering the cost of nursing home services. In addition, the statute requires the inflation adjuster to be market basket minus one, which only makes the estimate worse. 
   Evidence is now available to illustrate that the market basket estimate is inadequate to properly compensate for nursing home care. 
   In 1996, HCFA's market basket increase was approximately 2.7 percent, while data now indicates that the actual cost increase was approximately 10.5 percent. Preliminary 1997 cost data reflect similar differences between the HCFA market basket index and the actual change in costs experienced by nursing facilities. 
   My legislation provides easily implemented relief to nursing homes which are being short changed by inadequate market basket estimates. The bill eliminates the ``minus one'' from the inflation adjuster for 1996, 1997, and 1998, thereby providing a one-percent increase of the index over three years, compounded. 
   While there may need to be further modification to the actual market basket, this straightforward legislative solution enables HCFA to implement this provision immediately. This solution will provide meaningful and practical relief to nursing homes so they can continue to provide quality care for the more medically complex Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Mr. President, many nursing homes are on the verge of filing for bankruptcy and others may be closing their doors due to various PPS implementation problems. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries are finding themselves on long waiting lists to be admitted to a skilled nursing facility. Others are remaining in hospitals for extended stays, while they wait for nursing home availability. 
   The ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act'' is a common sense solution to address these very real problems. It provides  two solutions that HCFA can implement today without being mired in Year 2000 compliance efforts. 
   I would add that I am pleased that the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, has indicated his interest in moving a bipartisan BBA technical bill following the August recess. 
   I have written to Senator ROTH asking him to carefully review our skilled nursing facility bill as he develops a BBA technical corrections bill over the next several weeks. I strongly believe this bill serves as a viable option on which to address the PPS problem that so many nursing homes are facing today.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate considers legislation to address the serious threats to American consumers, businesses, and the future of electronic commerce, which derive from the deliberate, bad-faith, and abusive registration of Internet domain names in violation of the rights of trademark owners. For the Net-savvy, this burgeoning form of cyber-abuse is known as ``cybersquatting.'' For the average consumer, it is simply fraud, deception, and the bad-faith trading on the goodwill of others. 
   Our trademark laws have long recognized the communicative value of brand name identifiers, which serve as the primary indicators of source, quality, and authenticity in the minds of consumers. These laws prohibit the unauthorized uses of other people's marks because such uses lead to consumer confusion, undermine the goodwill and communicative value of the brand names they rely on, and erode consumer confidence in the marketplace generally. Such problems of brand-name abuse and consumer confusion are particularly acute in the online environment, where traditional indicators of source, quality, and authenticity give way to domain names and digital storefronts that take little more than Internet access and rudimentary computer skills to erect. In many cases, the domain name that takes consumers to an Internet site and the graphical interface that greets them when they get there are the only indications of source and authenticity, and legitimate and illegitimate sites may be indistinguishable to online consumers. 
   Despite the protections of existing trademark law, cyber-pirates and online bad actors are increasingly taking advantage of the novelty of the Internet and the online vulnerabilities of trademark owners to deceive and defraud consumers and to hijack the valuable trademarks of American businesses. In some cases these bad actors register the well-known marks of others as domain names with the intent to extract sizeable payments from the rightful trademark owner in exchange for relinquishing the rights to the name in cyberspace. In others they use the domain name to divert unsuspecting Internet users to their own sites, which are often pornographic sites or competitors' sites that prey on consumer confusion. Still others use the domain name to engage in counterfeiting activities or for other fraudulent or nefarious purposes. 
   In considering this legislation, the Judiciary Committee has seen examples of many such abuses. For example, we heard testimony of consumer fraud being perpetrated by the registrant of the ``attphonecard.com'' and ``attcallingcard.com'' domain names who set up Internet sites purporting to sell calling cards and soliciting personally identifying information, including credit card numbers. We also heard examples of counterfeit goods and non-genuine Porsche parts being sold on a number of the more than 300 web sites found using domain names bearing Porsche's name. The risks posed to consumers by these so-called ``dot.con'' artists continue to escalate as more people go online to buy things like pharmaceuticals, financial services, and even groceries. 
   I was also surprised to learn that the ``dosney.com'' domain was being used for a hard-core pornography website--a fact that was brought to the attention of the Walt Disney Company by the parent of a child who mistakenly arrived at that site when looking for Disney's main page. In a similar case, a 12-year old California boy was denied privileges at his school when he entered ``zelda.com'' in a web browser at his school library, looking for a site he expected to be affiliated with the popular computer game of the same name, but ended up at a pornography site. Young children are not the only victims of this sort of abuse. Recently the Intel Corporation had the ``pentium3.com'' domain snatched up by a cybersquatter who used it to post pornographic images of celebrities and offered to sell the domain name to the highest bidder. 
   The Committee also heard numerous examples of online bad actors using domain names to engage in unfair competition. For example, one domain name registrant used the name ``wwwcarpoint.com,'' without a period following the ``www,'' to drive consumers who are looking for Microsoft's popular Carpoint car buying service to a competitor's site offering similar services. Other bad actors don't even bother to offer competing services, opting instead to register multiple domain names to interfere with companies' ability to use their own trademarks online. For example, the Committee was told that Warner Bros. was asked to pay $350,000 for the rights to the names ``warner-records.com,'' ``warner-bros-records.com,'' ``warner-pictures.com,'' ``warner-bros-pictures'', and ``warnerpictures.com.'' 
   It is time for Congress to take a closer look at these abuses and to respond with appropriate legislation. The bill the Senate considers today will address these problems by clarifying the rights of trademark owners with respect to cybersquatting, by providing clear deterrence to prevent such bad faith and abusive conduct, and by providing adequate remedies for trademark owners in those cases where it does occur. And while the bill provides many important protections for trademark owners, it is important to note that the bill we are considering today reflects the text of a substitute amendment that Senator LEAHY and I offered in the Judiciary Committee to carefully balance the rights of trademark owners with the interests of Internet users. The text is substantively identical to the legislation that Senator LEAHY and I introduced as S. 1461, with Senators ABRAHAM, TORRICELLI, DEWINE, KOHL, and SCHUMER as cosponsors. In short, it represents a balanced approach that will protect American consumers and the businesses that drive our economy while at the same time preserving the rights of Internet users to engage in protected expression online and to make lawful uses of others' trademarks in cyberspace. 
   Let me take just a minute to explain some of the changes that are reflected in the bill as it has been reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee. While the current bill shares the goals of, and has some similarity to, the bill as introduced, it differs in a number of substantial respects. First, like the legislation introduced by Senator ABRAHAM, this bill allows trademark owners to recover statutory damages in cybersquatting cases, both to deter wrongful conduct and to provide adequate remedies for trademark owners who seek to enforce their rights in court. The reported bill goes beyond simply stating the remedy, however, and sets forth a substantive cause of action, based in trademark law, to define the wrongful conduct sought to be deterred and to fill in the gaps and uncertainties of current trademark law with respect to cybersquatting. 
   Under the bill as reported, the abusive conduct that is made actionable is appropriately limited to bad faith registrations of others' marks by persons who seek to profit unfairly from the goodwill associated therewith. In addition, the reported bill balances the property interests of trademark owners with the interests of Internet users who would make fair use of others' marks or otherwise engage in protected  speech online. The reported bill also limits the definition of domain name identifier to exclude such things as screen names, file names, and other identifiers not assigned by a domain name registrar or registry. It also omits criminal penalties found in Senator ABRAHAM's original legislation. 
   Second, the reported bill provides for in rem jurisdiction, which allows a mark owner to seek the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of an infringing domain name by filing an in rem action against the name itself, where the domain name violates the mark owner's substantive trademark rights and where the mark owner has satisfied the court that it has exercised due diligence in trying to locate the owner of the domain name but is unable to do so. A significant problem faced by trademark owners in the fight against cybersquatting is the fact that many cybersquatters register domain names under aliases or otherwise provide false information in their registration applications in order to avoid identification and service of process by the mark owner. The bill, as reported, will alleviate this difficulty, while protecting the notions of fair play and substantial justice, by enabling a mark owner to seek an injunction against the infringing property in those cases where, after due diligence, a mark owner is unable to proceed against the domain name registrant because the registrant has provided false contact information and is otherwise not to be found. 
   Additionally, some have suggested that dissidents or others who are online incognito for similar legitimate reasons might give false information to protect themselves and have suggested the need to preserve a degree of anonymity on the Internet particularly for this reason. Allowing a trademark owner to proceed against the domain names themselves, provided they are, in fact, infringing or diluting under the Trademark Act, decreases the need for trademark owners to join the hunt to chase down and root out these dissidents or others seeking anonymity on the Net. The approach in this bill is a good compromise, which provides meaningful protection to trademark owners while balancing the interests of privacy and anonymity on the Internet. 
   Third, like the original Abraham bill, the substitute amendment encourages domain name registrars and registries to work with trademark owners to prevent cybersquatting by providing a limited exemption from liability for domain name registrars and registries that suspend, cancel, or transfer domain names pursuant to a court order or in the implementation of a reasonable policy prohibiting cybersquatting. The bill goes further, however, in order to protect the rights of domain name registrants against overreaching trademark owners. Under the reported bill, a trademark owner who knowingly and materially misrepresents to the domain name registrar or registry that a domain name is infringing is liable to the domain name registrant for damages resulting from the suspension, cancellation, or transfer of the domain name. In addition, the court may award injunctive relief to the domain name registrant by ordering the reactivation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name back to the domain name registrant. Finally, the bill also promotes the continued ease and efficiency users of the current registration system enjoy by codifying current case law limiting the secondary liability of domain name registrars and registries for the act of registration of a domain name. 
   Finally, the reported bill includes an explicit savings clause making clear that the bill does not affect traditional trademark defenses, such as fair use, or a person's first amendment rights, and it ensures that any new remedies created by the bill will apply prospectively only. 
   In addition, the Senate is considering today an amendment I am offering with Senator LEAHY to make three additional clarifications. First, our amendment will clarify that the prohibited ``uses'' of domain names contemplated by the bill are limited to uses by the domain name registrant or his authorized licensee and do not include uses by others, such as in hypertext links, directory publishing, or search engines. 
   Second, our amendment clarifies that, like the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, uses of names that dilute the marks of others are actionable only where the mark that is harmed has achieved the status of a ``famous'' mark. As reported by the Committee, the bill does not distinguish between famous and non-famous marks. I supported this outcome because I believe the bill should provide protection to all mark owners against the deliberate, bad-faith dilution of their marks by cybersquatters--particularly given the proliferation of small startups that are driving the growth of electronic commerce on the Internet. Nevertheless, in the interest of moving the bill forward to provide much needed protection to trademark owners in a timely fashion and to build more closely on the pattern set by established law, I agreed to support an amendment limiting the scope of the bill to famous marks in the dilution context. Thus, our amendment clarifies that, like substantive trademark law generally, uses of others' marks in a way that causes a likelihood of consumer confusion is actionable whether or not the mark is famous, but like under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, dilutive uses of others' marks is actionable only if the mark is famous. 
   Finally, our amendment clarifies that a domain name registrant whose name is suspended in an extra-judicial dispute resolution procedure can seek a declaratory judgment that his use of the name was, in fact, lawful under the Trademark Act. This clarification is consistent with other provisions of the reported bill that seek to protect domain name registrants against overreaching trademark owners. 
   Let me say in conclusion that this is an important piece of legislation that will promote the growth of online commerce by protecting consumers and providing clarity in the law for trademark owners in cyberspace. It is a balanced bill that protects the rights of Internet users and the interests of all Americans in free speech and protected uses of trademarked names for such things as parody, comment, criticism, comparative advertising, news reporting, etc. It reflects many hours of discussions with senators and affected parties on all sides. Let me thank Senator LEAHY for his work in crafting this particular measure, as well as Senator ABRAHAM for his cooperation in this effort, and all the other cosponsors of the bill and the substitute amendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee last week. I look forward to my colleagues' support of this measure and to working with them to get this important bill promoting e-commerce and online consumer protection through the Senate and enacted into law.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the proposed amendment that would effectively extend the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and open the door to the creation of additional interstate dairy compacts. I urge my colleagues to vote against the cloture motion. These interstate compacts would allow states to form alliances that would create economic barriers and foster economic warfare between the states. First, I want to commend my colleagues for their efforts on behalf of their states. In particular, Senator JEFFORDS has been a forceful advocate for dairy compacts. But although I share the concerns of my colleagues for the future of all American farmers, we cannot authorize interstate compacts that would encourage activities which are contrary to the constitutional principle of establishing and maintaining a national free market for the products of all citizens. 
   To date, only one dairy compact, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, has been authorized by Congress. It initially passed as an amendment in conference to the 1996 farm bill, after the Senate had stripped the compact language out of the bill on the Senate floor. The compact authorization was for 2 years only, but was extended last year, until October 1, 1999, by an amendment to appropriations legislation. Since the creation of this compact, a number of state legislatures have authorized the creation of new interstate dairy compacts. And today, once again, an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill has been introduced that would extend the life of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and possibly lead in conference to the authorization of a Southern Compact. 
   The Framers of the Constitution intended the compact clause to help preserve national unity by prohibiting States from entering into interstate compacts without congressional approval. See Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893). Like the commerce clause, the compact clause prevents States from joining forces to the detriment of the national interest. It is true that the overwhelming majority of compacts serve benign purposes that are not intended to insulate States from competition or to harm the national economy, or otherwise adversely affect the national interest. Indeed, Congress has approved hundreds of interstate compacts. These compacts have facilitated nationally beneficial projects such as the development of  highway, railroad, and subway transportation, the construction of bridges, the allocation of water-control rights, the establishment of boundary lines, and protection against forest fires. These are precisely the type of agreements the compact clause was intended to facilitate. 
   The proposed dairy compacts, however, would frustrate, rather than facilitate, free trade among the States. In essence, dairy compacts prohibit interstate competition by preventing non-compact 
   dairy farmers from freely setting the price for their dairy goods sold in compact states. These compacts represent economic protectionism, pure and simple. Indeed, this is an attempt by a group of states to dictate to the rest of the country's dairy farmers the terms under which they can sell their goods into compact regions. It is unimaginable that the Senate would vote to embrace a form of economic protectionism that flies in the face of the Constitutional principle of a free market society. 
   As the Supreme Court stated in H.P. Hood v. DuMond, 336 U.S. 525, 529 (1949):  
   ......our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, is that every farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have free access to every market in the Nation, that no home embargoes will withhold his exports, and no foreign state will by customs duties or regulations exclude them. Likewise, every consumer may look to the free competition from every producing area in the Nation to protect him from exploitation by any. Such was the vision of the Founders .....  
   If we continue to approve dairy compacts, that vision will be forsaken. And, if we continue down this road, I ask my colleagues: ``what's next?'' Will we be asked to protect the poultry industry? Why not protect regional software or Internet companies? If the logic behind these dairy compacts is that states or regions should be allowed to collude to raise artificially the price of dairy products to protect farmers and producers at the expense of the consumer, then why not give certain states or regions the right to collude to raise artificially the prices of other goods and services? Because AOL employs so many people in Maryland and Virginia, shouldn't those two states be permitted to agree to prevent any company from offering Internet access to consumers in Maryland or Virginia at a price below that offered by AOL? The minimum price could be justified by stating its purpose is to protect the jobs created by AOL in these states. Certainly, the argument would go, the purpose is not to eliminate competition--that is just an unfortunate circumstance of protecting an industry that contributes significantly to the states' economies. 
   This hypothetical may sound farfetched, but it is not. The logic is the same: ``We need to protect our state's industries regardless of the effects on competition or consumers.'' No, my colleagues, we simply cannot start down the road of protecting one region's industries against others, regardless of how significant an industry may be to one state's interests. We cannot elevate one region's concerns over the nation's interest in ensuring a stable, free market that thrives on competition. 
   A vote against these compacts is not a vote against dairy farmers. All of the Senators who are opposed to these compacts, myself included, sympathize with the plight of so many of America's farmers who are struggling to stay in business, but we cannot solve this problem by pitting one industry against consumers, or one region against the nation. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I cannot support dairy compacts that allow states to collude to thwart competition, the results of which ultimately harm America's consumers. I urge my colleagues to vote against the dairy compact amendment which would allow less efficient producers in one region of the country to exclude lower priced dairy goods from other regions in an effort to protect their farmers and producers at the expense of consumers. This is not the type of agreements the founders envisioned interstate compacts would facilitate--indeed, it is exactly the type they feared.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this Friday, on the campus of Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah, the family, friends, former associates and successors of Leland M. Perry will gather to honor his quiet but substantial contributions to the dynamic growth and greatness that characterizes BYU. 
   Leland Perry, who marks his 98th birthday on August 23, and who still  lives in Provo, was the director of the physical plant at BYU from April 1947 to July 1957, when he and his late wife, McNone Perry, set their vocations aside for several years to organize and preside over the West Spanish American Mission of the LDS Church. 
   Afterward, Mr. Perry went on to head the physical plant at Ricks College in Idaho, which is also an institution in the system of higher education affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, during that college's explosive building program. From there, he was appointed director of all physical plants in the LDS Church's higher education system, except BYU, until he retired in the mid 1960s. 
   Leland Perry directed BYU's physical plant during a time when the university was beginning an era of enormous growth; and, from the account I have heard, it is clear that he played an important role during that critical period. 
   One especially noteworthy example typifies his vital contributions. In 1955, he learned about a new concept for heating widely spread, isolated buildings, in a more efficient and less costly way, using pressurized water, which was heated to levels much higher than the boiling point, and combined with a method of forced circulation. Until then, steam was commonly used in such settings, delivered through pipes from a central heating plant. Heat engineering was still a young science, so he took it upon himself to learn all he could about this new technique. He then advocated its use in modernizing the BYU physical plant. 
   Leland Perry did such a good job in mastering the concept and then in explaining and advocating the system that his idea was accepted, and BYU because the first university in the United States to install and use it campus-wide. Since then, virtually all other campuses of any size have followed BYU's lead, savings untold millions of dollars for American colleges and universities--and for students--nationwide. 
   At the dedication ceremony for the new system in 1957 former BYU President William F. Edwards said, ``Leland caught the vision of a new idea and had the courage to promote the idea.'' 
   The physical plant of any major facility or complex of buildings is easy to take for granted. We tend not to notice the pipes and the boilers and the controls unless they break down. But they are the structural bones and the circulatory system that make our buildings useful, comfortable, and practical. 
   I might mention that I was a student at BYU during Leland's tenure as plant manager. I confess that I did not fully appreciate at the time that there was heat in the library, the classrooms and in the dorms because of Leland Perry. 
   Leland Perry, like many Utahns, is truly a pioneer. With humility and dedication, he has made the vocation of caring for Utah's physical plant a calling. And, he led the way through the last half of this century and created the standards applied to his successors who will lead us into the next century. 
   I want to join my fellow Utahns and fellow Cougars in commending Leland Perry for his years of service and in wishing him a happy 98th birthday.

   Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct. Millions of Americans live in areas that are not in compliance with air quality standards. The increased motor vehicle traffic anticipated in the four county Wasatch front in my home state of Utah will certainly push us toward non-attainment compliance problems. Promoting the increased use of alternative fuel vehicles is a viable option available to help Utah achieve our clean air objectives. Alternative fuel vehicles represent the cleanest vehicles in the world. Market-based incentives will help encourage the use of such vehicles. I am very pleased to be part of this effort with my colleagues from the Finance Committee and am looking into getting a natural gas car of my own at this very moment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we stand here today to celebrate good news. This country is now facing the longest peacetime expansion in its history; the economy is growing; and the federal government is predicted to be running a surplus of $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years. 
   The news is not all good. We are facing some pressing problems as well. The world is seeing a shift in demographics. The impending retirement of the baby boom generation affects the workplace, retirement policy, and entitlement spending. Most notably, both the Social Security system and Medicare are in financial trouble and need substantive reform. Public debt and the interest payments that go with it are continuing to grow. These issues cannot be ignored because of a strong economy and good times. 
   The bill before us today represents a balanced package that takes into account the problems as well as sharing in the good times. The bill will provide fiscally responsible tax relief over the next ten years while reducing the public debt $200 billion more than the President's budget and still save the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus. 
   We all agree that the Social Security surplus should be reserved for the Social Security system. That is not the debate. The big debate here today is how do we best handle the non-Social Security surplus in the federal budget. 
   Many of my colleagues have argued that this bill is too large--that $792 billion is too much. They argue that we should save this money for Medicare and other spending. I strongly disagree. It is important that we not forget those who are responsible for the surplus--hard-working, over-paying taxpayers. After all, what is a surplus--it is excess revenues over the amount needed to fund government operations. 
   Taxes in this country are at their highest levels since World War II. American families have seen the percentage of their personal income that goes to pay taxes grow from 23 percent in 1990 to 26%. The average taxpayer from Utah, or any other state in America, will pay nearly $7,000 more in taxes over the next 10 years than the federal government needs, excluding the Social Security program. This is where the surplus is coming from--individual taxpayers who are turning over their hard-earned wages to pay taxes. It is only fair that we return this surplus to the rightful owners. After all, we would expect the electric or power company to rebate an overpayment, we should be able to expect the same from the federal government. 
   The $2.9 trillion surplus is large enough to balance our priorities. The Taxpayer Refund Act shows that we can provide meaningful tax cuts, provide for Medicare reform, and reserve the Social Security surplus. 
   The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 provides a tax refund for everyone who pays taxes by cutting the 15% tax rate and putting more middle class taxpayers into lowest income bracket. 98 million taxpayers, 80 million with annual income under $75,000 would get a tax cut. 
   In addition, 19 million two-earner families filing married returns will see their marriage penalty eliminated. It is sending the wrong signal to American taxpayers when a couple with two incomes in Utah faces a higher tax bill when they marry than they do as singles. 
   The bill also addresses the need for enhanced retirement security through enhanced employer plans and expanded IRAs. The demographics of the American workforce are changing and our pension laws must adapt to meet these new realities. By improving retirement systems to increase access, simplify the rules, increase portability and provide small business incentives, we help employers design and offer pension plans to meet the needs of today's employees. 
   Another important enhancement to our retirement security is making tax-preferred savings more widely available through expanded IRAs. This is particularly true for those without employer-provided pension and middle income taxpayers. In 1994, the median income of families owning an IRA was $48,600--hardly wealthy by any measure. This bill would make it easier for people to increase their savings for retirement. 
   This tax bill helps our families struggling to finance a quality education for themselves and their children through tax-free treatment for participants in college savings or prepaid tuition plans and recipients of employer-provided educational assistance. The bill would also expand the student loan interest deduction. This is real relief that will help make education more affordable. 
   There are important provisions relating to school construction in this bill. The need for more resources and innovative ideas to address the issue of school construction and rehabilitation is reaching crisis proportions. My home state of Utah is expected to build 10-15 new schools a year. In the Jordan school district alone, 6 schools are currently under construction. In addition, Utah will spend $350 million a year in new repairs. This bill would reduce the burden on small school bond issuers in complying with cumbersome arbitrage rebate rules and will allow school districts to engage in public-private partnerships. The reduction in the cost and time of school construction projects will result in more schools being built. 
   We have all heard about the challenge that providing adequate health care that is facing the American families. The Taxpayer Refund Act provides meaningful help for 
   those who are struggling with the costs of insurance through tax benefits for the self-employed, employees not covered by employer plans, and consumers of long-term care insurance. There is also an additional personal exemption for care-givers. 
   The bill also contains provisions that would help keep the economy growth strong. There is a package of international tax relief that provides simplification and helps American companies which have operations overseas remain competitive and continue to grow. 
   The expiring tax credits are extended for five years and the research and experimentation tax credit is made permanent. This tax credit enhances and encourages the development of new technologies and products. This is the only way the U.S. can maintain its leadership in the high-tech world of today into the next millennium. This is very important to future economic growth. It has been said that innovation is the leading factor driving increased productivity and job creation. Innovation predominantly derives from the private sector research and development which are encouraged by the tax credit.  
   This bill is not perfect, however, and there are some things that I would like to change. For instance, the bill does provide some relief from the estate tax by cuts in the top estate tax rate and an exemption that rises to $1.5 million per estate. This will provide tax relief for estates of all sizes. However, I strongly believe that we should go even further and repeal this tax altogether. 
   The ``death tax'' is unfair and inefficient. For every dollar that we collect, roughly 65 cents is spent complying and collecting this tax. This is the wrong way to use up our resources. I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have labeled this a tax on the wealthy. They are wrong. The wealthy hire lawyers and advisers to create trusts and do estate planning to minimize the amount of tax they will pay. It is the small business owners and family farmers that are hit the hardest by this tax. We must find a way to remove this crushing burden from their backs. 
   Another important area that is not addressed in this bill is the capital gains tax rate. This too has often been labeled as a tax cut for the rich. This is not true. Million of Americans are becoming investors. They purchase stock and mutual funds directly or they invest directly through stock options, employee stock ownership plans or 401(k)s. Roughly half of American households now have some sort of stock ownership, and the number grows every year. 
   A recent DRI study has shown that the 1997 capital gains tax rate cuts contributed to the strong economic growth we have experienced in the last couple of years. Cutting the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent reduced the cost of capital, increased business investment and contributed to the increase in stock prices. We need to continue along the same path and continue to reduce the capital gains rates. 
   It is easy to get lost in the debate over numbers and how we should spend the surplus. But we must remember who sent us the revenue that created the surplus. We are talking about families struggling to make ends meet, provide an education for their children, or save for their retirement. They are the family running the corner grocery store or landscaping business. They are bus drivers, day care providers, carpenters and students. They work 3 hours a day on average just to pay their taxes. 
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 is a balanced tax cut package that provides relief for middle class taxpayers. It gives American families a well-deserved tax break, simplifies the tax code, and provides pro-growth incentives to help keep the economy strong and growing. This $792 billion bill is the biggest tax cut since the Ronald Reagan presidency. Yet, it still represents a rebate of only one quarter of the surplus dollars that the federal government has collected. We owe the American taxpayers that much.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, along with my colleague, the Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, to introduce legislation that will address a growing problem for consumers and American businesses online. At issue is the deliberate, bad-faith, and abusive registration of Internet domain names in violation of the rights of trademark owners. for the Net-savy, this burgeoning form of cyber-abuse is known as ``cybersquatting.'' for the average consumer, it is basically fraud, deception, and the bad-faith trading on the goodwill of others. Whatever you call it, it is an issue that has a great impact on American consumers and the brand names they rely on as indications of source, quality, and authenticity. 
   As anyone who has walked down the aisle in the grocery store knows, trademarks serve as the primary indicators of source, quality, and authenticity in the minds of consumers. How else do you explain the price disparity between various brands of toothpaste, laundry detergent, or even canned beans. These brand names are valuable in that they convey to the consumer reliable information regarding the source and quality of goods and services, thereby facilitating commerce and spurring confidence in the marketplace. Unauthorized uses of others' marks undercuts the market by eroding consumer confidence and the communicative value of the brand names we all rely on. For that very reason, Congress has enacted a number of statutes addressing the problems of trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition, trademark dilution, and trademark counterfeiting. Doing so has helped protect American businesses and, more importantly perhaps, American consumers. 
   As we are seeing with increased frequency, the problems of brand-name abuse and consumer confusion are particularly acute in the online environment. The fact is that a consumer in a ``brick and mortar'' world has the luxury of a variety of additional indicators of source and quality aside from a brand name. For example, when one walks in to the local consumer electronics retailer, he is fairly certain with whom he is dealing, and he can often tell by looking at the products and even the storefront itself whether or not he is dealing with a reputable establishment. These protections are largely absent in the electronic world, where anyone with Internet access and minimal computer knowledge can set up a storefront online. 
   In many cases what consumers see when they log on to a site is their only indication of source and authenticity, and legitimate and illegitimate sites may be indistinguishable in cyberspace. In fact, a well-known trademark in a domain name may be the primary source indicator for the online consumer. So it a bad actor is using that name, rather than the trademark owner, an online consumer is at serious risk of being defrauded, or at the very least confused. The result, as with other forms of trademark violations, is the erosion of consumer confidence in brand name identifiers and in electronic commerce generally. 
   Last week the Judiciary Committee heard testimony of a number of examples of consumer confusion on the Internet stemming from abusive domain name registrations. For example, Anne Chasser, President of the International Trademark Association, testified that a cybersquatter had registered the domain names ``attphonecard.com'' and ``attcallingcard.com'' and used those names to establish sites purporting to sell calling cards and soliciting personally identifying information, including credit card numbers. Chris Young, President of Cyveillance, Inc.--a company founded specifically to assist trademark owners police their marks online--testified that a cybersquatter had registered the name ``dellspares.com'' and was purporting to sell Dell products online, when in fact Dell does not authorize online resellers to market its products. We heard similar testimony of an offshore cybersquatter selling web-hosting services under the name ``bellatlantics.com''. And Greg Phillips, a Salt Lake City trademark practitioner that represents Porsche in protecting their famous trademark against what is now more than 300 instances of cybersquatting, testified of several examples where bad actors have registered Porsche marks to sell counterfeit goods and non-genuine Porsche parts.  
   Consider also the child who in a ``hunt-and-peck'' manner mistakenly typed in the domain for ``dosney.com'', looking for the rich and family-friendly content of Disney's home page, only to wind up staring at a page of hard-core pornography because someone snatched up the ``dosney'' domain in anticipation that just such a mistake would be made. In a similar case, a 12-year-old California boy was denied privileges at his school when he entered ``zelda.com'' in a web browser at his school library, looking for a site he expected to be affiliated with the computer game of the same name, but ended up at a pornography site. 
   In addition to these types of direct harm to consumers, cybersquatting harms American businesses and the goodwill value associated with their names. In part this is a result of the fact that in each case of consumer confusion there is a case of brand-name misappropriation and an erosion of goodwill. But, even absent consumer confusion, there are many many cases of cybersquatters who appropriate brand names with the sole intent of extorting money from the lawful mark owner, of precluding evenhanded competition, or even very simply of harming the goodwill of the mark. 
   For example, a couple of years ago a small Canadian company with a single shareholder and a couple of dozen domain names demanded that Umbro International, Inc., which markets and distributes soccer equipment, pay $50,000 to its sole shareholder, $50,000 to a charity, and provide a lifetime supply of soccer equipment in order for it to relinquish the ``umbro.com'' name. Warner Bros. was reportedly asked to pay $350,000 for the rights to the names ``warner-records.com'', ``warner-bros-records.com'', ``warner-pictures.com'', ``warner-bros-pictures'', and ``warnerpictures.com''. And Intel Corporation was forced to deal with a cybersquatter who registered the ``pentium3.com'' domain and used it to post pornographic images of celebrities. 
   It is time for Congress to take a closer look at these abuses and to respond with appropriate legislation. In the 104th Congress, Senator LEAHY and I sponsored the ``Federal Trademark Dilution Act,'' which has proved useful in assisting the owners of famous trademarks to police online uses of their marks that dilute their distinctive quality. Unfortunately, the 
   economics of litigation have resulted in a situation where it is often more cost-effective to simply ``pay off'' a cybersquatter rather than pursue costly litigation with little hope of anything more than an injunction against the offender. And cybersquatters are becoming more sophisticated and more creative in evading what good case law has developed under the dilution statute. 
   The bill I am introducing today with the Senator from Vermont is designed to address these problems head on by clarifying the rights of trademark owners online with respect to cybersquatting, by providing clear deterrence to prevent such bad faith and abusive conduct, and by providing adequate remedies for trademark owners in those cases where it does occur. While the bill shares the goals of, and has some similarity to, legislation introduced earlier by Senator ABRAHAM, it differs in a number of substantial respects. 
   First, like Senator ABRAHAM's legislation, our bill allows trademark owners to recover statutory damages in cybersquatting cases, both to deter wrongful conduct and to provide adequate remedies for trademark owners who seek to enforce their rights in court. Our bill goes beyond simply stating the remedy, however, and sets forth a substantive cause of action, based in trademark law, to define the wrongful conduct sought to be deterred and to fill in the gaps and uncertainties of current trademark law with respect to cybersquatting. 
   Under our bill, the abusive conduct that is made actionable is appropriately limited to bad faith registrations of others' marks by persons who seek to profit unfairly from the goodwill associated therewith. In addition, the bill balances the property interests of trademark owners with the interests of Internet users who would make fair use of others' marks or otherwise engage in protected speech online. Our bill also limits the definition of domain name identifier to exclude such things as screen names, file names, and other identifiers not assigned by a domain name registrar or registry. it also omits criminal penalties found in Senator ABRAHAM's earlier legislation. 
   Second, our bill provides for in rem jurisdiction, which allows a mark owner to seek the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of an infringing domain name by filing an in rem action against the name itself, where the mark owner has satisfied the court that it has exercised due diligence in trying to locate the owner of the domain name but is unable to do so. A significant problem faced by trademark owners in the fight against cybersquatting is the fact that many cybersquatters register domain names under aliases or otherwise provide false information in their registration applications in order to avoid identification and service of process by the mark owner. Our bill will alleviate this difficulty, while protecting the notions of fair play and substantial justice, by enabling a mark owner to seek an injunction against the infringing property in those cases where, after due diligence, a mark owner is unable to proceed against the domain name registrant because the registrant has provided false contact information and is otherwise not to be found. 
   Additionally, some have suggested that dissidents and others who are online incognito for legitimate reasons might give false information to protect themselves and have suggested the need to preserve a degree of anonymity on the Internet particularly for this reason. Allowing a 
   trademark owner to proceed against the domain names themselves, provided they are, in fact, infringing or diluting under the Trademark Act, decreases the need for trademark owners to join the hunt to chase down and root out these dissidents or others seeking anonymity on the Net. The approach in our bill is a good compromise, which provides meaningful protection to trademark owners while balancing the interests of privacy and anonymity on the Internet. 
   Third, like the Abraham bill, our bill encourages domain name registrars and registries to work with trademark owners to prevent cybersquatting by providing a limited exemption from liability for domain name registrars and registries that suspend, cancel, or transfer domain names pursuant to a court order or in the implementation of a reasonable policy prohibiting the registration of infringing domain names. Our bill goes further, however, in order to protect the rights of domain name registrants against overreaching trademark owners. Under our bill, a trademark owner who knowingly and materially misrepresents to the domain name registrar or registry that a domain name is infringing is liable to the domain name registrant for damages resulting from the suspension, cancellation, or transfer of the domain name. Our bill also promotes the continued ease and efficiency users of the current registration system enjoy by codifying current case law limiting the secondary liability of domain name registrars and registries for the act of registration of a domain name. 
   Finally, our bill includes an explicit savings clause making clear that the bill does not affect traditional trademark defenses, such as fair use, or a person's first amendment rights, and it ensures that any new remedies created by the bill will apply prospectively only. 
   Mr. President, this bill is an important piece of legislation that will promote the growth of online commerce by protecting consumers and providing clarity in the law for trademark owners in cyberspace. It is a balanced bill that protects the rights of Internet users and the interests of all Americans in free speech and protected uses of trademarked names for such things as parody, comment, criticism, comparative advertising, news reporting, etc. It reflects many hours of discussions with senators and affected parties on all sides. I want to thank Senator LEAHY for his cooperation in crafting this particular measure, and also Senator ABRAHAM for his cooperation in this effort. I expect that the substance of this bill will be offered as a Committee substitute to Senator ABRAHAM's legislation when the Judiciary Committee turns to that bill tomorrow, and I look forward to broad bipartisan support at that time. I similarly  look forward to working with my other colleagues here in the Senate to report this bill favorably to the House, and I urge their support in this regard.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hope and expect that cloture will be invoked shortly. It is my understanding that we will then proceed to the appointment of conferees for the juvenile crime bill, which is something I have been working on with the majority leader for some time. I commend the leader for his commitment to this bill, and I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for allowing the Senate to work its will. 
   I appreciate the arguments my colleagues have made and agree with much of what they said. But, in the end, the Senate and House have passed different juvenile crime bills, and it is a conference committee's task to reconcile those differences. It will be a difficult challenge since the Senate has an obligation to advocate for its position. Yet--at the same time--we must recognize that the House passed a bill which contains different cultural reform proposals, less spending, and no gun control provisions. In fact, the House defeated a separate gun control bill. 
   We must do our best to reconcile these bills. In the end, I hope and trust that this conference committee will produce a vehicle that the House, the Senate, and the President can support. If, however, some in positions of leadership and responsibility are unwilling to search for common ground and are content to simply politicize this issue, the change to do something meaningful for our Nation's children may slip through our hands. I hope that does not happen and I hope that we can come together for the sake of our children. 
   I want to say yet again that this is one of the most important bills that Congress will consider this year. The Judiciary Committee has worked on juvenile crime legislation for more than two years. The committee marked up the predecessor to S. 254 for nearly two months last Congress. And as you are aware, the Senate spend 2 full weeks this spring debating S. 254. 
   In 1997, juveniles accounted for nearly one-fifth of all criminal arrests in the United States. Juveniles committed 13.5 percent of all murders, more than 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 30 percent of all robberies, and 50 percent of all arsons. In particular, schools are becoming more and more dangerous. Fifteen percent of students have reported being victimized at school. Additionally, more than half of the Nation's public schools have reported that a crime had been committed on the premises. 
   Sadly, the killings at Columbine High School last Spring are not an isolated event. Similar shootings have occurred in recent years at schools in Pearl, Mississippi, which left two dead, West Paducah, Kentucky, which left three dead, Jonesboro, Arkansas, which left five dead, Edinboro, Pennsylvania, which left one dead, and Springfield, Oregon, which left two dead.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the death of the Arab world's longest-standing leader, King Hassan II of Morocco, who died last Friday at the age of 70. To his family, and to the people of Morocco, I extend my heartfelt condolences. 
   King Hassan ruled Morocco for 38 years as only the second King of Morocco in that country's modern, independent history, having succeeded to the throne after the death of his father, King Mohammed V, in 1961, only five years after Morocco gained its independence from the French. 
   Morocco, however, is an ancient country and the country with which the United States has its oldest uninterrupted diplomatic relations. Our two countries signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1786, which the United States ratified the following year. Thus began a relationship that provided our tall ships a haven in the 18th century and developed into a relationship of geostrategic importance in the 20th century. 
   This special friendship was cherished in modern times by leaders in both of our countries, particularly King Hassan, and I was pleased to see that President Clinton, along with former President Bush, attended King Hassan's funeral this weekend. America lost a good friend, a wise counsel on the region, and an important and brave promoter for peace in the Middle East. 
   One of the biggest challenges for the Arab world, as in other parts of the world, has been the challenge of modernization, and how leaders encourage their governments and societies to rise to this challenge. 
   We have seen several models: secular socialist dictatorships, radical fundamentalist regimes, and traditional authoritarians. King Hassan, whose remarkable career spanned from the era of decolonization to the doorstep of the next century, demonstrated that the traditional model could adapt to the economic and political challenges of modernization. He understood that tradition was not the enemy of the modern, but could ease the transition by providing stability and respect for his people while allowing political and economic reforms to unleash the fundamental strengths and dreams of his people. 
   For his adept stewardship, he earned the deep and sincere affection of the vast majority of Morocco's nearly 30 million citizens. 
   Beginning as a traditional authoritarian, the King recognized the importance of constitutional governance early in his reign and expanded political rights through the years. In doing so, he was one of the most successful leaders in the Arab world in reconciling traditional monarchy with the requisites and demands of modernity. King Hassan in recent years had furthered political reform such that, today, the lower house of parliament is elected through universal suffrage from a roster of multiple parties, and the governing coalition, including the Prime Minister, is controlled by the opposition. 
   Concomitant with these political reforms has been a steady improvement  in the human rights situation, marked, in some significant cases, by reconciliation with and compensation for victims of the past. While power still resides predominantly with the crown, King Hassan, by advancing political democracy and the free market, allowed his people and provided his son, King Mohammed VI, with the fundamental platform on which Morocco will proceed confidently into the next century. 
   Mr. President, no remarks on the legacy of King Hassan can be complete without recognizing his prescient view of reconciliation between Israel and the Arab world. Many note that some of the initial meetings preparing for the signing of the historic Camp David accords occurred with King Hassan in Morocco. The fact is that the King of Morocco had been providing opportunities for encounters and dialogue for years before then, showing that the King had a wise vision for peace as well as a pragmatist's approach for moving toward this noble goal. 
   From the 1960s to the late Prime Minister Rabin's visit to Morocco in 1993--which was, by the way, only the second Arab nation visited by an Israeli leader, after Egypt--King Hassan of Morocco demonstrated that he recognized the permanent role that the Jewish state had to play in the affairs of the Middle East. In this, as in many other areas, King Hassan was a leader among leaders. 
   Morocco's new king, King Mohammed VI, has many challenges before him. He, along with King Abdallah of Jordan, represents the new generation of leaders in the region: highly educated, understanding the West, cognizant of the realities of the region, and faced with enormous domestic economic challenges. Morocco's is a youthful population, straddled with an unacceptably high illiteracy rate and an unyielding demand for economic development. These are extremely tough challenges to burden a new and young king. But let us recall the youth of King Hassan when he assumed the throne in 1961 and the misplaced doubts about his future. We recognize today the legacy of King Hassan to his son and his nation. 
   The United States should assist in the continuing modernization of Morocco and the continuing cooperation to create a more peaceful Middle East. So should continue a special relationship into the 21st century that began so propitiously in the 18th.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, late last week, Senior Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals passed away at his home in Montgomery, Alabama. Judge Johnson will be remembered for his courageous stands in some of the most difficult struggles of the Civil Rights era. At a time when men of lesser fortitude would have avoided direct confrontation on the highly unpopular issues of school desegregation and voting rights for African-Americans, Judge Johnson stood firm on his convictions and the law. 
   Soon after his appointment to the district court by President Eisenhower in 1955, Johnson took the courageous step of striking down the Montgomery law that had mandated that Rosa Parks sit in the back of a city bus. He believed that ``separate, but equal'' was inherently unequal. Judge Johnson upheld the constitutionality of federal laws granting African-Americans the right to vote in Alabama elections. He believed in the concept of ``one man, one vote.'' 
   Despite tremendous pressure from Governor George Wallace, Judge Johnson allowed the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery to proceed despite threats of continued civil unrest and violence. The national fervor that followed the march resulted in the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
   Today, around a courthouse that bears Frank Johnson's name in Montgomery, there are integrated schools, buses, and lunch counters. Truly representative democracy flourishes in Alabama with African-American state, county, and municipal officials who won their offices in fair elections with the votes of African-American and white citizens. In large part because of Judge Johnson, attitudes that were once intolerant and extreme have dissipated, but the example he set has not. 
   The members of the Judiciary Committee extend our deepest sympathies to Judge Johnson's family and the host of friends that he had across the country. We will always remember this federal judge for exemplifying unwavering moral courage in the advancement of the wholly American ideal that ``all men are created equal'' and deserve ``equal protection of the laws.''

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I noted that Senator DASCHLE used a quotation from a statement I made last fall concerning the Omnibus Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1990 in his arguments for his amendment to S. Res. 160. 
   I am flattered that he felt my words were of such import that he had them blown up to poster size and displayed them for all to see. I wish he would do that with all of my speeches. 
   In this case, however, I just wish he had quoted the entire statement. Although I, like many of our colleagues, expressed genuine frustration with the unusual process that resulted in the Omnibus Appropriations bill, my statement also defends it as necessary to prevent a devastating government shutdown. I regret that Senator DASCHLE took this excerpt out of context. Those who read my entire statement will see that it provides a much different position than what the Minority Leader suggests by excerpting this small section.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the LUGAR-Graham-Mack amendment to restore funding to the National Endowment for Democracy. I rise as an unwavering supporter of the Endowment since that day in 1982, when President Ronald Reagan announced his intent to create an institution to promote abroad the most fundamental of American political values --democracy. 
   Since the Endowment was instituted the following year, it has received overwhelming bipartisan support. On six occasions the Senate has debated funding for the NED; on all six occasions the Senate has reaffirmed its commitment. We most recently debated funding the Endowment in 1997 and reaffirmed our support for it in a vote of 72-27. I expect that today the Senate will once again go on record demonstrating support for this venerable institution. 
   Support for the NED goes beyond bipartisan politics. Rarely is there such near-unanimity in the so-called ``foreign policy establishment.'' But, in recent years, we have seen seven former Secretaries of State from both Republican and Democratic presidents--Secretaries Eagleburger, Baker, Haig, Kissinger, Muskie, Shultz and Vance--co-sign a letter in support of the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   But the NED's support extends well beyond the Beltway into American society at large. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the Endowment, recognizing that the promotion of democracy requires the rule of law, on which all fundamental, productive commercial activity rests. The AFL-CIO is also a principal supporter of the NED, recognizing the inseparable bond between the advancement of democracy and the protection of independent labor's right to organize. 
   Both of these organizations, along with the Republican and Democrat parties, form the core groups through which the NED coordinates programs currently active in over 80 countries of the world. 
   Further, support for the NED is widespread among our nation's media, editorialists and academics. How often, Mr. President, do we see editorials in support of an institution on the pages of liberal and conservative media? There has recently been editorial support for NED expressed by The Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times. I ask unanimous consent that the editorials be added at the conclusion of my statement.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I often detect confusion in foreign policy debate between the concepts of ``interest'' and ``values.'' For example, the President, at the end of Operation Allied Force over Yugoslavia, declared it an operation in support of our values. I disagree: The NATO actions in Kosovo, which I supported, protected American interests, specifically our interests in a stable southeastern Europe. 
   The fact is that defining America's national interest is more fundamental than the promotion of democracy. But the reality is, Mr. President, that where we find democracy we are more likely to find it easier to protect our interests. 
   For this reason, the advancement of democracy as a foreign policy goal has by no means been diminished by the end of the Cold War. I supported the actions of the NED during the Cold War, along with members of both parties. I worked with the NED and International Labor Organization supporting the nascent Solidarity movement in the early 1980s and am deeply proud of the work done by NED's early grantees. 
   But the world is more complicated, with more challenges to U.S. interests, in the post-Cold War era. We need the NED more than ever. And if we look around this complicated globe, we see that NED's activities are complementing our foreign policy. 
   China is perhaps the most vexing challenge this country faces. We cannot determine the direction political evolution in China will take. We hope for the day when democracy spreads to the mainland. 
   Our dear friends in Taiwan, after all, have demonstrated that Chinese political culture is by no means alien to democracy. But on the mainland, the goals of political reform are murky. We don't know what the outcome will be in the next century--it may be democracy, it may be fascism, it may be something else. 
   There is evidence to be optimistic, as we see the increasing manifestations of grassroots democracy and openness. Unfortunately, there is also evidence to be skeptical, given official actions that imprison democratic activists, outlaw non-political organizations, and threaten aggression against us and our friends. My attitude has always been to plan for the worst, but work for the best possible outcome. 
   One of those ways to work for the best possible outcome is to support the NED, which has promoted democracy in China since its inception. A brief and incomplete list of NED's activities in China would include: 
   Supporting, as one of its first grants, a Chinese-language journal that circulated in China in the mid-1980s; 
   Supporting a New York-based human rights group, Human Rights in China, which assembled basic data on conditions in China; 
   Assisting Harry Wu's Laogai Research Foundation, which exposed the abhorrent abuses in China's prison labor system; and, 
   Contributing to the Tibetan Human Rights Foundation.  
   In addition, my colleagues who have read the fascinating reports by the International Republican Institute on their work advising on and monitoring village level elections in China will recognize a practical and profoundly significant activity funded by the Endowment. These are among many, many other programs supported by the NED in China. 
   The skeptics can say that NED's activities are small in comparison to Beijing's power to suppress. That is true. But my view is that it is always better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and the NED has been providing light and support to democrats in China, throughout Asia, and all around the world. 
   Indonesia just had its first free and open elections in over 40 years. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world after China, India and the United States. 
   As a result of this election, a country that has historically had good relations with us, a country that remains of great geostrategic importance, is now set to become the world's third largest democracy. Indonesia is a country with which we've had shared interests; those interests are now advanced because we now have shared political values. The ruling and opposition parties consulted with the NED throughout the period leading to these historic elections. 
   I could go on and on about NED's activities promoting democracy around the world. I will simply add one more example: Three weeks ago a remarkable conference on emerging democracies was held in Yemen. Yemen, my colleagues will recall, was divided until 1990--South Yemen was one of the most radical countries in the Arab world. 
   Since reunification in 1990, the NED has worked through its core institutes, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, to support that country's transition to democracy. Yemen has had two parliamentary elections and is today one of the few Arab nations that has universal suffrage. 
   The government of Yemen deserves the credit for this remarkable political evolution and deserves the support of the United States. But we should be proud, very proud, of the efforts that the NED has expounded in assisting this political reform. And, three weeks ago, when representatives from around the world convened in Yemen to see that this nation of 18 million can enhance its culture and empower its people through democracy, it was appropriate that they saw the NED as a supporter of democracy there, and everywhere. 
   In recognition of these and other activities, brave democracy proponents around the world--individuals that Congress regularly lauds, that we regularly bring to the Hill for their perspectives on their parts of the world--these individuals have spoken of the need to preserve the NED. 
   Hong Kong's Martin Lee, Chinese human rights activist Harry Wu, Vietnamese human rights activist Vo Van Ai, his Eminence the Dalai Lama have all declared the fundamental and irreplaceable importance of the NED in trying to advance democratic values in China, in Asia, around the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to think of these individuals as they determine whether the Senate should continue to support funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   In every region of the world where the U.S. has interests or is challenged--in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq--there are people striving and risking their lives for democratic expression. They see the United States as a role model. 
   The NED is actively working with all of these people, and in doing so, demonstrates America's--and Congress's--commitment to their causes. I urge my colleagues to continue their support for this important institution.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I won't take long. The amendment exempts juveniles and the mentally ill from the reforms accomplished by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which was passed in 1996. This was my bill. This amendment would subject State prison systems to micromanagement by the Federal courts. Keep in mind, I am also the author of Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons, which is to take care of a lot of these difficulties. I cast the deciding vote back in the late 1970s passing that bill. 
   Currently everyone whose Federal or constitutional rights have been violated retains the ability to bring suit and to have any violation of their rights remedied by a Federal court. All this Congress did in 1996 was to say courts could not go beyond remedying people's Federal rights to micromanage prison systems. 
   I am opposed to this amendment because of that. I know the distinguished Senator from Minnesota is trying to do something right, but basically it flies in the face of what the reform basically says. If true constitutional rights are being violated, they have a right to go to court under current legislation, both in the Civil Rights Act for Institutionalized Persons and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which we passed in 1996. 
   I reluctantly have to oppose this amendment because I believe that basically the current law takes care of it. His amendment would allow micromanagement of the Federal courts. 
   I am happy to yield the floor. I hope my colleagues will vote with me on this, and I believe there will be a motion to table. I hope they will vote to table.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am committed in my view that the Senate must lead and speak against hate crimes. 
   Many of America's greatest strides in civil rights progress took place during recent generations--from Congress' protection of Americans from employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion and national origin with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to the protection of the disabled with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, and many other important pieces of legislation. 
   However, while America's elected officials have striven mightily through the passage of such measures to stop discrimination in the workplace, or to the hands of government actors, what remains tragically unaddressed in large part is discrimination against peoples' own security--that most fundamental right to be free from physical harm. 
   Despite our best efforts, discrimination continues to persist in many forms in this country, but most sadly in the rudimentary and malicious form of violence against individuals because of their identities. 
   As much as we condemn all crime, hate crime can be more sinister than non-hate crime. A crime committed not just to harm an individual, but out of the motive of sending a message of hatred to an entire community--oftentimes a community defined on the basis of immutable traits--is appropriately punished more harshly, or in a different manner, than other crimes. Moreover, hate crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes; they inflict deep, lasting and distinct injuries--some of which never heal--on victims and their family members; they incite community unrest; and, ultimately, they are downright un-American. 
   I am resolute in my view that the federal government can play a valuable role in responding to hate crime. One example here is my sponsorship of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, another is the passage in 1996 of the Church Arson Protection Act. 
   Given the seriousness of our objective to eradicate hate crime, it is imperative that any measure abide by the constitutional limitations imposed on Congress, and be cognizant of the limitations on Congress' enumerated powers that are routinely enforced by the courts. This is more true today than it would have been even a mere decade ago, given the significant revival by the U.S. Supreme Court of the federalism doctrine in a string of decisions beginning in 1992. 
   I have therefore proposed a response to hate crimes that is not only as effective as possible, but that carefully navigates the rocky shoals of these  court decisions. To that end, I have prepared a measure that I believe will be not only an effective one, but one that would avoid altogether the constitutional risks that attach to other possible federal responses that have been raised. 
   There are four principal components to my approach: 
   First, it creates a meaningful partnership between the federal government and the states in combating hate crime, by establishing within the Justice Department a fund to assist state and local authorities in investigating and prosecuting hate crime. Much of the cited justification given by those who advocate broad federal jurisdiction over hate crimes is a lack of adequate resources at the state and local level. 
   Accordingly, before we take the step of making every criminal offense motivated by a hatred of someone's immutable traits a federal offense, it is imperative that we equip states and localities with the resources necessary so that they can undertake these criminal investigations and prosecutions on their own. 
   Second, my approach undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the raw data that has been collected pursuant to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, including a comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--some with hate crime laws, others without--to determine whether there is, in fact, a problem in certain states' prosecution of those criminal acts constituting hate crimes. 
   Third, my approach directs an appropriate, neutral forum to develop a model hate crimes statute that would enable states to evaluate their own laws, and adopt--in whole or in part from the model statute--hate crime legislation at the state level. 
   One of the arguments cited for a federalization of enforcement is the varying scope and punitive force of state laws. Yet there are many areas of grave national concern--such as drank driving, by way of example--that are appropriately left to the states for criminal enforcement and punishment. 
   Before we make all hate crimes federal offenses, I believe we should pursue avenues that advance consistency among the states through the voluntary efforts of their legislatures. Perhaps, upon completion of this model hate crime law, Congress will review its recommendation and consider additional ways to promote uniformity among the states. 
   Fourth, my proposal makes a long-overdue modification of our existing federal hate crime law (passed in 1969) to allow for the prosecution by federal authorities of those hate crimes that are classically within federal jurisdiction--that is, hate crimes in which state lines have been crossed. 
   I believe that passage of this comprehensive measure will prove a strong antidote to the scourge of hate crimes. 
   It is no answer for the Senate to sit by silently while these crimes are being committed. The ugly, bigoted, and violent underside of some in our country that is reflected by the commission of hate crimes must be combated at all levels of government. 
   For some, federal leadership necessitates federal control. I do not subscribe to this view, especially when it comes to this problem. It has been proposed by some that to combat hate crime Congress should enact a new tier of far-reaching federal criminal legislation. That approach strays from the foundations of our constitutional structure--namely, the first principles of federalism that for more than two centuries have vested states with primary responsibility for prosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries. 
   As important as this issue is, there is little evidence such a step is warranted, or that it will do any more than what I have proposed. In fact, one could argue that national enforcement of hate crime could decrease if states are told the federal government has assumed primary responsibility over hate crime enforcement. 
   Accordingly, we must lead--but lead responsibly--recognizing that we live in a country of governments of shared and divided responsibilities. 
   I encourage this body to question the dogma that federal leadership must include federal control, and I encourage this body to act anew by supporting a proposal that is far-reaching in its efforts to stem hate crime, and that is at the same time respectful of the primacy states have traditionally enjoyed in prosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries. 
   My proposal should unite all of us on the one point about which we should most fervently agree--that the Senate must speak firmly and meaningfully in denouncing as wrong in all respects those actions we have increasingly come to know as hate crimes. Our continued progress in fighting to protect Americans' civil rights demands no less. 
   I take note that there are now two different hate crime measures that have been accepted by the Senate. It is my hope that the conference will consider the Hatch amendment's approach to be the wiser and the more responsible, and accordingly adopt it. Alternatively, however, it is my hope that some accord might be reached between the two versions that respects the constitutional and federalism boundaries I have discussed, and to the extent it is not, I may choose to pursue adoption of my measure through the Judiciary Committee.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address the funding for the Judicial Branch for fiscal year 2000. The Appropriations Committee that worked on this budget has done an outstanding job with limited resources and very demanding budget requests. Senators STEVENS, GREGG, BYRD, and HOLLINGS, and their staffs, are to be commended for doing a very difficult job in a professional manner that does credit to the Senate. 
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have a special interest in this budget. And I agree with most of the Senate bill. The Senate bill fully funds compensation for judges. This is required by the Constitution. 
   The Senate bill fully funds judges' staffs. This is appropriate because judges cannot operate without their law clerks and secretaries. 
   The Senate bill fully funds the rental costs of court facilities leased from the General Services Administration. This is appropriate because we must have courtrooms for judges and their staffs to work in. 
   Further, the Senate bill appropriately reduces funding for certain expenditure requests that were not critically needed. 
   However, the Senate bill underfunds court support staff and operating expenses for the circuit and district courts by a net 257 million dollars. 
   The Judiciary's budget request was for maintaining the current level of services by support staff. The support staff is needed to handle high levels of criminal cases, bankruptcy cases, pretrial services, and supervised release services. These duties are not going away. The Judiciary is required by law to continue to address each of these areas. Moreover, I note that the Judiciary's budget request does not even take into account the increased workload that new legislation, like the Juvenile Crime Bill, will place on the federal courts. 
   The Judiciary cannot maintain the current level of services in the Courts of Appeal and District Courts without some portion of the 257 million dollar shortfall being replaced. 
   I request that over the next few months we work together to provide the Judiciary with additional funding for support staff on the Courts of Appeal and the District Courts. 
   I am also concerned about a deeper problem that exists with the budget process for the Judiciary. 
   Current law requires the Executive Branch to submit the Judiciary's annual budget request to Congress ``without change.'' Nonetheless, the Administration's Office of Management and Budget indirectly decreases the Judiciary's budget request through the use of negative allowances. 
   The Judicial Branch should be required to be responsible in its budget requests, and I believe they are. But, the Judicial Branch's budget should not be subject to reductions by the Executive Branch to fund the political priorities of the President. Current law prohibits such reductions, but the Administration does not follow this law. This is a systemic problem that I hope we can address in the future along with the Judiciary's current-year budget needs. 
   As legislators, it is our duty under Article I of the Constitution to provide sufficient funds so that the federal courts established under Article III of the Constitution are effective and federal law is upheld. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address these issues in the next few months.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would provide critical and direct improvements to the competitiveness of the over 2.1 million S corporations nationwide. The vast majority of S corporations operate as small businesses. By 1995, they comprised 48 percent of all corporations. In my home state of Utah, S corporations make up half of the 21,600 corporations in the state. 
   Despite the reforms that were enacted in 1996 and in previous years, the tax laws that currently govern S corporations remain too restrictive, complex, and burdensome, particularly in comparison with the laws that are imposed on other entities. As a result, Mr. President, many of these small businesses are unable to attract sufficient capital and to grow to their full potential. 
   For example, the inability to issue preferred stock denies S corporations access to badly needed senior equity. Capital is also eliminated by a requirement that prevents straight debt from being converted into stock. Substantial reforms need to be enacted to ensure better competition for small businesses in today's increasingly sophisticated and global economy. 
   Mr. President, the current law is threatening the multi-generational family business in our country. Law allows only for 75 shareholders under an S corporation, and each member of a family is currently treated as a single, distinct shareholder. In addition, nonresident aliens are not allowed as shareholders. This ban on nonresident alien shareholders is an outmoded restriction dating back to the creation of Subchapter S. Since that time, partnerships have been allowed to involve nonresidential aliens. And, as the economy becomes more global, S corporations will be at a disadvantage relative to the more flexible partnerships. Mr. President, this bill would eliminate these outdated provisions and allow for all family members to be counted as one shareholder for purposes of S corporation eligibility, as well as permitting nonresident aliens to be shareholders. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review and support the Subchapter S Revision Act. This legislation will help American families pass their businesses from one generation to the next and to create a level playing field for small business. We should not allow the more than 10,000 S corporations in my home state, as well as the many others across the country, to be subject to rules and regulations that limit their competitiveness. I am looking forward to working with my fellow members of the Finance Committee in enacting this bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to day to introduce the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, a very important piece of legislation in America's on-going war on drugs. Three years ago I introduced the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Act of 1999, which this body passed, to address the frightening and very real problem of methamphetamine abuse in this country. That legislation has provided law enforcement with necessary tools to combat methamphetamine and has helped us track and slow the proliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing and abuse. However, there remain too many people in this country who are determined to undermine our drug laws and turn America into one colossal metamphetamine laboratory. For this reason, I, along with Senators FEINSTEIN, DEWINE, BOND, THURMOND, BIDEN, BRYAN, and REID, are introducing this bipartisan bill that seeks to shield America against the proliferation of methamphetamine Manufacturing. 
   The methamphetamine threat differs in kind from the threat of other illegal drugs because methamphetamine can be made from readily available and legal chemicals and substances, and because it poses serious dangers to both human life and to the environment. America's history of fighting illegal drugs has been long and tiring but with so many young Americans still being exposed to so many destructive drugs, now is not the time to give up--it is a time to fight smarter and harder. The provisions of this bill will provide law enforcement with several effective tools that will help us turn the tide of proliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing in America. 
   Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of illegal drugs consumed in America has been manufactured outside of our borders and then illegally smuggled into America. The rapid spread and growing use of methamphetamine threatens to change the future of where drugs are manufactured. Drug pushers are threatening to turn America into a producing country of a drug that affects the lives of every American because it not only destroys the lives of those who use the drug, but also can have devastating effects on people situated around lab sites, on law enforcement officials that have to clean the labs, and on the environment. 
   According to a report prepared by the Community Epidemiology Work Group, which is part of the National Institute  on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine ``abuse levels remain high ..... and there is strong evidence to suggest this drug will continue to be a problem in West Coast areas and to spread to other areas of the United States.'' the reasons given for the ominous prediction are that methamphetamine can be produced easily in small, clandestine labs and the chemicals used to make 
   methamphetamine are readily available. 
   This threat is real and immediate, and the numbers are telling. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, the number of labs cleaned up by the Administration has almost doubled each year since 1995. Last year 5,786 amphetamine and methamphetamine labs were seized by DEA and State and local law enforcement officials, and millions of dollars were spent on cleaning up the pollutants and toxins created and left behind by operators of these labs. In Utah alone, there were 266 lab seizures last year, a number which elevated Utah to the unenviable position of being ranked third among all states for higher per capita clan lab seizures. The problem with the high number of manufacturing labs is compounded by the fact that the chemicals and substances utilized in the manufacturing process are unstable, volatile, and highly combustible. The smallest amounts of these chemicals, when mixed improperly, can cause explosions and fires. And of course, those operating these labs are not scientists, but rather unskilled, ignorant, criminals and fly-by-nights who are completely apathetic to the destructive powers that are inherent in the manufacturing process. This fact is even more frightening when you consider that most of these labs are situated in residences, motels, trailers, and vans. 
   Let me take a moment to highlight some of the provisions of this bill that will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in preventing the proliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing in America. 
   First, the bill will bolster the DEA's ability to combat the manufacturing and trafficking of methamphetamine and other drugs by authorizing the hiring of new agents to carry out a variety of anti-drug initiatives. Agents will be hired to assist State and local law enforcement officials in small and mid-sized communities in all phases of methamphetamine manufacturing investigations. Due to the large number of manufacturers and traffickers that are setting up shop in small and rural cities, law enforcement agencies located in these areas are in dire need of the DEA's expert guidance and knowledge of methamphetamine investigations, including assistance in interrogating suspects, conducting surveillance operations, and collecting evidence to build a case. This bill also authorizes the expansion of the number of DEA resident offices and posts-of-duty, which are smaller DEA offices often set up in small and rural cities that are overwhelmed by methamphetamine manufacturing and trafficking. 
   Another way this legislation will help the DEA assist State and local officials is to provide for the training of State and local law enforcement personnel in techniques used in methamphetamine investigations and to provide them with certification training in handling the dangerously-volatile and toxic wastes produced by methamphetamine labs. It also provides for the creation of another DEA program that will enable 
   certain State and local law enforcement officials to recertify other law enforcement in their regions. These programs are authorized for a three year period and designed to pass on the DEA's knowledge and expertise to State and local officials so that they can become more independent of the DEA and thereafter rely rather on each other in combating the scourge of methamphetamine manufacturing. 
   This bill contains many references to the drug amphetamine, a lesser known, but equally dangerous drug. Because the process of manufacturing amphetamine is as dangerous as manufacturing methamphetamine, this bill seeks to equalize the punishment for manufacturing the two drugs. Other than being slightly less potent, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and used in the same manner as methamphetamine. In fact, many times a person can set out to manufacture a batch of methamphetamine and end up with amphetamine if just one precursor chemical is used in place of another. When this happens, drug dealers sell amphetamine as methamphetamine and users buy and use it thinking it is methamphetamine. The dangers posed to the environment are also the same. Amphetamine labs have the same destructing and polluting ability as methamphetamine labs. Every law enforcement officer with whom I have spoken, including federal and State prosecutors and federal and State law enforcement officials, agreed that the penalties for amphetamine should be the same as those for methamphetamine. 
   Another important section of this bill will assist in preventing the manufacture of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs by banning the dissemination of drug ``recipes'' and other demonstrative information relating to the manufacturing and use of controlled substances. The dissemination of this type of information is prohibited if the intent of the person disseminating the information is for it to be used for, or in furtherance of, a federal crime or if the person disseminating the information has knowledge that the person receiving the information intends to use the information for, or in furtherance, of a federal crime. Currently, there are hundreds of sites on the Internet that instruct how to manufacture methamphetamine and other illegal drugs, including what ingredients are required, what instruments or equipment is needed, and how to combine precisely the ingredients. These step-by-step instructions will be illegal under this bill if the person posting the information or the person receiving the information intends to engage in activity that violates our drug laws. 
   I was shocked to discover that those who embrace the drug counter-culture these days are using the Internet to promote, advertise, and sell illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia. In 1992, Congress passed a law that made it illegal for anyone to sell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia. This law resulted in the closings of numerous ``head shops,'' yet, now the out-of-business store owners are selling their illegal drug paraphernalia on the Internet. This bill will amend the anti-drug 
   paraphernalia statute to clarify that advertisements for sale include the use of any communication facility, including the Internet, to post or publicize in any way any matter, including a telephone number or electronic or mail address, knowing that such matter is designed to be used to buy, distribute, or otherwise facilitate a transaction in drug paraphernalia. This will not only prevent web sites from advertising drug paraphernalia for sale, but it will also prohibit web sites that do not sell drug paraphernalia from allowing other sites that do from advertising on its web site. Currently, anyone can log on to the Internet, go to one of the numerous pro-drug sites, and purchase illegal drug paraphernalia, such bongs, water pipes, ``Toke'' bottles and ``High Again'' bottles, along with descriptions of how these devices can assist in getting a better ``high'' from smoking marijuana. There are even web sites that advertise for sale marijuana and poppy seeds, along with growing and nurturing instructions. This type of behavior is not only reprehensible, but it is also illegal, and this clarifying provision can help stop this behavior from continuing over the Internet. 
   Finally, this legislation seeks to impose harsher penalties on manufacturers of illegal drugs when their actions create a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment. The inherent dangers of killing innocent bystanders and, at the same time, contaminating the environment during the methamphetamine manufacturing process warrant a punitive penalty that will deter some from engaging in the activity.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my heartfelt sympathy to our colleague, Senator TED KENNEDY, and the whole Kennedy Family on the death of his nephew, John F. Kennedy, Jr. 
   John Kennedy, Jr. was much admired by all Americans. The son of Camelot, he was aware of his own celebrity but did not flaunt it. 
   His entry into politics--the Kennedy family business--would have been well paved for him, but he chose to go his own way. He succeeded in the extremely competitive publishing world. When failures in this industry outnumber successes, he created and built ``George'' into a popular and often insightful magazine. By all accounts, JFK, Jr. was a hands-on editor, had a fair hand, and had an eye for what would be interesting and fresh for American readers. 
   His marriage to Carolyn Bessette took America's number one bachelor off the market. But, it also gave his life new dimension. 
   We here in the Senate would be remiss if we did not also express our  deepest sympathy to the Bessette family who lost two daughters in this terrible accident. As a father, this is a loss I cannot begin to imagine. 
   It seems that no family should have to endure the level of tragedy that has befallen the Kennedys. I will say to the Senator from Massachusetts: America mourns with you and the Senate mourns with you, your family, and the Bessette family as well. 
   Elaine and I want to express publicly what we have said privately, which is that you and your family and the Bessette family are in our thoughts and prayers. May God hold you in the palm of his hand.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of debate on legislation that is, unquestionably, one of the most important measures to be considered in the 106th Congress. 
   We have heard the horror stories about denials of coverage for certain treatments. We have heard about the bureaucratic nightmares suffered by family members who have a simple question: Why can't the insurance companies understand a family's anxiety as well as they understand the costs of diagnostic tests or the arcane science of filling out forms? 
   As a matter of fact, our constituents may be surprised to know that many of us have also experienced the bureaucratic two-step, many of us have also sat on ``hold'' trying to get past an automated switchboard. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made it seem that we are completely oblivious to the health care needs of the American people. 
   On the contrary, we are well aware of the public's frustration and of the need for effective legislation to ensure that those individuals enrolled in managed care plans are provided quality health care. 
   Over the past several years, numerous hearings have been held in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, exposing story after story about individuals who had complaints about their managed care plans. 
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) recently published figures that, in 1998, more than 35,000 health insurance complaints were made to state insurance departments. 
   According to an article in the February edition of the Employee Benefit Plan Review magazine, ``consumer complaints about health insurers and HMOs are surging.'' The article goes on to say that ``these complaints encompassed matters such as health care claim denials, disputed claims, slow payments by health insurers, and premium-related matters.'' 
   But the article also reports that insurance commissioners in 12 states where the data were collected ``doubt the rise implies a deterioration in care but rather that the numbers reflect greater public readiness to fight HMOs, and encouragement by states for consumers to file complaints.'' 
   Enrollees in managed care plans are not likely to acquiesce and abide by  coverage decisions as final--when their lives are at stake. That is why we are here today and that is why the Senate is now poised to take significant action in addressing this issue for the American people. 
   The question before the Senate this week is not so much will we pass a patients' bill of rights measure--and I hope and believe that we will--but rather what kind of patients' rights bill will the Senate pass and send over to the House of Representatives for consideration? 
   All of us in this Chamber know very well there are numerous competing bills that have been introduced over the years that provide a variety of legislative remedies to address these concerns. In many respects, these bills have common components intertwined with similar and, in some cases, identical provisions. 
   It is my understanding that there are presently 47 various bills that have been introduced in the Senate and House this year alone which are designed to provide patient protections to managed care enrollees. 
   Clearly, we are all concerned. But, for Congress to act and pass responsible and workable legislation, we must come together in a bipartisan fashion and put forth the best bill for the American people. We have done this many times on health care legislation in the past, and there is no reason why we cannot succeed again today and do what is right for the country. 
   I have joined 49 of my colleagues in sponsoring one of the proposals currently under consideration, S. 300, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act of 1999. This legislation, along with its companion bill, S. 326, represents a balanced approach at addressing the concerns over managed health care. 
   This bill is sound public policy that avoids unnecessary and costly federal mandates that would ultimately undermine the affordability and availability of health insurance to millions of Americans.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moment to speak on behalf of the conference report. As you know, the negotiations over the details of the Y2K Act entered their final phase last Friday, during the weekend, and through Monday and Tuesday of this week. With the tremendous help and diligence, particularly of Senators MCCAIN, DODD, and WYDEN, we were able to craft a compromise bill which addresses every one of the major concerns of the White House. 
   Let me say that the final bill reflects the spirit of compromise. But I must admit that I believe the original Judiciary and Commerce Committee bills--along with the House bill--would have been far more effective in dealing with the problem of the expected frivolous and massive Y2K litigation--than the current compromise measure. But because of the overwhelming importance and need for this bill, both sides acted in good faith and reached an equitable agreement. Let me explain the depth and breadth of the changes that were made.

   Mr. HATCH. There can be no question that the final bill is more than a fair compromise. It balances the need to protect consumers against the need to safeguard business--particularly our high tech industries--from the ravages of unrestrained predatory litigation. Indeed, some experts maintain that litigation over the Y2K bug could cost the world economy over one trillion dollars. 
   I must emphasize the importance of this. One reason that our economy has been prospering is the beneficial effect of its increasing computerization. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, has asserted several times that the economy's increased productivity is in part due to computerization and the information revolution. And one of America's biggest exports is high technology goods and services. Without this bill, we would be strangling the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg. America must remain the pacesetter in high technology and the leader of the information revolution. Our security and national defense demands it. 
   Because of the importance of this issue, I have stated that I want a bill and not a partisan issue. I believed that compromise was the only way to achieve a product that was both fair and that would pass Congress. The bill we produced is a good product. But, it could have been a better product if the administration had been more forthcoming. Despite frequent requests by myself, Chairman MCCAIN, and other Senators, for the administration to become actively involved, the administration did not seriously enter into negotiations until last week. They now--after hours and hours of talks--reluctantly support the bill. Well, better late than never, I guess. 
   I want to reiterate my thanks to Chairman MCCAIN and Senators DODD and WYDEN. I also want to thank the other conferees, Senators BENNETT, THURMOND, GORTON, STEVENS, BURNS, LEAHY, HOLLINGS, and KERRY, for all their hard work and efforts in making this bill fair, as well as, effective. Senator BENNETT in particular was an early advocate for prompt and meaningful action on Y2K. I would also be remiss not to note my appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the cosponsor of my Senate Judiciary Y2K bill, Senator FEINSTEIN. 
   I also want to thank the House conferees for their hard work and for their wisdom and prudence. Finally, I want to thank the Senator and House staff for their dedication. I know the long hours they labored. 
   I urge all Senators to support this compromise conference report.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering four very important intellectual property related ``high-tech'' bills that Senator LEAHY and I have introduced to promote the continued growth of vital sectors of the American economy and to protect the interests and investment of the entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators who fuel their growth. These bills were reported by unanimous consent earlier today by the Judiciary Committee. 
   Technology is the driving force in the American economy today, and American technology is setting new standards for the global economy, from semiconductor chip technology, to computer software, Internet and telecommunications technology, to leading pharmaceutical and genetic research. In my own state of Utah, these information technology industries contribute in excess of $7 billion each year to the State's economy and pay wages that average 66 percent higher than the state average. Their performance has placed Utah among the world's top ten technology centers according to Newsweek Magazine. Similar success is seen in areas across the country, with the U.S. being home to seven of the world's top ten technology centers and with American creative industries now surpassing all other export sectors in foreign sales and exports. 
   Underlying all of these technologies are the intellectual property rights that serve to promote creativity and innovation by safeguarding the investment, effort, and goodwill of those who venture into these fast-placed and volatile fields. Strong intellectual property protections are particularly critical in the global high-tech environment where electronic piracy is so easy, so cheap, and yet so potentially devastating to intellectual property owners--many of which are small entrepreneurial enterprises. In Utah, 65 percent of these companies have fewer than 25 employees, and a majority have annual revenues of less than $1 million. Intellectual property is the lifeblood of  these companies, and even a single instance of piracy could drive them out of business. What's more, without adequate international protection, these companies would simply be unable to compete in the global marketplace. 
   That is why we enacted a number of measures last year to provide enhanced protection for intellectual property in the new global, high-tech environment. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) implemented two new World Intellectual Property Organization Treaties setting new global standards for copyright protection in the digital environment. We also paved the way for new growth in online commerce by providing a copyright framework in which the Internet and other new technologies can flourish. 
   This year, Senator LEAHY and I are continuing to focus our attention on important high-tech and intellectual property legislation. The bills we are considering today will build upon existing protections, including last year's measures to deter digital piracy, by raising the Copyright Act's limit on statutory damages to make it more costly to engage in cyber-piracy and copyright theft. They will also make technical ``clean-up'' amendments to the DMCA and other Copyright Act provisions to make them clearer and more user-friendly. On the trademark side, these bills will make the protection of famous marks easier and more efficient and provide recourse for trademark owners against the federal government for trademark infringement. Finally, these bills will allow the Patent and Trademark Office to better serve its customers--America's innovators and trademark owners--through the collection and retention of fees. 
   Each of these bills is noncontroversial and enjoys widespread support. I want to thank Senator LEAHY for his assistance, cooperation, and leadership in this process, and I look forward to the Senate swiftly passing these bills today.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I have been very intrigued and interested in the remarks that have been made. I just want everybody to know that I want to go to conference on this bill. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Biden-Sessions-Feinstein bill is a very important bill. We all know it. We all know it is important. We all know that we need to pass it this year. 
   Let me just say this: Leadership will, in my opinion, appoint conferees in July because I believe we have to do this. 
   I met just this week with leaders in both the House and the Senate--the majority leader in the Senate and the Speaker of the House. I know the intention is to appoint conferees and to have this matter resolved. My hope is that we will pass a conference report before the August recess. 
   No one wants this bill more than I do. It is an important bill. 
   To hear some of my colleagues speak, though, you would think that 99 percent of this bill is a gun control bill. I would say that a very small part of it involves guns, and the rest of it addresses in a serious way the very important issues we must confront regarding juvenile violence and juvenile justice. These are the truly critical parts of this bill.

   Mr. HATCH. My feeling is that they will appoint conferees in July--both leaders of the House and the Senate, the floor leaders--perhaps prior to the recess. My goal is to have this conference report voted on before we go out on the August recess; if not, then as soon as we can after we get back, but I hope before the August recess.

   Mr. HATCH. It would be great if we could do that. That is my goal. 
   I thank my colleague for being willing to stand up on that point with me. 
   I voted against the Lautenberg amendment. I voted against it twice. Neither of those votes on Lautenberg  won a majority of the Senate. But it finally passed with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President GORE. 
   Still, I voted for the final bill. I have repeatedly made clear my desire to pass this bill. This is not an empty exercise for me. This is an important bill. So there is no question about that. 
   Let me just say this: We have had a lot of crying, moaning, and groaning about background checks at gun shows. 
   Let's just stop and think about it. If we had not had Brady, which required a 5-day waiting period, if we had not had this new demand for a 3-day waiting period, we could have already had a responsible system in place. We spent so much time on 3- to 5-day waiting periods that we haven't gotten the instant check system in place throughout the country. In other words, we haven't 
   concentrated enough efforts on implementing the one thing that will really help us to identify and weed out the felons and others who are disqualified to purchase guns in the first place. 
   Some would rather concentrate their efforts on this phony waiting period issue than address the real problem of identifying those who aren't allowed to own a firearm. The reason they would rather address the phony issue of a 3-day waiting period at gun shows is because gun shows only take place for 3 days. If you have a 3-day delay, it means basically there won't be any more gun shows. 
   What does that mean? This is pretty important stuff. 
   If you do not have the gun shows where legitimate, private sellers of guns can come and sell their weapons with appropriate background checks, which everybody in this body is willing to do--I have led the fight to do it--if you do not allow that to happen, then the private sellers of weapons are going to go into the streets, and those guns will all be sold on what will then be a much larger black market for guns. 
   We have that already in our society. We ought to minimize it. The best way to do it is to have legitimate gun shows. There are some 4,000 of them in this country--legitimate gun shows where we have legitimate background checks that are done within a 24-hour period. And that will never happen as long as we keep playing political games, and seeking the political advantage that some people think they get by talking about 1 day, 2 days, or 3 day waiting periods. 
   The key is to get an effective instant check system in place so we absolutely instantly can tell whether the purchaser of this weapon is somebody who is legitimately entitled to purchase the weapon. 
   Having said all of that, having made it very clear that we intend to have conferees on this matter and that we intend to put this matter to bed, hopefully before the August recess, a lot depends on cooperation from the other side. 
   As we know, we have lost a week and a half because of delays on the other side because they want their legislation considered on their terms, regardless of how important the appropriations bills are. We have had interference after interference on getting the work of the Senate done. 
   And as important as all of that is, I think it is important that the American people know that the juvenile justice bill is about a lot more than guns. That is a minuscule part of the bill. We are talking about prevention and enforcement and assistance to local and State governments.

   Mr. HATCH. That is true. I know they have their hands full. I trust the  statement of the leaders. If they do it then, that will be fine. That is consistent with what we have done in the past. I don't have any problem with that. 
   Let me continue my remarks. The Hatch-Leahy amendment to S. 254, which passed overwhelmingly, encourages large Internet service providers to offer screening/filtering software to empower parents to limit access to material unsuitable for children. This amendment provides that within 12 months of enactment, large Internet service providers should provide the software either at no charge or at a fee not exceeding the cost to them. That is a very important part of this bill. 
   We have an antiviolence public service campaign in this bill. The Republican education amendment to S. 254 provides $25 million annually to the National Crime Prevention Council and community-based organizations for a national public service campaign to prevent violence. 
   We have a provision on Internet bombmaking. The Hatch-Feinstein amendment to S. 254 prohibits the teaching of bombmaking, including bombmaking instructions, on the Internet if there is reason to know the bomb will be used in violation of Federal law. 
   We also get tough on violent juveniles and other violent offenders. We ensure that violent juveniles will be held accountable. Among other reforms, S. 254, with Republican amendments, contains the following: Project Cuff. The Hatch-Craig amendment provides $50 million to hire additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute gun crimes in Federal court to take advantage of stiff Federal sentences. 
   We have full funding of the National Instant Check for background checks for firearm purposes. That is something that had to be done. We have not been concentrating on that as we should, because we keep playing games on guns instead of doing what should be done. 
   We have an extension of the prohibition against juvenile possession of a handgun in the Youth Handgun Safety Act to semiautomatic rifles. 
   The juvenile Brady provision, which I have already mentioned, prohibits firearm possession by juveniles who commit violent offenses. 
   We have a bipartisan provision that requires safety locks or secure gun storage devices to be sold with a handgun. 
   We have a minimum of 12 years in prison for those who discharge a firearm during the commission of a violent felony or drug trafficking crime. 
   We have a minimum of 15 years in prison for those who injure a person during the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. 
   We have a minimum of 3 years in prison for first-time offenders and a minimum of 5 years in prison for repeat offenders for those who distribute drugs to minors or sell drug in or near a school. 
   We have an increase in the maximum penalty for knowingly possessing, transporting, or transferring stolen firearms, to 15 years in prison. 
   We have an increase in the maximum penalty to 20 years for a juvenile who illegally brings a gun or ammunition to school with intent to carry or otherwise possess, discharge, or use the handgun or ammunition in the commission of a violent felony. 
   We have an increase in penalties for illegal purchase of a firearm. 
   We have an increase in penalty for committing crimes of violence while wearing body armor. 
   We have a safe-and-secure-schools provision. 
   These are very important. One would think that everything comes down to the Lautenberg amendment. That amendment didn't pass overwhelmingly. In fact, it didn't even have the support of a bare a majority in the Senate until the Vice President of the United States, as is his right, voted to break the tie.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator BROWNBACK's amendment to the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, the aptly named ``Silk Road Strategy Act.'' This act puts in place a much-needed strategy toward a much-overlooked part of the world, a part of the world that the U.S. would ignore at considerable risk. 
   I commend my colleague from Kansas for the extraordinary effort he has committed to shaping this policy and drafting this legislation. Senator BROWNBACK has spent several years studying this region, traveling through it, meeting with political leaders and economic decision makers and discussing his thoughts with the Administration. The fruits of this in-depth research and commitment are evident in this amendment. 
   I also thank my colleague for working with me to include language in this bill that strengthens the U.S. policy of opening these markets and raising  these countries' level of economic cooperation with the United States through bilateral investment treaties. 
   As the senior Senator from Utah, I am very fortunate to represent a State with many far-sighted international commercial ventures, and the language I proposed, which Senator BROWNBACK has thoughtfully accepted, supports those interests by requiring the Secretary of State to report annually on the progress that is being made in negotiating investment treaties with nations of the region. I believe this measure will, for the time being, be sufficient to monitor progress in these important negotiations and will alert these nations to the serious concerns that the U.S. Congress has in protecting U.S. investments abroad. U.S. companies investing in this region should have the protections of bilateral investment agreements. 
   This is entirely consistent with the strategy of the ``Silk Road Act,'' which is posited on the accurate belief that increased U.S. participation in this region is fundamental to their development and our interests. 
   The economic component is only one part of the strategy of this amendment. By promoting infrastructure development, democratic political reforms, sovereignty, independence, and conflict resolution, the Brownback proposal will contribute to political stability and progress as well. 
   Last fall, during a visit to the region, I went to the Republic of Georgia and renewed an acquaintance with Edouard Shevardnadze. An artful negotiator as foreign minister in the last years of the Soviet Union, President Shevardnadze returned to has native Georgia, which became independent as a result of the demise of the Soviet Union. As President of Georgia, Edouard Shevardnadze has been a stalwart promoter of democracy and an open economy, and he has done so under very, very difficult circumstances. 
   Close to one-quarter of his nation's territory is not under central government control. Russian soldiers remain stationed on some of that territory, against the will of the Georgian government. President Shevardnadze has twice narrowly avoided assassination--one of his assassins freely resides in Russia today. In my discussions with President Shevardnadze, we discussed the need for increased U.S. attention to this region and increased participation by U.S. commercial interests. This ``Silk Road Strategy Act'' promotes these goals. 
   The region of the world that this act addresses remains rife with internal conflicts, cross-border incursions, and--perhaps most disturbing--continued challenges by radical Islamic interests, supported in many cases by the extremists in Iran. If these conflicts succeed in destabilizing the region, millions of people recently freed from nearly a century of communist totalitarianism will be denied their economic and political progress, nations surrounding the region will be drawn into wider conflicts, and international markets will be affected. 
   Further, and most importantly, if this region slips toward instability, I am deeply concerned that the U.S. will see the Central Asian and Caucasus States become the source of many future conflicts. Some of these conflicts could have troubling transnational consequences that directly affect us, such as the spread of terrorism and international crime. 
   I commend Senator BROWNBACK for this valuable legislation, which makes a solid and important step in refocusing U.S. interests to a part of the world that is important to us now, and will be even more important in the future.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to rise, along with the ranking minority Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, to introduce a series of intellectual property related ``high-tech'' measures designed to promote the continued growth of these vital sectors of the American economy and to protect the interests and investment of the entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators who fuel their growth. 
   It is no secret that high technology is the driving force in the American economy today. American technology is setting new standards for the global economy, from computer chip technology and computer hardware, to personal and business software applications, to Internet, multimedia and telecommunications technology, and even cutting-edge pharmaceuticals and genetic research. In my own state of Utah, these information technology industries contribute in excess of $7 billion each year to the State's economy and pay wages that average 66 percent higher than the state average. Their performance has placed Utah among the world's top ten technology centers according to Newsweek Magazine. Where Wired is a Way of Life, Newsweek, November 9, 1998, at 44. Similar success is seen across the country, with seven of the world's top ten technology centers located in the United States, and with American creative industries now surpassing all other export sectors in foreign sales and exports. 
   Underlying all of these technologies are the intangible property rights--  copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets--that serve to promote creativity and innovation by safeguarding the investment, effort, and goodwill of those who venture into these fast-paced and volatile fields. Providing adequate protections for these intellectual property rights in the global high-tech environment is critical, particularly in the digital environment where electronic piracy is so easy, so cheap, and yet so potentially devastating to intellectual property owners--many of which are small entrepreneurial enterprises. In Utah, 65 percent of the information technology companies have fewer than 25 employees, and a majority have annual revenues of less than $1 million. Over half of Utah's information technology companies have been in business for less than 10 years, with nearly a quarter having opened their doors since 1995. Intellectual property is the lifeblood of these companies and others similarly situated throughout the country, and even a single instance of piracy may be enough to drive them out of business. What's more, without adequate international protection, these companies would simply be unable to compete in the global marketplace. 
   That is why in the last Congress we enacted a number of measures to provide enhanced protection for intellectual property in the new global, high-tech environment. For example, last year Congress ratified two new landmark World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties to update international copyright standards to respond to the challenges of the global economy and the digital, networked environment. In enacting the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Congress implemented these treaties in the United States by bringing our own 
   copyright laws into the digital age and set the standard internationally for other nations to follow in amending their own laws to meet the requirements of the new WIPO treaties. In addition, as a part of that bill, we paved the way for new growth in online commerce by creating greater security for copyright owners and for the Internet service providers who transmit and store copyrighted works online. We also addressed new technologies, such as webcasting and satellite radio, to provide a copyright framework in which these new platforms can flourish. 
   This year, Senator LEAHY and I are continuing to focus our attention, and that of the Judiciary Committee, on important high-tech and intellectual property legislation. Already this year the Judiciary Committee has reported, and the Senate has enacted, legislation to extend the Satellite Home Viewer Act, which will enable the satellite industry to use new and emerging technology to provide competition in the multichannel video marketplace and allow satellite subscribers to receive local network stations by way of their satellite dishes for the first time. 
   Today we are introducing a number of additional measures relating to technology and intellectual property to strengthen our laws further in order to provide both incentives to creativity and deterrents against infringement. Included among these are legislation that builds upon existing protections, including last year's measures to deter digital piracy, by raising the Copyright Act's limit on statutory damages, thereby making it more costly to engage in cyber-piracy and copyright theft. Also included is a measure to make technical ``clean-up'' amendments to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in order to make its provisions clearer and more user-friendly. On the trademark side, Senator LEAHY and I are introducing a bill to make the protection of famous marks easier and more efficient and to provide recourse for trademark owners against the federal government for trademark infringement. Finally, we are introducing Patent and Trademark Office reauthorization legislation to allow the PTO to better serve its customers--America's innovators and trademark owners--through the collection and retention of patent and trademark fees. 
   It is our intention to turn to these bills in the Judiciary Committee prior to the July 4th recess at a Committee markup session dedicated solely to the consideration of intellectual property legislation. I expect these measures to be noncontroversial, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate as we bring these bills to the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend Senators JEFFORDS, ROTH, KENNEDY, and MOYNIHAN for going the extra mile to work out the provisions of this legislation. I am sure it was not easy; dealing with Medicaid and SSDI never is. 
   As a veteran of many negotiations and collaborations with on disability issues, I see this legislation as a fine example of progressive policy that does not also beget more bureaucracy and irresponsible spending. I do not believe that improving life for those with disabilities and maintaining fiscal responsibility have to be mutually exclusive goals if we take the time to do it right. 
   That is why I appreciated the modifications made in this bill prior to its reintroduction early this spring. I know my colleagues on the Finance Committee and my former colleagues on the Health and Education Committee worked very hard to accomplish this goal, and I think that, by and large, they have succeeded. They can be proud to have produced a bill with such solid bipartisan support. I might mention that Pat Morrissey of Senator JEFFORDS' staff was particularly responsive to my earlier questions and concerns. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the helpful input I received from my own Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy. While this measure was particularly important to a number of the committee's individual members, I want to note for the record that the entire committee endorsed it and urged my support for the bill. I am pleased to be able to demonstrate that support today with an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the remarks of my colleague, my dear friend. In this body, he is certainly a champion for the trial lawyers, and certainly I have been as well. I intend to continue to stand up for trial lawyers, who do a great job for consumers in this country, but we are talking about a little bit of a different problem. 
   Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the final passage of S. 96, the Y2K Act, as modified by S. 1138, the bipartisan Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-Wyden-Gorton-Lieberman-Bennett amendment. This bill effectively addresses the very serious problems associated with the Y2K computer problem. 
   As you know, Mr. President, what is now known as the Y2K problem arises from the inability of computers to correctly process the date after December 31, 1999. When January 1, 2000 arrives, the computers that cannot process that date will have a variety of problems, ranging from very mild glitches to severe breakdowns. In the technologically dependent world we live in, this creates obvious problems for both individuals and for any business that relies on computer technology at any point in its business. 
   As a result of this problem, we face the threat of an avalanche of Y2K-related lawsuits that will be filed on or about January 3, 2000. Such an unprecedented wave of litigation will overwhelm the computer industry's ability to correct the problem. As I have said before, this super-litigation threat is real, and the consequences for America could be disastrous. Already, there have been more than 66 lawsuits, including 31 class actions, filed based on the Y2K problem. These suits are the beginning of a tsunami of litigation that could drown America. 
   As a Senator from the State of Utah, I am extremely aware of the impact this problem will have on the economy of the United States, as well as that of the entire world. Utah stands with a number of other states as a leader in the technological boom that has fueled America's economic progress in recent decades. The future of Utah, and of all America, relies on our ability to continue in our role as the global technological leader. As I have said before, if we fail to counteract the negative effects of the Y2K problem, we will be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. 
   Every dollar that industry has to spend defending itself from frivolous litigation is a dollar that cannot be spent on fixing the problem. The way to minimize the hardships caused by the problem on January 1st is to encourage remediation by the technology industry and to encourage mitigation by would-be plaintiffs, both before and after January 1st. This bill does precisely that. 
   The Y2K bill provides powerful incentives for industry to fix the Y2K problem before it happens and to remedy problems once they occur. Contrary to what some opponents of the bill have alleged, there is absolutely nothing in the bill that would deny any aggrieved party the right to sue. Let me repeat this. There is nothing in the bill that would prohibit anyone from bringing a lawsuit. What the bill does is to create powerful incentives to fix problems before resort to the courts is necessary. It encourages remediation through the requirement of pre-litigation notice and by providing opportunities for alternative dispute resolution. The pre-litigation notice and pleading requirements also assist industry in fixing Y2K problems by requiring that prospective plaintiffs provide the information necessary for the defendant to understand and remedy the problem during the cure period. 
   In addition to encouraging the computer industry to remediate the problem, this bill fosters action by both industry and consumers to avoid the problems caused by Y2K failures. This bill preserves contracts and State contract law, encouraging contracting parties to anticipate the possibilities of Y2K failure and to do all they can to avoid them. The bill also imposes a duty to mitigate, requiring prospective plaintiffs to do what they reasonably can to avoid damages occurring because of a Y2K failure. 
   Some Senators have raised concerns about some of the provisions of the  Y2K Act. Let me address some of these concerns. 
   Specifically, some Senators have opposed to the punitive damages provision, the proportional liability provision, and the section dealing with the economic loss rule. In the past several days, however, we have also heard many of my colleagues set forth the reasons why these provisions are central to the effective operation of the bill in preventing the disaster that is imminent in the wake of extensive frivolous Y2K litigation. 
   The punitive damages provision of the Y2K Act is essential in order to prevent the destruction of America' small businesses by excessive punitive damage awards. This section of the bill is extremely limited, as it applies only to small businesses. The bill simply does not impose a cap on punitive damages for any defendants other than small businesses. Opponents of this provision argue that punitive damages serve as a deterrent to misconduct, and that placing a cap on them will remove that deterrent. The punitive damage cap created by this bill does not remove any deterrent to misconduct. 
   Punitive damage awards against small businesses will be limited to three times the amount awarded for compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is less. FOr small businesses consisting of an individual whose net worth does not exceed $500,000 or a company with less than 50 employees, this is a significant deterrent of misconduct. In addition, there is no cap at all if the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff. I cannot take seriously the argument that this formulation of punitive damages is too small to act as a deterrent. Treble damages or $250,000 is a significant piece of change to pay for a small business. 
   In fact, I supported a similar cap for all businesses. But, in the spirit of bipartisan compromise, we agreed to limit the caps to small businesses. I understand that even the White House supported a similar small business cap provision in the products liability bill of two years ago. So what's the big deal? 
   What the small business punitive damages cap does do is to protect our small businesses from utter destruction by excessive punitive damage awards. As last year's Rand Corporation study of punitive damages concluded, the United States has witnessed a substantial increase in the amount of punitive damage awards. Witness the recent May 10 punitive damage award by an Alabama jury of $581 million to a family that complained they were overcharged $1,200 for two satellite dishes. According to Rand, although punitive damages amounts to a minority of all damages awarded, the very size of these awards skewers the civil justice system. Even frivolous lawsuits are settled for fear of large judgments. This has led to what is termed ``jackpot justice.'' Lawsuits have been grossly transformed from a search of justice to a search of deep pockets. We have tried to counter this trend--at least for small businesses--in the Y2K Act. 
   Speaking about ``jackpot justice''--the proportionate liability provision is intended to mitigate the quest for deep pockets by assuring fairness in the award of damages. Punishment must fit the crime and it is only fair that defendants should be liable only for the part of the damage that they cause. In an attempt to forge a bipartisan compromise, Senators MCCAIN, DODD, WYDEN, LIEBERMAN, FEINSTEIN, GORTON, BENNETT, and myself, agreed to the formulation of proportionate liability found in the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This act was signed into law by the President several years ago--so it should be acceptable to the administration. 
   Yet some opponents to this bill have spoken out against this provision. Opponents of this section of the bill apparently want some defendants to be liable for all damages, even if they were responsible only for a tiny fraction of the damage. That is the very definition of ``deep pockets.'' The Y2K Act would prevent this and that is why it is opposed by the trial attorneys. The act ensures that a defendant's liability in a Y2K action will be for the damage that they caused, and not for the damages caused by other defendants. 
   Another section of the bill that is under attack is the class action section. Opponents of the bill say that this provision would federalize all State actions. This is a gross exaggeration. Let me explain. 
   The class action provision is vital to the effective operation of the bill. Class actions are a significant source of abuse. I have seen this as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Far too often, Federal jurisdiction is defeated by joining just one nondiverse class plaintiff--even if the overwhelming number of parties are from differing States. This wrecks the clear purpose of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23--to provide for a Federal forum ameliorates myriad state judicial decisions that are conflicting in scope and onerous to enforce. 
   Now, as I stated before in this debate, I am a great proponent of federalism and the right of our States to act as what Justice Brandeis termed national laboratories of change. But it is axiomatic that a national problem needs an uniform solution. That is the justification for Congress' commerce clause power and its consequent promulgation of rule 23. That is the justification for the Y2K Act itself, in which the Y2K defect is clearly a national problem in need of a Federal answer. 
   The economic loss section of the Y2K Act has also been the subject of some contention. Let me reiterate some of the arguments I made last Thursday on the Senate floor in opposition to the Edwards amendment which if passed would have weakened this section. The economic loss rule is already widely accepted and has been adopted by both the U.S. Supreme Court and by a majority of States. The rule basically mandates that when parties have entered into contracts and the contract is silent as to consequential damages--which is the contract term for economic losses--the aggrieved party may not turn around and sue in tort for economic losses. Under the rule, the party may only sue under tort for economic losses. Under the rule, the party may only sue under tort law when they have suffered personal injury or damage to property other than the property in dispute. 
   In short, the Y2K Act's economic loss section ensures fairness in contract law by applying the rule already in use in most states to Y2K lawsuits. It prevents ``tortification'' of contract law by flagging an end run against terms of a contract agreed to by the parties. 
   Let me also remind the critics of this bill that it is of limited duration. This bill is designed to specifically address the problems related to Y2K computer failures that will occur around the turn of the millennium. In keeping with this purpose, the bill has a sunset period, which means that the entire bill will only be in effect until January 1, 2003. 
   Let me also make a variant of Pascal's wager. If these disputed provisions are harmful, as some critics contend, enacting them will do little harm because the bill will expire in 3 years. But if, as the supporters of this bill believe, these provisions are critical, not including them in the final bill could greatly harm the economy and our high tech industries. The choice is obvious. Both reason and equity require that these provisions remain in the bill. 
   Some have expressed concern that President Clinton will veto this bill. I don't think he will. This bill can only solve the problems created by the Y2K problem. Its provisions encourage remediation and mitigation, and encourage solutions to problems. The President knows this. He knows that to sign the bill can only help our nation and the world. He knows that by vetoing the bill he will, at best, be doing nothing to solve the Y2K problem, and that at worst he will be contributing to it. If we are to be successful in solving this great problem before us, we must overcome our fear and pass the Y2K bill as a strong and effective piece of legislation. 
   Again, I emphasize the importance of this bill to our nation's future. Without meaningful legislation addressing the Y2K problem and the deluge of litigation that will surely follow, our nation may suffer devastating consequences. The Y2K Act before the Senate today is that meaningful legislation. This is a bipartisan bill, created and shaped through cooperation on both sides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to vote for its final passage.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today is Flag Day. Utahns, and indeed Americans all across our great country, revere the flag as the unique symbol of the United States and of the principles, ideals, and values for which our country stands. Who can forget the majestic image of the Marines raising Old Glory on the island of Iwo Jima during World War II or of school children pledging their allegiance to the American flag? 
   Over the years, the love and devotion our diverse people have for the American flag has been reflected in the actions of our legislatures. During the Civil War, for example, Congress awarded the Medal of Honor to Union soldiers who rescued the flag from falling into rebel hands. 
   During World War I, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Flag Act that numerous state legislatures adopted to prohibit flag desecration. 
   Congress declared the ``Star Spangled Banner'' to be our national anthem. 
   In 1949, Congress expressed the love the American people for their flag by establishing June 14 as Flag Day. Congress also adopted ``The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag'' and the manner of its recitation which millions of school children observe each school day. 
   In 1968, Congress adopted a federal statute to prohibit flag desecration. More recently, Congress designated John Philip Sousa's ``The Stars and Stripes Forever'' as the national march. 
   As with numerous societal interests that affect free speech, legislatures of 48 States and the federal government and the courts also have long respected society's interest in protecting the flag by balancing this interest against the individual's interest in conveying a message through the means of destruction of the flag instead of through the means of oral or written speech. 
   The Supreme Court continues to strike the balance in favor of society's interests in public safety, national security, protection from obscenity, libel, and the protection of children even though these interests can and do implicate the First Amendment. 
   In the 1989 case of Texas v. Johnson, however, the Supreme Court abandoned the traditional balance in favor of society's interest in protecting the flag and adopted an absolute protection for the individual's interest in communicating through the means of physically destroying the American flag. 
   Congress responded to the Johnson decision with a statutory attempt to restore balanced protection to the physical integrity of the American flag--the Flag Protection Act of 1989. However, in the 1990 case of United States v. Eichman, the Supreme Court relied on the new rule it created in Johnson to reject statutory protection of the flag. 
   The recent reintroduction of another flag protection statute, which has been introduced in prior Congresses, is also clearly unenforceable under the Johnson and Eichman precedents. Even Professor Lawrence Tribe, a defender of the statute struck down in Eichman, has stated that the reintroduced statute cannot be upheld under the new rule of Johnson and Eichman. 
   Moreover, in the 1992 case of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, the Supreme Court clearly stated that it will no longer uphold statutory protection of the flag from desecration. Accordingly, the only realistic way to restore traditional balanced protection for the flag is with a constitutional amendment. 
   In March of this year, Senator CLELAND and I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 14, a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag.  This amendment restores balanced protection to the flag by allowing Congress to prohibit only the physical desecration of the flag, while retaining the full existing freedoms for oral and written speech. 
   Thus, a would-be flag burner would still be able to convey his particular message by speaking at a rally, writing to a newspaper, and voting at the ballot box. He would not, however, be able to burn a flag or to stuff a flag into a toilet, as has been done since the Johnson and Eichman decisions. 
   Nearly 80 percent of the American people and 49 state legislatures support the constitutional amendment to restore balanced protection to the American flag. By sending this amendment to the States for ratification, Congress would help restore traditional balanced protection for the flag while protecting the robust freedom of expression that Americans enjoyed when the Marines raised the flag over Iwo Jima and when Congress created Flag Day.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague, and I appreciate what he is trying to do. This bill is trying to resolve what really are unlimited litigation possibilities. If we don't pass this bill, that could really wreck our computer industry and wreck our country and would make it even more difficult to get the computer industry and everybody involved in Y2K problems to really resolve these problems in advance of the year 2000. 
   I rise to oppose the Edwards amendment, which basically strikes the economic loss section of S. 96, the Y2K bill. 
   I have followed carefully the debate of the bill. And, as of now, it is the Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-Wyden substitute, S.1138, that we are now debating. 
   My observation is that during this debate there has been much confusion over the economic loss section. 
   Let me attempt to clarify this matter. 
   It is important to note that the economic loss rule is a legal principle that has been adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court and by most States. 
   The rule basically prevents ``tortification'' of contract law, the trend that I view with some alarm. 
   The rule basically mandates that when parties have entered into contracts and the contract is silent as to ``consequential damages,'' which is the contract term for economic losses, the aggrieved party may not turn around and sue in tort for economic losses. Thus, the expectation of the parties are protected from undue manipulation by trial attorneys. The party under the rule may sue under tort law only when they have suffered personal injury or damage to property other than the property in dispute. 
   The economic loss rule exists primarily or principally because of the importance of enforcing contractual agreements. If the parties can circumvent a contract by suing in tort for their economic losses, any contract that allocates the risk between the parties becomes worthless. 
   The absence of the economic loss rule would hurt contractual relations and create an economic and unnecessary economic cost to society as a whole. It would encourage suppliers to raise prices to cover all of the risks of liability and would encourage buyers to forego assurances as to the quality of the product or service. If anything goes wrong, simply sue the supplier under tort law. 
   The economic loss rule also reflects the belief that the parties should not be held liable for the virtually unlimited yet foreseeable economic consequences of their actions, such as the economic losses of all the people stuck in traffic in a car accident. 
   In light of this, most States apply the rule without regard to privity, and the vast majority of States that have considered the rule have applied it not only to products but to the services as well with some exceptions for ``professional services,'' such as lawyers and ``special relationships''. 
   Why then should Congress codify the economic loss rule with regard to Y2K actions or litigation? 
   First, adopting the economic loss rule helps identify which parties have the primary responsibility of ensuring Y2K compliance. It is one of the major goals of the Y2K legislation to encourage companies to do all they can to avoid and repair Y2K problems, and adoption of the economic loss rule helps us to do exactly that. 
   Second, adoption of the economic loss rule preserves the parties' ability to enter into meaningful contractual agreements and preserves existing contracts. Parties who suffer personal injury or property damage, other than to the property at issue, could still sue in tort, or in contract, while those suffering only economic damages would be able to sue in contract. 
   Third, adoption of the rule would strengthen existing legal standards. We have the rule in this bill, and there is very good reason to have it in this bill. 
   By strengthening existing legal standards, we would avoid costly and potentially abusive litigation as a result of the Y2K failures. 
   That is what we are trying to avoid. 
   This bill only lasts 3 years. It then sunsets. The bill's purpose is to get through this particularly critical time without having the Federal courts and the State courts overwhelmed by litigation, yet at the same time providing people with a means of overcoming some of these problems. That is the whole purpose of this bill. 
   If this amendment is adopted, that whole purpose will be subverted. It is not a loophole at all, as Senator EDWARDS contended. If we change this rule and adopt this amendment, we surely will have courts clogged, we surely will have undue and unnecessary litigation, and in the end we surely are not accomplishing what we need to accomplish--encouraging the companies to do what is right and to get the problems solved now. That is what we want to do. This bill will do more toward getting that done than anything I can think of.  
   Lastly, adoption of the economic loss rule would establish a uniform national rule applicable to Y2K actions. This would help to avoid the patchwork of State legal standards that would otherwise apply to Y2K problems and actions. The subtle and complex idiosyncrasies and the rule's applications by the various States strongly indicate the need for a uniform national rule with regard to Y2K actions. 
   Without a uniform rule, which we have in this amendment, every issue concerning Y2K liability may have to be litigated in each different State. This increases the already enormous costs of Y2K litigation. 
   As I stated, the Supreme Court has adopted and endorsed the economic loss rule, which has greatly influenced State law. The leading case is East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc. In that case, the company that chartered several steamships sued the manufacturer of the ship's turbine engines in tort for purely economic damages, including repair costs and lost profits caused by the failure of the turbines to perform properly. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court denied recovery in tort under the economic loss rule. The Court's ruling was based in large part on the propriety of contract law over tort law in cases involving only economic loss. 
   The Court goes on to say:  
   The distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the ``luck'' of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury. The distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products. When a product injures only itself the reasons for imposing a tort duty are weak and those for leaving the party to its contractual remedies are strong ..... Contract law, and the law of warranty in particular, is well suited to commercial controversies of the sort involved in this case because the parties may set the terms of their own agreements. The manufacturer can restrict its liability, within limits, by disclaiming warranties or limiting remedies. In exchange, the purchaser pays less for the product .....  
   The Court's ruling was also based on the fact that allowing recovery in tort would extend the turbine manufacturer's liability indefinitely:  
   Permitting recovery for all foreseeable claims for purely economic loss could make a manufacturer liable for vast sums. It would be difficult for a manufacturer to take into account the expectations of persons downstream who may encounter its product. In this case, for example, if the charterers--already one step removed from the transaction [which included the shipbuilder in between]--were permitted to recover their economic losses, then the companies that subchartered the ships might claim their economic losses from delays, and the charterers' customers also might claim their economic losses, and so on. ``The law does not spread its protections so far.''  
   Let me turn to state law cases. The leading case on this issue is Huron Tool and Engineering Co. v. Precision Consulting Services, Inc., 532 N.W.2d 541 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995). In Huron, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that the Economic Loss Rule barred plaintiff's fraud claim against a computer consulting company to recover purely economic loss caused by alleged defects in a system provided under contract. The court explained:  
   The fraudulent representations alleged by plaintiff concern the quality and characteristics of the software system sold by defendants. These representations are indistinguishable from the terms of the contract and warranty that plaintiff alleges were breached. Plaintiff fails to allege any wrongdoing by defendants independent of defendant's breach of contract and warranty. Because plaintiff's allegations of fraud are not extraneous to the contractual dispute, plaintiff is restricted to its contractual remedies under the UCC. The circuit court's dismissal of plaintiff's fraud claim was proper.  
   Hotels of Key Largo, Inc. v. RHI Hotels, Inc., 694 So.2d 74, 77 (Fla.Ct. App. 1997), holding that the Economic Loss Rule barred plaintiff's fraud claim seeking to recover economic loss caused by the defendant's failure to promote the plaintiff's hotel per contractual agreement, says: ``[W]here the only alleged misrepresentation concerns the heart of the parties' agreement simply applying the label `fraudulent inducement' to a cause of action will not suffice to subvert the sound policy rationales underlying the economic loss doctrine.''. 
   Raytheon Co. V. McGraw-Edison Co., Inc., 979 F Supp. 858, 870-73 (E.D. Wisc. 1997), holding that the Economic Loss Rule barred tort claims, including strict-responsibility, negligent, and intentional misrepresentation claims, brought by purchaser of real property against seller to recover purely economic loss caused by environmental contaminants in the soil says: ``[T]he alleged misrepresentations forming the basis of Raytheon's fraud claims are inseparably embodied within the terms of the underlying contract ..... [Therefore,] Raytheon cannot pursue its fraud claims.''

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand what the distinguished Senator from North Carolina is attempting to do. He is a very skilled lawyer, and a very good lawyer, and from my understanding primarily a plaintiffs' lawyer in the past. I have been both a defense and plaintiffs lawyer, and I presume maybe he has also, and I have a lot of respect for him and I understand what he is trying to do. 
   The fact of the matter is, we have a 3-year bill here, that sunsets in 3 years,  that is trying to solve all kinds of economic problems in our country that could cripple our country and cause a major, calamitous drop in everything if we do not have this bill, plus it could destroy our complete software and computer industry in a short period of time if we get everything tied up in litigation in this country because we are unwilling to pass this bill with this amendment on, that we have worked so hard, with Senator DODD, to bring about. 
   If we do not pass this bill with this amendment, as amended by this amendment, the Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-Wyden amendment--and Sessions amendment--I apologize for leaving out Senator SESSIONS' name. He has worked hard on this bill. But if we don't pass this bill with this language in it, then I predict we will have undermined the very purposes we are here to try to enforce. 
   This bill is an important bill. This bill assures every aggrieved party his day in court. It does not end the ability to seek compensation. What it does, however, is to create procedural incentives that for a short time delay litigation in order to give companies the ability to fix the problem without having to wait for a judgment from some court--which could take years. But in this particular case, I want to remind all that the bill sunsets in 3 years. It is limited in a way that prevents what would be catastrophic losses in this country, unnecessary losses if this bill is enacted. That is why we should quit playing around with this bill and get it passed. 
   I don't care that the President of the United States says, he is not going to veto this bill. He would be nuts to veto it. This is a bipartisan bill. This amendment is a bipartisan amendment, and it has been worked out over a very long period of time and through a lot of contentious negotiations. We finally arrived at something here that can really solve these problems. 
   Sincerely motivated as is the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, I hope our colleagues will vote this amendment down, because it will really undermine, at least in my opinion and I think in the opinion of many others, what we are trying to do here. What we are trying to do here is in the best interests of our country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. The McCain bill doesn't affect that. If fraud is committed consumers in most states will be able to recover even economic losses under state statutes. This is not altered by the Y2K Act. So, if there is fraud committed or a criminal act committed, you are going to be able to have all your rights, even in States like North Carolina, where they codify the economic loss rule. So that is not affected by this bill at all. 
   The only thing that will be affected by this bill, if your amendment is adopted there will be an increase of wide open and aggressive litigation. Without your amendment, we will not have a uniformity of rule that will help us to get to the bottom of this matter. So with regard to the count on fraud, with regard to real fraud, or statutory fraud, with regard to criminal acts, the defendants will still be liable for what the distinguished Senator believes they should be liable for.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment basically is, in my opinion, too broad and too vague to provide guidance. It would cause more litigation, and what we are trying to do is prevent litigation that literally is unjustified. 
   This amendment does not take into account the practical reality that the standard of care is determined as part of the case. Thus, how would a plaintiff know what the pleading requirements are under S. 96 for specificity? How would they know that? If it simply depends on the allegation of the plaintiff, then no plaintiff would fall under the requirements of this bill. This could result in tremendous abuse. Talk about loopholes, this would be the biggest loophole of all in the bill. The fact of the matter is, what we are trying to do in this bill is avoid litigation. 
   The distinguished Senator from North Carolina talks about protecting the little guy out there, and the way that is done generally is through class actions, where the little guy gets relatively little, but those in the legal profession make a great deal. That is what we are trying to avoid, a pile of class actions that are unjustified under the circumstances where the manufacturers and all these other people go into the bunkers and get a bunker mentality rather than resolving these problems in advance. 
   The whole purpose of this bill is to get problems resolved, to get our country through what could be one of the worst economic disasters in the country's history. 
   The Y2K bill before us sets an important criteria for fixing the problems. There needs to be specificity in plaintiffs' pleadings--in fact, both plaintiffs' and defendants' pleadings--so glitches can be fixed before litigation. 
   This amendment would allow ``reasonable care standards,'' which must be shown in negligence cases. It does not have to be pleaded with specificity. This would defeat the very purpose of this act, which is trying to get us to be more specific so those who have problems will be able to rectify those problems and remediate those problems. 
   The goal here is to solve problems, not allow any one side or the other to get litigation advantage. We are not trying to give the industries litigation advantage. We are not trying to give big corporations litigation advantage. We are trying to solve problems. I commend all of those on this bill who have worked so hard to do so. 
   If we accept this amendment, my gosh, we will not only not solve problems, we will not have specificity in pleadings, we will never know what is really going on, and we will have massive class actions all over this country that will tie this country in knots over what really are glitches that possibly could be corrected in advance. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support what will be offered as the bipartisan amendment to S. 96, the Y2K Act. I also rise to oppose Senator John KERRY's alternative to the Y2K Act. 
   The Y2K Act has gone through significant and myriad changes. In the spirit of constructive compromise, Senators of both parties have come together to work out their differences to produce S. 1138, the bipartisan Dodd-McCain - Hatch - Feinstein - Wyden - Gorton-Lieberman-Bennett amendment. Why? Because these and other Senators realize the importance of resolving a potential Y2K litigation crisis. These and other Senators have placed the vitality of the nation over any exaggerated loyalty to one political party. 
   Y2K-related lawsuits pose the greatest danger to industry's efforts to fix the problem. All of us are aware that the computer industry is feverishly working to correct--or remediate, in industry language--Y2K so as to minimize any disruptions that occur early next year. 
   What we also know is that every dollar that industry has to spend to defend against especially frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that will not get spent on fixing the problem and delivering solutions to technology consumers. Also, how industry spends its precious time and money between now and the end of the year--either litigating or mitigating--will largely determine how severe Y2K-related damage, disruption, and hardship will be. 
   Many fear that if Congress does not act, the American high tech industry, a leader in the world and a significant source of our exports, will be severely damaged. This is particularly true for the economies of cutting-edge high tech states--such as my home state of Utah--whose private sector is a leader in the information revolution. Why retard the industry that has led the recent boom of the American economy? Why kill the goose that lays the golden egg? 
   Let me restate what I have said on numerous occasions. The potential financial magnitude of the Y2K litigation problem is enormous. To understand this enormity, we should consider the estimate of Capers Jones, Chairman of Software Productivity Research, a provider of software measurement, assessment and estimation products and services. Mr. Jones suggests  that ``for every dollar not spent on repairing the Year 2000 problem, the anticipated costs of litigation and potential damages will probably amount to in excess of ten dollars.'' The Gartner Group estimates that worldwide remediation costs will range between $300 billion to $600 billion. Assuming Mr. Jones is only partially accurate in his prediction--the litigation costs to society will prove staggering. Even if we accept The Giga Information Group's more conservative estimate that litigation will cost just two dollars to three dollars for every dollar spent fixing Y2K problems, overall litigation costs may total $1 trillion. 
   Even then, according to Y2K legal expert Jeff Jinnett, ``this cost would greatly exceed the combined estimated legal costs associated with Superfund environmental litigation . . . U.S. tort litigation.....and asbestos litigation.'' Perhaps the best illustration of the sheer dimension of the litigation monster that Y2K may create is Mr Jinnett's suggestion that a $1 trillion estimate for Y2K-related litigation costs ``would exceed even the estimated total annual direct and indirect costs of all civil litigation in the United States,'' which he says is $300 billion per year. 
   These figures should give all of us pause. At this level of cost, Y2K-related litigation may well overwhelm the capacity of the already crowded court system to deal with it. 
   Looking at a rash of lawsuits--there already have been 66 Y2K lawsuits filed nationwide and the number is growing--we must ask ourselves, what kind of signals are we sending to computer companies currently engaged in or contemplating massive Y2K remediation? What I fear industry will conclude is that remediation is a losing proposition and that doing nothing is no worse an option for them than correcting the problem. This is exactly the wrong message we want to be sending to the computer industry at this critical time. 
   I believe Congress should give companies an incentive to fix Y2K problems right away, knowing that if they don't make a good-faith effort to do so, they will shortly face costly litigation. The natural economic incentive of industry is to satisfy their customers and, thus, prosper in the competitive environment of the free market. 
   This acts as a strong motivation for industry to fix a Y2K problem before any dispute becomes a legal one. This will be true, however, only as long as businesses are given an opportunity to do so and are not forced, at the outset, to divert precious resources from the urgent tasks of the repair shop to the often unnecessary distractions of the court room. A business and legal environment which encourages problem-solving while preserving the eventual opportunity to litigate may best insure that consumers and other innocent users of Y2K defective products are protected. 
   The bipartisan compromise amendment accomplishes these ends. It is significant to note that the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, my good friends and respected colleagues ROBERT BENNETT and CHRISTOPHER DODD, endorse the bipartisan amendment. Both these Senators have developed great expertise in Y2K and related matters during their leadership of the special committee. They were instrumental in crafting the compromise amendment. 
   The Kerry proposal, on the other hand, is partisan. As I understand it, it was in part drafted with the White House. It has not been endorsed by one Republican. While I firmly 
   believe that Senator KERRY and other Democrat Senators who crafted the amendment sincerely believe that they are doing good, their amendment clearly eviscerates the protections established by S. 96. It reduces the incentives created in the bill for reducing litigation and resolving Y2K problems outside the court room. Let me explain. 
   The Kerry Amendment significantly weakens the class action section of S. 96. Class actions are a significant source of abuse. I have seen this as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Both plantiffs and defendants' attorneys have all too often been successful in rigging the system. Far too often, sweetheart deals are entered into whereby the plaintiff's attorneys negotiate huge fees, the defendants buy litigation peace through a nation-wide class action settlement that acts as res judiciata and bars all, even meritorious, future litigation, and class members are given mere trifles, such as coupons for products that hardly can be considered just compensation. 
   Far too often, Federal jurisdiction is defeated by joining just one nondiverse class plaintiff--even if the overwhelming number of parties are from differing states. This wrecks the clear purpose of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23--to provide for a Federal forum for class actions where the litigation problem is national in scope. A federal forum ameliorates myriad state judicial decisions that are conflicting in scope and onerous to enforce. Now, I am a great proponent of federalism and the right of our states to act as what Justice Brandeis termed national laboratories of change. But it is axiomatic that a national problem needs an uniform solution. That is the justification for Congress' Commerce Clause power and its consequent promulgation of Rule 23. That is the justification for the Y2K Act itself, in which the Y2K defect is clearly a national problem in need of a Federal answer. 
   Because of the short 2 or 3 year timespan for litigation, all of these problems are magnified in the Y2K context. There already have been filed 31 Y2K class action lawsuits with all the attendant problems associated with class action abuse. Before all is said and done, I expect many more to be filed. S. 96 deals with the problems generated by class actions in two ways: first, a certification requirement to demonstrate a common material defect is mandated. This assures that class action joinder is available only if common questions of law and fact exist. Second, minimal diversity is allowed. Thus, a substantial number of parties must be from different states and joinder of one or two nondiverse parties cannot defeat Federal jurisdiction. Moreover, to assure that Federal courts are not saturated with class actions independently filed or removed from state court, the amount in controversy must be over one million dollars. 
   To its credit, the Kerry Amendment adopts the common material defects showing requirement. But it is silent as to the need for minimal diversity to assure that the Federal courts will have jurisdiction over what is after all a national problem. To be sure, I am aware that the Judicial Conference opposes this provision fearing a substantial increase in Federal class actions. But I am also aware of their tendency to overreact. They made no study of the issue. Their concerns were mere ipse dixits, statements made as true with no foundation as to their truth. 
   To the contrary, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has made a study of both S. 96, the bill reported out of Commerce, and S. 461, the Hatch-Feinstein Y2K measure, the bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee. Both bills have nearly identical provisions. 
   Concerning the class action provisions of S. 461, CBO first recognized that because of the incentives found in the bill it expects ``that parties to lawsuits would be encouraged to reach a settlement. Thus, we anticipate that many lawsuits would not result in trial, which can be [time-consuming] and expensive.'' CBO went on and noted that ``some class action lawsuits could be shifted from state to federal court under S. 461 because the bill would ease restrictions for filing such actions in Federal court.'' What is important, however, is their ultimate conclusion: ``On balance, CBO estimates that the savings from eliminating trials for many lawsuits would more than offset any increased costs that might be incurred from trying additional class action lawsuits in federal court.'' (My emphasis). In other words, in the only study done of the class action issue, it is concluded that the Y2K Act's class action provision would not result in the flooding of the federal courts with unneeded and expensive litigation. 
   A provision of S. 96 that the Kerry Amendment actually strikes is the punitive damages limitation provision. Now both S. 96 and S. 461 contained caps on punitive damage awards. The caps applied to all prevailing parties and limited punitive damages to the greater of three times compensatory damages or $250,000, or the lesser of that amount if a small business was  the defendant. The reason for these caps are clear. Runaway punitive damages have hindered economic growth and productivity nationwide. Businesses are often forced to settle spurious suits when faced with millions in punitive damages. Thus, prices for goods and services are unnecessarily raised with consumers suffering the most. Because of the concentrated time period, this problem will be magnified for Y2K actions. 
   The bipartisan Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein amendment modifies the punitive damage provision. In the spirit of compromise, the caps were limited to small business and individuals with a net worth of less than $500,000. There were two reasons for this change. The first is that small businesses and most individuals would be ruined by immense punitive dmamages. The other reason is that punitive damages in this situation do not serve the intended deterrent effect. In fact, insolvency and bankruptcy creates a counterincentive to remediate Y2K glitches. Why would a small business voluntarily notify customers of potential Y2K defects if the business could face ruin for its good citizenship? 
   But Senator KERRY even opposes this watered down provision. The reason for Senator KERRY's opposition for even this moderate provsion is that even caps for small business would allegedly reduce the deterrent effect of those damages. Surely, however, the prospect of treble damages provides adequate incentives for companies that need monetary threats to make efforts at compliance. The current, unlimited punitive regime simply encourages suits by lawyers who hope to hit the lottery, while driving up the settlement value of insubstantial claims. 
   Let me turn to the proportionate liability section of S. 96. It is good to see that Senator KERRY has moved closer to our position. Prior drafts of his amendment completely weakened this provision. Senator KERRY's latest attempt in most respects is verbatim the same as the bipartisan 
   amendment. 
   The system of modified proportionate liability in S. 96 makes sense as a matter of both equity and of litigation management. Based on the already existing proportionate liability provision of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, it ensures that defendants will not be forced to pay for injuries that are not their fault. It discourages specious lawsuits because plaintiffs' lawyers will not be able to take advantage of the archaic joint and several liability doctrine whereby a deep-pocket defendant will inevitably have to pay the entire judgment so long as a jury can be persuaded to find it is even one percent responsible. And the proportionate lability section will avoid coercive settlements prevalent in a joint and several liability scheme. 
   The Kerry provision essentially adopts the proposal in S. 96, which recognizes that it is unfair to assume that defendants should be forced to pay for damages that are not their fault. But the Kerry draft also eliminates proportionate liability if the defendant fails to inform the plaintiff of a potential Y2K problem before December 31, 1999. This is true even if the defendant business demonstrates that it was innocent, or had no knowledge of the defect. Suppose a retailer, having no reason to believe the manufactured product sold was defective, could not and did not notify the purchaser of the Y2K defect. In that case the retailer would be subject to joint and several liability under Kerry. The result is that deep-pocketed defendants who are subject to strike suits will have to assume that they face limitless liability, and, therefore, will have no choice but to pay a coercive settlement, even if the defendant was innocent of any knowledge of the defect. 
   The Kerry Amendment duty to mitigate requirement has been so limited that it will not encourage remediation. The amendment provides that plaintiffs cannot recover damages for injuries that they could have reasonably avoided in light of information provided to the plaintiff by the defendant. It does not impose such a limit if the plaintiff obtained the relevant information from third parties or other sources. The provision in the Kerry Amendment is much more narrow than the general common law of the duty to mitigate. If the plaintiff in fact obtained information from any source that would have allowed it to avoid injury, it makes no sense to allow the plaintiff to ignore that information, to suffer the injury, and then to force someone else to pay its damages. 
   There is another significant problem with the Kerry Amendment. The amendment eliminates all intentional torts--except where the tort involves fraud or misrepresentation about the product--from the scope of S. 96's codification of the Economic Loss Rule, regardless of the relationship between the parties. This exemption would significantly narrow existing law in many states and undermine the purpose of the Rule in cases involving two contracting parties. 
   Breach of contract, intentional or otherwise, does not generally give rise to a tort claim; it is simply breach of contract. The Economic Loss Rule thus prevents tort remedies--such as lost profits and other economic losses--where the parties were in privity and could have negotiated consequential damages and other economic losses. The rapidly emerging trend, therefore, among the States is to apply the Economic Loss Rule to bar fraud claims where those claims merely restate claims for breach of contract. The Rule does not, however, bar fraud claims arising independent of a contract. Additionally, the Kerry Amendment would significantly override State law and allow recovery of economic loss in cases of intentional torts even where such recovery would be prohibited by State law. This seems to create a new cause of action for recovery of economic loss in cases of intentional torts and is unacceptable. The Kerry Amendment also would apply the Economic Loss Rule to only actual defects and not anticipated failures. Thus many lawsuits based on anticipated failures would not fall under the Economic Loss Rule. 
   Finally, the Kerry Amendment carve-out for noncommercial suits will permit a huge range of abusive actions. Carving out noncommercial suits--including class actions--will permit a huge range of abusive actions. Abusive class actions on behalf of consumers are one of the greatest dangers in the Y2K area because such suits are easily created and controlled by plaintiffs' lawyers. While the Kerry Amendment does apply the minimum injury certification requirement to individual class actions, it does not apply to the proportionate liability and other substantive provisions in such cases. Besides, why should not consumers get the benefit of the bill's terms, which will speed remediation and negate the need for costly lawsuits, as CBO opined. 
   It is clear that the Kerry Amendment has serious flaws. I sincerely believe that Senator KERRY and the sponsors of his amendment are well-meaning. Their goals are in harmony with ours. But they are mistaken if they believe that their proposal would solve the Y2K problem. That is why I ask all Senators to support S. 96, as modified by S. 1138, the Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate Resolution recognizing June 22, 1999, as ``National Pediatrics AIDS Awareness Day.'' I am sponsoring this resolution today with my colleague Senator BOXER from California and 52 of our other colleagues of the Senate. 
   Senator BOXER and I are cochairs for the 10th anniversary of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which promises to be a wonderful event. But, more importantly, through the generosity of many individuals and organizations, substantial funds will be raised to further the research necessary to defeat this disease which threatens so many lives--including children. 
   Infection of children with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is very different than infection in adults. Infected children get sick faster; their immune systems may deteriorate more quickly; treatment protocols are very different; and they often involve more complications. Almost all children with HIV infection have acquired the virus from their mothers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, before preventive treatments were available, an estimated 1,000-2,000 babies were born with HIV infection each year in the United States. 
   Today, because of scientific and medical breakthroughs in pharmaceutical therapies, the mother-to-infant transmission rate has dropped from 43% in 1992 to 8% in 1997. The investment in prevention alone has resulted in avoiding an estimated 656 HIV infections and saves $105.6 million in medical care costs. Thus we are indeed seeing results from the time, energy, and resources being expended to fight this dreaded disease. My hat is off to those front line researchers and clinicians who have devoted themselves to this task. 
   While significant advances have been made in decreasing pediatric HIV infection, we must continue to work tirelessly to develop an HIV vaccine that will enable the safe and effective immunization of children and adults. We must better understand why HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects children of color and find cures to eradicate this epidemic. For our children living with HIV, we must provide them with the best possible therapeutic and social support to ensure their long, high quality life. I urge all senators to join me on June 22 at the National Building Museum to celebrate the successes which have been achieved in fighting HIV and AIDS among our youth and to renew our pledge to fight this disease until it disappears from the face of this earth.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when Congress enacted the BRAC legislation, it left little doubt that the local community was intended to be the prime beneficiary of surplused facilities. Agencies were designed and created to determine the best use of the facilities deemed surplus by BRAC. In many cases, it has been determined that local school districts are the best recipient for use of these facilities. 
   Unfortunately, local school districts and other public education entities today face a barrier in acquiring the surplused facility. 
   This barrier is a highly punitive fee established by the Department of Education that can actually discourage local education entities from acquiring surplus defense facilities. 
   ED has determined that certain non-instructional uses of these facilities, such as the vaguely defined ``research'' disqualify the district for a 100 percent exemption from the costs of acquiring the surplus facility. Similarly, ED has determined that certain other uses of these facilities, such as storage, even if directly related to instruction, warrants payment of a fee. 
   For example, if a school district wants to use 70% of a facility for instructional purposes and 30% for storage of teaching related supplies, this district could be charged upwards of $300,000. 
   Additionally, Mr. President, I find it somewhat ironic that, when the President's own education agenda calls for another federal program and more federal funding to provide school construction funds, the Clinton administration's Department of Education has concocted this schedule of fees to charge local school districts who wish to use surplus military property. 
   I know that in my state of Utah, we have a great need for additional facilities. For example, of Utah's 461,000 students, 22,255 of them--or nearly 5% take classes in portable classrooms. That is unacceptable and the arbitrary requirements that the Department of Education has set for districts to acquire disposed defense facilities are onerous and should be corrected. 
   I believe every public education entity ought to be eligible for a 100% exception from the payment of costs to acquire the facility when the surplus defense facility is used for instruction or other educational purposes. 
   I understand that the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee does not have jurisdiction over the Education Department. He does, however, have jurisdiction over the underlying statute that the Department of Education has a role in carrying out.

   Mr. HATCH. What I'm saying, and I know the Senator from Virginia agrees, is that public education is no less important than economic development. And, when it comes to pushing the desperately underfunded school district to a position where it must purchase its facility, while some undefined economic development function gets a free conveyance, I can only conclude that the President has his priorities badly reversed, despite his rhetoric on the importance of education. 
   At a time when we all seem to agree that we should do everything we can to help our state and local education agencies, we ought to be eliminating the requirement that local school districts jump through hoops just to be able to use surplus property--surplus because the community has already been hit by an economically devastating base closing.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleagues Senators BAUCUS and MACK to introduce the International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act of 1999. This bill will provide much-needed tax relief from complex and inconsistent tax laws that burden our American-owned companies attempting to complete in the world marketplace. 
   Our foreign tax code is in desperate need of reform and simplification. The rules in this arena are way too complex and, often, their results are perverse. 
   Mr. President, the American economy has experienced significant growth and prosperity. That success, however, is becoming more and more intertwined with the success of our business in the global marketplace. This has become even more obvious during the recent financial distress in Asia and Latin America. Yet, most people still do not realize the important contributions to our economy from U.S. companies with global operations. We have seen the share of U.S. corporate profits attributed to foreign operations rise from 7.5 percent in the 1960's to 17.7 percent in the 1990's. 
   As technology blurs traditional boundaries, and as competition continues to increase from previously lesser-developed nations, it is imperative that American-owned businesses be able to compete effectively. 
   It seems to me that any rule, regulation, requirement, or tax that we can alleviate to enhance competitiveness will inure to the benefit of American companies, their employees, and shareholders. 
   There are many barriers that the U.S. economy must overcome in order to remain competitive that Congress cannot hurdle by itself. For example, we have international trade negotiators working hard to remove the barriers to foreign markets that discourage and hamper U.S. trade. It is ironic, therefore, that one of the largest trade barriers is imposed by our own tax code on American companies operating abroad. Make no mistake: the complexities and inconsistencies in this section of the Tax Code have an appreciable adverse effect on our domestic economy. 
   The failure to deal with the barriers in our own backyard will serve only to drive more American companies to other countries with simple, more favorable tax treatment. We just saw this occur with the merger of Daimler Benz and Chrysler. The new corporation will be headquartered in Germany due to the complex international laws of the United States. 
   The business world is changing at an increasingly rapid pace. Tax laws have failed to keep pace with the rapid changes in the world technology and economy. Too many of the international provisions in the Internal Revenue Code have not been substantially debated and revised in over a decade. Since that time, existing international markets have changed significantly, and we have seen new markets created. The U.S. Tax Code needs to adapt to the changing times as well. Our current confusing and archaic tax code is woefully out of step with commercial realities as we approach the 21st century. 
   U.S. businesses frequently find themselves at a competitive disadvantage to their foreign competitors due to the high taxes and stiff regulations they often face. A U.S. company selling products abroad is often charged a higher tax rate by our own government, than a foreign company is. For example, when Kodak sells film in the U.K. or Germany, they pay higher taxes than their foreign competitor Fuji does for those same sales. 
   If we close American companies out of the international arena due to complex and burdensome tax rules on exports and foreign production, then we are denying them the ability to compete. Dooming them, and ourselves, to anemic economic growth and all its adverse subsidiary effects. 
   The bill we are introducing today is not a comprehensive solution, neither is it a set of bold new initiatives. Instead, this bill contains a set of important intermediate steps which will take us a long way toward simplifying the rules and making some sense of the international tax regime. The bill contains provisions to simplify and update the tax treatment of controlled foreign corporations, fix some of the rules relating to the foreign tax credit, and  make other changes to international tax law. 
   Some of these changes are in areas that are in dire need of repair, and others are changes that take into consideration the changes we have seen in international business practices and environments during the last decade. 
   One example of the need for updating our laws is the financial services industry. This industry has seen rapid technological and global changes that have transformed the very nature of the way these corporations do business both here and abroad. This bill contains several provisions to help adapt the foreign tax regime to keep up with these changes. 
   In the debate about the globalization of our economy, we absolutely cannot forget the taxation of foreign companies with U.S. operations and subsidiaries. These companies are an important part of our growing economy. They employ 4.9 million American workers. In my home state of Utah, employees at U.S. subsidiaries constitute 3.6 percent of the work force. We must ensure that U.S. tax law is written and fairly enforced for all companies in the United States. 
   This bill is not the end of the international tax debate. If we were to pass every provision it contains, we would still not have a simple Tax Code. We would need to make more reforms yet. We cannot limit this debate to only the intermediate changes such as those in this bill. We must not lose sight of the long term. I intend to urge broader debate about other areas in need of reform such as interest allocation, issues raised by the European Union, and subpart F itself. I believe that we must address these concerns in the next five years if we are to put U.S. corporations and the U.S. economy in a position to maintain economic position in the global economy of tomorrow. 
   This bill is important to the future of every American citizen. Without these changes, American businesses will see their ability to compete diminished, and the United States will have an uphill battle to remain the preeminent economic force in a changing world. This modest, but important package of international tax reforms will help to keep our businesses and our economy competitive and a driving force in the world economic picture. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill in the RECORD.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, once again we have a BRAC authorization measure before us. And once again the same deficiencies that led to the far-reaching political distortion of the prior, so-called ``independent'' BRAC commissions, are ignored. 
   I voted against the first BRAC authorization back in February 1989. At the time, I was one of only eight senators opposing the measure because, I said, it could not avoid political tampering. I was hoping to have been proven wrong. Unfortunately, I was not. 
   The proposal of my distinguished colleagues, Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN, is well-intended. There is no question that a properly run BRAC outcome could lead to funds freed up for force modernization, military pay increases, and many other badly needed defense needs, not the least of which is readiness. But it's not the motivation of my colleagues that I worry about. Rather, I still question whether this process can be completely objective. Whoever occupies the White House is also likely to be misguided by the same kind of outside pressures and political interests that characterized the previous BRAC disasters. 
   And, on a more parochial note, I am simply not going to vote to put my home state through this process again. We have proven over and over and over again that Hill Air Force Base and the other military installations based in my state are efficient, productive, and high quality. I am not going to vote to make them prove it again in a forum where the deck may already be stacked. 
   So with all due respect to my colleague from Arizona, I cannot support this amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this amendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor. I congratulate Senators GRAMM, THURMOND, and BYRD for their excellent statements on this matter, and for their leadership on this issue. 
   This amendment strikes section 806 of the bill, a provision that would effectively eliminate the Department of Defense purchasing preference for products supplied by Federal Prison Industries (FPI), also known by its trade name of UNICOR. 
   FPI is the federal corporation charged by Congress with the mission of training and employing federal prison inmates. 
   For more than 60 years, this correctional program has provided inmates with the opportunity to learn practical work habits and skills. It has enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in Congress and from each Republican and Democrat administration. An important part of this support has been the cooperative relationship between FPI and the Department of Defense--a relationship that has helped supply our armed forces in every war since 1934. 
   FPI is an irreplaceable corrections program. FPI and its training programs at federal prisons across the nation have been credited with helping to lower recidivism and ensuring better job-related success for prisoners upon their release--a result that all of us applaud. 
   Finally, FPI is an essential tool for ensuring a safe and secure correctional environment for staff, guards, and inmates in the federal prison system. Simply put, FPI keeps inmates productively occupied. And since the limited number of FPI jobs are coveted by inmates, getting and keeping these jobs are important incentives for good behavior by inmates. 
   These are important considerations as the federal inmate population continues to rise. In the last ten years, the federal inmate population has more than doubled, from 51,153 in 1989 to 108,207 in 1998. As Philip Glover, President of the Council of Prison Locals, AFGE, testified before the Judiciary Committee yesterday, ``We cannot afford to simply warehouse inmates.'' 
   Any corrections officer will tell you that the most dangerous inmate is the idle inmate. Idleness breeds frustration, and provides ample time to plan mischief--a volatile combination. Yet, despite the references to the costs imposed by FPI by my colleagues who oppose this amendment, I have heard no one suggest how the taxpayers will pay for the new prison programs and the additional prison guards that might be needed if FPI factories are forced to close. 
   Section 806 of this bill, which our amendment strikes, puts the FPI program at substantial risk, and would certainly result in the shuttering of some FPI factories. Section 806 exempts from the FPI mandatory source  requirement products priced below $2,500, products integral to or embedded in another product not made by FPI, or products which are components of a larger product used for military intelligence or weaponry. Together, these categories make up over 80 percent of DoD's purchases from FPI. FPI, in turn, depends on sales to the Pentagon for nearly 60 percent of its business. 
   Some may reasonably ask, why should there be a government procurement preference for FPI goods? The answer is simply this: when FPI was established, in perhaps an 
   unnecessary effort ensure the program did not affect private sector jobs, FPI was barred from selling its products in the commercial market. This is still the law. Thus, under current law, FPI may sell its products and services only to the federal government. Section 806 does not alter this sales restriction, and I do not understand the Senator from Michigan to be supporting such a change. 
   To ensure that FPI has adequate work to keep inmates occupied, congress created a special FPI ``procurement preference,'' under which federal agencies are required to make their purchases from FPI instead of other vendors, as long as FPI can meet price, quality, and delivery requirements. 
   Section 806 would remove this procurement preference, as it relates to the vast majority of sales to the Department of Defense. Without this preference, FPI could be crippled. Again, FPI is not permitted to compete for sales in the private market. It may only sell to the federal government, and then only if it can meet price, quality, and delivery requirements. And even then, waivers are available. 
   Nothing short of the viability of Federal Prison Industries is at issue here. Under full competition for federal contracts, combined with market restrictions, FPI could not survive. 
   My colleagues should remember that the primary mission of FPI is not profit. The primary mission of FPI is the safe and effective incarceration and rehabilitation of federal prisoners. Needless to say, FPI operates under constraints on its efficiency no private sector manufacturer must operate under. For example: 
   Most private sector companies invest in the latest, most efficient technology and equipment to increase productivity and reduce labor costs. Because of its different mission, FPI frequently must make its manufacturing processes as labor-intensive as possible--in order to keep as many inmates as possible occupied. 
   The secure correctional environment FPI in which FPI operates requires additional inefficiencies. Tools must be carefully checked in and out before and after each shift, and at every break. Inmate workers frequently must be searched before returning to their cells. And FPI factories must shut down whenever inmate unrest or institutional disturbances occur. No private sector business operates under these competitive disadvantages. 
   The average federal inmate is 37 years old, has only an 8th grade education, and has never held a steady legal job. Some studies have estimated that the productivity of a worker with this profile is about one-quarter of that of the average worker in the private sector. This is another disadvantage that, by and large, private companies do not have to operate under. 
   Finally, FPI is required to diversify its product line to minimize the impact on any one industry. Moreover, FPI can only enter new lines of business, or expand existing lines, after an exhaustive review has been undertaken to the impact on the private sector. Again, this is a restraint that most other businesses do not have imposed on them. 
   All of us share the goal of ensuring that FPI does not adversely impact private business. FPI has made considerable efforts to minimize any adverse impact on the private sector. Over the past few years, it has transferred factory operations from multiple factory locations to new prisons, in order to create necessary 
   inmate jobs without increasing FPI sales. FPI has also begun operations such as a mattress recycling factory, a laundry, a computer repair factory, and a mail bag repair factory, among others, to diversify its operations and minimize its impact on the private sector, while providing essential prison jobs. 
   Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that FPI actually creates a substantial number of private sector jobs. In FY 1998, thousands of vendors nationwide registered with FPI, and supplied nearly $419 million in purchases to FPI. And at the same time FPI trained and employed 20,200 federal inmates at no expense to the taxpayer in FY 1998, it also directly supported 4,600 jobs outside prison walls. 
   Every dollar FPI receives in revenue is recycled into the private sector. Out of each dollar, 76 cents goes to the purchase of raw materials, equipment, services, and overhead, all supplied by the private sector; 18 cents goes to salaries of FPI staff; and 6 cents goes to inmate pay, which in turn if passed along to pay victim restitution, child support, alimony, and fines. Incidentally, FPI inmates are required to apply 50 percent of their earnings to these costs. 
   Thus, while I have some sympathy for the intent of Senator LEVIN, who sponsored this provision in the bill, I must join Senator GRAMM in offering this amendment to strike Section 806. I would like to remind my colleagues that the Senate has addressed this matter before. Two years ago, Senator LEVIN offered a similar amendment. Mr. President, 62 members of the Senate voted instead for an amendment offered by Senator GRAMM and myself, requiring the Departments of Defense and Justice to undertake a joint study of the procurement and purchase processes governing FPI sales to the Department of Defense. 
   Just last month, this study was delivered to Congress. Interestingly, the report does not support the action proposed by section 806. To the contrary, the Departments of Defense and Justice jointly concluded that the report's ``recommendations can be made within existing statutory authority, and will not require legislative action.'' 
   In fact, neither of the Departments affected by section 806 support its inclusion in this bill. The Administration's official Statement of Administration policy is equally clear, stating that ``the Administration opposes Section 806.'' 
   In summary, either we want Federal inmates to work, or we do not. I believe that we do want inmates to work, and therefore I must oppose section 806. I say to my colleagues, if you believe in maintaining good order and discipline in prisons, or if you believe in the rehabilitation of inmates when possible, you should support this amendment. 
   I agree with those of my colleagues who believe that we must address the issues raised 
   by prison industries nationwide. As we continue, appropriately, to incarcerate more serious criminals in both Federal and State prisons, productive work must be found for them. At the same time, we must ensure that jobs are not taken from law-abiding workers. Under the leadership of Senator THURMOND, the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight yesterday held a hearing on this issue. Witnesses at that hearing urged Congress not to gut FPI without addressing the broader need for productive prison work. 
   FPI is a proven correctional program. It enhances the security of federal prisons, helps ensure that federal inmates work, furthers inmate rehabilitation when possible, and provides restitution to victims. Section 806 would do immense harm to this highly successful program, and I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to strike it.

   Mr. HATCH. This morning the Senate will resume debate on the juvenile justice bill. Under a previous order, the Senate will begin 60 minutes of debate on the Smith and Lautenberg pawnshop amendments. Following that debate, at approximately 10:30, votes on or in relation to the amendments will occur. Additional amendments are expected, and therefore votes will occur throughout the day and into the evening. 
   In addition, consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill will begin today. It is hoped that a time agreement on this legislation will be made and a vote on final passage will also take place today. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is an important day because this is the day on which we hope we can finally pass this juvenile justice bill. We have had another shooting of students just today at a high school in Georgia. The shooting occurred at 8 a.m. at the Heritage High School and a number of children were wounded. I won't go into the details, but the shooting was exactly a month after the April 20 slaughter at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where two students killed 13 people before taking their own lives. 
   It is apparent that we have to do something about this, and this bill is a very considered attempt to do exactly that. 
   Now, we are going to have two very crucial amendments this morning. The Smith amendment is first to come up, and this amendment is to resolve the pawn shop issue and the special licensee issue. I commend the distinguished Senator from Oregon and the distinguished Senator from Vermont in particular for their thoughtfulness in trying to resolve this difficulty. We want to do this in a bipartisan way. I surely hope people quit trying to score political points and help to get this bill done. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. I am happy to do that. 
   We are hearing a lot in the media and on the floor of the Senate demonizing those who believe in the second amendment, those who strive to protect the rights of American citizens. The sincere steps taken today to try to find a middle ground are slapped aside by some. And, quite frankly, I find that to be discouraging and dispiriting. 
   I still hold out hope that the Littleton shooting can bring out the best in all of us. We have come together on some issues and have before us a bill that responds to Littleton and does so in a way which respects the rights of law-abiding citizens. But to suggest, as one of our colleagues did yesterday, that in defending the second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens the Senate is ``whistling past the graveyard of Littleton'' is contemptible, in my view. Given what is in this bill already, how can anyone in good conscience really say such a thing. 
   If today's shooting in Atlanta isn't a wake-up call to those who want to play politics with this bill, I don't know what is. 
   Americans still believe that gun ownership is a basic right of our people. If any community would change its views as a result of the Littleton shooting, it would be the residents of Colorado, where prior to the shooting 70 percent believed firearms ownership was a basic right. Has support for gun control increased in Colorado? No, just the opposite. A recent poll found that 75 percent of Coloradans believe gun ownership is a basic right. The people of Colorado and elsewhere recognize that this is a complex problem and that going on a gun control feeding frenzy is not the answer. Those who think otherwise should take a deep breath, take stock in what we have accomplished to date with this bill, and bring this bill to passage, because this bill can have a dramatic effect on helping us to resolve some of these problems with teen violence in our society today. 
   We have had a vigorous and lengthy debate about gun shows and how best to limit criminal access to guns at these shows. There have been numerous unnecessary delays on this matter. Today I hope we can bring closure on this matter. This is an evolving process. After several days of debate last week, Republicans took a step to require background checks at gun shows without substantial cost and without overregulatory burdens. 
   We all realize our duty to do what is best for our children and to uphold the Constitution of the United States, including the second amendment. We all realize that the political benefits of scoring debating points lasts only for the hour, while the real benefits of protecting our children last for a lifetime. 
   The evolutionary process continues. The supporters of the Lautenberg amendment have made changes to their proposal to bring it closer to our  plan, and we are proposing the Smith-Jeffords amendment to deal with the pawnshop exemption and to clarify the special licensee provision. Our plan, however, does not impose substantial disincentives to obey the law. My sense and hope is that our efforts will continue to evolve and that we will be able to find common ground, a common ground that protects the rights of law-abiding citizens to legally use guns but punishes criminals who illegally use guns. 
   There is one firearm-related provision on which I hope we can reach bipartisan agreement. That is the treatment of pawnshops that have traditionally been exempt from the requirement to conduct background checks when they simply return a firearm to its owner. 
   Contrary to what the distinguished Senator from Nebraska said, if a stolen gun is pawned, it will be discovered when the gun comes into the pawn shop. State law requires pawn shops to notify state or local law enforcement agencies concerning the gun. These state and local agencies then check to determine if the gun is stolen. If the gun is stolen, the police can investigate and, if necessary, arrest the pawning customer. This all happens before the gun is returned to the customer and thus, before a Federal background check would be required. 
   The pawn shops protested the 1993 Brady law that required them to do a federal background check in addition to the state check they were already doing. Further, they complained about the 3-day waiting period. If a pawn shop had to wait 3 days under the orginal Brady law to conduct a federal background check, it could not return the gun to the customer when the customer repaid the loan. That is why Congress amended the Brady law in 1994 to exempt pawn shops from the requirement to do a federal background check. 
   The Craig amendment which we passed last Wednesday simply restored the exemption for pawnshops that had been part of the Brady law for 4 years and had been approved by some notable people, even some here on this floor. Thus, the Craig amendment did not effect a major change in law, but a change back to how the Brady law read from 1994 to November 1998 when the exemption lapsed as the instant check system became effective. 
   As I have stated repeatedly, it is my goal to find common ground on these issues. Wherever possible, I want to do what is best for our children and for the public, which is consistent with our oath as Senators to uphold the Constitution. Frankly, I viewed the pawn shop provision as a technical matter, one which should not be politicized. I am glad that Senators SMITH and JEFFORDS have made a bipartisan proposal to resolve this matter so that both sides can get together. 
   With respect to special licensees, last Wednesday the Senate passed the Craig amendment which provided that persons who wished to engage in the business of selling firearms but just at guns shows must obtain a special Federal license to do so. Subsequently, however, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle complained that the Craig amendment was not clear enough in requiring special licensees to conduct background checks. We have looked at the language and think it is clear. 
   Nonetheless, to address the concerns of our colleagues, I offered a simple one-page amendment last Friday which made it absolutely clear, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that special licensees were subject to the background check provisions of the Gun Control Act. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle rejected this clarification. Instead of dealing with their concern, they wanted to debate it, and, boy, have they debated it. 
   Today the Smith-Jeffords amendment contains the clarification I offered last Friday with a bit more explanation. It states:  
   Except as to the State and local planning and zoning requirements for a licensed premises as provided in subparagraph (D), a special licensee shall be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to dealers, including, but not limited to, the performance of an instant background check. 
   The key language of the amendment states:  
   A special licensee shall [not might, but shall] be subject to all [not some, but all] of the provisions of this chapter applicable to dealers, including but not limited to, the performance of an instant background check.  
   This could not be any clearer. Special licensees must perform a background check before selling a firearm at a gun show. So let's get rid of the talk about loopholes. 
   The Smith-Jeffords amendment deals in a bipartisan fashion with the pawn shop exemption and with the clarification of the requirement for special licensees to perform background checks. 
   There has been a lot of talk about loopholes, and the Smith-Jeffords amendment should lay most of that talk to rest. But the biggest loophole for criminals is the lack of enforcement of criminal laws that currently exist by our Attorney General and this administration. If we in Congress pass a law prohibiting a criminal transaction, it is the duty of the Attorney General to enforce it. But she has not. Our bill includes the CUFF program to fund more prosecutions of gun crimes and orders the Attorney General to report on her progress in prosecuting gun crimes. By enforcing criminal statutes, we can protect our children and our schools. If a criminal knows that the statutes we pass will not be enforced, however, we expose our children to more crime. 
   Let me make a point with these charts. Is this a record to be proud of in this administration? We are quoting the Executive Office of the U.S. Attorneys for these figures. Prosecutions under the Brady Act background checks: In 1996, zero. They claim that the Brady Act stopped 200-some-odd-thousand felons from getting guns. There was not one prosecution in 1996, not one prosecution in 1997, and just one prosecution in 1998. 
   If there is a loophole, it is in the failure of the Attorney General and the Justice Department to enforce the laws that are already on the books. Yet, you hear this hue and cry for more gun control laws. But this is only for political purposes because they know that their own Attorney General will not enforce these laws.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. The Senator really poses an interesting question. The current law requires no background check for sales at gun shows between non-licensed individuals. For sales by dealers, however, an Instant Check background check is required. If there is a question, the FBI gets 3 days to resolve the question. Of course, because a gun show generally lasts only 3 days, the show will be over by the time the FBI is through checking. 
   Our bill requires the FBI to resolve any question within 24 hours. This strikes a balance between the time constraints of a gun show and the time needed by the FBI to resolve any Instant Check question. 
   Further, this is an evolving process. As technology advances and more records are placed on the Instant Check database, the FBI will be able to resolve any question in less than 24 hours.

   Mr. HATCH. The Senator makes a good point. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I will work with the FBI and the ATF to ensure they have the resources to get the job done. We will do everything in our power to find the means to solve these problems. 
   Mr. President, with respect to the Attorney General's prosecution record, this is not a record to be proud of--this business of prosecutions under Brady. There were zero in 1996, zero in 1997,  and one in 1998. Yet, they want new laws. We are not enforcing the laws we already have. 
   Is this a record to be proud of? Prosecutions for transfer of handguns or ammunition to a juvenile: This Justice Department, in 1996, had nine prosecutions. We have had that many shootings in the last short while. In 1997, five prosecutions. In 1998, six prosecutions. Why aren't we enforcing the laws that already exist instead of making political points to have a whole bunch of other laws that there is a question whether the Justice Department will enforce? 
   Let me go into this one. Is this a record to be proud of by this administration? Prosecutions for possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone. Think about that. In 1996, four prosecutions; in 1997, five; in 1998, eight. 
   Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could enforce the laws that are already on the books? We would not have nearly the problems we have today. By the way, this business of prosecutions for transfer of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile, and others, there are thousands of cases that they know of and there are only these limited number of prosecutions. 
   Well, Mr. President, the plain fact of the matter is that the revised Lautenberg amendment, though improved to look more like the Republican proposal, is still not as good as the current bill as amended. 
   The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide qualified immunity to persons who obey the law and act appropriately with firearms, even after the Senate voted on it yesterday to provide qualified immunity when parents properly use child safety locks. The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide tax relief to licensees and others who perform background checks. And the revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to relieve gun show organizers of substantial new recordkeeping requirements. It is very unfair. 
   Thus, the revised Lautenberg amendment is a small step in the right direction, and I sincerely appreciate that step. However, in my view, it fails to go far enough. 
   The revised Lautenberg amendment will change an unregulated market into a very heavily regulated market overnight. In fact, by imposing this much regulation, without providing any immunity or tax protection, and without any provision for licensing temporary dealers, the revised Lautenberg amendment will create a black market in gun trading, because people will not go to the gun shows, they will go into the streets and do it. By creating a black market in gun trading, the revised Lautenberg amendment will inevitably promote gun sales where there are no Federal licenses, no records, and no background checks. We do not need a black market, but we need a free market with reasonable, nonburdensome regulations where buyers and sellers have incentives to comply with the law. 
   Mr. President, the current bill with the Smith-Jeffords amendment will strike the appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of law-abiding citizens to own, buy, and sell lawful products and the public interest in preventing criminals from obtaining guns. The powerful incentives included in our plan will ensure that persons will comply with the mandatory background check requirement on all sales at every gun show. The Republican plan also gives law-abiding gun owners the peace of mind that they have not inadvertently transferred a firearm to a felon, and strongly encourages the Attorney General to begin prosecuting the criminals who have violated the existing gun laws. 
   Mr. President, this juvenile justice bill is too important to our country's schools, parents, and children to be held up by endless debates. 
   Only this morning, we heard of another shooting in Georgia. So far, thank goodness, there have been no reports of death. 
   We have to stop debating and pass this bill. We have had enough delays. We need to protect our students and our schools now. We in the Senate have an opportunity to take a major step toward protecting our children by passing the juvenile crime bill. Our country needs it. We should do it in a bipartisan way, and we need to do it today. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
   The fact of the matter is that the overwhleming majority of instant checks can be completed in a matter of minutes. If the instant check system approves the purchase, it will do so quickly. If the instant check system disappoves the purchase, it will do so quickly. The problem is the portion that instead of being approved or disapproved, raise a question. Under the 24-hour rule, the Justice Department has to work harder to resolve questions for gun show instant checks. This is because the gun show will be over in 3 days. If you allow 3 days to resolve questions for gun show checks, the questions will not be resolved until after the gun show is over. It means private people are going to take their guns to the streets and sell them there. It means a black market. It means more problems--more accessibility to those who are unsavory in our society to guns. 
   I can't imagine why people can't see this, because it is as clear as the nose on anybody's face. The politics of it is more important than seeing the truth.

   Now look, the first amendment is not absolute.

It isn't like this is something unprecedented.  
   I think we have to look at these matters and see what we can do to change the culture in this society, because that is what is wrong. It is a lot more important than guns or anything else. 
   We have made it possible for these kids to see all kinds of filth and violence coming out of their ears. After a while, they get so that it becomes part of their lives. That is why this bill is so important. It is a lot more important than some of the assertions by some people on behalf of their amendments.

   Mr. HATCH. With respect to the amendment offered today by Senator HELMS, which amends the Gun Free Schools Act of 1994, I must say that I support this effort to make our schools gun and drug free. 
   The amendment would require an educational agency that receives federal funds to expel for not less than one year a student determined to be in possession of felonious quantities of illegal drugs. We're talking about quantities that indicate hard-core drug use, or drug trafficking. We're talking about dangerous, and predatory, behavior. We've simply got to get the people who bring these things into our schools out of our schools. 
   Now, I know that some of my colleagues may be concerned with the consequences of turning disruptive students out onto the streets for one year. I assure everyone that I understand that concern and direct their attention to the Alternative Education Grant provision found in the underlying bill. This demonstration grant provides funding to state and local education agencies to set up alternative education in appropriate settings for disruptive or delinquent students. These services are designed to improve the academic and social performance of these students and to improve the safety and learning environment of regular classrooms. This three-year demonstration project will provide alternative education to juveniles in trouble with or at risk of getting in trouble with the law, such as students who are expelled for carrying firearms or drugs to school. 
   I applaud the efforts of Senator HELMS for continuing to seek effective ways to curb the spiraling increase in drug abuse among our nation's youth. Anyone familiar with my record on combating illegal drug use knows that I am in favor of stiff penalties designed to deter criminal behavior, and never more so than when we are talking about behavior that harms our school children. I think this amendment, which contains a specific exception to the one-year expulsion rule by allowing the chief administering officer of the local educational agency to modify the expulsion requirement for students on a case-by-case basis, is a measured and principled response to the scourge of drugs in our schools. 
   Like the original Gun Free Schools Act, this amendment is motivated not only by a desire to punish those who bring illegal objects into schools, but also to address the immediate threat to the entire student population created by the presence of those objects. As with guns, felonious quantities--drug-trafficking quantities--of illegal drugs present a direct and serious hazard, both to the individual possessors, and to the other students as well. For this reason, it is appropriate that sanctions be the same in both cases.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I recommend to the Senator from Delaware that what we should have done is consider this amendment--that is, the Senator's legislative proposal--on the Department of Justice reauthorization bill, and deal with this issue at that time, but only after hearings to see whether we can resolve some of these problems raised by the Inspector General. The Biden amendment reauthorizes the Clinton administration's COPS Program. This amendment would cost in the neighborhood of $7 billion. It doubles the cost of this bill. I don't oppose more money to hire police and have law enforcement, but we need to ensure flexibility in our grant programs. The Biden amendment does not provide for adequate flexibility. The Congress has provided flexible grants to law enforcement through the local law enforcement block grants. 
   Ironically, the President's budget zeros out funding for the block grant program. Here we are debating a $7 billion amendment. The Department of Justice is proud of this program, but the Department of Justice's Inspector General does not share their view. The Department of Justice's Inspector General found serious mismanagement and inappropriate use of funds. 
   Let me cite a few examples that the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma referred to: 
   20 out of 145 grantees, 14 percent, overestimated salaries and or benefits in their grant application. I won't read all of this, but let me cite just a few more. 
   74 of 146 grantees, 51 percent, included unallowable costs in claims for reimbursement; 52 out of 67 grantees receiving COPS MORE grants, 78 percent, either could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers or could not demonstrate they had a system in place to track redeployment of officers in community policing; 60 of 147 grantees, 41 percent, showed indications of using Federal funds to supplant local funding, instead of using grant funds to supplement local funding; 83 of 144 grantees, 58 percent, either did not develop a good-faith plan to retain officer positions or said they would not retain the officer at the conclusion of the grant. 
   I believe there are some positive aspects to the COPS Program, but a $7 billion program with serious questions concerning the management of the program and the use of grants by recipients should not pass the Senate with only a 45-minute debate. 
   I want to work with my colleagues on the law enforcement grant programs, but we should not try to do it on this bill. I will work with anyone who wishes to join me, but not on this bill. I plan to move a Department of Justice reauthorization bill later this year. If my colleagues truly wish to work with me, I suggest to them we do this on that authorization bill. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. Let me make just a few more comments on this amendment. It has been suggested by the amendment's sponsors that the COPS program is responsible for the decline in crime in our country. Now, crime rates are still far too high, and are very high by historical standards. Be that as it may, we have seen some improvement in the past several years. But has the COPS Program been responsible for even the modest improvements we have seen? The evidence certainly suggests not. 
   First of all, the program's grants have always been too spread out to have more than a marginal impact on crime rates. Second, law enforcement authorities themselves have been skeptical. For instance, in 1995, Chicago experienced sizable reductions in murder, robbery, and assault well before the COPS Program ever got off the ground. The Chicago Police Department cited a number of local initiatives that made a difference, including tracking every gun used by juvenile offenders, and using a towing ordinance in effect for narcotics and prostitution enforcement. 
   Time and time again, the factor cited by the successful police executives traced the roots not to the Federal Government, but to local institutions, citizens, and police chiefs imposing accountability on their local police departments. 
   Perhaps the best example of all is New York City, where a new police chief successfully attacked quality-of-life crimes and enforced accountability for the officers of the New York Police Department by setting standards of performance backed by a system of incentives and disincentives. New York City's murder rate fell so fast its decrease alone accounted for over 25 percent of the total nationwide drop in homicides in 1996. 
   In 1997, the 21.7-percent drop in murders in New York City represented 14.8 percent of the total national decrease in murders. Yet, in New York City, which had 38,189 police officers in 1996, they added precisely 342 Clinton cops by 1995. Only 28 of the 342 new cops were actually new hires. 
   I would like hearings on this matter. I would like another full authorization bill. I hope our colleagues will not vote to double the costs of this bill with this particular amendment, as well intended as it is. 
   The distinguished Senator from Delaware knows that I have great feelings for him and for what he is trying to do, but I also believe we ought to do it in the right way.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the past, time seemed to roll past school shootings and similar tragedies. The public was quickly distracted. Yet, Littleton was different. The need to do something about the serious problem of youth violence has always been apparent. The tragedy of a month ago gave us the ingenuity and dedication to follow through. 
   I have said since the outset of this debate that this issue is a complex problem and one which requires dedication and a spirit of cooperation. I felt that we needed to examine this and other acts of school violence and not single-out one politically attractive interest as a cause. In doing what's right for our children and in doing what's right for the public at large, our personal interests had to take a back seat. While I believe the cooperative spirit was lacking on occasion, I believe that the Senate has crafted a consensus product and one which I intend to support.  
   At the start of this debate, I along with several of my colleagues announced a comprehensive plan to respond to the problem of violent juvenile crime. Our Youth Violence Plan contains four main components: 
   1. Prevention and Enforcement Assistance to State and Local Government; 
   2. Parental Empowerment and Stemming the Influence of Cultural Violence; 
   3. Getting Tough on Violent Juveniles and Those Who Commit Violent Crimes with a Firearm; and 
   4. Providing for Safe and Secure Schools. 
   Each element of this plan--all of it--is included in S. 254 as amended. 
   I. Prevention & Enforcement Assistance to State and Local Government: The first tier of this plan involved passage of the underlying bill--S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender and Accountability Act. We have provided a targeted infusion of funds to State and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. S. 254 provides over $1 billion a year to the States to fight juvenile crime and prevent juvenile delinquency. We need to reach out to young children early in life, insure that parents are empowered to do what they believe is best for their children, and take meaningful steps to give local education and enforcement officials the tools they need to hold violent juveniles accountable. S. 254 accomplishes this goal. 
   II. Parental Empowerment and Stemming the Influence of Cultural Violence: The second tier of our plan involved Congress taking steps to empower parents, educators and the entertainment industry to do more to limit the exposure of America's children to violence in our popular culture. We offered several amendments to the underlying bill which furthered this leg of our plan and all of them passed the Senate. For example, this bill gives parents the power to screen undesirable material from entering their homes over the Internet. We have given the entertainment industry the tools it needs to develop and enforce pre-existing ratings systems so that children are not exposed to material that the industry itself has deemed unsuitable for children. And we have established a National Commission on Youth Violence. It is time for us to hold Hollywood--and the rest of the entertainment industry--a bit more 
   accountable. 
   III. Getting Tough on Violent Juveniles and Enforce Existing Law: A third tier of our plan insured that violent juveniles--teenagers who commit violent crimes--will be held accountable. Part of the solution is to insure that when a teenager brings a gun to school, he or she is held accountable by school authorities and the criminal justice system. We take care of this in the bill. We also extend the Youth Handgun Safety Act to semi-automatic assault rifles. The bill before the Senate contains reforms like the juvenile Brady provision--a measure which will prohibit firearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. We increase penalties for transferring a gun to a minor and other corrupting acts. 
   Most importantly, we respond to the biggest of gun law loopholes--the Clinton Administration's failure to enforce the gun laws already on the books. We insure that the Department of Justice will fulfill its obligation to enforce the law. Prosecuting violent gun offenders will be made a priority for this Administration whether they like it or not. 
   IV. Safe and Secure Schools: The fourth element of our plan revolves around the basic right that all students share--the right to receive the quality education they deserve. Our teachers and students need to know that their school is safe and that, should they take action to deal with a violent student, the teacher will be protected. Our bill promotes safe and secure schools, free of undue disruption and violence, so that our teachers can teach and our children can learn. We provide greater flexibility to local communities in how they use federal education funds. We also provide teachers with limited civil liability protection should they take action to remove a problem child from school. 
   These are just some of the many, many reforms contained in this bill. There has been a sense among many Americans that we are powerless to reverse the trend of violence. People believe we are powerless to deal with violent juvenile crime and that we are powerless to change our culture. It is this feeling of powerlessness which threatened our collective ambition for meaningful, penetrating solutions in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. I believe the Senate has taken a meaningful step towards shedding this defeatism. 
   Do I agree with everything in this bill? No. For example, I oppose to the gun show regulatory and taxing amendment. But addressing this gun show issue has been evolutionary. Both sides have moved on this and--perhaps--we can find common ground as the bill moves 
    through the House and conference. 
   Given the seriousness of our youth violence problem--and the number of warning signs that tragedies will continue unless all of us come together--we must move forward. We should join together and pass this bill. 
   Finally, in closing I want to end this debate with a reminder. We have been on this bill for two weeks talking about violent juvenile crime, about the events in Littleton, about kids who use guns, and about kids influenced by violence in the media. Unfortunately, all of that is very true. 
   But let us not lose sight of the fact that there are millions of kids in this country, hundreds of thousands in Utah, who are really good young people. We give a lot of attention and this bill focuses even more of it on young people who get into trouble with the law. Let's not forget that about the kids who fly straight. As we wrap up consideration of this bill, let's thank the millions of young people across this land that work hard, study long hours, respect and love their parents and friends, and care for others around them. 
   Mr. President, I would like added as cosponsors of this bill and have their names appear as cosponsors immediately following my name: Senator LEAHY, Senator SESSIONS, Senator BIDEN and Senator FEINSTEIN. I am very proud to be able to be the prime sponsor with these wonderful cosponsors. 
   Senator BIDEN was one of the first cosponsors on this bill. I am more than pleased that my ranking member, Senator LEAHY is a cosponsor and a prime cosponsor.

   Mr. HATCH. I likewise congratulate the ranking member. 
   Mr. President, I ask 5 minutes be accorded to the subcommittee chairman of the Judiciary Committee who did more than any other single person to bring the good parts of this bill to the floor. He deserves a lot of recognition. This is his first term in the Senate. To have such a significant role on a bill of this magnitude I think is a great star in Senator SESSIONS' crown. I certainly recognize that and tell him what a pleasure it has been to work with him and with his staff in doing this. 
   Let me just add one last thing. The Senator is right, the Senator from Vermont. We are here trying to save our children. We are here trying to make this a better world for them. We are here trying to make it clear to people in this country there is such a thing as discipline and we have to abide by certain rules in society. This bill will help a lot of young kids out there to realize there are rules and they are worthy rules; if they will abide by them, we will continue to have a great society for the next 200-plus years. To the extent this bill has come through, as extensive and good as it is, we owe a lot to the Senator from Georgia. 
   I want to end this debate with a reminder. We have been on this bill for 2 weeks talking about violent juvenile crime, about the events in Littleton, about kids who use guns and about kids influenced by violence in the media. Unfortunately for all of us, that is true. But let us not lose sight of the millions of kids in this country, hundreds of thousands in Utah, who are really good young people. 
   We give a lot of attention, and the bill focuses even more, on young people who get into trouble with the law. Let us not forget that about the kids who fly straight. As we wrap up consideration of this bill, let's thank the millions of young people across this land who work hard, study long hours, respect and love their parents and friends, and care for others around them. There are millions and millions of good kids in this country. What we are trying to make sure is the kids who were led astray, the kids who we think may not be so good, they are going to get a break--or at least they are going to understand what the law is with regard to violence. This bill, I think, will go a long way to solving these problems. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday I met with former Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan, who now chairs the prestigious Public Health Policy Advisory Board (PHPAB). Dr. Sullivan presented to me their new report entitled ``Health and the American Child: A Focus on the Mortality Among Children.'' 
   I was immediately struck by the fact that the findings of the PHPAB report underscore both the need for the legislation we are debating here today and the tremendous importance we must place on prevention efforts so that we can reduce unnecessary deaths of our Nation's youth. 
   According to ``Health and the American Child,'' in the past two decades, two causes of child death have dramatically increased--homicide and suicide, which account for 14% and 7% respectively of all deaths for children under age 19. In teenage black males, the levels are so striking that the report uses the term ``epidemic'' to describe an eight-fold increase in homicide rates among African American youth, now their number one cause of death. 
   ``Homicide and suicide, the greatest new risks to children's health today, require both heightened preventive action as well as research into children's mental health and the social fabric in which they grow and develop.'' And that is precisely what we have been talking about during our debate on S. 254. 
   The PHPAB report goes on to define the contributing risk factors associated with mortality in children. Homicide and suicide, as the major killers of our children, are most closely associated with firearms, drug and alcohol use, and motor vehicles. These significant increases in both morbidity and mortality among our youth must be addressed and demand aggressive preventive action on our part. 
   I commend ``Health and the American Child'' to my colleagues and would be glad to make it available to any Senators who care to have the benefit of its considerable findings. ``Health and the American Child'' is really a call to action. It shows so dramatically why this bill we are debating today is important, and why we must set partisan rhetoric aside to get this legislation passed and enacted.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleague, Senator CONRAD, to introduce legislation aimed at helping companies to develop technologies for cleaner burning fuels. This is important to the people in my home state of Utah where air pollution is one of the top concerns of citizens. 
   I believe that cleaner burning fuels that will reduce emissions is a key element of the solution to this problem. The Biomass and Coal Facilities Extension Act would provide a tool for companies that are stepping into this void and developing clean burning fuels by extending the ``placed in service'' date under section 29 for facilities that produce alternative fuels. 
   Section 29 was originally created to encourage the development of alternative fuels to reduce our dependence on imports and to reduce the environmental impacts of certain fuels. With the enormous reserves of low rank coals and lignite in the United States and around the world, and with the potential for use of biomass and other alternatives, it is particularly important to the American economy and to our environment that new, more environmentally friendly fuels are brought to market both here and in developing nations. 
   Bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In particular, finding investors to take a new technology from a laboratory table to the marketplace is difficult because working the bugs out of a first-of-a-kind, full-sized plant is a costly undertaking. Incentives to bring new, clean energy technologies to the market in the U.S. are a worthwhile use of the tax code. 
   In 1996, Congress provided sufficient incentives to make the development of alternative fuels a viable pursuit by extending the section 29 ``placed in service'' date for facilities designed to produce energy from biomass or processed coals to July 1, 1998, provided that those facilities were constructed pursuant to a binding contract entered into before January 1, 1997. Many contracts were signed and construction projects started. 
   Then the Administration released its budget in February 1997. It contained a proposal to eliminate the extension granted just one year before, cutting off the section 29 credit for plants not completed by July 1, 1997, which is an impossible deadline to meet for many of these projects. 
   Without the assurance of the section 29 tax credit, financing for these projects dried up. Taxpayers were stranded in contracts, some of which contained significant liquidated damages clauses. As a result of the Administration's proposal, taxpayers essentially lost a significant amount of the extension given them by Congress in 1996. 
   The bill before us would give companies with projects already in progress and contracts signed by January 1, 1997 some additional time to finish these projects. The bill does not extend the contract deadline, allow more projects to be initiated, or change the 2008 deadline for receiving the section 29 tax credit. This bill simply restores some of the time that taxpayers lost in their efforts to develop environmentally friendly fuels under section 29. 
   Bringing new alternative fuel technologies to the market is an important part of our commitment to a cleaner environment and a secure economy. Congress reflected that commitment in our efforts to mitigate some of the financial risk involved in developing this much needed technology in 1996. This bill maintains that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate considers legislation that will help provide for greater consumer choice and competition in television services, S. 247, ``The Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act of 1999.'' The bill before us is a model of bipartisanship and cross-Committee cooperation. The cosponsors of this bill include, first and foremost, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, with whom I have worked closely on this legislation; the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE; the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, Senators DEWINE and KOHL; and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN. We have all worked together with many others of our colleagues to bring this important legislation along on behalf of our constituents. 
   The options consumers have for viewing television entertainment have vastly increased since that fateful day in September 1927 when television inventor and Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth, together with his wife and colleagues, viewed the first television transmission in the Farnsworth's home workshop: a single black line rotated from vertical to horizontal. Both the forms of entertainment and the technologies for delivering that entertainment have proliferated over the 70 years since that day. In the 1940s and 50s, televisions began arriving in an increasing number of homes to pick up entertainment being broadcast into a growing number of cities and towns. 
   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, cable television began offering communities more television choices by initially providing community antenna systems for receiving broadcast television signals, and later by offering new created-for-cable entertainment. The development of cable television made dramatic strides with the enactment of the cable compulsory license in 1976, providing an efficient way of clearing copyright rights for the retransmission of broadcast signals over cable systems. 
   In the 1980s, television viewers began to be able to receive television entertainment with their own home satellite equipment, and the enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1988 helped develop a system of providing options for television service to Americans who lived in areas too remote to receive television signals over the air or via cable. 
   Much has changed since the original Satellite Home Viewer Act was adopted in 1988. The Satellite Home Viewer Act was originally intended to ensure that households that could not get television in any other way, traditionally provided through broadcast or cable, would be able to get television signals via satellite. The market and the satellite industry has changed substantially since 1988. Many of the difficulties and controversies associated with the satellite license have been at least partly a product of the satellite business attempting to 
   move from a predominately need-based rural niche service to a full service video delivery competitor in all markets, urban and rural. 
   Now, many market advocates both in and out of Congress are looking to satellite carriers to compete directly with cable companies for viewership, because we believe that an increasingly competitive market is better for consumers both in terms of cost and the diversity of programming available. The bill we consider today will move us toward that kind of robust competition. 
   In short, this bill is focused on changes that we can make this year to move the satellite television industry to the next level, making it a full competitor in the multi-channel video delivery market. It has been said time and again that a major, and perhaps  the biggest, impediment to satellite's ability to be a strong competitor to cable is its current inability to provide local broadcast signals to its subscribers. (See, e.g., Business Week (22 Dec. 1997) p. 84.) In fact, marketing research by one firm found that 86 percent of those consumers who consider subscribing to satellite but ultimately do not do so, decide against satellite service because the local television signals are not available. (U.S. Satellite Broadcasting, ``Research Summary for Thomson Electronics,'' Aug. 1997, p. 6.) This problem has been partly technological and partly legal. 
   As we speak, the technological hurdles to satellite retransmission of local broadcast signals are being lowered substantially. Emerging technology is not enabling the satellite industry to begin to offer television viewers their own local programming of news, weather, sports, and entertainment, with digital quality picture and sound. This will mean that viewers in the remoter areas of my large home state of Utah will be able to watch television programming originating in Salt Lake City, rather than New York or California. In fact, one satellite carrier is already providing such a service in Utah. 
   Today, with this bill, we hope to remove the legal impediments to use of this emerging technology to make local retransmission of broadcast signals a reality for all subscribers. The most important result will be that the constituents of all my colleagues will finally have a choice for full service multi-channel video programming: They will be able to choose cable or one of a number of satellite carriers. This should foster an environment of proliferating choice and lowered prices, all to the benefit of consumers, our constituents. 
   To that end, the ``Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act'' makes the following changes in the copyright law governing satellite television transmissions: 
   It creates a new copyright license which allows satellite carriers to retransmit a local television station to households and businesses throughout that station's local market, just as cable does, and sets a zero copyright rate for providing this service. 
   It extends the satellite compulsory licenses for both local and distant signals, which are now set to expire at the end of the year, until 2004. 
   It cuts the copyright rates paid for distant signals by 30 or 45 percent, depending on the type of signal. 
   It allows consumers to switch from cable to satellite service for network signals without waiting 90-day period now required in the law. 
   It allows for a national Public Broadcasting Service satellite feed. 
   Many of my colleagues in this Chamber will recognize this legislation as substantively identical to a bill reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last year. It passed the Judiciary Committee this year again with unanimous support. I am pleased with the degree of cooperation and consensus we have been able to forge with respect to this legislation, and I am pleased that we have been able to bring this bill before the Senate for swift consideration and approval. 
   Let me explain how we will proceed. As I have indicated earlier, the bill we have before us is the copyright portion of a comprehensive reform package crafted in conjunction with our colleagues on the Commerce Committee. As the Judiciary Committee has moved forward with consideration of the copyright legislation embodied in S. 247, the Commerce Committee proceeded simultaneously to consider separate legislation introduced by Chairman MCCAIN, S. 303, to address related communications amendments, including important ares such as the must-carry and retransmission consent requirements for satellite carriers upon which the copyright licenses will be conditioned, and the FCC's distant television signal eligibility process. It is our joint intention to combine our respective work product as two titles of the same bill in a way that will clearly delineate the work product of each committee, but combine them in the seamless whole necessary to make the licenses work for consumers and the affected industries. To do that, Chairman MCCAIN will today offer the text of his committee's companion legislation as an amendment to the Judiciary Committee's underlying copyright bill. Upon adoption of this amendment, we will offer a manager's package of technical and conforming amendments to more fully meld the bills into a comprehensive, pro-consumer package that we can offer to the House for their consideration in a conference. 
   I am glad we are taking up this legislation today. We need to act quickly on this legislation. The Satellite Home Viewer Act sunsets at the end of this year, placing at risk the service of many of the 11 million satellite subscribers nationwide. Many of our constituents are confused about the status of satellite service in February and April to as many as 2.5 million subscribers nationally who have been adjudged ineligible for distant signal service under current law. The granting of the local license, together with some resolution of the eligibility rules for distant signals and a more consumer-friendly process, can help bring clarity to these consumers, and greater competition in price and service for all subscription television viewers. 
   I again thank the majority leader for his interest in and leadership with respect to these issues, and the chairman of the Commerce Committee for his collegiality and cooperation in this process. I also thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who have worked on this legislation. This bill is a product of a bipartisan effort with Senators LEAHY, DEWINE, and KOHL, and I have been pleased to work closely with each of them every step of the way. Finally, I thank the Register of Copyrights, Ms. Marybeth Peters, and Bill Roberts of her staff in particular, for their assistance and expertise throughout this process. The Senate process has been a more informed one, and the product of our efforts more sound as a result of their advice and recommendations. 
   In closing, I look forward to our consideration of this important legislation today, and to continued collaboration with my colleagues to help hasten more vigorous competition in the television delivery market and the ever-widening consumer choice that will follow it.

   Mr. HATCH. The reason I bring that up is we have had enough time on gun amendments, it seems to me. There has been a lot of getting together, and I have helped to lead that. I think it is about time we get on to the rest of this bill, which is much more important than the gun aspect of this bill. There is a huge number of things we do in this bill to try to stop juvenile crime in this country, and especially violent juvenile crime. This bill will help to alleviate that. So I want to finish the bill, and I think we ought to do the very best we can to do that.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say one other thing. This is an amendment that has already been debated, and it was defeated. So it is coming back again substantially in the same form. 
   Now, I was told yesterday that the minority believes they have narrowed their amendments down to about eight. As I understood it, they figured they would have three more gun amendments, including this, and possibly a fourth. 
   All we want to know is how many are we going to have and what are they so we are sure of what is going to come up. But in all honesty, I do not want to just keep debating the same subject over and over when we have made real honest and decent efforts to try to resolve these problems. 
   Be that as it may, I would like to know, as soon as I can, just exactly how many more gun amendments we are going to have to put up with or are we going to do the rest of the bill. Are we going to get something seriously done about juvenile crime or are we going to make political points in the Chamber, to the extent Senators think they are making them? 
   That is what I am concerned about. I would like to pass this bill which will make a real difference on accountability, making kids who commit violent acts responsible for their actions. For the first time, we actually have prevention moneys, more than accountability moneys. We are doing something about the cultural problems in this society--not something, a whole lot about the cultural problems--that really will work if we can just get this bill passed. Of course, we are going to get tougher on violent juveniles in the sentencing phase and a number of other ways from a law enforcement standpoint. 
   We have spent most of our time in the last 6 days--now 7 days--on gun amendments. We have made a real effort to try to accommodate people on the other side--and some on our own side--to resolve these matters. I think we have largely resolved them. Be that as it may, we will go on from here.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been working very closely with the Democratic leadership to try to get this matter to a conclusion. As I understand it, including this gun amendment, there are two others, and possibly a third besides this amendment. We are going to try to finish this bill. 
   Now, my personal impression is that they have gone too far. They are pushing this way too far. As the manager of this bill, I have tried to bring both sides together, and we have made a real effort to do so. I am starting to question whether or not we are getting a good-faith effort on the other side.  
   Now, this is the second time we have debated the Lautenberg amendment--the second time. To be honest with you, there is so much more in this bill than just the gun matters. I have helped to effectuate compromise on the gun matters, which I believe has been to the satisfaction of most all Democrats and most all Republicans--not all on either side. Here is where we are. We have fought back amendments on one side. I was told by colleagues on the other side of the aisle they had cut their list of amendments to eight and that three, maybe four, including this amendment, would be on gun control. 
   Today, they tell us that maybe they can agree to limit amendments. I have chatted with one of the top leaders on the Democrat side. He said they have agreed that we are going to get this done. But some have said maybe they can agree to limit amendments, but only after a vote on the Lautenberg amendment. 
   You see, they want to vote on Lautenberg, not just twice, but three, four, five--who knows how many times. Who is holding up this bill? I have to tell you, it isn't us. We will vote on Lautenberg, but I want to be sure that we have a unanimous consent agreement to vote on final passage. 
   I would like to vote on Lautenberg. But that is going to have to be the good-faith deal, because that is what I have represented to the other side. I think it is time to put this matter to rest. I think we can push these gun things only so far, especially when you have seen the good-faith effort I have made, and others on our side, to try to resolve these problems. The gun issue is an evolutionary issue; there is no question about it. We are trying to find ways of satisfying the vast majority of Senators. So far, we have been able to do that except with regard to the Lautenberg amendment. There is a very good reason why we will not vote for the Lautenberg amendment, or why we are going to vote for a tabling motion. 
   Much has been said about gun shows and how best to limit criminal access to guns at these shows. Not much has been said about the black market push that is going to happen if we get too bureaucratic about it, where people won't go to gun shows, where they will just sell them on the black market. That is the last thing on Earth I want, but that is what is going to happen. 
   I have to tell you, it is time to cut the rug. It is rug-cutting time. We are giving them the Lautenberg vote not because we think it is a worthy thing to do but because they are insisting on it. But there is a time when good faith says we move the bill. If Lautenberg is passed, so be it. If it does not pass, then so be it. 
   I have been saying for a long time that there have been numerous delays in debate on this matter. I have had some indications that there are going to be some more delays. We will have to see. 
   I am going to encourage my friends on the other side to limit the time. Let's get time agreement. Let's move ahead. Let's save the time of everybody in the Senate, and let's get a bill that will do something about juvenile justice in this country and about solving some of these serious problems we have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator very much. 
   I have been saying for a long time that how the Congress will deal with firearms violence is an evolving process. We began this debate with fairly ardent positions on both sides. 
   After several days of debate last week, Republicans took a step to require background checks at gun shows without substantial cost and regulatory burdens, and we passed the so-called bill on that, the Hatch-Craig bill. There was some gloating on the other side of the aisle, if I didn't misconstrue it. There were some Senators quoted talking about eating crow. These comments were not constructive at all. They made my job much more difficult on our side. We are here to do what is best for our children and to uphold the Constitution of the United States, including the second amendment. We are not here to score debating points, it seems to me. That type of comment, it seems to me, is very unconstructive and not conducive to getting a bill that will help our children and our country as a whole. 
   I would note, however, that the evolution of this matter continues. This time, the supporters of the Lautenberg amendment are making changes to their proposal to bring it closer to our plan that we passed in the Hatch-Craig amendment. My sense and hope is that our efforts will continue to evolve and we will be able to find common ground. That to me would be a great, great accomplishment. But I haven't seen that yet. We are evolving towards that. 
   I appreciate that my colleagues have recognized that the concerns we raised were legitimate and they have taken some steps in this current amendment to address the concerns. But I certainly  don't think they have gone far enough. I think they have gone too far in making it look like the only matter to consider on this whole bill happens to be guns. 
   Let's review how we got here. Under current law, non-licensed individuals can sell firearms at a gun show without obtaining a background check. This was the loophole that the President, the Lautenberg amendment sponsors, and others said they were concerned about. Yet, the bill as amended last week now requires background checks for these transactions at gun shows. 
   Under current law, persons who only want to sell firearms at a gun show are not licensed at all and perform no background checks. Our bill as amended requires sellers to obtain a federal license to sell firearms at a gun show. Because these special licensees, or temporary dealers, are now included in the Gun Control Act, they are subject to the background check requirements. 
   Further, our bill as amended provides civil liability protection to those sellers who complied with the background check requirements. 
   Our proposal also prevents the Federal Government from taxing background check transactions. The liability protection and tax relief were powerful incentives for persons to have background checks. 
   That is why we put them in the Hatch-Craig amendment. 
   Last week, when we first debated the Lautenberg amendment, we pointed out several problems. 
   First, the Lautenberg amendment's definition of a gun show was, at best, unfocused. 
   If two neighbors got together with 25 guns each and sold a gun, they would have been surprised to find that they had created a gun show and were criminals under the Lautenberg amendment because they did not conduct a background check or get a permit from the ATF. 
   We understand that the revised Lautenberg amendment now modifies the definition of ``gun show'' to conform with what is already in the bill, what we put in the Hatch-Craig amendment. It isn't totally that way because they still have their 50-person standard, and so forth, but basically they have come our way on it. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain that the bill's current definition of ``gun show'' would allow ``hundreds of guns'' to be sold at flea markets that do not fall under the 10 or more exhibitor or 20 percent exhibitor rule. Of course, if a very few sellers were selling hundreds of firearms, they would in all likelihood be engaged in the business--and that is an important phrase--in the business of selling firearms without a license. Under current law, such persons are subject to fines, prison sentences or both. 
   Secondly, the Lautenberg amendment allowed the imposition of taxes and fees on background checks that constitute a substantial cost for complying with the law. Now what does that do? That is going to force people to not go to gun shows where they can legitimately sell them with background checks now that we require it in this bill, and to go off and sell them on the black market. 
   What we are trying to do and what it seems to me will be the inevitable result of some of the approaches under the Lautenberg amendment, will be that we will create a huge black market in guns, which is exactly the opposite of what we want to accomplish. I am sure that the distinguished Senator from New Jersey does not want to accomplish that, nor anybody else on this floor, but think it through. It doesn't take many brains to realize that is what will happen. 
   We understand the revised Lautenberg amendment does not ``impose'' taxes on sellers and purchasers. However, the tax to which we objected is paid by the person or entity that conducts the background check, not to a nonlicensed buyer or seller. Of course, the licensee, special licensee or special registrants now in this bill will pass this fee on to the buyer or seller who will have to pay it. Of course, they will pass it on. They will not just do this out of the goodness of their heart. As they do that, people will go into the black market to sell their guns, the exact opposite of what the distinguished Senator from New Jersey and I and others, who are really trying to do something constructive in this area, want to occur. 
   In short, notwithstanding its appearance, the revised Lautenberg amendment allows for an ATF taxing authority loophole. The revised amendment seemingly concludes that we were right, but does not correct the problem. So on this provision we have a major concern. 
   Third, the Lautenberg amendment required gun show organizers to obtain advanced permission from the ATF before holding a gun show. It doesn't take many brains to realize that is something nobody wants to agree with who believes that gun shows are a time-honored right in this society under the second amendment. 
   We understand that the revised Lautenberg amendment currently before the Senate that will be at the end of this 
   amendment chain to be voted upon eliminates the advance permission requirement. However, gun show organizers are still required to keep extensive records, so there is a substantial burden that would be required, overregulatory burden. 
   Fourth, the Lautenberg amendment imposed extensive recordkeeping requirements for sales between nonlicensed individuals, thus driving up the cost of the background check and intruding into the privacy of law-abiding citizens. 
   That is just typical of what we have to face around here in the zeal to score points on guns. We understand that the revised Lautenberg amendment may require less records to be kept and may require the Federal Government to destroy records held by the instant check operator, yet dealers must still keep all records on the buyer. Further, the implication that requiring records to be destroyed after 90 days conveys a new benefit is not accurate. 18 U.S.C. section 922(t)(2)(C) already requires the instant check operator to destroy records of checks that were approved, and the FBI currently destroys the records after 90 days. There is no new benefit in this system compared to current law. So the Lautenberg amendment does not improve current law at all, it just obscures it. 
   Some have complained that the Republican plan promotes unaccountable interstate gun peddling by gun dealers. Under current law, a dealer from one State can go to a gun show in another State and solicit sales. He must return home to his licensed premises, however, to ship the firearm. And the shipment must be to a licensed dealer. That is current law. 
   Our amendment allows one federally licensed firearms dealer to deliver the firearm to another federally licensed firearms dealer who is located out of State. He still cannot deliver a firearm to a nonlicensed individual, but only to a licensed dealer. Thus, the purchasing dealer will have to log the firearm into his inventory, will be subject to inspection by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to find that firearm, and will have to conduct a background check to sell a firearm to a nonlicensed dealer. This is about the most regulated sale of a firearm for which the Federal law provides. 
   Next, some have stated that the current bill's provision for granting civil liability protection to people who comply with the background check requirement is not prudent. They say that the revised Lautenberg amendment provides no immunity for people who transfer guns to felons and others who intend to use the guns to commit violent crimes or felonies. 
   The bill, as amended, recognizes that persons who act properly with firearms--this is the amendment by Hatch-Craig--including firearms transactions, should not be subject to suit. Indeed, only yesterday, the Senate recognized the value of providing limited immunities to persons who act properly with firearms, by bestowing qualified immunity on persons who properly use child safety laws. This is a key incentive in the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee child safety lock amendment. The same reasons for affording civil liability protection apply here. Keep in mind we have evolved towards having something that brings both sides together. The current Lautenberg amendment split both sides apart and will result, in my opinion, in more black market sales in this country, to the detriment of the country. 
   Further, some complain that our bill dismisses certain suits. These are only those suits at which nonlicensed individuals have voluntarily sold a firearm  through a licensed dealer who conducted a background check. If persons are now 
   voluntarily having background checks performed at gun shows, they should not be penalized for doing so. That is something we want to encourage. We want to give incentives for that. 
   I also note that the bill provides no immunities for criminal sales of firearms. If a seller knowingly transfers a firearm to a buyer who will use that firearm to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, he is subject to severe criminal penalties. Further, if the seller is convicted of that offense, the bill expressly provides that he is not entitled to civil immunities. Thus, he could be sued for compensatory and punitive damages. 
   Some have complained that the bill, as amended, does not impose stiff enough penalties on special licensees and special registrants for the failure to obtain a background check. However, current law suspends the license and imposes a fine on dealers who do not conduct a background check. Our bill maintains the current penalties for background check failures and imposes tough mandatory minimums for the knowing transfer of a firearm to a juvenile who will use that firearm in a crime of violence. That is a major change. And we put it in our bill. In fact, a lot of these things that were requested by the President we have in the bill. We had them in there before he requested them. I suspect he might have had somebody look at the bill. 
   Further, through our aggressive firearms prosecution program, the CUFF Program, and the prosecution reporting requirement, we ensure that some of these violations actually will be prosecuted by the Attorney General--something that hasn't been undertaken in earnest over the last 6 years. 
   Remember, of the thousands of possible cases, the Attorney General only prosecuted one Brady case, one Brady background check violation, from 1996 through 1998. Of the thousands they claim, 225,000 turned back felons, one prosecution. 
   The Lautenberg amendment not only fails to include the tough mandatory minimums found in the Republican plan, it acquiesces in the Attorney General's almost complete failure to prosecute Brady violations. This makes no sense. If we in Congress pass criminal statutes, it is the duty of the Attorney General to enforce those laws. Our bill recognizes that we have a problem at the Department of Justice and our bill does something about it. Some have also stated that our bill has the potential for invading the privacy of gun owners by nonspecial registrants and special licensees to conduct background checks. 
   This argument goes that by requiring the Instant Check operator to destroy records of an approved background check immediately, special licensees and special registrants will be able to conduct background checks on anyone, even non-gun buyers, and there will be no audit trail to catch them. 
   Of course, special licensees and special registrants will have to undergo a background check, a field examination, and an interview just to obtain their license or registration. And they must keep records of the persons for whom they used the Instant Check system. Thus, the ATF can take these records, contact the persons listed, and determine if they attempted to purchase a gun using the services of the special licensee or the special registrant. If they did not, the special licensee or the special registrant will be held accountable, just as dealers are now. 
   Further, gun owners would much rather entrust their privacy interests to special licensees and special registrants than to the Federal Government. The argument that more record keeping on lawful gun ownership by the Federal Government would protect privacy better than less record keeping by the Federal Government carries little weight. 
   Mr. President, all of these concerns are less than compelling. The plain fact of the matter is that the revised Lautenberg amendment, though improved to look more like the Republican proposal, is still not as good as the current bill as amended. 
   The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide qualified immunity to persons who obey the law and act appropriately with firearms, even after the Senate voted only yesterday to provide qualified immunity when parents properly use child safety devices or child trigger locks. 
   The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide tax relief to licensees and others who perform background checks. 
   And the revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to relieve gun show operators or organizers of substantial new recordkeeping requirements. 
   Some are complaining that the 24-hour requirement for instant check is not good enough. They would require 3 days. But gun shows only last 3 days. If we do not have a 24-hour instant check requirement, the gun show is going to be over. The ATF has the technology and the funding to get the job done in 24 hours, and it should. We should not force people into a black market where there are no licenses, no records, and no background checks. We do not need to do that. 
   Further, we even offered to make the background check requirement for special licensees express. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle rejected this, or objected to my modification of my own amendment, one of the few times in my 23 years where a Senator was refused the right to modify his own amendment to please the other side--even though it was not necessary, in my view, and I think in the view of any reasonable person who looks at it. 
   I want to make sure that persons who sell a substantial number of guns come inside the gun show and get a Federal license. These special licensees must submit to a background check and an ATF interview, they must comply with the Gun Control Act, and they must conduct background checks--something that has evolved into something that both sides ought to be willing to agree to. 
   Mr. President, there is one firearm-related provision on which I hope we can reach bipartisan agreement. And that is the treatment of pawn shops, gunsmiths and repair shops that have traditionally been exempt from the requirement to conduct background checks when they simply return a firearm to its owner. Prior to the 1993 Brady law, States required pawn shops to report the pawn of a firearm to State or local law enforcement agencies. Thus, there was already a state law check on the firearm. The Brady law, however, when it passed inadvertently required a Federal background check on returned firearms in addition to the state check. The pawn shops raised concerns because State law already required them to undergo a background check and because waiting on a background check to be returned before returning a firearm to its rightful owner affected their business. 
   Because these were real concerns, many in Congress supported an exemption to the Brady law which exempted pawn shops, gunsmiths, and repair shops from the Federal background check. It passed the Congress as part of the 1994 crime bill. Many of the people attacking the Hatch-Craig amendment's so-called pawn shop loophole voted to do the same thing in 1994 when the crime bill passed. Frankly, if what we included in the Hatch-Craig amendment is a loophole, it was a loophole when Senator LAUTENBERG voted for the crime bill in 1994 and when President Clinton signed it into law. 
   Indeed, after the Brady law passed, Senator SCHUMER even wrote a letter to the Treasury Department asking them to draft regulations to exempt pawn shops from the Federal background check requirement. To be fair, however, I should note that then-Congressman SCHUMER did vote against the amendment to the 1994 crime bill that provided the statutory exemption for pawn shops, but he still took a position in his 1994 letter to the Treasury Department which is consistent with our amendment. 
   If the pawn shop exemption from a Federal background check is a loophole now, it was a loophole in 1994 when Senator SCHUMER asked the Treasury Department to draft it. 
   The Craig amendment that we passed last Wednesday simply restored the exemption for pawn shops that had been part of the Brady law for 4 years. Thus, this was not a major change in law, but a change back to how the Brady law read from 1994 to November 1998 when the exemption lapsed as the Instant Check system became effective. 
   However, I know that the good Senator from New York has legitimate  concerns and wants to address those concerns. Neither of us want a person to commit a crime and then get a firearm. However, I believe neither of us want to overburden legitimate business transactions. 
   As I have stated repeatedly--it is my goal to find common ground on these issues. Wherever possible, I want to do what's best for our children and the public in a manner which is consistent with our oath as Senator to uphold the Constitution. Frankly, I viewed this provision as a technical matter--one which should not be politicized. 
   I just have a minute more to go, maybe a minute and a half, because I know there is limited time here. 
   Let me just sum it up. 
   Thus, the revised Lautenberg amendment is a small step in the right direction. And I sincerely appreciate that step. However, in my view, it fails to go far enough, and it may create more problems than currently exist. 
   The current bill as amended strikes the appropriate balance between the privacy interests of law abiding citizens and the public interest in preventing criminals from obtaining guns. The powerful incentives included in our plan will ensure that persons comply with the mandatory background check requirement on all sales at gun shows. The Republican plan also gives law abiding gun owners the peace of mind that they have not inadvertently transferred a firearm to a felon, and requires the Attorney General to begin prosecuting the criminals who violate the existing gun control laws, 
   something that has not been done, now, for a number of years, maybe the whole time of this administration--since the Brady bill. 
   Accordingly, when the time arrives, I will move to table the revised Lautenberg amendment in order to allow the bill as currently amended to stand, because I think it will do a better job of accomplishing what everybody here seems to want, everything the current Lautenberg amendment will do. 
   I am sorry this took so long. I apologize to my colleagues, but it was important to make these points.

   Mr. HATCH. I may need a little bit more than that because of Senator KERREY's remarks and the remarks of the Senator from California. So I will ask unanimous consent when I do that. 
   Senator KERREY says a lot of pawnshop guns could be stolen. But let me remind the Senator that State law already requires a check with State or local law enforcement agencies. If the gun is stolen, the State law catches this. So the Lautenberg amendment does not do anything particularly good on that. 
   Without the special license provision, gunsmiths and others will not go into a regulated gun show. It is just that simple. These people generally do not have to be licensed now. Under the bill as currently amended, we require them to keep records and to comply with all of the provisions of the Gun Control Act. If we regulate gun shows without a special licensee, we will force these people into the black market. So let's require them to be licensed. That is one of the points I was making there. All the other points I made I do not think have been rebutted at all. 
   Mr. President, we now reach that point where we have the debate on four amendments, 10 minutes equally divided. We will begin with the Wellstone amendment No. 358; then we will go to the Sessions amendment No. 357; then to the Ashcroft amendment No. 361; and then the Santorum amendment No. 360, with the votes to occur beginning at 1 p.m., as I understand it. 
   Should we go with Sessions first? I will be happy to do that. Let me rearrange the order. We will start with Sessions amendment No. 357, then Wellstone amendment No. 358, then Ashcroft amendment No. 361, and then Santorum amendment No. 360. OK.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me once again start by complimenting the Senator from Minnesota's commitment to the problems associated with mental health conditions. 
   I share his commitment, but I have a number of grave concerns about his amendment to provide $1 billion a year in new funding to hire over 100,000 school-based mental health personnel. 
   As I noted in my statement yesterday, there is no evidence whatsoever to support the assertion that the recent tragedies in Colorado and Oregon would have been prevented by having more school counselors. 
   Let me reiterate what I observed yesterday: it has been reported that both Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gotten fairly extensive individual counseling, had undergone anger-management training and had gotten affirmative evaluations from counselors. 
   One of Dylan Klebold's teachers had expressed concern about some of the things he was writing in English class to a counselor. 
   It has also been reported that the 15-year-old Oregon killer, Kip Kinkel was currently in counseling, along with his parents, when he killed them and went on to kill two of his classmates and injure a number of others. 
   Please don't misunderstand me, Mr. President, I do not want in any way to undercut the very fine and vital work done by counselors in my state of Utah  and around the country. I respect them. Their work is important and valuable and I support their efforts 100 percent. 
   I merely make the point that more counselors would not have prevented these recent tragedies. 
   Additionally, Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I have an almost knee-jerk reaction whenever I hear that the federal government is--once again--attempting to micromanage public education. 
   I believe that we can best support our local schools by adequately funding current federal education programs and allowing state and local education agencies the flexibility to make important education decisions unencumbered by federal regulation. 
   I sincerely beleive that $1 billion of new federal taxpayer dollars will not do as much to encourage a renewed commitment to strengthen mental health outreach as local school boards, parent groups and local civic mental health and law enforcement organizations working together. 
   This amendment is a Washington knows best, big money, unfunded answer to complicated questions that can best be addressed through local efforts. 
   Mr. President, I get am getting a little tired of seeing some of our colleagues throwing money at issues without regard to costs. I am geting a little tired of hearing that the answer to everything around here is simply to throw more money at it. There is no question that counselors can be effective, but a lot of other things are too, and we have a lot of effective programs in this bill. Frankly, it is time to get this bill passed and quit delaying it.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we continue to throw money at these problems and not solve them. First, the Senator's bill called for $1 billion and now it calls for $340,000,000. Which one is it? And how do we know that this latest amount is what is needed? We can't keep pulling extraordinary amounts of money out of thin air and justify spending the amounts because problems may exist. We continue to take time on this floor to delay a bill that can help solve these problems. The fact is that we take care of a lot of these problems in the bill without throwing an inordinate amount of money toward them.

   Look, you are not the only Senator on this floor who cares about kids. I have a record of 23 years of leading a fight for most of the children's programs that have passed here. And every one of them takes into carefull consideration how much money should or should not be spent--child care, the child health insurance bill; you name it, I have been there. Right now, I am raising over $2 million for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. I don't need to be lectured by the Senator from Minnesota, whose answer to everything is to throw more money at every problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. This amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, originally to provide $1 billion more but modified now to provide $340 million, after modification, a year in new funding to hire 141,000 school-based mental health personnel: 100,000 school counselors, 21,000 school psychologists, and 20,000 school social workers. These funds have to be matched by the States and localities. 
   Now look, this is another attempt to micromanage our educational system in this country from Washington. It is an expensive add-on that should not be on this particular bill. 
   I made the case earlier that we are in favor of counselors, but there is a limit to everything, and the counselors may or may not be the answer here, especially in the Klebold matter--in the Columbine matter, and a number of other matters where the boys were under counseling. 
   The fact of the matter is, this is another ``Let's throw money at it'' at the cost of society.

   Mr. HATCH. I have to ask the Senator, this debate has gone on for quite a well. It has been one of the better debates I have seen or listened to, on both sides. 
   It is clear we have a difference of opinion. It is clear both sides think they have a legitimate case to make. I know the distinguished Senator is one of the champions for persons with disabilities, as am I. We have worked closely together through the years. I understand the difficulties that are involved here. I understand his sincerity. I also understand the sincerity of the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Tennessee. They are decent people. They are good men. The Senator from Tennessee is a major force on the Labor Committee, as is the distinguished Senator from Iowa. 
   We are in the middle of a bill that really needs to be passed now. This is our seventh day on this bill. It is not a full-blown crime bill that took a tremendous amount of time. This is a limited, narrow bill with a lot of provisions that will make a difference with regard to children in our society. I would like to bring it to conclusion. 
   I guess I am asking my friend from Iowa, can we get an idea of how much time the Senator desires? I will talk to my people on my side to try and shorten our time so we can proceed with the rest of the amendments on this bill and hopefully lock in the final time agreement on all the remaining amendments and a final vote certain so everybody in the Senate will know what we are doing. I just want to ask my colleague if he will cooperate with me and set a time agreement so we can move this bill ahead, rather than have this stay in the logjam it is in. 
   It is a sincere set of differences. It seems to me the way to resolve those differences is time honored. We go to a vote on this amendment and then I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment be the Senator's amendment which rebuts this amendment. So we go to a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Iowa and let the chips fall where they may. 
   I don't see any reason to delay this bill when I am willing to make that offer. I will see that the Senator gets an amendment immediately following. 
   If you win, you win; if you lose on this one, you lose.

   Mr. HATCH. I can understand why the Senators from Missouri and Tennessee want a vote on their amendment. I can understand why the Senator wants a vote on his amendment. It is a legitimate way to resolve an issue. I don't know which way the votes will go on either issue and I take a great interest in this as well. But there will be a conference and we will probably resolve these issues in the best interests of all. 
   My position is we have had a lengthy debate. I have deliberately stayed off the floor because I wanted Senators to have a free and open debate on this. But it seems to me we have had the debate. Basically, both sides have really explained their positions. Everybody knows what they are. 
   My suggestion is we go to a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Missouri, up or down, and then if they lose, they lose. Then I will ask unanimous consent, whether they win or lose, that the Senator be entitled to immediately bring up his amendment which would undo everything they are doing and we go up or down on a vote there. And we even could have an additional period of time so people could hear one last explanation on the differences between the two sides. 
   What I want to avoid is a filibuster. I want to avoid the Senator feeling he has to now delay this whole bill because he feels deeply about this issue. I feel deeply about it, too. I think these Senators on this side feel deeply about it. You feel deeply about it. Frankly, there is still a conference where we can work with both sides to see if we can resolve this as we go to conference. But I would like to be able to push this bill forward, because it is an important bill and every day we delay--we all know once we get it through the Senate, the  bill has to come through the House. Then we have to go through conference. Then we have to send it down to the President. If he signs it, then it becomes law. 
   We are talking weeks or months before we can get a juvenile justice bill passed that might prevent more Columbine High School massacres. But we have to get this done. 
   We also have a supplemental appropriations bill that has to be brought up, because it is important. It is not fair to hold this bill hostage--either side--now. It is not fair to hold this bill hostage because of a dispute that literally is a legitimate dispute on both sides that can be resolved by voting. Let the chips fall where they may. I have had to do that. I have had to eat a lot of stuff here on the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. As has the distinguished Senator from Vermont. 
   As floor managers, we are trying to bring people together. I say to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, I believe he has faith that I will always try to do what is right for persons with disabilities. I will use my optimum good efforts to try to make sure this matter is resolved in a manner that is credible and acceptable to both sides--or at least as acceptable as can be to both sides. But I would like to set a time limit for further debate, which I hope will not be very long because you have been debating now for hours. I think virtually everything has been said that needs to be said. Then let's just go to those votes. 
   The Senator is not on a list right now, to come up, I do not believe, after this amendment. But I will get you on the list. I will ask unanimous consent you be given that privilege. I think it is fair. I think it is a way of resolving this. I don't want to see a filibuster here at the last minute on a bill of this importance when this could be resolved through voting and when I am giving the Senator a shot at his amendment, which basically rebuts theirs, immediately following it. I think that is fair. It is a reasonable way of doing it. 
   You are dealing with two managers who have done their utmost to bend over backwards for everybody on the floor. I have even bent over backwards for the Senator from Minnesota, time after time--I finally got a smile out of him. It is the 
   only time he smiled all day. 
   But I would like to see my friend from Iowa do that. If he would, I would personally appreciate it. I would like to get this bill done, at least pushed forward as far as we can. I believe we can finish this bill tonight if we have time today. We have had 7 days on this bill. I would hate to go on 8 days, but I would even do that if we have time agreements on all these amendments, time agreements on when we vote, and let the chips fall where they may and let's go at it. 
   I intend to call up an amendment as soon as these two are disposed of, if that is what we do, and we will move ahead on the other amendments and we will try to shorten the time on all the amendments. I am asking the distinguished Senator from Iowa to shorten the time, agree to a time agreement, and I will certainly live up to asking unanimous consent and getting his amendment immediately following the amendment of the distinguished Senators from Tennessee and Missouri. 
   Will the Senator please help me in that regard--help us, Senator LEAHY and me?

What that does for you--you are concerned about Senators learning, knowing what to do and hearing your position--when they know there is a time certain, that is when Senators generally try to listen.

   Mr. HATCH. I have been trying to avoid a filibuster here on a bill that I think everybody admits is very important. The Senator has indicated he is willing to filibuster. And as 
   somebody who has been around here a long time, who knows how to do it, I recognize one when I see one. 
   Let me make an offer here that I think is superfair. I have tried to make an offer that the Senator get in line right behind this amendment so he has every shot at his amendment. 
   Let me ask Senators FRIST and ASHCROFT, as well, would both sides be willing--since we know 60 votes is the key, would both sides be willing to do this: That we call up for a vote, after another reasonable time for final debate here, but hopefully a very short time, call up the Ashcroft-Frist/Frist-Ashcroft amendment? And if it does not get 60 votes and we call yours up right after, if neither of them gets 60 votes, we pull them both, rather than have a filibuster here--excuse me, Lautenberg and Frist. OK. 
   Let me ask, I have to ask the Senator from Vermont. It has been suggested that since we had had problems with this amendment, which is 60 votes, if they don't get 60 votes, they pull it. We do the same with the Lautenberg; if he doesn't get 60 votes, we pull that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. As usual, I have to commend the Senator from Minnesota for his heart and for his desire to try to resolve problems that are difficult in our society. I have to say that I am concerned about the disproportionate confinement of minority youth, especially young African Americans and Hispanics, in our society--especially African Americans because it is disproportionate. If you really stop and think about it, the issue is who is committing the crimes. 
   I also agree it would be wonderful if we had a perfect system of rehabilitation for these young people. The juvenile justice bill provides an additional $547 million in addition to the $4.4 billion we spend annually for helping young people to get rehabilitated or to help prevent crime to begin with. I think that is the right direction. 
   This is probably the first bill in history that has 45 percent of the money in the bill for law enforcement and accountability purposes and 55 percent of the money for prevention purposes. But, you know, you still can't ignore the fact that these kids are committing crimes. Just because you would like the statistics to be relatively proportionate, if that isn't the case, because more young people commit crimes from one minority classification than another, it doesn't solve the problem by saying states should find a way of letting these kids out. 
   Now, if there is another problem, if there is literally a civil rights violation or a discrimination against minority youth, then that is a problem I think would need fixing. But I don't think that is a case that has been made so far. 
   The Democrats' amendment requires States to address efforts to reduce the proportion of juveniles who have contact with the juvenile justice system who are members of minority groups, if such proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in the general population. It fails to take into consideration who is committing these crimes. If a higher proportion of young African Americans are committing the crimes, do we just ignore that because we don't like the fact that it is disproportionate compared to Hispanic Americans or Anglo Americans? I don't see how you get around the fact that the ones who are committing the crimes are the ones who are arrested or incarcerated. 
   This amendment is not only ill-advised as a matter of policy and principle, but it is also unconstitutional. The amendment makes an overt racial classification. Juveniles must be classified according to race in order for this amendment to be followed. 
   This amendment is unconstitutional. As the Supreme Court announced in the 1979 decision of Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney:  
   A racial classification, regardless of its purported motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.  
   Now, such a classification could be upheld if there is an extraordinary justification, but that is not evident here. I just hear that there are more young African American kids who go to jail than white kids; therefore, there must be something wrong with the system. 
   I don't agree with that. If there are more young African American kids  committing crimes, and especially vicious crimes and violent crimes, you don't help the problem by saying they should not be punished and they should not be incarcerated somehow or other be sent to--unless there is a justification for that. 
   Now, according to Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, a 1979 decision:  
   A racial classification, regardless of its purported motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.  
   That is the law, and I think it is a correct law. 
   More recently, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution requires the strictest judicial scrutiny ``of all race-based action'' by Government. What does that mean? It means that this amendment is subject to strict scrutiny and can be constitutional only if it is, under Adarand, ``narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.'' 
   This amendment does not pass strict scrutiny. The only ``compelling interest'' the Supreme Court has recognized in this context is the remediation of past discrimination. Moreover, the Court requires a particularized showing of past discrimination. I don't think anybody would disagree with that. 
   Here there is no such proof of discrimination, and the current law, which this amendment replicates--and, I might add, expands--is not narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination. In fact, the Justice Department regulations under current law require States to intervene regardless of the cause of disproportionate confinement. Instead of remedying past discrimination, much of the current law is aimed at prevention programs. This amendment, and the current law it replicates, cannot pass strict scrutiny. 
   I wish I could support this amendment, but its constitutional flaws prevent that. And, frankly, I believe that this amendment is bad social policy, because basically this amendment just says that these young people who have been engaged in criminal activity, somehow or other, should be proportionately given a break because there are more--in this case--young African Americans than young whites who are convicted. Now, that is unconstitutional in the light of Adarand and the Feeney case, and, frankly, under any principle of race neutrality in the justice system. 
   The proponents of this amendment are motivated, in my opinion, by the best of intentions. I share their concern. That is one reason I want this juvenile justice bill to pass, so we can get serious about violent juvenile crime and so we can use the tools of this bill to help to prevent that in the future. And we have significant prevention moneys in this bill to help get these kids away from ever committing crime again. 
   Like I say, the proponents are sincere. They want to help minority children avoid detention. However, I believe the best way to prevent the detention of juveniles is to prevent juveniles--of all races--from committing crime. I am proud that S. 254 provides $547.5 million in new funds for prevention programs. I have had to fight to get that. That is on top of and in addition to the $4.4 billion that we already have on the books every year for prevention programs. 
   It is unhealthy for the Government to focus only on reducing the detention of minority juveniles. We should focus on preventing crime committed by juveniles of all races and recognize that detention of juvenile offenders is sometimes necessary. As this current debate illustrates, it is inherently divisive when the Government makes racial classifications. 
   Look, if there is discrimination against minority kids, then you can count on me. I will fight alongside of my Democrat colleagues to end that discrimination. But to just say it is disproportionate without consideration to what crimes were committed, it seems to me, is not only unconstitutional, it is wrong.

   Mr. HATCH. Let me say a few words. 
   I think everybody in this body wants to do whatever they can to end discrimination wherever it is. I haven't heard one shred of information that proves there is discrimination here. When you prove that, I will be right there side by side with you. Nor have I heard much of a reason how you get around the fact that crimes are committed, and it is the type of crime and the quantities of crime and who is doing it that makes a difference in our society and why people are locked up. 
   I think you have to look at the crime. You can't just get out here and say, well, there is disproportion; therefore, there has to be something wrong. You have to show what is wrong. 
   Frankly, I do not think the other side has shown what is wrong here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Let me say this again, what are the crimes? What 
   is the extent of the crimes? How serious are they? 
   The fact that 13 percent of the offenders are African American and 67 percent of those incarcerated are--I don't see any information here saying that higher percentage was unjustifiably put in jail. These percentages don't tell us what the crimes were in the individual cases. If these individuals committed a crime, then they go to jail. Does that mean there are a lot of white people getting off? I don't see any evidence of that, either. 
   Do you have evidence that minority juveniles are more likely to be detained for the same crime as white juveniles? I don't think you do. For example, is there evidence that African Americans who are charged with possession of crack cocaine are given more severe sentences than whites for crack cocaine? Is there evidence? I don't know of any. 
   My point is, I don't think my colleagues on the other side are arguing that if people commit heinous crimes and they are convicted and sentenced to jail that they shouldn't be. Now, if there is some evidence that law enforcement is ignoring white people who commit these same heinous crimes, then I am with you. I don't know of any evidence of that. 
   Statistics are statistics are statistics, but when people go to jail, it is generally because they have committed crimes. 
   What is your solution? To let them out of jail? Crack cocaine distributors? Is your argument that white crack dealers get away with it because they are smarter or they are protected somehow or other? I don't think you are making that argument. I can't imagine you would make that argument. So I don't know why there is a higher percentage, but I do know that almost without exception--there certainly are some instances where the law is not applied justly, I am aware of that--but almost without exception, people who commit these heinous crimes go to jail for them.  
   I don't think you are arguing to let them out of jail. But then, again, how can you argue, then, that if they are committing the crimes and are going to jail, that for some reason or other there is some reason why they are going to jail where others aren't? I don't see the argument myself. Plus, you are adding racial classifications, mandated racial classifications in this amendment. To me it is not even a question of constitutionality. There is no question it is unconstitutional. 
   With that, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Let me retain it for a second and say one other thing. One would think, listening to my friend from Minnesota, that our bill does absolutely nothing to deal with this problem. You hear this very emotional set of arguments as though the Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill does absolutely nothing about these problems. S. 254, in my opinion, has a much better provision to solve these problems than the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. 
   The bill as written, as before the Senate, requires that prevention resources be directed to ``segments of the juvenile population'' who are disproportionately detained. Now, such ``segments of the population'' could include, for example, certain socioeconomic groups who are more likely to be at risk. S. 254 directs prevention resources to such groups who need those resources the most. So we try to do something about it rather than just cite statistics. 
   I don't see how you get around the fact that these people are sentenced and sent to jail because they have committed crimes. Just because there are statistics that indicate that more than a proportionate share of the general population is going to jail, I don't know how in the world you get around the fact that these crimes are being committed by individuals--individuals who just happen to be of one race or another. But we do try to address it by directing prevention resources to such groups who need those resources the most. I think that is the way to do it. 
   I will work with my friends on the other side to see that we do things that make sure those moneys work.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is not a civil rights vote. This is a vote that is an emotional vote. That is, they cannot show any reasons why people who commit heinous crimes should not go to jail. They are saying because there is a disproportionate number of African Americans--to select one group because that is the one they are talking about--going to jail for crimes they  were convicted for, that somehow there is something wrong with that. Everybody in America knows that people are sentenced to jail because they have committed crimes. I admit that occasionally there are injustices in our courts, but they are very rare. When they do occur, I will decry them as much as my friend from Minnesota. 
   This is what you call a bleeding heart amendment. They can't show the facts; they don't have any facts on their side. They are using statistics. They are ignoring the fact that people are convicted of these crimes and need to serve time for them, regardless of skin color; and they are ignoring the fact that we take care of this problem by providing a disproportionate amount of the prevention funds to help segments of the population having difficulties because of socioeconomic difficulties. That is the way to face it and solve the problem. Don't just complain about the problem. What is the solution? Is it that these people should not serve their time? Should they not be convicted when they sell drugs to our kids? Everybody knows that it happens. 
   It is nice to talk about civil rights. The fact of the matter is that nobody is more concerned about civil rights than I am. If anyone can show me where there is prejudice, if they can show me where these people are not justly convicted, that is 
   another matter. I will be right there marching with them. But they can't and they know it. 
   Mr. President, I am going to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, and then I will yield back the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HATCH. I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky for his amendment. I just want to be clear on one matter, however. It is my understanding that lands under the BLM, Park Service, and Forest Service are in no way covered or affected by the amendment because they do not consider subjective criteria when determining 
   whether to cooperate or grant permits to a film or TV production. Is that correct?

   Mr. HATCH. Let me just say a few words. 
   I must object to the amendment of the Senator from California. I appreciate the necessity of afterschool programs. I am aware that the 21st Century Learning Centers program supports several efforts in my home State of Utah. 
   The Senator's amendment, however, increases the program's authorization from $20 million annually to $600 million annually. That adds up to $3 billion over 5 years. The entire underlying bill, which we have been working on for 2 years, only authorizes a little over $1 billion in spending a year--our whole bill. 
   Again, I express my concerns with attempting to solve a problem by simply throwing more money at it. This amendment attempts to throw $3 billion at a problem our underlying bill will solve because it is effectively written and we know what to do with the money. Our underlying bill will solve many of the problems this amendment by the distinguished Senator from California addresses, without spending such an inordinate amount or settled amount on a single program. 
   Finally, the Labor Committee is undertaking reauthorization of the ESEA this year. Let that committee do its job in a thoughtful and reasonable way. That would be the place for the distinguished Senator to make her case when that comes up, both in the Labor Committee and on the floor. 
   I yield such time as he may need to the distinguished chairman of the Labor Committee.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would just like to take a moment to pay tribute to Ila Marie Goodey of Logan, Utah. I have just learned that Ila passed away on Saturday. 
   Ila was a tireless and effective advocate for individuals with disabilities and served as an early and active member of my Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy. I have always appreciated her counsel on these issues. 
   In particular, she believed in independence and self-sufficiency, and she directed as much of her energy to assisting others to reach this goal as she did to helping herself. She served as the first chairperson of the Utah Assistive Technology Program Management and Implementation Board. This consumer-responsive, interagency program has been hailed nationwide as a model for other programs of its kind. 
   I know that her friends and colleagues at Utah State University and among the disability community in my state will mourn her loss. But, I also know that they, as I do, appreciate all that she has contributed. There can be no doubt that Ila has made a real difference.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed in the failure of the Senate to invoke cloture. I believe that there exists strong bipartisan support for the bill and it is a shame that the bill may die for partisan reasons. But the Democrats held firm on cloture. Sometimes party unity is a good thing, but in this case, it is a mistake. 
   The reason why it is a mistake is that the Y2K problem hurts America. What we face is the threat that an avalanche of Y2K-related lawsuits will be simultaneously filed on or about January 3, 2000 and that this unprecedented wave of litigation will overwhelm the computer industry's ability to correct the problem. Make no mistake about it, this super-litigation threat is real, and if it substantially interferes with the computer industry's ongoing Y2K repair efforts, the consequences for America could be disastrous. 
   Today we face the more immediate problem of frivolous litigation that seeks recovery even where there is little or no actual harm done. In that regard, I am aware of at least 25 Y2K-related class actions that are currently pending in courts across the country, with the threat of hundreds more to come. 
   It is precisely these types of Y2K-related lawsuits that pose the greatest danger to industry's efforts to fix the problem. All of us are aware that the computer industry is feverishly working to correct--or remediate, in industry language--Y2K so as to minimize any disruptions that occur early next year. 
   What we also know is that every dollar that industry has to spend to defend against especially frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that will not get spent on fixing the problem and delivering solutions to technology consumers. Also, how industry spends its precious time and money between now and the end of the year--either litigating or mitigating--will largely determine how severe Y2K-related damage, disruption, and hardship will be. 
   Let me talk about the potential financial magnitude of the Y2K litigation problem. The Gartner Group estimates that worldwide remediation costs will range between $300 billion to $600 billion. Other experts contend that overall litigation costs may total $1 trillion. Even if we accept the lower amount, according to Y2K legal expert Jeff Jinnett, ``this cost would greatly exceed the combined estimated legal costs associated with Superfund environmental litigation . . . U.S. tort litigation . . . and asbestos litigation.'' Perhaps the best illustration of the sheer dimension of the litigation monster that Y2K may create is Mr. Jinnett's suggestion that a $1 trillion estimate for Y2K-related litigation costs ``would exceed even the estimated total annual direct and indirect costs of all civil litigation in the United States,'' which he says is $300 billion per year. 
   These figures should give all of us pause. At this level of cost, Y2K-related litigation may well overwhelm the capacity of the already crowded court system to deal with it. 
   Thus, it is imperative that Congress should give companies an incentive to fix Y2K problems right away, knowing that if they do not make a good-faith effort to do so, they will shortly face costly litigation. The natural economic incentive of industry is to satisfy their customers and, thus, prosper in the competitive environment of the free market. This acts as a strong motivation for industry to fix a Y2K problem before any dispute becomes a legal one. This will be true, however, only as long as businesses are given an opportunity to do so and are not forced, at the outset, to divert precious resources from the urgent tasks of the repair shop to the often unnecessary distractions of the court room. A business and legal environment which encourages problem-solving while preserving the eventual opportunity to litigate may best insure that consumers and other innocent users of Y2K defective products are protected. 
   The Y2K problem presents a special case. Because of the great dependence of our economy, indeed of our whole society, on computerization, Y2K will impact almost every American in some way. But the problem and its associated harms will occur only once, all at approximately the same time, and will affect virtually every aspect of the economy, society, and government. What we must avoid is creating a litigious environment so severe that the computer industry's remediation efforts will slacken and retreat at the very moment when users and consumers need them to advance with all deliberate speed. What we must avoid is the crippling the high tech sector of our economy. 
   As chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Alan Greenspan recently noted, the tremendous growth of our economy is in large measure a result of productivity gains resulting from the computerization of our economy. America is unquestionably the high tech leader in the world today. Our technology is a major export item. Unless the Y2K bill is passed, the American high tech information industries and computer businesses will be swamped by an avalanche of lawsuits. 
   Mr. President, why kill the goose that lays the golden egg? Let the Senate vote on the underlying bill. Let the Senate vote on Democrat and Republican amendments. But let us vote on the merits of the bill. Leave politics aside. This issue is too important to be held hostage. 
   The excuse that the minority proffered is that the Y2K should not be brought up until the Juvenile Justice bill is completed. How ironic. I have been working around the clock to work on a time agreements for amendments to the Juvenile Justice bill. The minority has been delaying the Juvenile Justice bill and uses the delay as an excuse to vote no on cloture petition on a motion to proceed to the Y2K bill. That's called chutzpa.  
   Look, a strong bipartisan substitute--a Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-Gorton-Wyden-Bennett substitute--has been crafted. This substitute is carefully drafted to assure an appropriate balance between the rights of citizens to bring suits for compensation and the need to protect the high tech community from onerous and wasteful litigation. This is a fair resolution of differences between Democrats and Republicans. I hope--for the sake of our Nation--that the minority allows us to debate this provision.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I really appreciate the majority leader and his patience and forbearance, because this bill is now in its sixth day. That is more than we give to most bills in the Senate, unless they are just hotly contested. This is one that should not be hotly contested. Everybody ought to be for this bill. 
   Mr. President, yesterday I read a quote from a recent New York Times editorial, and I would like to read it again, prior to the time for Senator HELMS. 
   This is from the New York Times editorial:  
   In the past it was not hard to be struck by the way time seemed to roll over a tragedy like a school shooting, by the disparity between the enduring grief of parents who lost children in places like Paducah and Jonesboro and the swift distraction of the rest of us. This time, perhaps, things may be different. The Littleton shootings have forced upon the nation a feeling that many parents know all too well--that of inhabiting the very culture they are trying to protect their children from........The urge to do something about youth violence is very strong.......but it will require an urge to do many things, and to do them with considerable ingenuity and dedication, before symptomatic violence of the kind that occurred in Littleton begins to seem truly improbable, not just as unlikely as the last shooting.  
   That was the New York Times, May 11, 1999. While I may not agree with the Times on everything, I doubt I could have described any better the task we have taken on. This issue is a complex problem and one which requires dedication, a spirit of cooperation, and an agreed upon set of objectives. 
   I believe that spirit of cooperation has been lacking somewhat as this is the sixth day we are on this bill and, as of this morning, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle still had over 25 amendments. Now, my friend from Vermont has indicated that he is working to try and get those cut down. I hope he is successful. I have spent several days urging Republicans not to offer their amendments--most have been agreeable--in the hopes that my colleagues on the other side would reciprocate. I spent the weekend here, and my staff was here working around the clock. We heard nothing from the other side during that time. Indeed, we were told by them that staff would not be coming in to meet with us at that time. 
   Now, perhaps they were trying to work on the Democrat amendments. Certainly, the distinguished Senator from Vermont says that is what he was doing. But frankly, we were prepared to work and cut these matters down and get this whole matter completed. 
   In fairness, we have been given some suggested changes to the underlying bill. We were given those suggestions late yesterday. I would be willing to accept a number of them if it meant we  could pass this bill by a date certain. As well, staff has been working to clear several amendments as part of a managers' package of amendments, which I hope Senator LEAHY and I can do. Still, we have been given no commitment, assurances, or even a hint that my colleagues will agree to a vote on a time or date certain. This bill is too important to be treated this way. The problem of juvenile crime and the victims of juvenile crime deserve better. 
   We should pass this bill, but there are a number on the other side who want to pull this bill down. You hear a lot of posturing about the gun lobby, which is complete nonsense. Let's just review the facts. 
   The President's gun package was framed as essentially containing the following elements: Gun show loopholes; permanent Brady; one gun a month; juvenile Brady; juvenile possession of assault weapons, increase the age to 21; child access to guns, liability; safety locks; increase penalties for guns to juveniles; firearms tracing; youth crime gun initiative; gun kingpins penalties; and a clip ban. 
   More than half of the President's so-called ``plan'' has been acted on by the Senate or is contained in a pending amendment. In other words, we have agreed to a unanimous consent agreement limiting amendments which allows for the remaining elements of the President's plan to be offered. 
   So the question is, Where is the President on this issue? Republicans want to let this plan be voted on, but his allies in the Senate do not appear eager to move forward. I hope they will. 
   I believe my colleague from Vermont when he says that, given some time and through the caucuses today, we probably can get this resolved, or at least he hopes we can. I do also. We have to get it resolved. 
   We are not trying to avoid the gun issue. I think some are concerned how this bill, with its reforms of the entertainment industry, will be received by their friends in Hollywood. That is something I think really bothers some on the other side. It bothers me, too. But we are doing some things that really are valuable, really viable, really worthwhile, and really allow for voluntary compliance and an approach that really will work in the best interests of the entertainment industry. 
   Given the seriousness of this problem, and the number of warning signs that future tragedies may be imminent--we are announcing them daily--we cannot afford to filibuster this bill through amendment. We should not play politics with this bill. Instead, we should come together and pass this bill. I am certainly hopeful that that is what we are going to get done either today or tomorrow. 
   I think the majority leader has been more than accommodating on this. He has indicated that he can only give so much time to this 
   because there are so many other pending bills. The distinguished Senator from Vermont and I both know that we have to bring up the bankruptcy bill, the Satellite Home Viewer Act, in addition to all these very important issues that involve the national defense and our people who are serving in the Balkan crisis, and, of course, the supplemental appropriations bill. We only have a limited time in which to do it. 
   So it is good that we get together today and get this matter resolved. I don't think we could have had a more cooperative majority leader, under the circumstances. We stand ready, willing, and able to work with our colleagues on the other side to try to narrow these amendments and, of course, work with them to try to get some of these problems solved that they think are so serious. 
   I might add that a number of these gun amendments were already in the bill; juvenile Brady is a prime example. We had that already in the bill. You would think, from the President's remarks, that it wasn't part of our bill. We have worked on this bill for 2 years. I want it to be bipartisan; I want our Democratic colleagues to be part of this; I want them to feel good after it is all done. We have made every effort to try to accommodate them. But to have this thing go on for another day or two is basically not right, under the circumstances. 
   So I hope we can get together, and I hope we will work together and get our staffs together, and I hope we will resolve this either today or tomorrow. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not even try to match the eloquence of my esteemed colleague from Delaware. But I would like to just say a few words about my friend, Adm. Bud Nance, and my friend, Senator HELMS, as well. I will not be long because I see other members of the Foreign Relations Committee who are here to speak. 
   I didn't have the privilege of serving on the Foreign Relations Committee at the same time with Bud Nance. But I knew him. I respected him. On a Capitol Hill that is completely covered with more youthful staffers, staffers who are very young in many ways, not quite as experienced, Bud Nance stood out as one of the most senior. He did not have to be here. He probably could have enjoyed the remaining years of his life much more by not being here. But he came to serve side by side with his friend from his youth, Senator JESSE HELMS, one of the greatest Senators who has ever sat in the Senate. 
   Admiral Nance was one of the greatest people who ever served on the Senate staff, and he did it at a time when we had a lot of conflicts and difficulties and problems in foreign relations, and he did it with intelligence, with a mastery that was important, with an ability to get along with people and to work with both minority and majority staffs. 
   This man is a true hero to me and true hero for our country, just the type of person we ought to all try to emulate, somebody who really loved his country enough to give his last for the country. I believe he loved his country so much because of his family and because of his understanding of what a great country this is and what a great constitutional form of government we have. 
   This is a man who reached the heights in the military and, in my opinion, reached the heights in the Senate as well. When he came on the staff, the staff was reported to be having difficulties, and he brought them together, coordinated them, unified them, and I think both the minority and the majority staffs have worked well ever since. It took a true leader to do that. 
   It took a true leader in Senator HELMS to pick Admiral Nance, and I know he feels highly privileged to have worked with his friend, his colleague, and somebody who advised him in the best of ways and advised all of us in the best of ways. 
   I express my sympathy to his wife and his family and tell them that they should be very proud of him, not just for the tremendous years of serving this country, as he did in the military, as a husband and as a father, but for these years on Capitol Hill. It made a difference to the country, to the world at large, and to all of us. I thank Senator HELMS for having given us the opportunity to know him better. 
   I yield the floor.

   In the past week it has been clear that some on the other side of the aisle believe that playing politics is more important than taking action. Some--but not all. So I am pleased to say that Senators KOHL, CHAFEE, and I have joined forces to produce a compromise on child safety locks that lays aside partisan rhetoric and demonstrates the positive steps that can result from putting aside such rhetoric and focusing on protecting our children. 
   Under the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee amendment, for the first time every handgun purchased from a manufacturer, importer, or licensed dealer will have to be sold with a storage or child safety lock device. 
   This amendment will not change the fundamental principle that governmental action cannot be used to micromanage specific methods of parental responsibility. We do not expect parents to let their small children drive a car or play with matches, and we do not expect them to permit their children to have unsupervised access to firearms. This amendment will provide parents with a tool to help prevent such access. 
   Last year the Senate overwhelmingly agreed to an amendment that funded gun safety education by State and local entities. It also required gun dealers to stock safety devices. These efforts encouraged people to lock up their guns and to act safely and responsibly. This amendment is another step in enhancing this successful effort. 
   I should add that no child safety lock or gun safe will ever make our society safe from gun violence if criminals who  use firearms are not aggressively prosecuted and punished. No safety device will stop a felon, but jail will. So once again I call upon the Attorney General to start prosecuting criminals who use guns. Only then will we truly be able to create a safer environment for our children. 
   This amendment gives law-abiding gun owners the peace of mind of knowing their children are protected. Further, it will give law-abiding gun owners qualified immunity from civil suit if they use the child safety device or child safety lock. 
   This amendment is a good idea for gun owners and a good idea for children. I am pleased we have bipartisan support in the Senate for this amendment. I hope it will be agreed to.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend Senator ALLARD for offering this amendment that conveys the Senate's heartfelt sympathy to the families and friends of all school shootings. 
   His amendment allows the families and friends of all victims of shootings to grieve and honor the victims at a memorial service held on school grounds. This amendment tells these families and friends that the Senate believes they have a right to congregate at a memorial service on school grounds to mourn the deaths of students and faculty. 
   Further, this amendment states that the Senate believes it is constitutional for these memorial services to include spiritual aspects, including the reading of prayers and scripture and the performance of religious music. 
   This amendment also states that the Senate believes that an appropriate and constitutional permanent memorial can be erected on school grounds, a part of which can include religious symbols, motifs, or sayings. 
   This amendment will, hopefully, ease some of the pain associated with preparing memorial services for loved ones killed in any act of school violence. I thank the Senator from Colorado for offering this amendment and commend him for it.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment which I offered with the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, is a much refined version of legislation we offered last Congress to address the serious and troubling issues of interstate and juvenile gangs. 
   I commend Senator FEINSTEIN for her hard work and dedication to this issue. 
   Our amendment includes improvements to the current Federal gangs statute, to cover conduct such as alien smuggling, money laundering, and high-value burglary, to the predicate offenses under the penalty enhancement for engaging in gang-related crimes, and enhances penalties for such crimes. 
   It criminalizes recruiting persons into a gang, with tough penalties, including a 4-year mandatory minimum if the person recruited is a minor. 
   It amends the Travel Act, of 1952 18 U.S.C., to include typical gang predicate offenses. 
   It includes the James Guelff Body Armor Act, which provides penalty enhancements for the use of body armor in the commission of a Federal crime. This provision also prohibits the purchase, possession or use of body armor by anyone convicted of a violent felony, but provides an affirmative defense for bona fide business uses. However, our amendment places no duties or restrictions on the sellers of these legitimate personal safety products. Our amendment also enhances the availability of body armor to law enforcement. It includes penalties for teaching, even over the Internet, how to make or use a bomb, with the knowledge or intent that the information will be used to commit a Federal crime. 
   Finally, our amendment enhances penalties under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (18 U.S.C. 43) to address the growing problem of attacks on businesses and research facilities, as well as establishes a clearinghouse to track such offenses. These crimes are increasingly being committed by some juvenile gangs, particularly in my State of Utah. 
   Gangs are an increasingly serious and interstate problem, affecting our crime rates and our youth. A 1997 survey of eighth graders in 11 cities found in 1997 that 9 percent were currently gang members, and that 17 percent said they had belonged to a gang at some point in their lives. These gangs and there members are responsible for as many as 68 percent of all violent crimes in some cities. 
   My home state of Utah continues to have a serious gang problem. In 1997, there were over 7,000 gang offenses reported to the police in Utah. Although we have seen some improvement from the unprecedented high levels of gang crime a couple of years ago, gang membership in the Salt Lake area has increased 209 percent since 1992. There are now about 4,500 gang members in the Salt Lake City area. 770 of these, or 17 percent, are juveniles. 
   During 1998, there were at least 99 drive by shootings in the Salt Lake City area. Also, drug offenses, liquor offenses, and sexual assaults were all up significantly over the same period in 1997. And in the first 2 months of 1999, there were 14 drive by shootings in the Salt Lake City area. 
   An emerging gang in Utah is the Straight Edge. These are juveniles who embrace a strict code of no sex, drugs, alcohol or tobacco, and usually no meat or animal products. Normally, of course, these are traits most parents would applaud. But these juveniles take these fine habits to a dangerous extreme, frequently violently attacking those who do not share their purist outlook. 
   There are 204 documented Straight Edgers in Salt Lake City, with an average age of 19 years old. Like most gangs, they adopt distinctive clothing and tattoos to identify themselves. Although not all Straight Edgers 
   engage in criminal activities, many have become very violent prone. They have engaged in coordinated attacks on college fraternities, and a murder outside the Federal Building in downtown Salt Lake City last Halloween night was Straight Edge related. This crime, in which a 15-year-old youth named Bernardo Repreza occurred during a gang-related fight against the Straight-Edgers. Three Straight Edge gang members, have been charged with the murder. 
   And these gangs are learning some of their tactics on the Internet, which is why our amendment includes a provision making illegal to teach another how to make or use an explosive device intending or knowing that the instructions will be used to commit a federal crime, has passed the Senate on at least three separate occasions. It is time for Congress to pass it and make the law. 
   Sites with detailed instructions on how to make a wide variety of destructive devices have proliferated on the Internet. As many of my colleagues know, these sites were a prominent part of the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado. 
   Let me give my colleagues an example of one of these sites. The self-styled Animal Liberation Front has been linked to numerous bombings and arson across the country, including several in my home State of Utah. Posted on their Internet site is the cyber-publication, The Final Nail #2. It is a detailed guide to terrorist activities. This chart shows just one example of the instructions to be found here--in this case, instructions to build an electronically timed incendiary igniter--the timer for a time bomb. 
   And how do the publishers intend that this information will be used? The suggestion is clear from threats and warnings in the guide. One page in the site shows a picture of an industry spokeswoman, warning her to ``take our advice while you still have some time: quit your job and cash in your frequent flier points for a permanent vacation.'' Now, on this chart, which comes from The Final Nail #2, we have redacted the spokeswoman's address and phone number to protect her privacy. The publishers weren't so considerate. And this is just the beginning. This same document has a 59 page list of targets, complete with names and addresses from nearly every U.S. State and Canadian province. 
   Let there be no mistake--the publishers know what they're doing. For instance, the instructions on how to make milk jug fire bombs come with this caution: ``Arson is a big time felony so wear gloves and old clothes you can throw away throughout the entire process and be very careful not to leave a single shred of evidence.'' 
   It is unfortunate that people feel the need to disseminate information and instructions on bombmaking and explosives. Now perhaps we can't stop people from putting out that information. But if they are doing so with the intent that the information be used to commit a violent federal crime--or if they know that the information will be used for that purpose, then this amendment will serve to hold such persons accountable. 
   Unfortunately, kids today have unfettered access to a universe of harmful material. By merely clicking a mouse, kids can access pornography, violent video games, and even instructions for making bombs with ingredients that can be found in any household. Why someone feels the need to put such harmful material on the Internet is beyond me--there certainly is no legitimate need for our kids to know how to make a bomb. But if that person crosses the line to advocate the use of that knowledge for violent criminal purposes, or gives it out knowing it will be used for such purposes, then the law needs to cover that conduct. 
   Mr. President, the Hatch-Feinstein Federal Gang Violence Act incorporated in this amendment is a modest but important in stemming the spread of gangs and violence across the country and among our juveniles. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from California.

   Mr. HATCH. And then protect the right of the Senator from California to speak in opposition. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment, which is nearly identical to a bill I introduced earlier this year, S. 577, The Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act. If nothing else can be said about this issue--it is absolutely imperative that states have the means to prevent unlawful access to alcohol by our children. 
   If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it delivered by merely ``borrowing'' a credit card and making a few clicks with her mouse, there is something wrong with the level of control that is being exercised over these sales and something must be done to address the problem. 
   I am a strong supporter of e-commerce. But the sale of alcohol cannot be equated with the sale of a sweater or shirt. We need to foster growth in electronic commerce, but we also need to make sure that alcohol control laws are respected. 
   The growth of many of our nation's wineries is tied to their ability to achieve name recognition and generate sales nationwide--tasks the Internet is uniquely suited to accomplish. I do not want to preclude them from using the Internet; I want to ensure that they use it responsibly and in accordance with state laws. 
   If there is a problem with the system, we need to fix the system, not break the laws. 
   The 21st amendment gives states the right to regulate the importation of alcohol into their states. However, efforts to enforce laws relating to the importation of alcohol have run into significant legal hurdles in both state and Federal courts. 
   The scope of the 21st amendment is essentially a federal question that must be decided by the federal courts--and ultimately the Supreme Court. For that reason, among others, I believe a federal court forum is appropriate for state enforcement efforts. 
   Most states do not permit direct shipping of alcohol to consumers. Therefore most Internet sales of alcohol are currently prohibited. If a state wants to set up a system to allow for the direct shipment of alcohol to consumers, such as New Hampshire and Louisiana have already done, then that is their right under the 21st amendment. But the decision to permit direct shipping, and under what conditions, is up to the states, not the purveyors of alcohol. 
   The bill is supported by a host of interests including, inter alia, Utah interests (Governor Leavitt, Attorney General Graham, Utah's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the Utah Hospitality Association, numerous Utah Congressional Representatives and Senator Bennett), SADD, the National Licensed Beverage Association, the National Beer Wholesalers Association, the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers, Geerlings and Wade (leading direct marketer of fine wines to 27 states and more than 81 percent of the wine consuming public), Americans for Responsible Alcohol Access, the National Association of Beverage Retailers, the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, and the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators. 
   Having said that, I will yield back the remainder of any time the proponents have.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before I relinquish the floor to Senator FEINSTEIN, let me say that I think States need the ability to take action on their own to enforce their State liquor laws. Senator BYRD's amendment provides States with a Federal court forum to enjoin violations of their alcohol laws, denying violators the ability to hide behind a jurisdictional curtain. 
   Mr. President, this is a summary of the Byrd amendment: 
   First, it permits the chief law enforcement officer of a state to seek an  injunction in federal court to prevent the violation of any of its laws regulating the importation or transportation of alcohol; 
   Second, allows for venue for the suit where the defendant resides and were the violations occur; 
   Third, no injunctions issued without prior notice to the opposing party; 
   Fourth, requires that injunctions be specific as to the parties, the conduct and the rationale underlying the issuance of the injunction; 
   Fifth, allows for quick consideration of the application for an injunction; conserves court resources by avoiding redundant proceedings; and 
   Sixth, mandates a bench trial. 
   Having said that, I probably will support both the Byrd amendment and the next amendment by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on this amendment, except let me just say this: I very much appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Minnesota. As I read it, it provides for six new grant programs totaling $170 million. 
   Mr. President, as you know, the issue of domestic violence, including its impact on children, is one that has been of paramount concern to me over the past 10 years. Working with Senator BIDEN, and the Senate, the Senate acted decisively in 1994 by passing the Violence Against Women Act. Moreover, in the years following passage of this landmark legislation, this Senate has consistently funded programs authorized by that legislation. 
   I do agree with my colleague; we probably could do more. We certainly can do better. For that reason, Senator BIDEN and I have begun working on a significant and thorough review of the act. 
   In 1994, we created many new programs, and we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fund them. I think it is time to examine what works and what doesn't as we look to reauthorizing this Act. Further, I think we need to examine carefully whether and what kind of additional programs are necessary and appropriate. 
   The Senator's amendment raises an important issue--the impact of domestic violence on children and what can be done to alleviate this problem. I am not prepared, however, at this time, to endorse his solutions. 
   I understand why the Senator would try to use this bill as a vehicle for his amendment, but I disagree. Rather, these suggestions, along with others, ought to be considered in the context of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. For example, several of the NEW grant programs proposed sound to me as if they ought to be considered as a discretionary use of funds in existing VAWA programs. Further, whereas we have a major Act on the books that deals with domestic violence, the new Wellston grant programs contain a new and different definition of domestic violence. Mr. President, these are not the kind of changes we should be making in the context of a juvenile crime bill. 
   Let me close by commending the Senator from Minnesota. But for the reasons stated, I will at the appropriate time move to table his amendment because I think we are going to work this out in the future. And let's work it out in the appropriate bill. 
   I yield back any further time we have.

However, votes will occur on previously offered amendments, beginning at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, so I urge my colleagues to offer their amendments in the morning for swift passage of the juvenile justice bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate today resumes consideration of the youth violence bill. As we resume debate on this measure let me quote from a recent New York Times editorial:  
   In the past it was not hard to be struck by the way time seemed to roll over a tragedy like a school shooting, by the disparity between the enduring grief of parents who lost children in places like Paducah and Jonesboro and the swift distraction of the rest of us. This time, perhaps, things may be different. The Littleton shootings have forced upon the nation a feeling that many parents know all too well--that of inhabiting the very culture they are trying to protect their children from. *.*.* The urge to do something about youth violence is very strong *.*.* but it will require an urge to do many things, and to do them with considerable ingenuity and dedication, before symptomatic violence of the kind that occurred at Littleton begins to seem truly improbable, not just as unlikely as the last shooting.  
   While I may not agree with the New York Times on everything, I doubt that I could have described our task any better. I commend them for this editorial. This issue is a complex problem which requires dedication, a spirit of cooperation, and an agreed-upon set of objectives. 
   When I assumed chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of my first actions was the creation of the Youth Violence Subcommittee. The subcommittee made dealing with the problem of youth violence a priority, and our efforts on this front were paid greater attention in the wake of juvenile crime tragedies. Yet, as the editorial in the New York Times notes, the Nation's attention always seemed to be swiftly distracted. Still, we pushed forward with our legislative efforts. 
   Senator SESSIONS held hearings in nearly empty hearing rooms. We spent more than 6 weeks in committee marking up the predecessor to the bill we have before us today. Some questioned our political equilibrium. After all, juvenile justice is fundamentally a State matter, and our economy is robust. Why bother? That is what some felt. Well, we have worked on this bill and pushed for this bill because we think it is the right thing to do and because it will improve juvenile justice and deter youth violence. 
   Some of us have invested substantial time, effort and political capital in this bill. I have invested even more in this bill in these last few days by supporting measures which, at an earlier time, I may not have supported. I have put the goal of changing our culture of violence and helping our young people first. The question for us now, however, is: Do we have the political strength as an institution to come together and pass this bill promptly? 
   I firmly believe the work we have undertaken these last several days demonstrates that we, on this side of the aisle, are dedicated to addressing the problems of youth violence and that we are willing to put our children first. We have made significant progress on this bill to date. We have voted on 14 amendments and I plan to accept even more in the managers' amendment. We have spent 4 legislative days on this measure. As a result, this is a better, more comprehensive bill than when we began the debate. If we focus our effort on where we can agree, as opposed to where we may differ, I believe we can pass this bill expeditiously. 
   Mr. President, the problem of school violence and juvenile crime is not going to go away because we have debated the issue and voted on some divisive amendments. In fact, the problem continued this weekend in Michigan where four juveniles, ages 12 through 14, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder for plotting a school shooting similar to the massacre at Columbine High School. These four juveniles allegedly planned to kill their classmates by opening fire in the middle school assembly and then detonating a bomb on school grounds. Michigan prosecutors reported that the juveniles planned to kill more students than were killed at Columbine High School. A bomb that was discovered near the middle school campus on Thursday led school officials to conduct school-by-school inspections and cancel school activities. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN and I have filed our antibomb amendment. It is astounding to me--the hundreds of articles on the Internet that teach kids how to do violence and make bombs. 
   In addition, a 13-year-old boy was arrested in Indiana this weekend for planting seven pipe bombs in a car owned by one of 
   his classmate's parents. One of the bombs exploded while the car was being driven. Reportedly, the juvenile stalked the family after their daughter told authorities that the boy had brought a gun to school. 
   Moreover, just days after the tragedy in Littleton, four junior high students in Wimberley, TX, were charged with plotting to kill students and teachers in a planned attack eerily similar to the one committed at Columbine High School. Gun powder, explosive devices, and bomb-making instructions downloaded from the Internet were found at the juveniles' homes. Incredibly, this was not a copycat plan. Rather, these 14-year-old boys had been planning the attack since the beginning of the year. 
   Mr. President, today, we believe and pray that the Columbine High School rampage will never be forgotten. Let's make sure that is the case. Let's pass this bill. Remember, we said the same about similar shootings in recent years in schools in Pearl, MS, which left two dead; West Paducah, KY, which left three dead; Jonesboro, AK, which left five dead; Edinboro, PA, which left one dead; and Springfield, OR, which left two dead.  
   These disturbing trends, which have occurred in every region of the country, provide further evidence that we should pass this legislation. No longer can we reasonably say that youth violence is a random or inconsequential problem. In reality, this legislation is needed now more than ever because juvenile crime and youth violence is unacceptably high by historical standards. 
   Given the magnitude of this problem--and the number of warning signs that future tragedies may be imminent--we cannot afford to delay passage of this bill through amendment. Instead, we should come together and reach unanimous consent to pass this bill tomorrow. For the sake of our children, let's wrap this bill up. This is a bipartisan bill. We have been open for suggestions from the administration and from the Justice Department. We haven't had any until this last week. 
   But most of those suggestions we have embodied in the bill or will embody in the bill. 
   So let's pass this bill tomorrow. Let's get this bill enacted into law. Let's get the President to sign it, and let's do everything we can to prevent future tragedies like the one at Columbine High. 
   Elaine and I just had our 18th grandchild born a few days ago--a little girl named Madison Alysa. We are very concerned. We have 6 children and 18 grandchildren now. The 19th is on its way, and will be here sometime in August. I have to say that I want to leave this world a better place for them than it currently is. This bill is one magnificent attempt to get us there. Nothing we do is going to absolutely guarantee no future problems. But this bill will absolutely guarantee that there will be less of those future problems than we have today, and it may even, in the end, help us to guarantee that there are none of these types of problems again, although I fully confess that I am probably wishing for too much under today's circumstances, with the influences that are besetting our kids throughout our society today. 
   Our problems are primarily cultural today. They are cultural. There is no question that we need to have accountability where kids learn to be responsible for their actions, and learn that there is a price to be paid for actions that are denigrating to society. But we also need the prevention moneys in this bill that basically will help kids to realize that if they have made a mistake, we are going to help them to get back, we are going to help them to be able to resolve their problems in life. 
   We need the safe schools section of this bill. We need the section that will help to change our culture by giving the entertainment industry the tools by which they can voluntarily require compliance with their retailers and their wholesalers so these adult and mature materials are not sold and disseminated to children. 
   We have a study in this bill by the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, to study just whether or not some of these industries are actually targeting kids. Of course, we have other provisions as well. We have the antitrust exemption, which would allow the companies to get together to voluntarily stop some of the things that are going on. 
   Last, but not least--I can talk about this all day--we need to get tough on violent juveniles. Some of these kids are every bit as bad as the Mafia. They kill at the drop of a hat. They don't have any conscience. They laugh at those who are righteous and decent and morally upright. And, frankly, we have to make sure that when they commit these heinous crimes, that they pay a price for it. Hopefully, we can rehabilitate them with the prevention moneys. But if we can't, they ought to be removed from society so they can't kill other people or maim other people or cause the problems that they are currently causing. 
   All of these things we can do with this bill. This is a bipartisan bill. We have good people on both sides of the aisle supporting it. I believe we need to get it done. 
   I appreciate the efforts of those who are here today willing to present their amendments so we can get this matter finished, and so we know, hopefully by the end of this day, just how many amendments we have and what we need to do. 
   I yield the floor.

I understand the distinguished Senator has three amendments. We will be glad to come back to the distinguished Senator for his second one, and then we will go back over here again, and then come back again. 
   But I would like to be able to have some ability to know when I should  have people here so we do not waste floor time, because we are pressured. We have worked all weekend to get our amendments down from the thirties to seven. The Democrat amendments are in the forties. I would like you to do the same, to work them down to seven. But it does mean some cooperation on both sides. I do not want people over here going on with any length either. And I will try to make sure they cooperate with reasonable time constraints.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Minnesota has a commitment to ensuring that individuals who suffer from mental illness have the resources and support they need to combat this painful condition. 
   I have heard from groups who assert that the amendment would help improve school safety. 
   The sad truth is there is no evidence whatsoever to support the assertion that the recent tragedies in Littleton, CO, and in Oregon, would have been prevented by having more school counselors. 
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, according to reports, had both gotten individual counseling had undergone anger-management training and had gotten affirmative evaluations from counselors. 
   It has been reported that the 15-year-old Oregon shooter, Kip Kinkle was in counseling, along with his parents, when he killed them and went on to kill two classmates. 
   It has also been reported that an English teacher of one of the Columbine killers had expressed concern about Dylan Klebold's writing to his parents and a counselor. 
   I mention this not in an attempt to disparage the fine work done by our Nation's counselors, but to make the point that effective policies to identify and prevent acts of violence must be school and community wide in nature. 
   I read with interest a recent article in the Washington Post on April 25, written by a Virginia teacher, Mr. Patrick Welsh, which described the program already in place at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA. President Clinton recently visited this school. 
   I would like to read to you from Mr. Welsh's article, which describes the efforts made by teachers and administrators and law enforcement personnel at this school.  
   We make no pretense: The possibility of violence is a fact of life here. There is usually a police car--and sometimes two or three--in front of the building. A decade ago, that would have worried parents. Now they appreciate it. The police almost seem like part of the school staff. All of us--administrators, faculty, students and police--are encouraged to see maintaining security as our joint responsibility. ..... 
   If at night there is a brawl in the community that might spill over into school the next day, the police inform administrators and often show up at school early in the morning. Conversely, administrators let police know about trouble at school that could spill over into the community. But it's not just liaison with the police that administrators value; it's liaison with the kids. Our principal, John Porter, and one of his assistants are out in front of the school nearly every morning greeting students and looking for signs for trouble.  
   Mr. President, T.C. Williams should be commended for its initiative. This school, and others around the country, has developed a program that works for them. 
   I suggest to my colleagues that it is this type of individual school by school approach that my legislation and the Republican package of education amendments attempts to support. 
   Violence prevention starts with trust. It's the availability of faculty. It's principals walking around the school. It's kids who trust the administration to respect their confidentiality. It's kids who feel a part of their community and will work to keep it safe. 
   Mr. President, I believe we can support our teachers, counselors, and administrators best by providing them with the resources needed to adequately fund current education programs and the flexibility to implement an appropriate school violence prevention program that works. 
   I do not believe this would be the result of the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. Therefore, I must oppose the Wellston amendment.

   We can make a difference in this country right now or we can keep fooling around and not get anything done. I can't blame the distinguished Senator for representing his side and protecting the minority leader, except I can't imagine the minority leader not wanting to finish this by 6 o'clock tomorrow. 
   As far as I am concerned, we should finish it 2 minutes from now, get this bill on the record, get the House to pass it, the President to sign it, and hopefully get a set of mechanisms the bill will provide into operation so we can help our families and our children throughout this society to be protected from these violent juveniles.

   Mr. HATCH. I have been here all weekend hoping we can find some help on the other side to resolve this matter. Now, there may be valid reasons why people on the other side did not meet with us, but we have been open to meeting and resolving this. I think I have exhibited a desire to resolve this bill time after time after time. We have tried, in an evolutionary sort of way, to resolve some of the gun problems. We know that is the way it is going to have to go. We are trying to do it. But we have not been able to get any cooperation. 
   Now that we are here on Monday, it seems to me we ought to start cooperating and helping our majority leader get this done.

   Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware this bill will help with some of the things about which he is concerned? In fact, all of them. 
   With the Senator's indulgence, this is the fifth day we have been on a bill that should have been passed on the third day or second day. There is not a thing in this bill, to my knowledge, that most people on this floor would not want to protect our children and our society and our families. 
   We have all kinds of past illustrations where monumental bills have been done in fewer than 5 days. Tomorrow will be the sixth day we have been on this bill. This is not that controversial a bill. There are some controversial parts to it, and we have been working in an evolutionary way to deal with those. I think the distinguished Senator knows I have worked hard to accommodate my colleagues on the other side as well as my colleagues on this side, and there are wide disparities with regard to the gun problem. 
   I do not blame the majority leader. He has a job to do. We have the Y2K  bill that is critical for the software industry in this country. It is critical to the court system of this country. It is critical to civil justice in this country. It is critical to our dominance in intellectual property. And I can go on and on. 
   We have the bankruptcy bill that probably is not going to come up now because we do not have time to bring it up, and that is absolutely critical to this country. 
   We have the supplemental appropriations bill. The majority leader is right, it is not an itty-bitty, normal supplemental appropriations bill with which everybody is happy. It is one that has a lot of components to it. 
   We have the Department of Defense authorization. We have our young men and women waiting for us to back them up. I think the majority of people here want to do that. 
   I find no fault with the distinguished Senator anguishing over things that he believes are very important. I do, too. But this bill will move toward solving those problems as well. They may not be solved in exactly the identical way the distinguished Senator from Minnesota wants them solved, but this bill makes a lot of inroads in helping in these areas about which he is concerned. 
   For the first time, in my recollection, we have both sides together at least giving more money for prevention purposes, for which the distinguished Senator from Minnesota fights so hard, than we do on the accountability or law enforcement side. I have worked hard to get that done because I believe in both sides. 
   The distinguished Senator has indulged me to make these comments. 
   I do not blame the majority leader, and I know a lot of very important bills passed in 2 days, let alone 5 or 6. Frankly, this is not one that should be delayed even 1 minute longer. There are sincere amendments. That is why we are here. 
   I appreciate the willingness of my friend from Minnesota to present at least three of those amendments today. I do not think there is any desire for this side to take unfair advantage. There 
   is a desire to move forward the work of the Senate, and there is a point beyond which the majority leader cannot go. We absolutely know there are some people in the Senate who really do not want this bill, who really want political advantage more than they want a bill. 
   Frankly, I am not one of them. I am one who wants this bill. I think it is time to get it; that is why we are here. I appreciate my colleague extending me this courtesy to make these comments. It is important to move ahead. It is important we get this done by tomorrow night, and I hope we can. 
   There will come a time when this bill manager is going to become exasperated enough that I will move to table every amendment that comes up, and I hope my colleagues will support me in that. There comes a time when deleteriousness and slowing down and repeating what we are trying to do in this bill--only getting our particular views other than what the bill says when it already does those things, we will have had enough of that. I warn everybody that I am reaching that point. I am not there yet, but I am going to get there. 
   If we cannot get this done by tomorrow night and we take the chance of losing this bill because of 40 amendments when we have done everything in our power to whittle ours down by the end of this day--we will have 3 or 4 amendments left, maybe fewer than that--then I think this sends a message.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have listened to the Senator on his last amendment. Our bill does exactly what the Senator from Minnesota suggests in his amendment. This bill already does that. A core purpose of the accountability block grant is, from page 225 of the bill: ``The coordinated delivery of support services for juveniles who are at-risk for contact with the juvenile criminal system.'' 
   That is exactly what the Senator from Minnesota is suggesting with this amendment. That is a point that I am making. We are repeating things that we have already long thought out for more than 2 years while we formulated this bill. And so I think it is very important that we realize we can beat these things to death when we already have considered what he wants. 
   We may not have considered it exactly the way he wants it, but it is certainly part of this bill. I commend him for having the feelings that he does and for being sincere about those feelings. But we are, too. We have worked on this bill, and we think we have covered most of the components of the amendment of the distinguished Senator. On the other hand, where they are too expensive or don't work, we have considered them, but the bill has a better approach. Be that as it may, I admire the Senator for his sincerity. We will have to vote on the amendment and see what happens.

   Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased to support the amendment I am offering on behalf of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM. This amendment adds new incentives for States to ensure that violent offenders are incarcerated for the public's protection, by transferring Federal crime fighting resources from States that fail to incarcerate their criminals to States where the criminals commit subsequent crimes. 
   Congressionally funded truth-in-sentencing grants, which provide funds to States to build prisons, have been instrumental in lowering crime by encouraging States to incarcerate violent and repeat offenders for at least 85 percent of their sentence. In January, the Justice Department reported that 70 percent of prison admissions in 1997 were in States requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. More significantly, the average time served by violent criminals nationally has increased 12.2 percent since 1993. Perhaps the biggest reason for recent declines in violent crime is due to these truth-in-sentencing prison grants. Simply put, violent criminals cannot commit crimes against innocent victims while in prison. 
   But as important as these grants have been, we can do more. While crime is a local issue, its effects are interstate. In our highly mobile society, the criminals let out of prison in one State too frequently end up committing crimes in a neighboring State, or even in a State across the country. In my view, States owe a duty not only to their own citizens, but to the citizens of other States as well, to keep their worst offenders locked up. Senator SANTORUM's amendment provides a modest incentive to States in this regard, by putting them on notice that if one of their murderers, rapists, or other sex offenders commits a similar offense in another State after being released, the second State may be reimbursed out of Federal criminal justice assistance funds allocated to the first State for the costs of incarcerating the criminal in the second State. 
   These transfers would apply if the first State is not a truth-in-sentencing State, does not have penalties at least 10 percent above the national average for murder, rape, or other sexual offenses, or in the individual case of triggering the transfer, the inmate did not serve at least 85 percent of his or her sentence. 
   Madam President, no State should allow crime to be a major export. This amendment is a modest proposal to ensure that all our States absorb at least part of the costs of their trans-border crime. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the juvenile justice legislation. There will be two back-to-back votes at approximately 9:40 a.m. The first will be on or in relation to the Hatch-Craig amendment, with a second vote on or in relation to the Schumer Internet firearms amendment immediately following. Additional amendments are anticipated, and therefore further votes are expected throughout today's session of the Senate. The cooperation of Senators is appreciated as the bill's managers work to finish this important legislation. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hatch-Craig amendment is an amendment that corrects a number of problems in this particular bill that people have complained about that we believe need to be corrected, but we also do a number of other things as well. We have more aggressive prosecution of violent minors who are going to continue to do violence unless we pass the accountability and the 
   prevention efforts in this bill. It has enhanced penalties for the use of firearms, something that we need. It is probably the only thing that is going to make a real difference with regard to firearms. That is important. The amendment has increased maximum penalties for the use of firearms, and that is important as well. It has expanded protection for children. 
   For instance, we have the juvenile Brady bill within the underlying bill, but we are passing it again so everybody will know that all of this complaining by those who have tried to defeat this bill is just political posturing. The fact is we are going to prevent any juvenile who has used a gun in the commission of a crime from ever having a gun henceforth. That is the juvenile Brady bill. 
   Last, but not least, we are expanding the background checks. A couple of days ago Senator CRAIG tried to do a voluntary background check with incentives, which was a step forward in resolving this issue. However, the Democrats wanted a very bureaucratic, very Government-oriented bill to do these background checks. The Hatch-Craig amendment provides for mandatory background checks and provides for more background checks than the Democratic alternative. We have a more stringent amendment than what the Democrats came up with, and we have offered this amendment in order to try to resolve the animosities and the problems that have existed on this gun show issue. 
   Last, but not least, I may get a little uptight with people who try to make the whole juvenile justice issue an issue about guns. Guns may be a part of it, and there is no question they are, and we are doing the things that are right with regard to guns. However,  anyone who tries to reduce all of these juvenile justice problems in our society to guns is not only exaggerating but they are misreading the American people. The people realize that juvenile justice encompasses a lot more than just gun issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Let me tell you, I am so tired of this unnecessary argument. I want a juvenile justice bill. I have insisted on making these changes so we can get rid of these political arguments made on the other side, and I am tired of it. 
   What we are trying to do this morning is make it absolutely clear--even though we think it is clear in the bill as it is--with this modification. I hate to say this, but I really believe there is an effort by some in this body to never have a juvenile justice bill. I am going to do everything in my power to get it. 
   Under current law, anyone who engages in the business of selling firearms at a gun show must have a license. The loophole of current law lets gunsmiths and other individuals go to gun shows as nonlicensed individuals to sell guns with no instant check. That is current law. We are trying to solve that. Others are trying to exploit this issue, and I think very unfairly so. 
   As long as the gunsmiths do not sell so many firearms as to be engaged in the business of firearms dealing, they are not classified as firearms dealers. Thus, they can sell a limited 
   number of firearms at a gun show without a license. This is also a loophole in existing law. 
   The Craig amendment which the Senate adopted on Wednesday provided that the gunsmiths who wanted to engage in the business of selling firearms, but just at gun shows, could do so, but have to be licensed to do so--a step in the right direction. It was not enough, apparently, and so we have been willing to change that. 
   The Craig amendment provided for a special license that would last for only 3 days. By becoming, in effect, a temporary dealer, the gunsmith was subject to all the provisions of the Gun Control Act to which dealers are subject, including the recordkeeping requirements, the requirement to be subject to inspection by Federal officials, and the requirement to perform background checks--a step in the right direction. 
   While the Craig amendment exempted special registrants who only conducted background checks and did not engage in the business of selling firearms from the dealer recordkeeping requirements, it expressly provided that the special licensee would be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of the Gun Control Act. 
   The Hatch-Craig amendment, which we are going to vote on in a few minutes, which we offered yesterday, simply changed the voluntary background check for individual sellers at gun shows to a mandatory background check. It did not affect the special licensing requirements. Thus, after the Hatch-Craig amendment, an individual who desires to obtain a firearm at a gun show must submit to a background check whether he purchases the firearm from a regular dealer, a special licensee, or another individual. 
   It is my desire to ensure that any gun sale that takes place at any gun show has a background check. That is what we are doing here, and we are doing it because of the complaining on both sides of the aisle, and I have insisted on it. 
   My colleague, Senator CRAIG, and I now agree on this. I believe the current language clearly, clearly accomplishes  this, without this modification I have sent to the desk. However, if my colleagues want to make the language to the special licensee even more express, that is why I expressed a desire to work with them. I am glad to work with them. I sent a modification to the desk to make it absolutely superabundantly clear. Since we have the same goals here, there is no reason to play politics on this issue. Let's get the job done. 
   Last but not least, we have asked the Justice Department and others to cooperate with us and help to know what they want here. Not one word in 2 years, other than political crticism. The President bad-mouthed this all day yesterday for political purposes, and I am tired of that because I am one of those who is insisting on making these changes. I am one of those who wants to accommodate my colleagues on the other side. If they have any substantive problems, bring them to us, but their amendment certainly does not do as much as ours does. I cannot solve every problem here, but this I think we can solve. 
   The modification basically says:  
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, section 923 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by this Act, shall be applied by amending in subsection (m) the following: In subsection (m), amend paragraph 1 by adding the new subparagraph as follows: Subparagraph (f), except as provided in subparagraph (d) a special licensee shall--  
   Not may, shall--  
   be subject to all the provisions of this chapter applicable to dealers, including, but not limited to, the performance of an instant background check.  
   I do not think that is necessary, but my colleagues do, and I want to accommodate my colleagues on the other side. I cannot accommodate----

   Mr. HATCH. Right. Our colleagues have been complaining here for 2 days. We are doing what I think they and others on our side would like to have done. And the National Rifle Association has not had a thing to do with it. I don't care whether they accept it or don't accept it. These things are done by us. Frankly, to try to make them the terrible organization that some on the other side try to do bothers me. They represent millions of decent, law-abiding, honest sports people. 
   I think it is time to start talking about these things in earnest with clarity and with decency. I think, more important, this is not all about guns. Guns are a part of the juvenile justice bill, but it is not all about guns. There are so many other things this bill does that will help us in this society to resolve the problems of violent juveniles that it is a crying shame we have had to play around with this bill over the last number of days like we have. I have tried to move these amendments forward and will continue to do so, but there is only so much time this bill can be given.

   Mr. HATCH. Let me just end with this. I believe my colleagues are sincere on the other side. I know the distinguished ranking member on the Judiciary Committee has been working diligently with me to get this bill passed. I compliment him and I honor him for that. 
   I believe the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is doing his best to try to make sure that loopholes are closed. I appreciate that. I have tried to accommodate him. I did not like his amendment because I thought it was too bureaucratic and too heavyhanded. On the other hand, he was sincere in presenting it. If he had not presented it, we probably would not be here today trying to accommodate him. 
   With regard to my friend from New York, there are very few people in this body who understand this issue any better than he does. And I respect him. 
   But I am serving notice, I am getting tired of the spurious arguments that have been made by some against what we are trying to do. And I am a little impatient because I think they are trying to artificially paint this gun show amendment like a National Rifle Association amendment. I can tell you right now, I did not talk to the National Rifle Association about this amendment; and I had a lot to do with changing the previous voluntary background check to a mandatory background check for sales at gun shows. And to his credit, Senator CRAIG has cooperated every step of the way. 
   Now, this mandatory gun show check is to accommodate our colleagues. This is to solve this gun show problem. We cannot solve every problem in this bill, but we are certainly trying to solve as many as we can. And this is a very small part of this total juvenile justice bill that we need to pass. We will never get it passed unless we get some cooperation from both sides of the aisle. I am asking for that. 
   We have been debating this juvenile justice bill for 3 days. This is a bill that should have been passed in 1 day. Every one of us should have been very, very happy to get this bill passed. Most everybody on this floor knows that this bill is a very, very well-thought-out bill. It is bipartisan, and it is time for us to get it passed. But we have to quit playing political games around here. Let's start worrying about the young people in this society, the families and our society as a whole. 
   That is all I need to say about it. I apologize if I have offended any of my colleagues on the other side, but I am tired of having arguments made that are not constructive when I am trying to meet the needs of the very people who have made these arguments.

I hope they will grant unanimous consent to do that. If they do not grant unanimous consent, then I will try to do that by amendment later, which we will have to vote on, I suppose. 
   But all I am trying to do is to accommodate them. I sometimes wonder if unfair political advantage isn't what is being sought here, instead of a bill. Everybody ought to be happy to have this additional language. The Hatch-Craig amendment closes the gun show background check loophole. This additional language makes it even more express than the bill makes it express at this time. 
   I hope my colleagues will permit the unanimous consent request to modify the amendment. To the degree we can work on other problems that they are concerned about, we will be happy to try to do that during the course of the debate on this bill.

   I hesitate to say this, but the distinguished Senator from New York had the language before I did. It was only a matter of minutes, but he did. It is only a one-paragraph thing. But rather than continue the heated debate, I will ask my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, if he will work with me. Let us see if we can work out this language so that we can solve this, so that your side is happy with it. I am personally happy with the Hatch-Craig amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the minority leader, and I appreciate his usual courtesy. But just stop and think about this. There has been all this time on this bill. If we were to vote on it today, it would pass overwhelmingly. It would make a tremendous amount of difference to this country at a time when that tremendous amount of difference needs to be made. 
   We all know how this game works around here. If we don't put a finality to it--and our leader has tried to do that--in this very tight time-constrained situation, with Y2K and all the other bills that have to come up, defense bills, the supplemental appropriations bills, and other types of appropriations bills, we will wind up spending another 4 or 5 days, or maybe even 2 weeks, on this bill. I know the majority leader does not have that much time and neither do we on this side. 
   If we wind up without a juvenile justice bill this year after we have come this far, I think it would be catastrophic for this Nation. The next time we have another situation like the Columbine massacre, I wonder what kind of excuse we are going to use at that time if we didn't do the very best we could. 
   I hope my colleagues on the other side will think this through. We are seeing a situation that could bring this bill down because we don't have the time to play politics with it. To have everybody bring up their amendments--we could go on for years with amendments on juvenile justice. We have done that for 2 years now. I know the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has worked closely with me to get this to a conclusion. 
   I think this is a pretty fair offer. I understand the minority leader may not be able to get his people together on this at this particular time. But let me tell you, I can't blame our majority leader if he has to pull this down and get the other bills done under these circumstances. I am very concerned.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand we will have time to debate this more at a future time. 
   This amendment, which I am pleased to offer with the Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, is a much refined version of legislation we offered last Congress to address the serious and troubling issue of interstate and juvenile gangs. I want to commend Senator FEINSTEIN for her hard work and dedication on this issue. 
   Our amendment includes improvement to the current federal gangs statute, to cover conduct such as alien smuggling, money laundering, and high-value burglary, to the predicate offenses under the penalty enhancement for engaging in gang-related crimes, and enhances penalties for such crimes.  
   It criminalizes recruiting persons into a gang, with tough penalties, including a four year mandatory minimum if the person recruited is a minor. 
   It amends the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. 1952, to include typical gang offenses in its predicate acts. 
   It includes the James Guelff Body Armor Act, which provides penalty enhancements for the use of body armor in the commission of a federal crime. This provision also prohibits the purchase, possession or use of body armor by anyone convicted of a violent felony, but provides an affirmative defense for bona fide business uses, and enhances the availability of body armor and other bullet-proof technology to law enforcement. 
   It includes penalties for teaching, even over the Internet, how to make or use a bomb, with the knowledge or intent that the information will be used to commit a federal crime. 
   Finally, our amendment enhances penalties under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. 43, to address the growing problem of attacks on businesses and research facilities, as well as establishes a clearinghouse to track such offenses. These crimes are increasingly being committed by some juvenile gangs, particularly in my state of Utah. 
   Gangs are an increasingly serious and interstate problem, affecting our crime rates and our youth. A 1997 survey of eighth graders in 11 cities found in 1997 that 9 percent were currently gang members, and that 17 percent said they had belonged to a gang at some point in their lives. These gangs and their 
   members are responsible for as many as 68 percent of all violent crimes in some cities. 
   My home state of Utah continues to have a serious gang problem. In 1997, there were over 7,000 gang offenses reported to the police in Utah. Although we have seen some improvement from the unprecedented high levels of gang crime a couple of years ago, gang membership in the Salt Lake area has increased 209 percent since 1992. There are now about 4,500 gang members in the Salt Lake City area. Seven hundred and seventy of these, or 17 percent, are juveniles. 
   During 1998, there were at least 99 drive-by shootings in the Salt Lake City area. Also, drug offenses, liquor offenses, and sexual assaults were all up significantly over the same period in 1997. And in the first 2 months of 1999, there were 14 drive-by shootings in the Salt Lake City area. 
   An emerging gang in Utah is the Straight Edge. These are juveniles who embrace a strict code of no sex, drugs, alcohol, or tobacco, and usually no meat or animal products. Normally, of course, these are traits most parents would applaud. But these juveniles take these fine habits to a dangerous extreme, frequently violently attacking those who do not share their purist outlook. 
   There are 204 documented Straight Edgers in Salt Lake City, with an average age of 19 years old. Like most gangs, they adopt distinctive clothing and tattoos to identify themselves. Although not all Straight Edgers engage in criminal activities, many have become very violent prone. They have engaged in coordinated attacks on college fraternities, and a murder outside the Federal Building in downtown Salt Lake City last Halloween night was Straight Edge related. This crime, in which a 15-year-old youth named ``Bernardo Repreza'' occurred during a gang-related fight against the Straight-Edgers. Three Straight Edge gang members, have been charged with the murder. 
   Straight Edgers are also being recruited into, and more frequently linked to, the radical animal rights movement. For instance, in 1996, Jacob Kenison, then 16 and a Straight Edger, became so obsessed with animal rights that he set fire to a leather store and released 
   thousands of animals from two Salt Lake County mink farms. In 1997, Kenison was charged in federal court for buying an assault rifle without disclosing he had been charged in state court. In December 1998, Kenison, now 20 years old, was sentenced to 9 months in jail for the mink release. The juveniles who committed the firebombing of a Murray breeders' co-op may have been Straight Edge, and have been linked to the Animal Liberation Front, a loose network of animal rights activists which advocates terrorist-like tactics. 
   And these gangs are learning some of their tactics on the Internet, which is why our amendment includes a provision making illegal to teach another how to make or use an explosive device intending or knowing that the instructions will be used to commit a federal crime, has passed the Senate on at least three separate occasions. It is time for Congress to pass it and make the law. 
   Sites with detailed instructions on how to make a wide variety of destructive devices have proliferated on the Internet. As many of my colleagues know, these sites were a prominent part of the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado. 
   Let me give my colleagues an example of one of these sites. The self-styled Animal Liberation Front has been linked to numerous bombings and arsons across the country, including several in my home State of Utah. Posted on their Internet site is the cyber-publication, The Final Nail #2. It is a detailed guide to terrorist activities. This chart shows just one example of the instructions to be found here--in this case, instructions to build an electronically timed incendiary igniter--the timer for a time bomb. 
   And how do the publishers intend that this information will be used? The suggestion is clear from threats and warnings in the guide. One page in the site shows a picture of an industry spokeswoman, warning her to ``take our advice while you still have some time: quit your job and cash in your frequent flier points for a permanent vacation.'' Now, on this chart, which comes from The Final Nail #2, we have redacted the spokeswoman's address and phone number to protect her privacy. The publishers 
   weren't so considerate. And this is just the beginning. This same document has a 59 page list of targets, complete with names and addresses from nearly every U.S. State and Canadian province. 
   Let there be no mistake--the publishers know what they're doing. For instance, the instructions on how to make milk jug firebombs comes with this caution: ``Arson is a big time felony so wear gloves and old clothes you can throw away throughout the entire process and be very careful not to leave a single shred of evidence.'' 
   It is unfortunate that people feel the need to disseminate information and instructions on bombmaking and explosives. Now perhaps we can't stop people from putting out that information. But if they are doing so with the intent that the information be used to commit a violent federal crime--or if they know that the information will be used for that purpose, then this amendment will serve to hold such persons accountable. 
   Unfortunately, kids today have unfettered access to a universe of harmful material. By merely clicking a mouse, kids can access pornography, violent video games, and even instructions for making bombs with ingredients that can be found in any household. Why someone feels the need to put such harmful material on the Internet is beyond me--there certainly is no legitimate need for our kids to know how to make a bomb. But if that person crosses the line to advocate the use of that knowledge for violent criminal purposes, or gives it our knowing it will be used for such purposes, then the law needs to cover that conduct. 
   Mr. President, the Hatch-Feinstein Federal Gang Violence Act incorporated in this amendment is a modest but important in stemming the spread of gangs and violence across the country and among our juveniles. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HATCH. We understand that most Senators have left. We also understand some of these amendments are controversial and they need debate on both sides. We also understand that some of us have to protect ourselves on both sides or protect our Senators. 
   We are moving ahead. I just put in a very important amendment for Senator FEINSTEIN and myself. We are submitting our statements for the RECORD today rather than taking the time of the Senate. We are moving ahead in a regular forum. We can move with some amendments today and some we can't. We do want to move ahead and we will certainly try to do so and accommodate Members. When it comes to protecting Members of the Senate, we have to do that. It is just a common courtesy that has been used in this body ever since I have been here for 23 years. I don't want to see that courtesy not extended at this time. 
   What I am hoping is that we can proceed with the Byrd amendment, which happens to be the bill that I filed on alcohol 
   sales over the Internet. We know that the Senators from the States who are in opposition are not here today. We will try to work out an arrangement where this amendment can be filed and reserve time, an equivalent amount of time, for those who may be in opposition. 
   We have asked for just a few minutes for one of our distinguished Senators who has a direct interest in this to be able to read the amendment. It is not a long amendment. If we could just get a few more minutes of time. 
   As I now understand, the amendment is OK. Let's go ahead. 
   May I propose a unanimous consent request?

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if nothing else can be said about this issue, it is absolutely imperative that states have the means to prevent unlawful access to alcohol by our children. 
   If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it delivered by merely ``borrowing'' a credit card and making a few clicks with her mouse, there is something wrong with the level of control that is being exercised over these sales and something must be done to address the problem. 
   I am a strong supporter of electronic commerce. But the sale of alcohol cannot be equated with the sale of a sweater or shirt. We need to foster growth in electronic commerce, but we also need to make sure that alcohol control laws are respected. 
   The growth of many of our nation's wineries is tied to their ability to achieve name recognition and generate sales nationwide--tasks the Internet is uniquely suited to accomplish. I do not want to preclude them from using the Internet; I want to ensure that they use it responsibly and in accordance with state laws. 
   If there is a problem with the system, we need to fix the system, not break the laws. 
   The 21st amendment gives states the right to regulate the importation of alcohol into their states. However, efforts to enforce laws relating to the importation of alcohol have run into significant legal hurdles in both state and Federal courts. 
   The scope of the 21st amendment is essentially a Federal question that must be decided by the Federal courts--and ultimately the Supreme Court. For that reason, among others, I believe a Federal court forum is appropriate for state enforcement efforts. 
   Most states do not permit direct shipping of alcohol to consumers. Therefore most Internet sales of alcohol are currently prohibited. If a state wants to set up a system to allow for the direct shipment of alcohol to consumers, such as New Hampshire and Louisiana have already done, then that is their right under the 21st amendment. But the decision to permit direct shipping, and under what conditions, is up to the states, not the purveyors of alcohol.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when I suggested equal time, it was on those particular amendments because of the need for certain Senators to be here on those particular amendments. Earlier this morning, Senator LAUTENBERG desired to call up his amendment and I respectfully requested that he reserve bringing it up until Monday because there are people gone who will not have an opportunity, who have asked me--who believed these amendments would not be brought up, who asked me to protect their right to be here when the amendments are brought up. As a courtesy, I ask him not to bring up the amendment. So I have no alternative other than to object to it. 
   We have had six amendments brought up. It is our turn on our 
   side to present an amendment. I think we are making progress. But we should honor, to the best of our abilities on each side--the request of some of our colleagues that they might be here on amendments they consider to be important to them, especially since this is a Friday and almost everybody left believing we would not do much more today. 
   Be that as it may, that is why I have to object. I have objected and I will object to certain amendments where I have to protect people on our side, as I would expect the distinguished Senator from Vermont to object if we tried to bring up an amendment when Senators on his side could not be here to respond. 
   I have another amendment for our side to bring up at this time. It is an amendment on the part of Senator SESSIONS and Senator ROBB and Senator ALLARD. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just answer that and then I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
   Look, the games are over as far as I am concerned. When a Senator stands on the floor and says he is protecting Members of 
   his side and extends the same courtesy to the other side to protect Members on their side, all they have to do is tell us. If the distinguished Senator believes somebody on his side has to be protected, all he has to do to be protected is tell me and I will honor that. I asked for that same courtesy on our side because there are Senators who cannot be here who want to be here when Senator LAUTENBERG brings up his amendment. It is a fair request, a fair statement; it is a fair position. I really do not think people should try to make political points or political hay out of it. 
   I might also add, nobody wants this bill more than I do. I have been working on it for 2 solid years. I have been working on it every day on the floor. I am going to do everything in my power to get it passed. I have to admit I have had a lot of cooperation from our distinguished ranking minority leader on the Judiciary Committee, for which I am very grateful. But there is no reason to play these games here. It is unreasonable for anybody to suggest that because somebody is protecting his side, because I am protecting my side, there is something untoward about that. I would not suggest it if the Senator wanted to protect his side. 
   Naturally, I am going to yield the floor to my friend from New Jersey. I wish I could accommodate him, frankly, because I care for him. I know he is sincere on this amendment. But it is not unreasonable to ask that Senators, on something they feel very deeply about, since everybody left here today other than a few of us, that they be protected so they can be here when the amendment is brought up. 
   Also, I note the distinguished Senator from Arkansas is on the floor. She wants to make a statement that is unrelated to the bill, as I understand it, or to either of the bills--the current bill that is on the floor or the prior bill we were debating. 
   So I yield the floor for the distinguished Senator, and of course, hopefully the Senator from Arkansas will then make her statement.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. During the debate over juvenile crime, we have heard a lot about the negative activities that juveniles participate in--playing violent video games, viewing unseemly sites on the Internet, and watching objectionable movies. But little has been said about the constructive things that kids can be--and are--doing with their time. It seems, sometimes, that there are few alternatives to the pollution that modern culture often feeds to our children. 
   However, in my home state of Utah there are many programs that help children to focus their attention away from destructive activities. For example, the Police Athletic League in Ogden, Utah provides sports lessons and intramural teams for 325 kids. Police officers serve as mentors to children and supply much needed attention through athletic activities. 
   The Hispanic Cultural Youth Program in Utah holds dances and social events that present a safe place for youth to socialize. And the LDS church has an extensive youth program that provides social events, educational activities, mentoring and community service activities. 
   I want my colleagues to be aware of an excellent program in Arizona that gives juveniles positive alternatives to the destructive activities that contribute to juvenile crime. ``Kid-Star'' Radio 590 AM, in Phoenix, allows children to produce, broadcast, and promote their own radio shows. Perry Damone, son of my good friend Vic Damone, has founded this program that places radio stations in the public schools and allows the children to control the broadcast. The kids run the entire program and have had phenomenal success with it. Over 3,000 students throughout Arizona have participated in the program. Individual schools report an almost immediate improvement in over-all student responsibility, and better written and oral skills. 
   Under this program, the students have conducted numerous interviews with prominent individuals including country singer Garth Brooks, comedian Jay Leno and our esteemed colleague Senator JOHN MCCAIN. Children have emerged from this program with a better self-esteem, greater maturity, and life skills. 
   In S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999, the Federal Government is required to disseminate data on prevention programs that are successful. This bill provides over $1 billion a year to the States to fight juvenile crime and prevent juvenile delinquency. This money will help the Department of Justice isolate and encourage successful prevention programs. Programs like the Police Athletic League, the Hispanic Cultural Youth Program, and ``Kid-Star'' should receive our special attention and be encouraged to continue the good work that they do. 
   As we continue to search for solutions to juvenile crime, let's remember the best solutions come from individuals working on a local level to make a difference. We can learn much from these initiatives on behalf of our children. I am extremely enthusiastic about the programs I have mentioned and hope the positive benefits of programs such as this can be extended to the entire Nation.

   Mr. HATCH. This morning the Senate will resume consideration of the juvenile justice legislation. Pending is the Hatch-Leahy amendment with a vote to take place at approximately 9:40 a.m. Following the disposition of the Hatch-Leahy amendment, Senator HOLLINGS will resume debate of his television violence amendment with 2 hours of debate remaining on the amendment, with the time for a vote to be determined. It is hoped that significant progress can continue to be made on this important legislation. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout today's session of the Senate. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this Hatch-Leahy amendment, which is aimed at limiting the negative impact violence and indecent material on the Internet have on children. 
   As I noted last evening, this amendment does not regulate the content. Instead, it encourages the larger Internet service providers, the ISPs, if you will, to provide, either for free or at a fee not exceeding the cost to the service providers, filtering technologies that will empower parents to limit or block the access of minors to unsuitable materials on the Internet. We simply cannot ignore the fact that the Internet has the ability to expose children to violent, sexually explicit, and other inappropriate materials with no limits. 
   A recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of teenagers from 13 to 17 believe the Internet is partly responsible for the crimes that occurred in Littleton, CO, at Columbine High School. The amendment respects the first amendment of the Constitution by not regulating content but ensures that parents will have the adequate technological tools to control access of their children to unsuitable material on the Internet. 
   I honestly believe that the Internet service providers that do not already provide filtering software to their subscribers will do so voluntarily. They will know it is in their best interests, and I believe the market will demand it. 
   A recent survey reported in the New York Times yesterday found that almost a third of on-line American households with children use blocking software. 
   In a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, 60 percent of parents said they disagreed with the statement that the Internet was a safe place for their children. According to yesterday's New York Times, after the shootings in Colorado, the demand for filtering technologies has dramatically increased. This indicates that parents are taking an active role in safeguarding their children on the Internet. That is what this amendment is all about--using technology to empower parents. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield the floor and hope we can go to a vote.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I should put all Senators on notice that we are just about out of time for debate with regard to the Hollings amendment on his side and I have somewhere near 42 minutes on our side. I intend to yield back some of that time so we can go to a vote on this matter. 
   I understand Senator COCHRAN wants to take about 10 minutes to speak on this amendment. I will take a few minutes now. 
   I rise to explain why I will ultimately move to table the Hollings amendment today. I struggled with this decision because there is much to be commended in my dear friend's amendment. I have a lot of respect for him. He knows that. I think it is important we work to make our culture safer for our families and for children, and that we make entertainment choices more family friendly. No question about it. We should certainly work to make television entertainment, which is so ubiquitous, less coarse, especially when children are watching. 
   Having said that, I do have a number of concerns with this amendment. Members of the satellite television industry, which we are working to make more competitive with cable, have expressed concerns with this amendment. Because much of the fare on satellites is delivered nationally, they will have difficulty complying. If a satellite carrier picks up programming on the east coast, where much programming originates, it will likely be out of compliance, given that fare appropriate for later hours on the east coast will be beamed simultaneously across the time zones to viewers on the west coast, and across the country, where obviously it will be earlier. 
   Additionally, opponents of this amendment have raised constitutional concerns. Although I have not had an opportunity to review or visit all of these constitutional issues, I do not believe that the constitutional concerns are clearly right or that opponents have an open-and-shut constitutional case. I do believe the issues bear careful consideration. 
   Most of all, I must vote to table this amendment because of a commitment I made to my colleagues in 1997 in connection with getting the voluntary television ratings and V-chip systems in place. At that time, I was approached by a number of colleagues to sign a Dear Colleague letter taking a stand against regulating television ratings, content, or scheduling until those systems had time to get underway. 
   That Dear Colleague letter is dated July 8, 1997, and was signed by Senators LOTT, DASCHLE, MCCAIN, LEAHY, as well as myself, and other Republicans and Democrats. I made that commitment then and I believe I need to honor it now. 
   Some may believe that an earlier amendment which I supported had a similar impact. The Brownback-Hatch-Lieberman amendment allowed the industry to develop a voluntary code of conduct but did not impose any regulations on the industry. It also was a comprehensive amendment and had much greater application than the television ratings, content, and scheduling at issue in the V-chip and ratings process. It applied to television, movies, music, video games, and the Internet. At that time yesterday, I recognized my earlier commitment and raised and distinguished it. 
   Therefore, although I find much to commend in the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, because of my prior commitment to forbear from supporting legislation or recommendation concerning television ratings, content, or scheduling, I believe I must honor that pledge to my colleagues and vote to table the Hollings amendment. 
   There is a lot of very bad programming on television in our country today. I think the satellite viewership problem is a big problem. To make someone liable because they have to carry the satellite transmission at a time that fits within the time constraints of this amendment on the west coast--coming from the east coast, it may be in compliance, but the west coast may not be, and the satellite transmitter will be liable--is a matter of great problematic concern to me. 
   I share the same concern my friend from South Carolina shares with regard to what is being televised and on the airwaves today, especially during times when young people are watching. On the other hand, I have a very strong commitment to uphold the first amendment and to be very reticent to start dictating what can and cannot be done on network television or on television, period. 
   As for cleaning up the media, we did have the Brownback-Hatch-Lieberman amendment. Senators BROWNBACK and LIEBERMAN have worked long and hard to come up with some solutions that hopefully will be voluntary, that hopefully will resolve these questions. 
   That amendment yesterday was adopted overwhelmingly. It requires the FTC and Department of Justice to do a comprehensive study of the entertainment industry. It seems to me that is a very reasonable, important thing to do and we ought to get that information before we make any final decisions in this area. 
   Also, it had a provision asking the National Institutes of Health to study the impact of violence and unsuitable material on children and child development. That brought a lot of angst to a number of people. Having the FTC look into these things brought a lot of angst to a lot of people. I might add, having the Department of Justice do it has caused a lot of concern. 
   I think that amendment, including its other provisions on antitrust, will go a long way toward cleaning up the exposure of minors to violent material. I would like to see that work and I would like to see these studies done before we go this drastically to a solution in the Senate. 
   At the appropriate time I will move to table the amendment, and I hope my colleagues will support the motion to  table with the commitment from me--and I think others will make it, too--that we will continue to revisit this area, because we are all concerned. It is not only the province of those who are for this amendment; all of us are concerned about what is happening to our children in our society today. 
   I see that Senator COCHRAN has arrived. I yield 10 minutes to Senator COCHRAN.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in discussing several proposals with my colleagues over the last 2 days and nights, I am offering a package of amendments that will increase the effectiveness of S. 254 by sharpening the bill's focus on punishing criminals who use guns illegally, while protecting law-abiding people who use guns lawfully for traditional sporting and self-defense purposes. We want to punish the criminal without burdening law-abiding people. 
   Our amendment package has four parts: one, more aggressive prosecution; two, enhanced targeted penalties; three, expanded protection for children; and, four, enhanced background checks. 
   First, we propose an improved version of a program for the aggressive prosecution of the criminal use of firearms by felons or a program that is commonly known as CUFF, C-U-F-F. It is one thing to talk about putting criminals behind bars, and it is another thing to actually do it. We in the Senate must recognize that all the gun laws we could ever pass mean absolutely nothing if the Attorney General does not enforce them. 
   The Clinton administration talked about the Brady bill and stopping criminals from obtaining and using guns. The Attorney General talked about being tough on criminals, but the record shows otherwise. The chart that we are going to show to you shows that in the last 3 years the Democratic Department of Justice has had a dismal record in protecting the very crimes that the Democratic administration and Democrats in Congress said were an essential part of their program. 
   This chart shows the prosecutions of Federal firearms laws, cases reported, Executive Office, U.S. Attorney, requested firearms sections, counts charged, calendar years 1996-1998. 
   Now, for example, between 1992 and 1997, gun prosecutions under Operation Triggerlock--a proven gun crime prosecution program, started under President Bush--dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to 3,765. Now, these are prosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony. They had been cut by 50 percent between the years 1992 and 1997. The Executive Office of the U.S. Attorney reports that between 1996 and 1998 the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted a grand total of one criminal who illegally attempted to purchase a handgun, but was stopped by the instant check system. 
   It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school grounds. However, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight cases under this law in 1998, even though they admit that more than 6,000 students illegally brought guns to school last year. 
   The Clinton administration had prosecuted only five such cases in 1997. Many believe that the actual number of kids who bring guns to school is much higher than the 6,000, but I think it is pretty pathetic when you stop and think that, in 1998, there were only eight cases prosecuted and in 1997 only five. 
   It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a juvenile. However, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases under this law in 1998, and only five in 1997. Think about it. It is illegal--illegal--to transfer a firearm to a juvenile yet only six cases were prosecuted in 1998 and only five in 1997. 
   Now, it is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon. However, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only four cases under this law in 1998 and only four in 1997. Think about it. 
   In addition, the Clinton administration has requested only $5 million to prosecute gun crimes. We have a lot of rhetoric from this administration about gun crimes and how effective the Brady law has been. They claim hundreds of thousands of people are stopped from purchasing guns, many of whom they believed were felons. Please note that it costs $1.5 million to fund an effective project in the city of Philadelphia alone--just one city, $1.5  million--and they only requested $5 million for prosecuting gun crimes. Thus, not only has the Clinton administration failed to prosecute gun crimes in the past; it apparently has no plan to do better in the future. 
   This chart lists the prosecuted cases reported by the Executive Office of the U.S. Attorney. 
   Providing firearm to a prohibited person, unspecified category: 17 in 1996, 20 in 1997, and 10 in 1998. 
   Providing a firearm to a felon: 20 in 1996, 13 in 1997, and 24 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a fugitive: 30 in 1996, 30 in 1997, and 23 in 1998. That is an important category. 
   Possession of a firearm by a drug addict or illegal drug user: 46 in 1996, 69 in 1997, 129 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person committed to a mental institution, or an adjudicated mental incompetent: 1 in 1996, 4 in 1997, 5 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, and we have millions of them coming into this country: 72 in 1996, 96 in 1997, and 107 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces: 0 in 1996, 0 in 1997, 2 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person under a certain kind of restraining order provision: 3 in 1996, 18 in 1997, 22 in 1998. Even though this administration has been complaining about domestic violence and the use of handguns and guns in domestic violence. Just think about it. This is the whole country. This is all the Justice Department has done. OK. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor: 0 in 1996, 21 in 1997, 56 in 1998. 
   Look at this. 
   Possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone: 4. 
   Look at that. We have 6,000 kids that they admit came into schools with firearms in this country, and we know it is many more thousands than that; they know it, too. But there were only 4 in 1996, 5 in 1997, and 8 in 1998. 
   Now, we have heard a lot of mouthing off about the Brady bill and 100,000 cops in the streets. Let's talk about the Brady bill. According to them, hundreds of thousands of people have been prohibited from getting guns because of the Brady Act. Really, it is the check system that we insisted on that is causing these people to be caught. 
   Look at this: All violations under the Brady Act, first phase: 0 in 1996, 0 in 1996, and 1 in 1998. 
   Think about that, OK. 
   All violations under the Brady Act, instant check phase: 0 in 1996, 0 in 1997, 0 in 1998. 
   How about the hundreds of thousands of people they claim violated the law that they have caught: 
   Theft of a firearm from a Federal firearms licensee: 52 in 1996, 51 in 1997, and 25 in 1998. 
   Manufacturing, transferring, or possessing a nongrandfathered assault weapon: 16 in 1996, 4 in 1997, and 4 
   in 1998. 
   Transfer of a handgun, or handgun ammunition to a juvenile. We have thousands of cases like this: 9 in 1996, 5 in 1997, 6 in 1998. 
   Possession of a handgun, or handgun ammunition, by a juvenile: 27 in 1996, 3 in 97, and only 8 in 1998. Think about that. 
   Unspecified violations: 46 in 1996, 26 in 1997, and 21 in 1998. 
   Enhanced penalty use of a firearm or destructive device during a crime of violence or drug-related crime prosecutable in Federal Court: 1,987 in 1996, 1,885 in 1997, and 1,763 in 1998. Those are very small numbers compared to the number of people who they claim are misusing firearms. 
   Possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, unspecified category: 683 in 1996, 752 in 1997, 603 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a felon. Think about all these complaints about firearms causing everything in our society. They prosecuted 1,213 in 1996, 1,366 in 1997, 1,550 in 1998. 
   Who is kidding whom here? The fact of the matter is, this administration hasn't been serious about prosecuting gun cases, and now they want a lot more gun laws. Well, we are going to give them some on this bill, and we are going to give them some that some gun owners don't particularly care for. We are going to see if they do a better job in the future. We have to turn this around. 
   The CUFF amendment would fund--and we offer it in this amendment--an aggressive firearms prosecution program modeled after Operation Triggerlock, which was so successful during the Bush administration. It focuses on prosecuting gun criminals and obtaining tough sentences on the use of firearms in the commission of crimes of violence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. The CUFF amendment, of course, they would like. Anybody who wants to do anything about crime would like that. In contrast to the $5 million requested by the Clinton administration to fund gun crimes, our plan provides $50 million to hire additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute gun crimes. This is just in the area of juvenile justice. 
   Our program expands to other cities a successful Richmond, Virginia program in which federal prosecutors prosecute as many local gun-related crimes as possible in federal court. Homicides have fallen 50 percent in Richmond since the program was implemented. This program works. 
   In addition to encouraging aggressive prosecution, our plan requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on the number of possible gun crimes and, if the crimes are not prosecuted, to explain why. I initially hesitated to support such a statute. However, after years of little enforcement of existing laws and after years of holding hearings at which the Attorney General consistently provides no satisfactory explanation, we have no choice. 
   If Congress passes a law to make an act a crime, it is the duty of the Attorney General to enforce that law. This reporting provision is a necessary step to ensure that the Clinton Justice Department does its duty and prosecutes the illegal use of guns by criminals. 
   Second, this package of amendments includes several penalty enhancements that I, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator MCCAIN, and Senator CAMPBELL have worked on. These enhancements target the illegal use of guns by criminals. 
   This proposal would impose the following mandatory minimum sentences: 
   Five years for the transfer of a firearm to another who the transferor knows will use the firearm in the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense. 
   Ten years for criminals, including straw purchasers, that illegally transfer a firearm to a juvenile who they have reasonable cause to know will use the firearm to commit a violent felony. 
   Twelve years for discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. 
   Fifteen years for injuring a person in the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. 
   The proposal would also increase the mandatory minimums for distributing drugs to minors and for selling drugs in or near a school to 3 years for the first offense and 5 years for repeat offenders. 
   Our proposal would also increase the maximum penalty for knowingly transporting or transacting in stolen firearms, stealing a firearm from a dealer, and stealing a firearm that has moved in interstate commerce to 15 years. 
   This is strong medicine for the worst criminals that illegally use guns and drugs to harm elderly people, women, and children. 
   Third, our proposal would protect our children. 
   After reviewing Senator LEAHY's proposal, I must give the good Senator from Vermont and his colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle credit. His proposal to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative is a proposal that we can agree on. 
   This proposal would facilitate the identification and prosecution of gun traffickers that illegally peddle guns to our children. 
   The proposal would also facilitate the sharing of information between federal and State law enforcement authorities to stop gun trafficking.  
   The proposal would also provide grants to State and local governments to assist them in tracing firearms and hiring personnel to stop illegal gun trafficking. 
   I am glad that on this provision, we can reach a bipartisan agreement to protect our youth from illegal gun trafficking. 
   This proposal would also prohibit possession of firearms by violent juvenile offenders. This is the juvenile Brady provision, another provision they weren't particularly happy of in the eyes of some people in our society. But it is in this bill, and in this amendment. 
   It extends the current ban on firearm ownership by certain felons to certain juvenile offenders. 
   Under this proposal, juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for serious crimes will not be able to own a firearm--ever. 
   When they reach maturity, they will not be able to own a firearm. 
   To ensure that this law will be enforceable, however, we make it effective only after records of such offenses are made available on the Instant Check System. 
   Finally, this proposal would aid in the overall enhancement of the Instant Check System. Senator DEWINE has played an instrumental role in drafting this provision that will help bring the Instant Check System into the 21st century, something that all on our side have been for from the beginning, and it is the only thing that really is working. 
   This amendment will fund a feasibility study on the development of a single-fingerprint computer system and database for identifying convicted felons who attempt to purchase handguns. 
   Under this system, a person will be able to voluntarily put his thumb or index finger onto a scanner at a gun store and a computer would instantly compare his finger print to a national digital database of finger prints for convicted felons. This would provide a truly accurate and truly instant check of a potential purchaser. This would prevent criminals with false identification credentials from purchasing a handgun. 
   The amendment would also close a loophole in current law. It would require the Attorney General to establish procedures to provide the Instant Check system with access to records not currently on the database. This would include records of domestic violence restraining orders. This will help protect vulnerable women from abusive spouses. 
   After the shooting at the library in Utah by a mentally disturbed person, I have been in contact with the representatives of mental health organizations to discuss this important problem. My constituents in Utah are very concerned about this issue and so am I, and everybody else is as well who reflects on this matter. 
   This proposal takes a small but important step on this issue. It directs the Attorney General to establish procedures for including public records of adjudications of mental incompetence and involuntary commitments to mental institution in the Instant Check database. This provision would protect the public, but would also respect the legitimate privacy interests and treatment needs of those with mental health problems. 
   Mr. President, this package of amendments will increase the prosecution of firearm crimes, increase penalties on criminals that illegally use guns and drugs, protect our children from gun trafficking, and expand the availability of background checks to stop convicted felons from illegally purchasing guns. The package accomplishes this without overburdening the lawful and traditional use of firearms by law abiding citizens for sporting purposes and by our most vulnerable citizens for self-defense purposes. Mr. President, I strongly support this package of amendments as an excellent addition to S. 254. 
   In addition, Mr. President, this amendment would also punish the solicitation of the violation of federal gun laws over the Internet. It would not require advertisers who do not actually sell a firearm over the Internet to become federally licensed firearms dealers. 
   The amendment provides that if a person knows or has reason to know that his Internet advertisement offering to transfer a firearm or explosives in violation of existing federal criminal statutes, he will be punished severely. 
   The amendment imposes fines and prison sentences that escalate for repeat offenders. 
   The amendment also provides an affirmative defense. If the advertiser is a licensed dealer, he can avoid the penalty imposed by this statute by posting a notice stating that sales of the firearm will be in accordance with federal law and will be made through a licensed dealer. 
   If the advertiser is a non-licensed individual, he can avoid the penalty imposed by this statute by:

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of the Senate that we have possible Democrat amendments of 51 and possible Republican amendments of 22. We have disposed of 12 or 13. 
   Look, this is ridiculous. We have been very fair. Both sides have had an opportunity to present what they wanted to present. We have had some terrible amendments here from one side or the other, and we fought them through and we have done what is right. 
   Let me tell you something. I would like to move through this matter as quickly as we can. I would like to have colleagues on both sides reduce the number of amendments. If you absolutely don't have to have the amendment, let's withdraw it. This is a very, very important bill. We are talking about kids all over this country who are getting away with murder. 
   We are talking about vicious, violent juveniles who are wrecking our country and wrecking our schools and creating gangs and doing things that are really causing this country chaotic conditions. 
   We have a bill here that is bipartisan that really will do something about that. There have been wins on both sides, and I think to the betterment of this bill. I think it is time for us to get down and start working on it and get it done. 
   I can't imagine why anybody in this body wouldn't want to get this bill done, especially with 2 years of work and all kinds of effort and work here on the floor by both sides. 
   I want to compliment my Democratic leader on this bill for the good work he has done on this, and the work we have been able to do together. It is clear we can't pass this bill with 77 amendments. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-hatch-ut-49-19990513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. We clearly can't pass this bill if we have to have 73 amendments. There is just no way we have time in this legislative session to do it. This bill has virtually everything in it to help us to resolve these problems. We all have pet projects in the amendments that we bring up. It is time to start restraining ourselves and quit delaying this particular bill. 
   I am getting to the point--we are not there yet, but we are getting to the point where I am going to start moving to table every doggone amendment that will come up. I am going to table them right off the bat, because I think we have gone way too far here. If we had a big partisan thing here where your side or our side was being mistreated, that is another matter, but this has been very fairly conducted, and everybody knows it. 
   I think it is time to get serious about solving these juvenile justice problems in our society. This bill has been improved to a large degree. Some of us believe it has been hurt a little bit, but that is the process. Now it is time to sit down and get this done. 
   Look, we have the Hatch-Craig amendment. Admittedly, our side has had more time on that amendment. 
   I would like to get a time agreement. The minority has had that amendment for well over 2 1/2 hours, maybe 3 1/2 hours. I can't remember, but it has been a long time. We have had major, major amendments from them. But we have taken one-half hour to get it prepared. It is time to argue it. It is time to get it over with. We are willing to grant most of the time to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, or others on the minority side. But I would suggest we set a time to vote on this amendment. I would like to get that over with, because I believe this is an amendment that virtually everybody in this body ought to support, because we have made real efforts to try to accommodate people on both sides of the floor. And we have incorporated Democrat ideas in this amendment as well. We have done it to try to bring this matter to an effective and decent conclusion. 
   I know this: The majority leader means it. We are going to be in here all week, and it is just ridiculous to do that, especially when we have come this far and we have had this kind of an open debate. We have debated some of the more controversial and difficult issues, and both sides have been given every chance to speak on it. 
   I suggest we come to a time agreement that gives most of the time to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey and those who are on the minority side who deserve a right to debate this amendment. We are willing to go ahead and do that. 
   I just would like to get a time limit on it and then move on from there, and move to the similar amendment, which we would get a time agreement on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. If I could respond to the Senator, we have people on our side who are going to move to table this amendment. I would like to avoid that by having a reasonable time for the Senator from New Jersey to argue this amendment. There is nothing complicated about it. 
   We explained it in detail. It is easy to understand. Frankly, there is not one thing in here that is new and that can't be understood readily. 
   I would be happy to sit down with the Senator and go over the detail of this amendment. I think he would be pleased with most all of it. But I would like to avoid a motion to table. I would like the Senator to have time to debate this amendment. But the way things are going, he is going to be cut off on his time. I don't want to have that happen, nor do I want this to evolve into a situation--we have been trying to be cooperative and trying to make this thing work. And it is apparent some people around here are trying to delay it. 
   I am not accusing the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, but I believe  we could get this bill finished tonight if we would sit down and get it finished. I don't see any reason we shouldn't. The sooner we get it finished, the sooner the kids in our society are going to understand what the game is and that we are going to stop some of this violent juvenile crime in this country. We are giving the tools to law enforcement to be able to do it. We have $50 million in here for additional juvenile prosecutors, just to name one thing out of that $1.1 billion in this bill. I would like to get a time limit. I am willing to give the Senator all of the time, but let's get a time limit on this and go from here.

   Mr. HATCH. First of all, those suggestions you had were in the $1.4 billion comprehensive amendment you made that had less than 9 percent for accountability. 
   We have 45 percent on this bill on the money for accountability and 55 percent for prevention. 
   I said at the time, many of those amendments we could accept and that we would present them later, which is what we have done. We have tried to do it in a reasonable, short period of time. It is to the Senator's credit that we all agree on those particular amendments. 
   What I would like to do is finish the Hatch-Craig amendment. Assuming we do need a little bit more time on that, I suggest we set that aside so the Senator can have a little bit more time, and go to the Schumer amendment, which I believe we can do in 30 minutes equally divided.

I am not going to put up with that kind of stuff, after what we have done here for 3 days in a row on a bill that everybody should want.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one reason I wanted the Hatch-Craig amendment voted on this evening is because all day long the President has been bad-mouthing the Republicans and the Attorney General has been bad-mouthing the Republicans, and I think taking unfair political advantage because of some of the votes we had yesterday. One of the things they are bad-mouthing the Republicans on is because we have closed that loophole with regard to gun shows. Today, the Hatch-Craig amendment does it. Then we find ourselves unable to vote on it. 
   I am happy we are going to vote in the morning, but I suggest we move on ahead this evening. We have the unanimous consent agreement locked in. I suggest we line up some more votes for tomorrow right after we finish those two votes. 
   If Senator WELLSTONE has an amendment he would like to bring up tonight, let's do it, and we will see what we can do. We will try to alternate between the two sides. 
   If you are serious about your amendments, let's go at it tonight. We have about 3 hours of debate ahead of us right now. We will go from there. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Senator MCCONNELL be the next one to lay his amendment down, following the debate on these two, and then--could I have the minority leader's attention, and also Senator LEAHY? 
   I ask unanimous consent that we go with the McConnell amendment right after we debate the two that we have the unanimous consent agreement on.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hatch-Craig amendment we offered earlier this afternoon requires every nonlicensed individual who desires to sell a firearm at a gun show to have a background check. They can get a background check through a licensed Federal firearms dealer or through a special registrant, but he must get a background check. 
   The language in the amendment clearly states that a nonlicensed seller ``shall only make'' a sale at a gun show after getting a background check through the instant check system. 
   ``Shall'' means ``shall.'' It does not mean ``maybe,'' ``sometimes,'' or ``if you want to''; it means ``shall.''

   Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to at the end if we have some time, but we are short on time. 
   The distinguished Senator from New Jersey says we are a nation of laws. He says we must close the loophole that allows nonlicensed individuals to buy a gun at a gun show. 
   The Senator from New Jersey says the definition of ``gun show'' used in the amendment would exempt gatherings of fewer 
   than 10 firearms exhibitors and, he said, would exempt gatherings of firearm exhibitors and other exhibitors where the percentage of firearm exhibitors is less than 20 percent of the show. This is untrue. The amendment defines a ``gun show'' as an event at which we have either, A, 20 percent or more firearms exhibitors out of all the exhibitors at the show or, B, 10 or more firearms exhibitors. The language is ``or,'' not ``and.'' 
   Thus, if there are three exhibitors, one of which is a firearms exhibitor, this would constitute a ``gun show'' under the 20 percent rule--one out of three naturally being 33 percent, which is greater than 20 percent. The event need not satisfy the ``10 or more'' tests. It will be a gun show. 
   If there are 10 firearm exhibitors out of 100 exhibitors, that will be a gun show under the ``10 or more'' rule. The event need not also satisfy the 20 percent. It would be a gun show. 
   It is just that simple. There is no question about it. The threshold for what constitutes a gun show is low and it is certain: 20 percent firearms exhibitors or 10 or more firearms exhibitors. 
   What does that mean? In fact, the definition of ``gun show'' in the Hatch-Craig amendment is more strict than Senator LAUTENBERG's original definition. He required 50 firearms and 2 or more firearms sellers. Thus, if 1 of 3 exhibitors at a gathering is a firearms dealer and only brings 49 firearms, Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment would not classify it as a gun show. The Hatch-Craig amendment would classify it as a gun show. 
   The Republican amendment closes the loophole that the Democratic amendment left open. To talk about loopholes, we know a little bit about that. The Hatch-Craig amendment slams the door shut on the loophole  and slams it hard. Unfortunately for my Democratic colleagues, however, our amendment slams this door without more regulation, 
   and without more taxes and without much more Government and bureaucracy, which is what would have happened under the Lautenberg amendment. 
   Next, the Senator from New Jersey says that we on this side of the aisle do not believe that gun laws work. He is absolutely wrong on that. We just know they are not enforced by this administration. 
   For all the loudmouth talking that this administration does, look at this record of what they have done with regard to prosecutions of guns. I went through this early in the day. 
   Providing a firearm to a prohibited person, unspecified category--each number will be for 1996, 1997, 1998, in that order--17, 25, 10. It is pitiful. 
   Look at this. Providing firearms to a felon: 20, 13, 24; for 1996, 1997, 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a fugitive: 30, 30, and 23 for last year. 
   Possession of a firearm by a drug addict or illegal drug user--we know there are hundreds of thousands, at least, if not millions--46, 69, 129. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person committed to a mental institution or adjudicated mentally incompetent: 1 in 1996, 4 in 1997, and 5 prosecutions in 1998. 
   Tell me that this administration is enforcing gun laws that are on the books. And yet all we hear is crying and crying over spilled milk, that we need more gun laws. But they won't enforce them. There are lots of gun laws on the books, but they just will not enforce them. 
   It is just the phoniest doggone issue I have seen yet, when everybody in this Senate knows that these problems with our teenagers and our young people, what they come down to is a myriad of problems, many of which are caused by broken homes, broken families, single families where the parent has to work and cannot take care of the kids, a breakdown in society, a breakdown in religious values, a breakdown in family values, a breakdown in many other societal values, rotten movies, rotten music, rotten Internet things, rotten video games. 
   All of this is adding to this. Guns is one small part of it. But look at all these laws. And they are not being enforced by this very administration which continues to pop off every day about, we need more gun laws. Well, enforce the ones we have. 
   It is incredible to me that they get away with this. Sure, the polls will say that people are concerned about guns. Naturally they are. We all are. But they ought to be concerned about an administration that does nothing about the laws already on the books, that continually calls for more for political advantage. That is what bothers me about this outfit. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person dishonorably discharged from the armed services: 0, 0, 2; for 1996, 1997, 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person under a certain kind of restraining order provision: 3 in 1996, 18 in 1997, 22 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor: 0 in 1996, 21 in 1997, 56 in 1998. 
   A country of 250 million people, and this is the record we have? 
   Possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor--think about it--0 in 1996, 21 in 1997, 56 in 1998. 
   Possession of a firearm or discharge of a firearm in a 
   school zone--thousands of them--we had 4, 5, and 8 in the last 3 years. Think about it. 
   All violations under the Brady Act--we have heard nothing but Brady Act, Brady Act, Brady Act, and it has not done a thing compared to the instant check system which we insisted on. But look at this. All the violations under the Brady Act, first phase: No prosecutions in either 1996 or 1997; one prosecution under the Brady Act in 1998. And you would have thought the Brady Act was the last panacea for all gun problems on this Earth. 
   All violations under the Brady Act in the instant check phase--they are not even doing it under the instant check that we have done--0, 0, 0; for 1996, 1997, 1998. There is a point where you call it hypocrisy to continually try to make political points on guns when this administration ignores every law that is on the books and then says we need more laws to solve these problems. 
   My gosh, we know that the trigger lock cases have dropped an awful lot, from 7,500 under the Bush administration down to 3,500, because this administration does not take it seriously. Yet they go out every day and make these political points that we need more gun laws so that they have an opportunity not to enforce them, I guess. 
   Look at this. Theft of a firearm from a Federal firearms licensee: 52, 51, 25. 
   Manufacturing, transferring, or possession of a nongrandfathered assault weapon: 16, 4, 4. We heard how terrible assault weapons are. Hardly anything done about it. 
   Transfer of a handgun or handgun ammunition to a juvenile: 9, 5, 6, even though we know that is violated all over this country. 
   The fact of the matter is, these are laws we should be enforcing that are not being enforced. And I have only covered some of them. I do not have enough time to cover all of them. 
   But the fact is, this administration, for all of its talk about guns, isn't enforcing the laws that exist. Now they are asking for more laws. And they will not enforce those either. 
   The Hatch-Craig amendment slams the door on these loopholes. And, frankly, when are they going to enforce these laws the way they should be enforced? 
   It is one thing to talk about punishing the criminal use of firearms; it is another thing to mean it. It is one thing to talk about protecting innocent schoolchildren from violent juvenile offenders; it is another thing to actually pass a bill that will do it. 
   This bill will help. Yet we are in such a doggone logjam here, we might have to pull this bill down, because all the amendments that people are coming up with every day really are deterring the passage of this bill. 
   Republicans want to pass this bill and protect our children now. And I believe my colleague on the other side, who is managing his side, wants to do so as much as I do. 
   Let's stop talking. Let's start acting. If you really want to protect our schoolchildren, prove it by passing the juvenile crime bill. That is the best way to do it. And let's not just center on guns, which may be a problem, and probably is a whole series of problems, but that is only one small part of this. I am saying, a lot of things are not being done. 
   Senator SCHUMER criticizes this amendment by saying it would permit, for the first time, transactions of firearms at gun shows by individuals who are not Federal firearms licensees. 
   But the entire justification of the gun show amendment--since the private sales are occurring at gun shows without any background checks whatsoever, we are putting in this bill, the Hatch-Craig amendment, instant checks on all sales. And it shall be done, according to this amendment. Senator SCHUMER's criticism suggests we are trying to address a problem that does not exist. Which is it? Is this a problem? Is there a problem with private sales at gun shows or not?

   Mr. HATCH. This amendment does not allow more types of firearms transactions at gun shows. It does provide for a mandatory background check for all transactions at gun shows. Only those transactions where there is currently no check at all will be able to take advantage of a special registrant background check. Right now, we have hardly any protections. 
   This amendment will bring them to pass. This amendment will do what was asked for yesterday. I think you can criticize anything to do with this area, but this is the right way to go. We are going to solve this problem. That is why people should vote for the Hatch-Craig amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say a few words also about Meg Greenfield. This was an extraordinary journalist, an extraordinary person, a person who anybody would have to look up to. 
   I remember as a young conservative meeting with her. She was fair and decent to me. It just about meant everything to me that she would take time to discuss some of the great issues of the day with me. 
   I have inestimable respect for her. My sympathy and the sympathy of my wife Elaine goes out to her family. They have real reason to be very proud of her. She set standards of journalism that were very high. What pleased me is that even though I know she disagreed with me on a number of issues, she was very fair, very frank, and very decent when we discussed them. She went out of her way to make me feel welcomed. 
   Whether you agree or disagree with the Washington Post--I personally believe it is one of the greatest newspapers in America--for her to rise to the pinnacle of her profession in that great newspaper and to make sure that the editorial page and other aspects she worked with in the Washington Post were done with integrity and decency always impressed me. 
   We will miss her. Our love and affection and hearts go out to the family. She deserves the respect of everybody in this body, and, frankly, many, many, more throughout the country.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the ``Citizens Access to Justice Act of 1999,'' or CAJA. More precisely, I am reintroducing the same bill that was voted out of the Judiciary Committee last Congress, but was a victim of a filibuster by the left. 
   Why am I doing this? Some may say that it is fruitless. But even though Senator LANDRIEU, other supporters of the bill, and myself, were unsuccessful last Congress in passing this much needed bill, property owners of Utah, and, indeed, of all of our States, still feel the heavy hand of the government erode their right to hold and enjoy private property. To make matters worse, many of these property owners often are unable to safeguard their rights because they effectively are denied access to federal courts. Our bill was designed to rectify this problem. Let me explain. 
   In a society based upon the ``rule of law,'' the ability to protect property and other rights is of paramount importance. Indeed, it was Chief Justice John Marshall, who in the seminal 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison, observed that the ``government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested right.'' 
   Despite this core belief of John Marshall and other Founders, the ability of property owners to vindicate their rights in court today is being frustrated by localities which sometimes create labyrinths of administrative hurdles that property owners must jump through before being able to bring a claim in Federal court to vindicate their federal constitutional rights. They are also hampered by the overlapping and confusing jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims and the federal district courts over Fifth Amendment property rights claims. CAJA seeks to remedy these situations. 
   The purpose of the bill is, therefore, at its root, primarily one of fostering fundamental fairness and simple justice for the many millions of Americans who possess or own property. Many citizens who attempt to protect their property rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution are barred from the doors of the federal courthouse. 
   In situations where other than Fifth Amendment property rights are sought to be enforced--such as First Amendment rights, for example--aggrieved parties generally file in a single federal forum to obtain the full range of remedies available to litigants to make them whole. In property rights cases, property owners may have to file in different courts for different types of remedies. This is expensive and wasteful. 
   Moreover, unlike situations where other constitutional rights are sought to be enforced, property owners seeking to enforce their Fifth Amendment rights must first exhaust all state remedies with the result that they may have to wait for over a decade before their rights are allowed to be vindicated in federal court--if they get there at all. CAJA addresses this problem of providing property owners fair access to federal courts to vindicate their federal constitutional rights. 
   Let me be more specific. The bill has two main provisions to accomplish this end. The first is to provide private property owners claiming a violation of the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause some certainty as to when they may file the claim in federal court. This is accomplished by addressing the procedural hurdles of the ripeness and abstention doctrines which currently prevent them from having fair and equal access to federal court. The bill defines when a final agency decision has occurred for purposes of meeting the ripeness requirement and prohibits a federal judge from abstaining from or relinquishing jurisdiction when the case does not allege any violation of a state law, right, or privilege. Thus, the bill serves as a vehicle for overcoming federal judicial reluctance to review takings claims based on the ripeness and abstention doctrines. 
   The second provision clarifies the jurisdiction between the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., and the regional federal district courts over federal Fifth Amendment takings claims. The ``Tucker Act,'' which waives the sovereign immunity of the United States by granting the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain monetary claims against the United States, actually complicates the ability of a property owner to vindicate the right to just compensation for a government action that has caused a taking. The law currently forces a property owner to elect between equitable relief in the federal district court and monetary relief in the Court of Federal Claims. Further difficulty arises when the law is used by the government to urge dismissal in the district court on the ground that the plaintiff should seek just compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, and is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal Claims on the ground that plaintiff should first seek equitable relief in the district court. 
   This division between law and equity is archaic and results in burdensome delays as property owners who seek both types of relief are ``shuffled'' from one court to the other to determine which court is the proper forum for review. The bill resolves this matter by simply giving both courts concurrent jurisdiction over takings claims, thus allowing both legal and equitable relief to be granted in a single forum. 
   I must emphasize that the bill does not create any substantive rights. The definition of property, as well as what constitutes a taking under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, is left to the courts to define. The bill would not change existing case law's ad hoc, case-by-case definition of regulatory takings. Instead, it would provide a procedural fix to the litigation muddle that delays and increases the cost of litigating a Fifth Amendment taking case. All the bill does is to provide for fair procedures to allow property owners the means to safeguard their rights by having their day in court. 
   Mr. President, I am very well aware that this bill has been opposed by the  Department of 
   Justice, many localities, some interstate governmental associations, and certain environmental groups. I believe that there concerns that the bill would hinder local prerogatives and significantly increase the amount of federal litigation are highly overstated. The bill is carefully drafted to ensure that aggrieved property owners must first seek solutions on the local or state level before filing a federal claim. It just sets a limit on how many procedures localities may interpose. 
   Moreover, I seriously doubt that there will be a rush of new litigation, as some have contended, flooding federal courts. That there will be no significant increase was the conclusion of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in its study of last year's bill. 
   It is extremely difficult to prove a takings claim, and this bill does not in any way redefine what constitutes a taking. These claims are also expensive to bring. Paradoxically, localities' need to defend federal actions may be lessened by the bill because localities already must litigate property rights claims on federal ripeness grounds, which take years to resolve. 
   Let me restate this. By providing certainty on the ripeness issue, the bill may very well reduce litigation costs to localities. Substantive takings claims, unless they are likely to prevail on the merits, are simply too hard to prove and too expensive to bring in federal court. And the issue of ripeness will have been removed by the bill from the already crowded court dockets. 
   Mr. President, it is interesting to note that once many state officials, localities, and state and trade organizations really examine the measure, many become the bill's supporters. Those supporting the bill and increased vigilance in the property rights arena include the Governors of Tennessee, Wisconsin, New Mexico, and North Dakota. 
   They also include the American Legislative Exchange Council, which represents over 3000 state legislators, and trade groups such as America's Community Bankers, the National Mortgage Association of America, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Realtors, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the organ of small business in the United States. They also include agricultural interests such as the American Farm Bureau, the American Forest and Paper Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the National Grange. 
   Just as important, let me point out that 133 House sponsors of the last year's House passed bill were former state and local officeholders. I do not believe that they would have voted for the bill if the bill would conflict with local sovereignty. 
   Mr. President, we have bent over backwards trying to accommodate those expressing concerns about the bill which passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. We met with city mayors, representatives of local governmental organizations, attorneys generals, and religious groups, to name just a few. 
   We held group meetings and asked for suggestions and changes to the bill which would alleviate opposition and concerns. These changes are incorporated in the present bill. These changes by and large alleviate municipalities' concerns that the bill would become a vehicle for frivolous and novel suits. They remove any incentive the bill may have for property owners to file specious suits against localities. They foster negotiations to resolve problems. And, they recognize the right of the states and localities to abate nuisances without having to pay compensation. 
   But I am under no illusion. I understand that many localities still oppose the bill. The process that we so fruitfully began last year should be continued. It is my hope that groups supporting property rights and those localities and governmental entities that oppose the bill should meet as soon as practicable. Let each side discuss their problems and concerns. I believe--in the best tradition of American pragmatic know how--that a solution to this problem can be worked out. 
   The bill I introduce today is a model. But it is a model that can be improved. I assure all those concerned that we will consider all reasonable suggested changes to the bill. After all, it is not pride of authorship that is important. What is important, instead, is a viable solution to a vexing and unfair problem.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to my colleague and I appreciate his efforts. 
   Before I move into the substance of Senator LEAHY's substitute, which is essentially an amendment, I note that we have had very little time to study and consider this amendment. We saw this amendment, which is 211 pages long, for the first time yesterday. The Senate has held no hearings--none whatsoever--on this amendment, nor has the amendment ever been referred to the committee as a bill or otherwise. Consequently, not only has the Senate  not considered Senator LEAHY's substitute, no outside groups in law enforcement or the juvenile justice communities have had the opportunity to examine this amendment. Having said that, that doesn't mean we should not consider it at this time. 
   By contrast, the Judiciary Committee has worked on S. 254 and its predecessor, S. 10, for more than 2 years. The Youth Violence Subcommittee, under the leadership of Senators SESSIONS and BIDEN, has held numerous hearings on S. 254 and its predecessor. These hearings have examined S. 254 from different angles and perspectives. A variety of experts have testified in favor and in detail about this bill. S. 254 is the most thoroughly considered juvenile crime legislation in my 23 years in the Senate and service on the Judiciary Committee and it has bipartisan support, as we saw yesterday on the vote. 
   Senator BIDEN, the ranking member of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, one of the leading Senators on crime issues, supports S. 254. We appreciate the efforts he has made. Moreover, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Boy and Girl Scouts, and the National Collaboration for Youth, among other organizations, have examined S. 254 in detail. These groups have written letters of support for S. 254. Needless to say, these groups have not endorsed Senator LEAHY's substitute, because they have not had a chance to consider the amendment. 
   I don't mean to imply that this substitute does not contain some good proposals. In certain ways it is similar to S. 254. For example, I commend Senator LEAHY for including funds for juvenile prosecution and drug treatment, but funding for these purposes is already in S. 254. In fact, virtually every basic fund for prevention is in S. 254. Also, this substitute changes procedural reforms to the Federal prosecution of juveniles that are very similar to S. 254, the bill before the Senate. Again, we address this area in the underlying bill. 
   In particular, the substitute contains a reverse waiver that allows Federal district court judges to reverse any Federal prosecutor's decision to prosecute a juvenile as an adult. Under both S. 254 and Senator LEAHY's substitute, the juvenile defendant must prove by ``clear and convincing evidence'' that he or she should not be tried as an adult. 
   In short, there is much in the Leahy substitute that Senators will have the opportunity to vote for when we pass S. 254. 
   Despite some positive provisions, the Leahy substitute is, in my opinion, badly flawed. For example, the Leahy substitute changes the provision to encourage and assist States to upgrade and share juvenile criminal records. One of the major features of our juvenile justice bill is improving criminal records sharing--I might add, that is a uniquely Federal role--but 
   the Leahy amendment does not improve juvenile records in a meaningful way. It would effectively strike the provisions governing the upgrading and improving of juvenile felony records. This is an important part of our bill. We found that if we don't keep these records, people don't realize when violent juveniles reach the age of maturity, or of majority, they don't realize what these young people may have done with regard to violence in their youth. 
   In addition, the Leahy substitute is not a balanced approach toward the accountability program. It provides only $150 million for accountability programs, such as graduated sanctions and detention for juveniles, out of an annual authorization of $1.86 billion in that bill, in that substitute. In other words, only 8.9 percent of the total funding goes to accountability programs. We all want prevention, but accountability is important, too. I have worked long and hard to remedy what some have thought in the past to be a failure to have enough prevention in these bills, as we are concerned about accountability. So we have made those changes on S. 254 to try to make this a more bipartisan bill for all Members to support. 
   We need to support and encourage a full range of graduated sanctions from the earliest acts of delinquent behavior to help ensure that early acts of delinquency do not grow into more serious problems. 
   This chart indicates that the earliest acts of delinquent behavior start at age 7, the green line. That is the average age where behavioral problems really come into focus and start with young people. They continue to grow worse as they get older if there is no effective intervention. The underlying bill, unlike my colleague's substitute, recognizes this and addresses it thoroughly. 
   Although we showed this chart yesterday, it is worthwhile going over it again and again. People need to understand the history and the probabilities of misbehavior by young people. Minor problems of misbehavior generally start at age 7, usually because of broken families or the lack of a father in the home, with the mother doing her best to try to help the children but having to work generally or, if not working, on welfare. It starts then. It isn't necessarily the child's fault. So we need to do what we can to intervene at that time when we have some of these minor behavior problems. 
   That includes both correction and enforcement. 
   Now, moderately serious problem behavior really starts gaining focus at 9.5 years. As a child grows to 9.5 years old, if that child has not been helped between 7 and 9.5, you start to get moderately serious problem behavior. 
   Then it becomes serious delinquency by almost 12 years of age, or 11.9 years of age. Then the first court contact generally, for index offenses--in other words, offenses that are quite serious--happens really at about 14.5 years of age. 
   This is important stuff, because we have to balance both sides of this equation, not just prevention but accountability as well. If we do not expect young people to be accountable and we don't put the resources into helping them be accountable, they are going to get to 14.5 years and we are going to be left with a hoped-for prevention that really isn't going to work in many cases. It may work, but we almost guarantee it will work if we can require a certain aspect of accountability during these years of age, 7 to 14.5. 
   That is one of the things we are trying to do in this bill. This is not a partisan bill. This is not a bill that is a triumph of Republican principles over Democrat principles. We have taken the best from both parties and tried to mold it together into a bill that really will work and make a dent in some of these problems that really are despoiling our society. 
   Prevention programs are not effective unless there are some accountability measures to reinforce them. Providing only 8.9 percent for accountability measures is not a balanced approach. S. 254, by contrast, provides approximately 40 percent for accountability programs. We balance the two. 
   By the way, we are spending an extra half billion dollars, if we pass the Leahy substitute, an extra half billion dollars on top of what we are spending, which is a monumental amount of money, over $1 billion, $1.1 billion in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill. It is important we do the accountability aspects of this. 
   On what does Senator LEAHY's amendment propose spending funds? In enforcement, it authorizes rural drug training, grants for State courts and prosecutors, and the Byrne Program. All of these are generally worthy programs, and I commend the Senator for recognizing them. Indeed, I have been a vocal critic of the recent efforts of the Clinton administration to cut funding for some of these very same programs. What of the $200 million the Leahy amendment purports to spend on more police officers in schools? This is in reality just an extension of the existing COPS Program, and it is not targeted at juvenile crime. Some COPS funding can of course be used for school security. In fact, Republicans last Congress, led by Senator CAMPBELL, amended the COPS Program to allow its grants to pay for school security officers. But to call this general reauthorization a program dedicated to cops in schools is a bit inaccurate. 
   What is left of the Leahy amendment? Prevention, which of course we all agree is important, no question about it. The Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment the Senate adopted yesterday increases our bill's commitment to prevention to $547.5 million per year, as this chart indicates.  
   Just so we all understand this, from the juvenile crime prevention standpoint, the funding of the OJJDP prevention programs, you can see that in 1994 we spent $107 million on these juvenile justice delinquency prevention programs--$107 million, which many in that year thought was quite a bit of 
   money. I did not. Senator LEAHY did not. I don't think Senator BIDEN did. But the fact is it was $107 million. 
   We have in 1995 jumped to $144 million, and in 1996 as well. Then in 1997 we went to $170 million; then in 1998, $201.7 million. We have been bringing it up gradually. But look, in our bill we put it up to $267.6 million. As we have gradually worked hard to do, we put it up. Then in our bill, starting in the year 2000, we go all the way up to $547.5 million. We double the money in this bill. That is a lot of money. And we ought to make sure that money works. We should not get into a contest of throwing money at these problems and saying that is going to solve them. 
   We have a balanced bill here that takes care of the accountability aspects, about 40 percent of our bill, and about 60 percent is for prevention. Those green lines, from 2000 through 2004, represent almost $600 million a year on top of other prevention funds we already have in other programs. So it is not as if we are letting prevention down. In fact, we have balanced it so we have both accountability and prevention. 
   I might add, our prevention is more balanced than that in the Leahy amendment. Mr. President, $850 million of Senator LEAHY's amendment's ``juvenile crime prevention'' is focused exclusively on crime prevention. I think that is important, but we do that as well. And $400 million of that funding is not even dedicated to the juvenile drug problem. So that bothers me a little bit, too. We are now working on a juvenile drug bill. 
   Yesterday, we got into a little bit of a hassle on the floor because Senator ROBB and Senator KENNEDY and others wanted to add SAMHSA money, mental health moneys, to this bill. We provide that our prevention moneys can be used for mental health, but we do not try to rewrite in the bill the whole of mental health legislation in this country. We are going to do that later. I will help them do that, because I am as concerned about mental health issues as Senators KENNEDY and ROBB and the others who voted for that. But that is not the purpose of this bill, when we provide that is one of the alternatives, one of the options that State and local governments will have in resolving this. 
   It is the same thing with juvenile crime prevention and drug prevention. We provide for that in this bill. Moreover, this substitute, the Leahy substitute, is not narrowly focused on the problem we should be debating, and that is juvenile crime. Indeed, of the advertised $3.581 billion over 3 years, by my count, only $1.6 billion, or 45.6 percent, is dedicated to addressing juvenile crime. 
   We would like to make this bill be a juvenile justice/juvenile crime bill, and not make it a big social spending bill, when we have other programs that literally can be beefed up for those purposes. I am not necessarily against doing that in other programs, but this bill is balanced and we want to keep it that way. 
   So of the advertised $3.581 billion over 3 years, only $1.6 billion, or 45.6 percent, is dedicated to addressing juvenile crime. My omnibus crime bill, the 21st Century Justice Act, which is S. 899, is a comprehensive approach to our general crime problem. But the bill we are debating today is a juvenile crime bill, and that ought to be our focus, our total focus. If we can pass this bill, we will do more to solve and resolve juvenile crime problems than almost anything we have done in 
   history. That is why it is such an important bill, especially when we have had to go through some of these very difficult times that this country has gone through recently. 
   In short, the Leahy substitute is no substitute for the effective comprehensive approach to juvenile crime proposed in the underlying Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill. So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, as much as it is well intentioned, as much as I respect my colleague. I really do respect my colleague, who works very hard on the Judiciary Committee. I know he is sincere in presenting these matters. But I want this bill to be balanced. I want it to be tough and lean--and work. We have added plenty of money, as you can see. We are jumping those funds dramatically in 1 year to where we have very significant amount of funds. We have doubled them, in essence. 
   There will be people around here, no matter how much money you spend, who will always want to spend more. There comes a time when you have to do what is best under the circumstances and what is right under the circumstances. That is what will get this bill through both Houses of Congress and will do what really needs to be done for our young people in this society who are troubled and who have difficulties and whom we can save if we pass this bill. We can prevent some of the things that have happened in the past that have literally disrupted our society and hurt so many people. 
   Finally, S. 254 is supported by real people who took the time to get involved in juvenile justice. For example, more than a year ago, I received a letter from a woman named Cris Owsley in Sunnyside, WA. She wrote about how her son, Shaun, was knifed to death by a 15-year-old attacker in January of 1997. Shaun was just 2 days past his 18th birthday, and he was murdered at his birthday party. 
   Shaun's parents are courageous people. They took their grief and turned it into activism. Working with other parents and the State legislature, they became advocates for laws that would appropriately punish juveniles like the murderer who killed their son. Then they contacted me and asked what they could do to promote reform nationally. I invited them to Washington last summer where they joined me and others on the Judiciary Committee and numerous law enforcement groups to urge passage of this juvenile crime bill. I am sure they will approve the amendment we adopted yesterday, the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. They have set up a web site to advocate the passage of S. 254. That is how much it means to them and, really, millions of parents across this country. 
   I close my remarks with this exhibit. This box that I have contains more than 1,000 letters in support of S. 254 generated by these folks. These are real people who have endorsed this bill. Given their support, I urge the Senate to reject the Leahy substitute and support S. 254, and let's get this done. I hope we can move this ahead today and get it done today, because the sooner we get this bill passed, the more likely we are going to have greater tools and greater efforts to resolve some of these problems that are tearing our society apart. This is an extremely important bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that will make a difference, and I think we ought to do this as quickly as we can. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HATCH. And you can reemphasize it, if you could. 
   Look, one of the things that has always bothered me about Washington, and especially the Congress of the United States, is no matter how much money you put up that is reasonable, there is always going to be somebody who says we have to spend a lot more. Generally, it does come from the other side of the floor. 
   In this particular case, we have just shown you how we double the prevention moneys for the next 5 years, each year, over what they are today and how they have gone up. They will go up about five times what they were in 1994. 
   Now look, today, before this bill passes, let me show you the imbalance in the law right now. We are spending $4.4 billion on juvenile prevention programs--117 programs. That is what we are spending. That is going to be spent whether this bill passes or not. 
   We are going to add another $547 million to that. It will bring it up to about $5 billion that we are spending on juvenile prevention. 
   One of the problems I have with the amendment of Senator LEAHY--he says it is not a substitute. That is fine. But one of the problems I have with his amendment is he is only spending 8.9 percent on the accountability side of the equation, where we spend 40 percent in our bill. 
   Look how much we are currently spending: zero dollars for juvenile law enforcement or accountability. You wonder why kids are in trouble today. We made the case. The troubles begins at age 7; they escalate until age 14 1/2 , when it is too late, and they then go to court. That is what accountability is going to do. It will help to make them accountable up to age 14 1/2 , and hopefully the prevention moneys will work then, because you will have both sides of the scale, admittedly not an awful lot for accountability in comparison, but we will have accountability money and we will have even more prevention money. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, who has made this case over and over. 
   But what never ceases to amaze me is, whatever money we put in these programs, there is always going to be someone who wants to spend a lot more. The point we make is there is a lot more there now, and we are going to add a lot more. And we do not need to add $400 million for each year for the next 5 years. 
   Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like briefly to respond to the distinguished minority leader's comments. I agree with the Senator from South Dakota that we need long term solutions to the problem of youth violence. S. 254, a comprehensive package designed to combat youth violence through multiple approaches--like prevention and accountability programs--is a long term, but flexible, approach to assist the States in curbing youth violence. 
   My colleagues across the aisle want more funding dedicated to prevention programs, despite the funding increases approved yesterday in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. In addition, the Federal government, according to a 1999 GAO study, spends over $4 billion annually on 117 prevention programs. The Robb amendment was wisely tabled, since it added an additional $1 billion to Federal programs that already exist. S. 254 and the pending Republican amendments already address programs to steer youth away from a life of crime. For instance, S. 254 has a unique mentoring program that utilizes college age adults and retired couples that are matched to troubled juveniles and their families. By giving the juveniles proper guidance, communities can prevent youngsters from choosing to commit crime. 
   Furthermore, although there were some similar provisions between the Leahy substitute amendment and the underlying bill, the devil is always in the details. Upon close inspection, this amendment was not an adequate substitute for the most thoroughly considered juvenile crime legislation in my 23 years in the Senate. 
   First, the Leahy amendment duplicated programs that are already in S. 254. My bill gives the Attorney General greater discretion to prosecute violent juvenile offenders that commit Federal crimes in adult court, and streamlines the process to do so. S. 254 already has a flexible accountability block grant that provides funding for a system of graduated sanctions to hold violent and repeat offenders responsible for the crimes inflicted on their victims. Since S. 254 provides a comprehensive package to fight juvenile violent crime, the Fraternal Order of Police supports the bill. 
   Second, the Leahy amendment was not narrowly focussed on the problem we should be debating--juvenile crime. Indeed, of the advertised $3.581 billion over three years price tag, by my count only $1.632 billion, or 45.6 percent, is dedicated to addressing juvenile crime. In the law enforcement category, the imbalance is even more startling. Of the $1.684 billion the amendment claimed to spend on juvenie crime law enforcement, only $150 million, or 8.9 percent, is targeted at reducing juvenile crime.  
   This $150 million is for juvenile and violent offender incarceration. I certainly agree with Senator LEAHY that we need to provide assistance to States and local governments for secure juvenile detention. But, we need to fully support and encourage a full range of graduated sanctions from the earliest acts of delinquent behavior, to help ensure that early acts of delinquency do not grow into more serious problems. According to the OJJDP, the earliest acts of delinquent behavior start at age seven, and continue to get worse if there is no effective intervention. S. 254, unlike my colleague's amendment, recognizes this, and addresses it. 
   So what did the Leahy amendment propose spending funds on? In the enforcement area, it reauthorizes Rural Drug Enforcement and Training, grants for state courts and prosecutors, and the Byrne program. Now, all of these are generally worthy programs. Indeed, I have been a vocal critic of recent efforts by the Clinton Administration to cut funding for some of these same programs. And my crime bill, the 21st Century Justice Act (S. 899) is a comprehensive answer to our general crime problem. But the bill we are debating today is a juvenile crime bill, and that should be our focus. 
   And what of the $200 million the Leahy amendment purports to spend on more police officers in schools? This is, in reality, just a two year reauthorization of the existing COPS program. Some COPS funding can, of course, be used for school security. In fact, I supported the bill by Senator CAMPBELL we enacted last Congress to amend the COPS program to allow its grants to pay for school security officers. But to call this general reauthorization a program dedicated to cops in schools is a bit inaccurate. 
   What is left of the Leahy amendment then? Prevention. Which, of course, we all agree is important. The Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment the Senate adopted yesterday increases our bill's commitment to prevention to $547.5 million per year. And, I might add, our prevention is more balanced than that in the Leahy amendment. $850 million of the Leahy amendment's ``juvenile crime prevention'' is focussed exclusively on drug prevention. And $400 million of that funding isn't even dedicated to the juvenile drug program, which I agree is in dire need of attention. 
   In short, the prior Democratic amendments are no substitute for the effective, comprehensive approach to juvenile crime proposed in the underlying Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill. This bill, and the amendments we will offer, address our juvenile crime problem in four key areas. These include:

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I first want to commend Senator BROWNBACK for his initiative to curb the exposure of our youth to violence. I recognize that as early as last year Senator BROWNBACK and I, and I have to add my dear friend from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, and others, had developed legislation designed to encourage television broadcasters to join forces and develop a code of conduct for responsible programming. That legislation is part of the amendment being offered today, and it addresses the broader concern that our children are exposed to too much violence, too much obscenity, and too much filth--whether through television, in movies, in modern music, or in video games. 
   Let me say for the record that I hope that as the new V-chip is implemented in televisions, our concern for the pervasive exposure of children to violence on the tube will be alleviated. 
   Again, I commend my colleague for his leadership in efforts to encourage the broadcast media to exercise responsibility. I commend my colleague from Connecticut as well. They have been two great leaders on these subjects. There are others who deserve credit as well. 
   Mr. President, I do not take the floor to attack the entertainment industry. It is well known that I work very closely with people in the entertainment industry, trying to make sure that their intellectual property needs are taken care of, and others as well. Indeed, it is just one part of a more complex problem. I do hope we can encourage the industry to work with us to do what is best for our children in America. 
   As my colleagues know, I have long supported the creative industry, as evidenced by continued efforts to ensure strong intellectual property rights that protect the creative products of these industries. 
   Why can't this industry, which is a source of so much good in America, do more to discourage the marketing of filth to children? Why shouldn't the industry help fight the marketing of violence to young people? 
   Study after study indicates that prolonged exposure of children to ultra-violent movies and video games increases the likelihood for aggression and aggressive conduct on their part. As President Clinton noted in his radio address last week, the two juveniles who committed the atrocities in Littleton played the ultra-violent video game Doom--that is this right here--the ultra-violent video game Doom obsessively, over and over and over. In addition, the 14-year-old boy who killed three in the Paducah, KY, school killing in 1997 was also an avid video game player. In fact, the juvenile had never fired a pistol before he accurately shot eight classmates. 
   Let me give one typical example of how these games are advertised. This chart back here is a page from a video game company's web site. It is promoting a new video game called Turok 2--Seeds of Evil. This ad describes this game as--if you can read those words--``the undeniably, certifiably el numero uno death match Frag fest because we know what you want.'' 
   Now, this last sentence bears repeating: ``Because we know what you want.'' The ad describes ``over 24 devastating weapons'' and exclaims that players may ``unload twin barrels of ricocheting shotgun shells'' and ``blow enemies clean away'' with the scorpion launcher. And worst of all, it urges players to ``send brains flying'' with something the gamemakers call a ``skull drilling cerebral bore.'' 
   How much more graphic can this get? They emphasize how ``real'' the games are, too, with ``real-time flinch generation.'' ``Enemies flinch and spasm differently, depending on which body part you hit.'' Absent here is any realistic depiction of the consequences of real violence. This is just one example of the irresponsibility of these games being marketed and accessible to our kids. It is pathetic when you stop and think about it. 
   I might add, given there is evidence that extremely violent or otherwise unsuitable material in movies, music, and video games have negative effects on children, many are concerned about how these products are marketed and sold. Do these industries specifically target products to minors that, according to their own guidelines, are unsuitable to minors? I think the American people deserve an answer to that question. 
   As I testified before the Senate Commerce Committee last week, I was troubled to learn that according to the National Institute on Media and the Family, some manufacturers of video and computer games are marketing ultraviolent video games rated for adults only to children. In 1998, the National Institute on Media and the Family conducted a thorough study of the video and computer game industry. Some of the findings were very disturbing. For example, lurid advertisements for violent video games are aimed directly at children. The advertisement for the video game Destrega states: ``Let the slaughter begin,'' while the advertisement for the video game Carmageddon states: ``As easy as killing babies with axes.'' These and similar advertisements appeared in recent gaming magazines that are targeted to teenagers. 
   Moreover, an advertisement for Resident Evil 2, a violent video game rated for adults only, was featured in the magazine Sports Illustrated for Kids. Few people would argue that cigarettes, alcohol, or X-rated, or NC-17 rated movies should be advertised in children's magazines. Why should such violent video games--games the industry itself has found unsuitable for children--be advertised and marketed to children? I think we need an answer to that. 
   Nor is the problem of marketing violence to children limited to video games. In recent years, the lyrics of popular music have grown more violent and depraved. And much of the violence and cruelty in modern music is directed toward women. 
   Here is one of the recent violent things. This is Eminem, and it is directed, in large measure, toward violence and cruelty toward women. 
   As Senator BROWNBACK noted on the floor two weeks ago, the group Nine Inch Nails had a commercial success a few years ago with a song celebrating the rape and murder of a woman. This is not an isolated example. Hatred and violence against women in mainstream hip hop and alternative music are widespread and unmistakable. Consider the singer Marilyn Manson, whom MTV named the ``Best New Artist of the Year'' last year. Some of Manson's less vulgar lyrics include: ``Who says date rape isn't kind''; ``let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out''; and ``the housewife I will beat, the pro-life I will kill.'' Other Manson lyrics cannot be repeated here on the Senate floor. 
   The weekend after the Colorado shootings, a 12-year-old boy whom I know, bought a Marilyn Manson compact disc from a local Washington area record store, even though it was rated for adult content. Ironically, the warning label on the disc was covered by the price tag. Here is the disc, and here is the way the warning label was covered. The tag covered the warning label, clearly 
   making it easier for kids to buy these products. This indicates that these record warnings are not being taken seriously. Consider Eminem, which I mentioned before, the hip hop artist featured frequently on MTV who recently wrote ``Bonnie and Clyde''--a song in which he described his killing his child's mother and dumping her body into the ocean. Many of his songs contain violent, troubling lyrics with the misogynistic message. 
   Despite historic bipartisan legislation by the State and Federal governments, it is stunning how much modern music glorifies acts of violence, sexual and otherwise, against women.  This music is what many children are listening to. This music is marketed to our youth, and we should not ignore the fact that violent misogynistic music may ultimately affect the behavior and attitudes of many young men toward women. 
   One might argue that these groups are not embraced by the entertainment industry. How, then, would the industry explain a 1998 Grammy nomination for Nine Inch Nails and a 1999 nomination for Marilyn Manson? It is one thing to say these people can't produce this material; it is another thing for the industry to embrace it. 
   Many Americans were justifiably outraged when it was discovered that tobacco companies marketed cigarettes to children. I believe we should be equally concerned if we find that violent music and video games are being marketed to children. Limiting access to ultraviolent music and video games to children does not raise the same constitutional concerns that a general prohibition on such material would entail. 
   For example, while some can reasonably contend that the first amendment protects certain X-rated material, no one can reasonably argue that the Constitution prohibits restricting such material to children. 
   Now, that is why one provision of this amendment--a provision I developed with Senators LIEBERMAN, HARKIN, and KOHL--directs the FTC and the Department of Justice to examine the extent to which the motion pictures, recording, and video game industries market violent, sexually explicit, or other harmful and unsuitable material to minors--including whether such content is advertised or promoted in media outlets in which minors comprise a substantial percentage of the audience. 
   The report will also examine the extent to which retailers, and in the case of motion pictures, theater owners, have policies to restrict the sale, rental, or admission of such unsuitable material to minors--and whether the industry requires, monitors, or encourages the enforcement of their respective voluntary rating systems by retail merchants or theater owners. 
   Mr. President, I do want to note that over the years each of these industries has taken some positive steps in developing voluntary labeling systems that provide notice to parents about unsuitable content of certain products. 
   But as I have said before, it is important to see if such standards are enforced at the retail stage, and also see if, despite their standards, the industry targets unsuitable materials to minors. 
   I also want to take a few moments to discuss another provision of this amendment that provides a limited antitrust exemption to the industry in order to empower them to develop effective enforcement procedures for their voluntary guidelines. This provision is different from the provision developed by Senator BROWNBACK, which relates to the development of a code of conduct. 
   For years, I and others in Congress have searched for solutions for limiting the negative impact exposure to violent or sexually explicit content--whether in motion pictures, television, songs, or video games--has on our children. This provision of the amendment is designed to achieve this objective by empowering the respective industries to develop and enforce responsible guidelines without the fear of liability under our antitrust laws. It will allow manufacturers and producers to agree among themselves to refuse to sell their products to retail outlets who do not follow the industry's standards and guidelines--if the industry chooses to do that. 
   Mr. President, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am mindful of the first amendment concerns that could be raised by attempts on the part of the Federal Government to broadly regulate content, on the Internet or over the other media. But I do believe that we must do what we can do to promote responsibility on the part of the film industry, the recording industry and the entertainment software industry in meeting the needs of children. This amendment does that. 
   Over the years each of these industries has taken positive steps in developing voluntary rating systems that either provide notice to parents about unsuitable content of certain products, or attempt to restrict the sale of unsuitable products to adults or mature audiences. Unfortunately, it appears that adequate and effective enforcement of these guidelines at the retail level is lacking. For instance, there is little enforcement effort that ensures children under the age of 17 are in fact prohibited from viewing NC-17 rated movies--or that children are not allowed to purchase music or video games which are purportedly intended for sale to adults. The inquiry by the FTC and DOJ directed by this amendment will further be helpful in this regard. 
   I believe that the enforcement of the voluntary standards is necessary to make the system work. Proper enforcement will protect the integrity of the overall self-regulatory system. If the industry chooses to exercise responsibility and refuse to sell its product to a retailer who does not follow the industry code of conduct, it should be able to do so--without the fear of antitrust laws. 
   Here is how this provision of the amendment works: to the extent that the antitrust laws might preclude the motion pictures, recording or video game industries from developing guidelines and procedures for their respective industries to limit the sale of unsuitable material to children, this amendment fixes that. It provides industry with limited fixes that. It provides industry with limited exemption from the antitrust laws in order to give them the freedom to develop and enforce voluntary enforcement mechanisms without the fear of antitrust liability or government regulation. 
   But with this amendment I hope to encourage industry to limit the sale to minors of material, whether it is music, movies, or video games, which the industry itself deems unsuitable for children. 
   Again, it is important to underscore that this provision does not tell industry to do or not to do anything. It simply gives them the power to join forces in order to develop enforcement mechanisms without the risk of liability under the antitrust laws.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the proposal, the Democratic proposal to heavily regulate firearms at gun shows, while well intentioned, is an example of regulatory overkill. 
   First, the proposal would require a law-abiding gun show organizer to notify Federal and State law enforcement prior to holding a gun show, and require substantial recordkeeping and reporting before and after the show. But gun shows are not conducted in a secret black market. They are publicly advertised for weeks in advance in order to generate public participation. 
   Second, the proposal would require individuals to sell through a licensed dealer in order to obtain the background check and other information. While obtaining a background check is a laudable goal, requiring an individual to pay a dealer for the service could be cost prohibitive to a lawful business transaction. So that is a matter of great concern. 
   The Republican proposal provides for a ``special registrant'' at a gun show that any nonlicensed seller can use to conduct a background check on the instant check system. This cost-effective mechanism will prevent any unlawful sales without unduly burdening a lawful transaction with regulatory costs. Thus, I must oppose the amendment to heavily regulate gun shows because it is overly burdensome on law-abiding sellers. 
   I strongly support the amendment filed by my colleague, Senator CRAIG, which will provide for increased safety and licensing of firearm sales at gun shows. This amendment contains several provisions that will make it more difficult for criminals to purchase firearms at gun shows, but this amendment allows law-abiding citizens to continue to buy and sell legal products. 
   First, the Craig amendment will provide for ``special registrants,'' who may conduct background checks for individual sellers at a gun show using the instant check system. These checks will prevent criminals from purchasing a firearm from another individual, an unlicensed seller at a gun show. It will also provide an inexpensive and efficient means to facilitate the lawful  sale of a firearm by one individual to another. 
   Second, this amendment will provide for special licenses for persons who want to buy and sell guns primarily or solely at gun shows. This will allow occasional sellers, such as gunsmiths, to avoid the expense and regulation of becoming full-fledged Federal firearms licensees. 
   Third, the Craig amendment will prohibit Federal and State law enforcement officials from charging a fee to conduct a background check on the instant check system. This would reduce the cost of criminal background checks to individuals. 
   Fourth, the Craig amendment would encourage the use of the instant check system by granting civil liability protection to those who use it at gun shows. Given the litigation climate we are currently experiencing, this will be a strong incentive to use the ``special registrant'' provision of this amendment. 
   In short, this amendment will promote background checks on sales by nonlicensed individuals at gun shows without an undue financial burden. It will prevent crime without punishing law-abiding citizens. So, accordingly, I do believe this amendment deserves support. 
   I respect the distinguished Senator from Idaho. In fact, I respect both Senators on the Democrat side and the Senator from Idaho for trying to resolve these difficult problems. But I do believe that the amendment of the Senator from Idaho resolves this problem in a more fair and reasonable manner while accomplishing just as much as the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is trying to do with his amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this next amendment along with Senator LEAHY, my friend and colleague, which I have developed with the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY. This amendment is largely aimed at limiting the negative impact to children from violence and indecent material on the Internet. 
   At the outset, let me note this amendment does not regulate content. Instead, it encourages the larger Internet service providers to provide, either  for free or at a fee not exceeding the cost to the ISP, the Internet service provider, filtering technologies that would empower parents to limit or block access of minors to unsuitable material on the Internet. 
   We cannot place all the blame for today's culture of violence on the Internet. But we also cannot ignore the fact that this powerful new medium has the ability to expose children to violent, sexually explicit, and other inappropriate materials with no limits, not even the time-of-broadcast limits that are currently imposed on television broadcasters. Indeed, a recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 believed the Internet is partly responsible for crimes like the Columbine High School shootings. 
   This amendment respects the first amendment of the Constitution by not regulating content, but ensures that parents will have the adequate technological tools to control the access of their children to unsuitable material on the Internet. 
   Let me say that many Internet subscribers already have such tools provided to them free of charge. For example, the largest Internet service provider currently provides its 17 million subscribers with such filtering technology as part of their standard service. 
   I honestly believe that other ISPs, or Internet service providers, who do not already provide filtering software to their subscribers will do so voluntarily. They will know it is in their best interests and that the market will demand it. That is why this amendment will not go into effect if, within 3 years, the service providers end up offering such technologies voluntarily. 
   This is what we would like to do. We think it is a fair amendment. We think it is something that should be done, and we think responsible Internet service providers should be willing to do this, and I am very, very pleased to offer this with my esteemed colleague who has worked very, very hard on all software Internet issues.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will begin consideration of the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. 
   There are few issues that will come before the Senate this Congress that touch the lives of more of our fellow Americans than our national response to juvenile crime. Crime and delinquency among our young people is a problem that troubles us in our neighborhoods, in our schools and in our parks. It is the subject across the dinner table, and in those late night, worried conversations all parents have had at one time or another. The subject is familiar--how can we prevent our children from falling victim--either to crime committed by another juvenile, or to the lure of drugs, crime, and gangs? 
   Their concerns are shared by all of us. Most of us are parents. Many of us are now proud grandparents. We have dealt with the challenges of raising children--the joys and the trying times. But for today's parents, the challenges they face are more complex. The temptations children confront come from many different directions and parents seemingly have less and less control over what it is their children are exposed to. 
   There is a sense among many Americans that we are powerless to reverse this trend, that we are powerless to deal with violent juvenile crime, that we are powerless to change our culture. It is this feeling of powerlessness which may restrain our collective ambition for meaningful, penetrating solutions in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. As Dr. William Bennett said recently on a national talk show, if the two students who committed the murders at Columbine High had ``carried Bibles and [said] Hail the Prince of Peace and King of Kings, they would have been hauled into the principal's office.'' Instead, these young people who committed these crimes saluted Hitler and they were ignored. Ironically, it seems the only time we promote morality in school these days is when mourners  visit on-school memorials in the wake of tragedies like Littleton. 
   If the murder of twelve innocent students and one teacher cannot give us the backbone to shed this defeatism and to do what is right, then we are doomed to see more tragedies. I believe that as a nation we must do more--and expect more--from our schools, the entertainment industry, our juvenile justice systems, and--where appropriate--the Department of Justice. We must also do more to empower parents in the raising of their children and help the States reform our juvenile justice systems. 
   True--the tragedy in Littleton was a bizarre and complex crime. For that reason, we should resist the temptation to claim we have all of the answers. And we should also fight the temptation to play politics with the matter. We should examine this and other acts of school violence and not single out one politically attractive interest as a cause. 
   Yet, we must also do more than simply talk about the problem. Accordingly, I along with several of my colleagues have developed--and will advance this week--a comprehensive legislative plan to respond to the problem of violent juvenile crime. Our Youth Violence Plan contains four main components: 
   No. 1, prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local government; 
   No. 2, parental empowerment and stemming the influence of cultural violence; 
   No. 3, getting tough on violent juveniles and those who commit violent crimes with a firearm; and 
   No. 4, providing for safe and secure schools. 
   Allow me to discuss each of these in more detail: 
   No. 1, prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local government: The first tier of this plan involves passage of the measure we are beginning consideration of today--S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender and Accountability Act. We believe we should provide a targeted infusion of funds to state and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. S. 254 provides $1 billion a year to the States to fight juvenile crime and prevent juvenile delinquency. We need to reach out to young children early in life, ensure that parents are empowered to do what they believe is best for their children, and take meaningful steps to give local education and enforcement officials the tools they need to hold violent juveniles accountable. I will discuss the underlying bill in greater detail shortly. 
   No. 2, parental empowerment and stemming the influence of cultural violence: The second tier of our plan involves steps Congress should take to empower parents, educators and the entertainment industry to do more to limit the exposure of America's children to violence in our popular culture. We plan to offer several amendments to the underlying bill which will further this leg of our plan. For example, parents should be given the power to screen undesirable material from entering their homes over the Internet. I have an amendment I will offer to this bill which does just that. Senator BROWNBACK's hearings on marketing violence to children provided powerful evidence of the exposure of children to violence in music, movies, and video games. He and I plan to offer a measure to give the entertainment industry the tools it needs to develop and enforce pre-existing ratings systems so that children are not exposed to material that the industry itself has deemed unsuitable for children. 
   In recent years, the movies our children watch have become increasingly violent. The video games they play reward virtual killings. The lyrics of popular music have grown more violent and depraved. And much of the violence and cruelty in modern music and cinema is directed toward women. 
   The President of the Motion Picture Association of America, Jack Valenti, is a man of great intellect and a man who I admire. He recently testified at a hearing that, ``I do earnestly believe that the movie/TV industry has a solemn obligation ..... [to engage in] creative 
   scrutiny.'' He also notes that the industry has ``a duty to inform parents about film content.'' I agree with him and commend the industry for some of the steps they have taken. But I believe the entertainment industry's ``obligation'' and ``duty'' go a bit further. Indeed, what good is a ratings system if it is not enforced? Is the industry fulfilling its obligation to parents if, out of one side of its mouth, it take steps to inform parents that a particular video game, movie, or CD is not suitable for children and then, out of the other side of its mouth, advertises, promotes, and sells this same material to children? 
   Let me be clear. I am not standing here arguing that this filth should be banned or regulated by the government. I simply believe we should limit our young people's exposure to it. It is one thing to say that Marilyn Manson or Eminem should be prohibited from producing their material. It's another thing for Congress to condone the entertainment industry's embracing of this garbage and its sale to children. 
   Exposure to violent and depraved material is just one part of a complex problem. But I do hope that we can encourage the industry to work with us to do what is best for our children. Why can't this industry, which is a source for so much good in America, do more to discourage the production and marketing of filth to children? Why shouldn't the industry help fight the marketing of violence to young people? This week, I intend to give them the opportunity to do more. 
   No. 3, getting tough on violent juveniles and enforcing existing law: A third tier of our plan insures that violent juveniles--teenagers who commit violent crimes--will be held accountable. Part of the solution is to insure that when a teenager brings a gun to school, he or she is held accountable by the criminal justice system. The Administration--and several of my colleagues--have called for more gun control. I plan to offer and support many of the proposals that have been discussed. I support the extension of the Youth Handgun Safety Act to semi-automatic rifles. Indeed, the Republican bill before the Senate contains reforms like the juvenile Brady provision--a measure which will prohibit firearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. Republicans have been fighting for this provision for years, but the Administration has, until recently, largely ignored our efforts. 
   The test for the Senate over the coming days will be whether we choose to play politics with the gun issue or work in a bipartisan manner to insure that access to firearms by juveniles is tightly controlled and that the laws are fully enforced. You see, we need to remember that it seems the Clinton Justice Department has trouble prosecuting violations of existing gun laws, especially gun crimes committed at school or involving minors. Arguably, we should not simply rush to enact more gun control--some of which cannot even be remotely associated with the Littleton tragedy--without taking steps to insure that existing federal laws are being enforced. So, we plan to propose legislation to insure that the Department of Justice will walk the walk--not just talk the talk--when it comes to prosecuting violent gun offenders and providing needed funding to the States to build detention facilities for violent and recidivist juvenile offenders. 
   No. 4, safe and secure schools: The fourth tier of our plan revolves around the basic right that all students share--the right to receive the quality education they deserve. Our teachers and students need to know that their schools are safe and that, should they take action to deal with a violent student, the teacher will be protected. Our plan will also promote safe and secure schools, free of undue disruption and violence, so that our teachers can teach and our children can learn. 
   The sad reality is that we can no longer sit silently by as children kill children, as teenagers commit truly heinous offenses, or as our juvenile drug abuse rate continues to climb. In 1997, juveniles accounted for nearly one fifth--18.7 percent--of all criminal arrests in the United States. Persons under 18 committed 13.5 percent of all murders, over 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 30 percent of all robberies, and 50 percent of all arsons. 
   In 1997, 183 juveniles under 15 were arrested for murder. Juveniles under 15 were responsible for 6.5 percent of all rapes, 14 percent of all burglaries, and one third of all arsons. And, unbelievably, juveniles under 15--who are not  old enough to legally drive in any state--in 1997 were responsible for 10.3 percent of all auto thefts. 
   To put this in some context, consider this: in 1997, youngsters age 15 to 19, who are only 7 percent of the population, committed 22.2 percent of all crimes, 21.4 percent of violent crimes, and 32 percent of property crimes. 
   And although there are endless statistics on our growing juvenile crime problem, one particularly sobering fact is that, between 1985 and 1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year olds increased 207 percent. We have kids involved in murder before they can even drive. 
   Cold statistics alone cannot tell the whole story. Crime has real effects on the lives of real people. Last fall, I read an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch 
   by my good friend, crime novelist Patricia Cornwell. It is one of the finest pieces I have read on the effects of and solutions to our juvenile crime problem. 
   Let me share with my colleagues some of what Ms. Cornwell, who has spent the better part of her adult life studying and observing crime and its effects, has to say. She says ``when a person is touched by violence, the fabric of civility is forever rent, or ripped, or breached. .....'' This is a graphic but accurate description. Countless lives can be ruined by a single violent crime. There is, of course, the victim, who may be dead, or scarred for life. There are the family and friends of the victim, who are traumatized as well, and who must live with the loss of a loved one. Society itself is harmed, when each of us is a little more frightened to walk on our streets at night, to use an ATM, or to jog or bike in our parks. And, yes, there is the offender who has chosen to throw his or her life away. Particularly when the offender is a juvenile, family, friends, and society are made poorer for the waste of potential in every human being. One crime, but permanent effects when ``the fabric of civility is rent.'' 
   This is the reality that has driven me to work for the last three years to address this issue. In this effort, I have been joined by a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which last Congress reported comprehensive legislation on bipartisan, two to one vote. 
   Our legislation from last Congress, which S. 254 is modeled after and improved upon in an effort to gain the support of more Democrats, was supported by law enforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers Coalition, as well as the support of juvenile justice practitioners such as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and victim's groups including the National Victims Center and the National Organization for Victims Assistance. S. 254 is enthusiastically supported by law enforcement. It has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers Coalition. Victim's groups including the National Center for Victims of Crime and the National Organization for Victims Assistance support the bill and its pro-victim provisions. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America, undeniably experts in what it takes to prevent juvenile crime and delinquency, has urged passage of S. 254. And the National Collaboration for Youth, which includes a wide array of front-line juvenile crime and delenquency prevention providers such as the American Red Cross, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, the National 4-H Council, the National Network for Youth, and the YMCA and YWCA of the USA, has called S. 254 a ``strong bill'' and praised ``the increasingly balanced emphasis S. 254 places on prevention activities''. 
   Mr. President, allow me to spell out in greater detail the major provisions of this bill--the first tier in our plan to deal with violent juvenile crime. And how it will help reform the juvenile justice system that is failing the victims of juvenile crime, failing too many of our young people, and ultimately, failing to protect the public. 
   First, this bill reforms and streamlines the federal juvenile code, to responsibly address the handful of cases each year involving juveniles who commit crimes under federal jurisdiction. Our bill sets a uniform age of 14 for the permissive transfer of juvenile defendants to adult court, permits prosecutors and the Attorney General to make the decision whether to charge a juvenile offender as an adult, and permits in certain circumstances 
   juveniles charged as an adult to petition the court to be returned to juvenile status. 
   It also provides that when prosecuted as adults, juveniles in Federal criminal cases will be subject to the same procedures and penalties as adults, except for the application of mandatory minimums in most cases. Of course, the death penalty would not be available as punishment for any offense committed before the juvenile was 18. 
   Finally, in reforming the federal system, I believe that we must lead by example. So our bill provides that the federal criminal records of juveniles tried as adults, and the federal delinquency records of juveniles adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses such as murder, rape, armed robbery, and sexual abuse or assault, will be treated for all purposes in the same manner as the records of adults for the same offenses. Other federal felony juvenile criminal or delinquency records would be treated the same as adult records for criminal justice or national security background check purposes. 
   The bill also permits juvenile federal felony criminal and delinquency records to be provided to schools and colleges under rules issued by the Attorney General, provided that recipients of the records are held to privacy standards and that the records not be used to determine admission. 
   Let me assure any who may be concerned that it is not our intent in reforming the federal juvenile code to federalize juvenile crime--indeed, no conduct that is not a federal crime now will be if this reform is enacted. I do not intend or expect a substantial increase in the number of juvenile cases adjudicated or prosecuted in federal court. It is our intent, rather, to ensure that when there is a federal crime warranting the federal prosecution of a juvenile, the federal government assumes its responsibility to deal with it, rather than saddling the states with that burden. 
   Second, at the heart of this bill is an historic reform and reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, the most comprehensive review of that legislation in 25 years. The States--under the leadership of a new breed of young, no-nonsense Governors, like Mike Leavitt of Utah, then-Governor George Allen and current Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia, and Frank Keating of Oklahoma--have for several years have been far ahead of the Federal Government in implementing innovative reforms of their juvenile justice systems. For example, between 1992 and 1996, of the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 48 made substantive changes to their 
   juvenile justice systems. Among the trends in State law changes are the removal of more serious and violent offenders from the juvenile justice system, in favor of criminal court prosecution; new and innovative disposition/sentencing options for juveniles; and the revision, in favor of openness, of traditional confidentiality provisions relating to juvenile proceedings and records. 
   While the States have been making fundamental changes in their approaches to juvenile justice, the Federal Government has made no significant change to its approach and has done little to encourage and reward State and local reform. Thus, the juvenile justice terrain has shifted beneath the Federal Government, leaving its programs an policies out of step and largely irrelevant to the needs of State and local governments. This bill corrects this imbalance between State and Federal juvenile justice policy, and will help ensure that federal programs support the needs of State and local governments. 
   First, our bill reforms and strengthens the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP, of the Department of Justice. The effectiveness of the OJJDP will be enhanced by requiring its Administrator to present to Congress annual plans, with measurable goals, to control and prevent youth crime, coordinate all Federal programs relating to controlling and preventing youth crime, and disseminate to States and local governments data on the prevention, correction and  control of juvenile crime and delinquency, and report on successful programs and methods. 
   And, most important to state and local governments, in the future, OJJDP will serve as a single point of contact for States, localities, and private entities to apply for and coordinate all federal assistance and programs related to juvenile crime control and delinquency prevention. This one-stop-shopping for federal programs and assistance will help state and local governments focus on the problem, instead of on how to navigate the federal bureaucracy. 
   Second, our reform bill consolidates numerous JJDPA programs, including Part C Special Emphasis grants, State challenge grants, boot camps, and JJDPA Title V incentive grants, under an enhanced $200 million per year prevention challenge block grant to the States. The bill also reauthorizes the JJDPA Title II Part B State formula grants. In doing so, it also reforms the current core mandates on the States relating to the incarceration of juveniles to ensure the protection of juveniles in custody while providing state and local governments with needed flexibility. 
   This flexibility is particularly important to rural states, where immediate access to a juvenile detention facility might be difficult. Since many communities cannot afford separate juvenile and adult facilities, law enforcement officers must drive hours to transport juvenile offenders to the nearest facility, instead of patrolling the streets. Another unintended consequence of JJDPA is the release of juvenile offenders because no beds are available in juvenile facilities or because law enforcement officials cannot afford to transport youths to juvenile facilities. Juvenile criminals are released even though space is available to detain them in adult facilities. Our reform will provide the states with a degree of flexibility which currently does not exist. 
   However, this flexibility is not provided at the expense of juvenile inmate safety. The bill strictly prohibits placing juvenile offenders in jail cells with adults. No one supports the placing of children in cells with adult offenders. To be clear--nothing in the bill will expose juveniles to any physical contact by adult offenders. Indeed, the legislation is explicit that, if states are to qualify for federal funds, they may not place juvenile delinquents in detention under conditions in which the juvenile can have physical contact, much less be physically harmed by, an adult inmate. 
   These provisions are largely based on H.R. 1818 from the 105th Congress, but are improved to ensure that abuse of juvenile delinquent inmates is not permitted by incorporating definitions of what constitutes unacceptable contact between juvenile delinquents and adult inmates. 
   Third, and finally, our reform of the JJDPA reauthorizes and strengthens those other parts of the JJDPA that have proven effective. For example, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act are reauthorized and funded. Gang prevention programs are reauthorized. And important, successful programs to provide mentoring for young people in trouble with the law or at risk of getting into trouble with the law are reauthorized and expanded. Operating through the Cooperative Extension Service program sponsored by the Department of Agriculture, the University of Utah has developed a ground-breaking and highly successful program that mentors to entire families--pairing college age mentors with juveniles in trouble or at risk of getting in trouble with the law, and pairing senior citizen couples with the juvenile's parents and siblings. This program gets great bang for the buck. So our bill provides demonstration funds to expand this program and replicate its success in other states. 
   Finally, our bill provides an important new program 
   to encourage state programs that provide accountability in their juvenile justice systems. All or nearly all of our states have taken great strides in reforming their systems, and it is time for the federal government's programs to catch up and provide needed assistance. 
   Despite reforms in recent years, all too often, the juvenile justice system ignores the minor crimes that lead to the increasingly frequent serious and tragic juvenile crimes capturing headlines. Unfortunately, many of these crimes might have been prevented had the warning signs of early acts of delinquency or antisocial behavior been heeded. A delinquent juvenile's critical first brush with the law is a vital aspect of preventing future crimes, because it teaches an important lesson --what behavior will be tolerated. Accountability is not just about punishment--although punishment is frequently needed. It is about teaching consequences and providing rehabilitation to young offenders. 
   According to a recent Department of Justice study, juveniles adjudicated for so-called index crimes--such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, and auto theft--began their criminal careers at an early age. The average age for a juvenile committing an index offense is 14.5 years, and typically, by age 7, the future criminal is already showing minor behavior problems. If we can intervene early enough, however, we might avert future tragedies. Our bill provides a new Juvenile Accountability Block Grant to reform federal policy that has been complicit in the system's failure, and provide states with much needed funding for a system of graduated sanctions, including community service for minor crimes, electronically monitored home detention, boot camps, and traditional detention for more serious offenses. 
   And let there be no mistake--detention is needed as well. Our first priority should be to keep our communities safe. We simply have to ensure that violent people are removed from our midst, no matter their age. When a juvenile commits an act as heinous as the worst adult crime, he or she is not a kid anymore, and we shouldn't treat them as kids. 
   State receipt of the incentive grants would be conditioned on the adoption of three core accountability policies: the establishment of graduated sanctions to ensure appropriate correction of juvenile offenders, drug testing juvenile offenders upon arrest in appropriate cases; and recognition of victims rights and needs in the juvenile justice system. 
   Meaningful reform also requires that a juvenile's criminal record ought to be accessible to police, courts, and prosecutors, so that we can know who is a repeat or serious offender. Right now, these records simply are not generally available in NCIC, the national system that tracks adult criminal records. Thus, if a juvenile commits a string of felony offenses, and no record is kept, the police, prosecutors, judges or juries will never know what he did. Maybe for his next offense, he'll get a light sentence or even probation, since it appears he's committed only one felony in his life instead 10 or 15. Such a system makes no sense, and it doesn't protect the public. 
   So the reform we offer in this bill also provides the first federal incentives for the integration of serious juvenile criminal records into the national criminal history database, together with federal funding for the system. 
   Finally, we all recognize the value of education in preventing juvenile crime and rehabilitating juvenile offenders. When trouble-causing juveniles remain in regular classrooms, they frequently make it difficult for all other students to learn. Yet, removing such juveniles from the classroom without addressing their educational needs virtually guarantees that they will fall further into the vortex of crime and delinquency. The costs are high--to the juvenile, but also to victims and to society. These juveniles too frequently become crime committing adults, with all the costs that implies--costs to victims, and the cost of incarcerating the offenders to protect the public. So our bill tries to break this cycle, by providing a three-year $45 million demonstration project to provide alternative education to juveniles in trouble with or at risk of getting in trouble with the law. 
   The bill we are debating today authorizes significant funding for the programs I have described. In all, our bill authorizes a total of $5 billion in assistance to state and local governments. This breaks down to $1 billion per year for five years, in the following categories: 
   $450 million per year for Juvenile Accountability Block Grants; 
   $435 million per year for prevention programs under the JJDPA, including  $200 million for Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grants, $200 million for Part B Formula grant prevention programs, and $35 million for Gangs, Mentoring and Discretionary grant programs; 
   $75 million per year for grants to states to upgrade and enhance juvenile felony criminal record histories and to make such records available within NCIC, the national criminal history database used by law enforcement, the courts, and prosecutors; and 
   $40 million per year for NIJ research and evaluation of the effectiveness of juvenile delinquency prevention programs. 
   Additionally, the bill authorizes $100 million per year for joint federal-state-local law enforcement task forces to address gang crime in areas with high concentrations of gang activity. $75 million per year of this funding is authorized for establishment and operation of High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas, and the remaining $25 million per year is authorized for community-based gang prevention and intervention for gang members and at-risk youth in gang areas. 
   And, finally, as I have already noted, the bill authorizes $45 million over three years for innovative alternative education programs to make our schools safer places of learning while helping ensure that the youth most at risk do not get left behind. 
   Under the leadership of a crime conscious Republican Congress and the leadership of our nation's governors, we as a nation have seen a decrease in our 
   overall violent crime rate. Consider that since 1995, we have made significant progress against crime--much of it in partnership with public officials like Governors Mike Leavitt of Utah, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, George Pataki of New York and George W. Bush of Texas, and Mayors Rudy Giulianni of New York City and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles. Consider that violent crime is down 18 percent from 1993 to 1997, murders are down 28 percent from 1993 to 1997, and overall crime is down 10 percent from 1993 to 1997. 
   These declines have put a serious dent in our crime rates for the first time since the 1960's. Congress since 1995 has supported the efforts of our state and local officials with legislation that has provided real funding and real solutions to crime, rather than feel-good measures. We cleared out our courts with habeas corpus and prisoner litigation reform. We have added thousands of border guards to stop criminal aliens from entering the country. We have returned billions of the taxpayers' dollars directly to our governors to build prisons and equip our police. Now it is time to address the problem of juvenile crime in the same way--with real solutions and real support to state and local efforts. 
   Meaningful reforms like truth-in-sentencing laws, which replaced the liberal indeterminate sentencing systems with longer and binding sentences for violent, drug, and repeat offenders, zero-tolerance policing, which put law enforcement officers back in our neighborhoods, and habeas corpus reform, which insured death sentences for heinous criminals would be carried out, have all contributed to this improving picture. 
   Yet, in the face of this improving domestic environment, depraved acts of school and related violence by young people are becoming increasingly more commonplace and increasingly 
   more depraved. While overall, juvenile crime may be headed down slightly, juvenile drug use is up and juveniles increasingly account for the violent crime being committed. 
   Our states are responding to this trend. They recognize, as this first chart shows, that the average age of delinquency or problem behaviors for tomorrow's adult violent offenders begins very early in life--with the average age of a first serious offense occurring before the child turns 12 years old. It is this fact--that many of tomorrow's violent crime problems are today's juvenile delinquents--which caused Senator SESSIONS and me to take this issue head-on more than three years ago. 
   This chart shows the average age of the onset of problem behaviors of delinquency in male juveniles for minor problem behavior is 7 years old; moderately serious problem behavior is 9.5 years old; serious delinquency, 11.9 years of age, almost 12; and first court contact for index offenses, 14.5 years old. 
   This is data based on the statements of the oldest sampling in the Pittsburgh Youth Study and on statements made by their mothers. It was also in the OJJDP Juvenile Justice Bulletin, ``Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders,'' in May 1998. 
   I am concerned that the Clinton Administration has been slow to respond and provide assistance. They have failed to enforce the gun laws already on the books and they have sat silently by, failing to endorse our bill because it was too tough on violent juveniles and because it wanted more control over how the monies would be spent. As recently as last week, I offered the Attorney General the opportunity to endorse S. 254 or provide us with her suggested improvements but we have heard nothing. Instead the Administration holds summits which produce nothing in terms of assisting the states. Instead of concrete proposals, the Administration offers the public poll-driven, legislative trinkets. They hold press conferences ``announcing'' as their own industry driven reforms aimed at making the Internet more safe for children. 
   Desperate for something to crticize, I expect the Administration will argue that our bill is short on the prevention-side of the equation--a claim they have to know just doesn't add up. Consider the fact that, under our bill, Justice Department juvenile justice spending will reach unprecedented heights. Since 1994, the Republican Congress has steadily increase funding for OJJDP--from $107 million in FY 94 to $267 million in FY 99. Our bill continues this trend by increasing authorized funding levels over existing appropriations from $267 million to $435 million in FY 2000. 
   So, it is left to the Congress--once again--to step forward to provide the necessary leadership at the federal level. I hope the Administration will see its way clear to do what's right and come out in support of our efforts to help fight juvenile crime. 
   Mr. President, in the face of a confounding problem like juvenile crime and school violence, it is tempting to look for easy answers. It is also tempting to play politics and advance poll-driven, legislative trinkets in lieu of meaningful reform. I do not believe that we should succumb to this temptation. We are faced with a complex problem which cannot be solved solely by the enactment of new criminal prohibitions. It is at its core a problem of our nation's values. But I believe that by parents and communities working together to teach accountability by example, by early intervention when the signs clearly point to violent and antisocial behavior, and by demanding more of our popular culture and industry leaders, we will be taking a postitive step forward. 
   Mr. President, that is what our efforts are all about. Our efforts are a comprehensive approach to this national problem. I hope we can work together to develop a bipartisan solution 
   to these problems as well. 
   To that degree, I appreciate the work of my colleagues, especially Senator SESSIONS, who worked so long and hard on our side, as well as Senator CAMPBELL, who has been very concerned about these juvenile crime issues, and my colleagues on the Democratic side, Senator BIDEN, Senator LEAHY, and others, who are working with us to try to come up with what needs to be done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have $1.1 billion a year in this bill, for law enforcement, for prevention, for safe schools, for parental empowerment. The distinguished Senator from Virginia wants to add each year an additional $1.4 billion on top of that. This is another marathon Federal bureaucratic solution to a local problem. 
   The first title creates a so-called National Resource Center for School Safety to the tune of $100 million. The director of this center is appointed by the head of the Department of Education, the Attorney General, and the head of Health and Human Services. This sounds to me very much like we are creating another Federal agency in a way that is duplicative of what is going on at the State level, something we have been trying to avoid in the whole 2 years we debated the juvenile justice bill. 
   For example, the funds of this center include such things as: 
   No. 1, an emergency response to do such things as helping communities meet urgent needs such as long-term counseling for students, faculty, and family. 
   No. 2, a national anonymous hotline. Many local areas are already establishing hotlines to accept calls from local students and other parties. Why on earth do we need a Federal hotline on top of the local community hotlines, a Federal hotline which is supposed to then relay the urgent messages to the local hotlines and officials? We are going to spend $100 million of taxpayer money in this bill for something already taken care of. Why not help the States establish their own hotlines, if they even need that help? This bill does that. 
   No. 3, training and assistance. This proposal has this new 
   $100 million Federal bureaucracy helping local agencies develop a school safety plan--as if they can't do it themselves. 
   First, most local agencies already have school safety plans and they know how to provide for school safety a lot better than the bureaucrats here in Washington or, I might add, anybody standing or sitting here in the Senate. Most local agencies, since they already have school safety plans, don't need help from us. 
   Second, if a national model is needed, the Department of Education can identify a local education agency's particularly affected plan and send it out to the local jurisdictions so they can carry it out. That way, we have 50 State laboratories or in every school district a State laboratory rather than bureaucrats back in Washington telling us what to do. That ought to cost just a few thousand dollars compared to $100 million provided in this particular instance. 
   No. 4, the new $100 million Federal bureaucracy is supposed to act as a clearinghouse for research and evaluation. This information is readily available on the Internet. We do not need a Federal bureaucracy to administer this. 
   The bottom of this chart lists the number of Federal programs we already have in each of these particular areas: Training and assistance, 62; counseling, 62; research and evaluation, 55; violence prevention, 53; parental and family intervention, 52; support service, 51; substance abuse prevention, 47; planning and program development, 47; self-sufficiency skills, 46; mentoring, 46; job training assistance, 45; tutoring, 35; substance abuse treatment, 26; clearinghouse, 19; and capital improvement, 10. There are similar services in several department and agency programs funded in fiscal year 1998. The source of this information is the General Accounting Office as of 1999. 
   Under title 2 of this amendment, as I read this, this is a marathon new grant program to the tune of $722 million for areas such as educational reform. As you can see, we are already doing that. ``The review and updating of school policies.'' Can you imagine that? Why would anybody want to do this, when the State and local school board directors know exactly what they are doing? Why would we spend $722 million more on this? I might add, ``to review for the review and updating of school policies,'' whatever that means. 
   Title 3 in this bill includes alcohol and drug abuse prevention. That is already part of our bill. We have worked on this for 2 solid years. We have made every dime count and we have added plenty of money for prevention. Better than half of this bill is prevention money. It makes you wonder; you would never be able to outspend some of these people around here. It doesn't make any difference what is in the best interests of taxpayers; it is what is in the best interests of the political people who push these things. 
   Mental health prevention and treatment and early childhood development is something they want to do. This proposal includes a grant to address violence-related stress. Another element includes grants to ``the development of  knowledge on best practices for treating disorders associated with psychological trauma.'' 
   Mr. President, mental health treatment is a very important area and one in which a lot of Members, including myself, have done a lot of work through the years. However, I have a concern about using this bill on school violence for a major new Federal mental health system at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars when we have better than half of the bill now going for prevention purposes. 
   The final title of this bill is a $600 million increase in afterschool programs. I am not categorically opposed to directing more Federal resources to promote afterschool programs. I am concerned that this section is overly bureaucratic. We can better help schools by freeing them up from regulatory hoops. I think that is what we ought to do instead of doing this. 
   I have been around here for 23 years. When committees work 2 solid years on this matter, the way we have, and we work with a leader on crime issues such as Senator BIDEN and with others on the committee in a bipartisan way to come up with prevention moneys that actually exceed the money for law enforcement itself, and do so to the tune of well over a half billion dollars a year, there is no need for this type of amendment which is just ``let's throw money at it'' and call it nice things--general things at that, if you will--even though almost everything this amendment proposes to do we already do in our bill and we do it in a fiscally responsible way and in a fiscally restrained way. 
   I am almost amazed that this amendment has been brought forth. At first I thought I might support it, because I thought they were talking about doing these things within the framework of what we have already done. But when I look at it and read it and understand it, it is just another way of throwing more money and beating our breasts, saying we have done something for prevention in the juvenile justice area when in fact we are doing plenty for prevention. 
   It needs to be known there is already $4 billion in the pipeline on prevention now, without the bill we have brought to the floor, the bipartisan bill we have brought to the floor. Now they want to add another $1.4 billion for these generalized programs that, literally, the States are taking care of in most instances, and if they have not, we have taken care of them in the underlying bill. 
   So I hope my colleagues will vote against this amendment, and at the appropriate time I will make a motion to table. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Fifty-five percent of the $1.1 billion that we already have in this bill--keep in mind there is already $4.4 billion out there for prevention--is for prevention, and one of the major uses, discretionary uses, is mental health. What I do not want to do is create a whole bunch of new bureaucracies back here that are just duplicative with what is already going on. That is where I have my difficulty with what the Senator from Massachusetts does.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there are three of us who are going to speak as proponents of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment: Senator BIDEN, Senator SESSIONS and myself. 
   This amendment contains three major provisions and reflects a hard fought, bipartisan compromise among Senator BIDEN, Senator SESSIONS and myself. It demonstrates that S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, is a bipartisan bill in every sense of the word. 
   Before I describe the amendment, I remind the Senate of other provisions in S. 254 that are also the product of compromise and concession. 
   For example, in title I of the bill we included the reverse waiver provision in section 5032, at Senator LEAHY's request. This provision ensures that Federal district judges have the ultimate authority to decide whether a juvenile is tried as an adult in Federal cases. 
   Another major compromise is the juvenile delinquency challenge grant in title III of the bill. This block grant provides $200 million a year to the States for prevention programs. This provision was included in S. 254 to satisfy demands from some Members for additional funds for prevention programs. 
   Another compromise in S. 254 concerns the juvenile felony records provision. Last year's juvenile crime bill, S.  10, required States to improve and share juvenile felony records in order to qualify for the accountability block grant. At the urging of Senators BIDEN and LEAHY, we removed the recordkeeping provision as a requirement for the accountability block grant. Instead, there is a separate grant for juvenile criminal records for States 
   that choose to upgrade and share their juvenile felony records. 
   The first provision of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment earmarks 25 percent of the accountability block grant in title III for drug treatment and crime prevention programs. These drug treatment funds will complement and reinforce the drug testing provisions in the accountability block grant. 
   In addition, this earmark provides funds for additional prevention programs, such as afterschool activities and gang prevention programs. This amendment, by earmarking 25 percent of the accountability block grant for prevention and drug treatment, demonstrates our commitment to prevention funding and ensures a balanced juvenile crime bill. 
   The second provision of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment provides a $50 million grant to the States to hire prosecutors to prosecute juvenile offenders. The hiring of juvenile prosecutors was a permissible use of grant funds in S. 254 since the bill was introduced. Our amendment merely provides a guaranteed source of funds for State and local prosecutors to target juvenile crime. 
   The third and last provision of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment extends the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund until the year 2005. By extending the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, we will ensure that the Federal Government continues to provide valuable assistance to the States in the war against crime. 
   Programs such as the truth-in-sentencing grant, the local law enforcement block grant, the COPS program, are funded from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. I am proud to propose the extension of this trust fund. 
   I want to personally thank Senator BIDEN for the hard work he has done on this bill and in working with us in a bipartisan and good way. I am very proud to have him on this bill, because he has been a major participant in every crime bill since I have been in the Senate, as have I. I just want to make that clear on the record. 
   I also particularly express my gratitude and appreciation to Senator SESSIONS, the Youth Violence Subcommittee chairman. He has done a great job on this bill, and I believe he has more than earned his spurs with regard to his work on anticrime matters. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 999, the ``Technology Transfer Act of 1999.'' 
   The purpose of this bill is to help ensure that the fruits of federally conducted and supported research will be translated into new products and jobs that can benefit the American public. 
   This bill is necessary in order to adopt a uniform policy across the federal government concerning the circumstances in which it is appropriate to grant an exclusive or partially exclusive license to intellectual property owned by the federal government. Essentially, this legislation codifies the most prudent, beneficial, and successful agency licensing policies that have evolved over the last few years. 
   Each year the federal government makes a substantial investment in research and development. This year the federal government will dedicate about $79 billion toward research and development activities. Of this amount, about half--or $39 billion--is devoted to non-defense research. Much of this civilian R&D funding--over $15 billion in FY 1999--is carried out by universities across our country. 
   Every American citizen should take pride in this considerable financial commitment because it explains why our country is in the forefront in so many areas of basic science and applied technology. 
   While there is intrinsic value in research for the sake of advancement of knowledge, another, more tangible, benefit occurs when the mysteries of science are translated into new technologies that protect and promote the public health and welfare and create jobs. 
   While Utah may be a small state in terms of population, I am proud to say that our universities are carrying out a vigorous program of research. For example, the University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and Utah State University each carry out substantial programs of research and in the aggregate received over $200 million in federal research support in 1998. 
   Last year the research efforts of these three schools resulted in the issuance of patents on 40 inventions. 
   No doubt this high level of financial support and creative activity are major reasons why our state has developed a thriving medical products industry over the last two decades. 
   According to a recent survey of the Utah Life Science Association there are currently 116 firms--employing a total of over 11,000 people--engaged in the discovery and production of biomedical products in the state of Utah. Together, these firms produced revenues of $1.641 billion last year. 
   Not only does this economic enterprise mean jobs for Utahns but also innovative new products for Americans and our neighbors around the world. 
   To give just one example, researchers at the University of Utah were co-discoverers of the BRCA 1 gene which is implicated in certain kinds of breast cancer. A start-up Salt Lake City biomedical research firm, Myriad Genetics, was also a partner in this ground breaking research, as were intramural researchers at the National Institutes of Health. Building upon this basic research, academic researchers at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah and private sector scientists at Myriad are playing a lead role in developing diagnostic tests and therapeutics which are aimed at combating the devastation of breast cancer. 
   The success we have achieved in institutions of higher learning in Utah is also occurring across our Nation. 
   According to the latest data available from the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), in 1997, the efforts of U.S. universities, academic health centers, and certain other non-profit research entities resulted in over 11,000 invention disclosures, over 4,200 new patent applications being filed, and over 2,600 issued patents. 
   Also according to AUTM, in 1997, over 3,300 new licenses were executed and total licensing income reached nearly $700 million. An economic model developed by AUTM estimates that about 250,000 jobs are attributable to commercializing academic research. 
   Government labs have also contributed to this success story. For example, in FY 1998 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) received nearly $40 million in royalty income. Also in 1998, NIH 
   intramural labs reported 287 invention disclosures; filed 132 patent applications; were granted 171 patents; and, executed 215 licenses and 149 cooperative research and development agreements. 
   In sharp contrast to the vibrant research and technology commercialization activities that are taking place in Utah and across our country today, the situation twenty years ago was vastly different. According to a 1978 survey, the federal government owned 78,000 patents but only 5 percent were ever licensed. 
   Research and development is expensive, but it has been estimated that R&D accounts for only about 25% of the cost of bringing a new product to the market. Without adequate protection of intellectual property, it is simply not prudent for the private sector to invest in new technologies. 
   In response to the problem of federally supported science languishing in the laboratory, the Congress passed a portfolio of legislation in the 1980s. 
   The purpose of these measures was simple: to provide incentives in the intellectual property laws to help assure that federally-conducted and -supported research would be commercially developed so that the seeds of new ideas will be translated into the fruits of new products that can benefit the American public. 
   My bill, S. 999, shares this goal and builds upon the previous intellectual property legislation in this area. 
   The ``Patent and Trademark Act Amendments of 1980'' (Public Law 96-517) is commonly termed the Bayh-Dole Act out of the well-earned respect for its two far-sighted cosponsors, Senator Birch Bayh and Senator Bob Dole. 
   The Bayh-Dole Act created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies that fund research and increased incentives for universities to engage in government-supported research. Under the act, small businesses and nonprofit organizations, including universities, were permitted to retain ownership of patents stemming from federal funds. In turn, patent holders could grant licenses to companies to further develop and commercialize the patented invention. 
   In 1986, Congress enacted the ``Federal Technology Transfer Act'' (Public Law 99-502). This law established new patenting, licensing and partnering policies for government laboratories. In concert with the philosophy of the  Bayh-Dole Act, the FTTA contemplates an activist role for government laboratories in assisting in the journey from the laboratory to the market place. The FTTA amended the earlier ``Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980'' (Public Law 96-480), which proved insufficient to meet its intended charge of making transfer of federal technology a duty of all federal laboratories. In addition to mandating a federal role in the technology transfer arena by strengthening the intellectual property laws in the areas of patenting and licensing, the FTTA created and embraced a unique device--the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)--which encourages a government/private sector partnership in the earliest stages of research. 
   In devising S. 999, I have worked closely with several colleagues, most prominently Representative CONNIE MORELLA, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology of the House Committee on Science. Chairman MORELLA, whose district is the home of the National Institutes of Health, has long been a leader in the area of technology policy. Chairman MORELLA and Representative GEORGE BROWN, the thoughtful ranking member of the full Committee have often worked together in a bipartisan manner in this area and are cosponsors of H.R. 209, the House companion to S. 999. 
   In this Chamber, Senator ROCKEFELLER has a long and distinguished record in the area of technology policy. Together with Senator FRIST, Senator ROCKEFELLER introduced similar legislation last Congress and once again this year. 
   I am working with all of these Members, as well as with Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and the Senate and House leadership to secure passage of this important legislation. Working together, I believe that we have succeeded in building upon as well as correcting some problems identified with the legislative proposals made last Congress, S. 2120 and H.R. 2544.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act, together with my colleagues, Senators ROCKEFELLER, CRAPO, and BRYAN. The legislation we introduce today will help to solve one of our Nation's most expensive problems--air pollution. 
   As air pollution was introduced at the beginning of this century, it is fitting that, at century's end, we should find solutions to this vexing problem. 
   Automobiles are a major source of pollution in our urban areas. Past efforts to address this mobile-source pollution have been fraught with pitfalls; and, as a result, the effort to control automobile emissions has progressed in fits and starts. The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act avoids past mistakes, leaving behind command-and-control mandates from Congress and providing market-based incentives for consumers and for much needed infrastructure development. 
   Mr. President, as we speak, my State of Utah is engaged in a mammoth road construction project on Interstate 15. This freeway runs right through Salt Lake City and through three counties in Utah that have struggled to meet national clean air standards. 
   It might suggest that we should not improve or repair highways. Could it be that the availability of convenient and efficient roadways is in part responsible for our emissions problem? I doubt it. While the Eisenhower vision of a vast nation connected by interstate highways may have encouraged more people to commute or vacation by car, the fact is that vehicular traffic is increasing almost everywhere. One-car families have become two-car and three-car families. 
   I do not believe that more cars crowded onto old and inefficient highways is the answer. In fact, slow-moving traffic is part of the problem. 
   According to a recent study by Utah's Division of Air Quality, on-road vehicles account for 22 percent of coarse particulate matter in Utah. Particulate matter can be harmful to those already suffering from chronic respiratory or heart disease, influenza, or asthma. Automobiles also account for 34 percent of hydrocarbon and 52 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions in my state. These two pollutants react in sunlight to form ozone, which in turn reduces lung function in humans and hurts our resistance to colds and asthma. Ozone may also lead to premature aging of lung tissue. In Utah, vehicles account for a whopping 87 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. Carbon monoxide can be harmful to persons with heart, respiratory, or circulatory ailments. 
   Mr. President, while Utah has made important strides in improving air quality, more vehicular miles are driven every year. If we are to have cleaner air, we must encourage low emission alternative fuels or electric power. 
   The need for alternative fuels will dramatically increase as the Environmental Protection Agency continues to implement its new, stricter clean air standards. With the tighter standards, some of Utah's counties will, once again, face non-attainment. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA can impose sanctions on a state's highway fund if it determines a state has not adequately implemented plans to attain air quality standards, a sanction which, as I have suggested, may actually be counterproductive. 
   Nevertheless, non-attainment can be a costly enterprise, whether due to the loss of federal highway money or to the expensive measures taken to reach attainment. And, as I have suggested, may be counterproductive. 
   By the EPA's own estimates, the annual cost of achieving the new ozone standard in 2010 will be about $9.6 billion. Additionally, the EPA puts the annual cost of achieving the PM 2.5 standard at $37 billion, making for a combined total cost of $47 billion annually. Mr. President, our most recent census count estimated that there are 65 million families in the U.S. So, by the EPA's own account, implementing the new air quality standards will cost about $723 per family every year. 
   Wouldn't it be wise, Mr. President, to invest some of that money in the development of alternative fuels? 
   Take natural gas as an example. Natural gas is one of the cleanest burning fuels available. Add to this, methanol, propane has a variety of options that would allow Americans to continue to drive their cars, while dramatically cutting back on air pollution. 
   Mr. President, research has brought us a number of excellent options to replace our dependency on traditional gasoline powered autos. It appears that our last obstacle remains bringing these alternatives to the marketplace. Past efforts to do so have failed to produce the hoped-for results because they have been too heavy on mandates and too weak on incentives to car buyers and to improve infrastructure. 
   Clearly, if consumers are to begin buying alternative fuel 
   vehicles, two elements must be in place: first, the price for vehicles and their fuel must be right; second, the consumer must feel confident that the infrastructure is in place with refueling stations widely available. 
   This is where the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act comes into play. With this legislation, we take important steps forward to meet these goal without mandates. The only requirement in this bill is that federal agencies submit an annual report on their use of alternative fuel vehicles in their fleets.  
   The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act encourages customers to purchase alternative fuels through a tax credit. Congress has already given ethanol users a tax credit of 54 cents per gallon. When adjusted for its energy capacity, ethanol's gasoline-gallon equivalent credit equals 82 cents. Our legislation levels the playing field by extending a 50-cent gasoline-gallon equivalent tax credit for the other alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, natural gas, propane, methanol, and electricity. 
   There currently exists a tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles. Our bill would extend the life of that credit, giving a continued incentive for companies to develop this technology. The current tax credit equals 10 percent of the purchase price of the vehicle, up to $4,000. Our legislation would extend the sunset date for this credit to 2010 and give an additional $5,000 credit toward any electric vehicle with a range over 100 miles. 
   Mr. President, consumers will never be interested in alternative fuel vehicles until a strong infrastructure is developed. Under current law, there is a $100,000 tax deduction for the capital costs of equipment at alternative fuel stations. This legislation extends that benefit to construction and installation costs at a new filling station. Often constructions costs outweigh capital costs as a barrier to the installation of new alternative fuel stations. 
   These measures will jump start a movement already under way toward increased use of alternative fuel vehicles. In California and Arizona there are already about 300 public charging sites for electric vehicles. Utah has led the way in natural gas infrastructure. An owner of a natural gas vehicle can crisscross my state from Logan in the north to St. George in the south, and from Salt Lake to the eastern border finding filling stations all along the way. This is progress, but much more needs to be done. 
   Mr. President, I believe the momentum is building in this nation for a leap forward in the use of alternative fuel vehicles. There is broad agreement that our approach with this legislation is the proper course to help promote this step. In a letter to me, Utah's Clean Cities Coalition signaled its support for this measure. I quote, ``We believe that for the people living in urban Utah now is a good time to take strong action to encourage Utahns to buy alternative, clean-burning vehicles. We ask that you support the 50-cent per gallon tax credit.'' 
   This bill has also gained the support of the Wasatch Clean Air Coalition in Utah. They stated, ``We believe this tax credit would have a strong positive impact on our local air quality by encouraging the use of alternative fuels, and increasing the portion of cars on our roads fueled by alternative fuels.'' 
   Finally, the American Lung Association has told me that, ``Motor vehicles are a major source of pollution along the Wasatch Front. While automobiles do run cleaner these days, and while alternative forms of transportation are being considered, more needs to be done to address the current and future sources of emissions and poor air quality. One reasonable strategy to cut down on the amount of pollutants in the air is to increase the use of clean fuel vehicles. Vehicles that run on natural gas, propane or electric simply are cleaner burning than those fueled by gasoline or diesel........This legislation will encourage an increased number of clean fuel vehicles on the road, and clean air for years to come.'' 
   Mr. President, I think we all know that 50 years down the road, we will not still be using petroleum fueled vehicles to the same extent we do today. This legislation is an attempt to bring the benefits of cleaner air to our citizens sooner, to free our cities from expensive EPA regulations, and to reduce our consumption of foreign oil. This legislation enables us to tackle these problems with incentives, not mandates. I urge my colleagues to join us in this future-minded approach to cleaning our air.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very dear friend of mine in the Senate and his historic 10,000th vote. His name is Senator JOSEPH BIDEN of Delaware, a friend and colleague whose distinguished career has elevated both the quality and stature of the Senate. The number 10,000 is an important landmark in a career that has many milestones, but I believe Senator BIDEN will be best remembered for the significance of his varied votes. I have seen many of those notable votes cast. 
   In every one of those votes he was careful, deliberate, and respectful of his duty to the people of Delaware. JOE and I have served in the Senate for roughly the same amount of time. He has been here a couple of years longer than I. We have worked closely together in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired and which I now chair. On occasion we have agreed to disagree. In fact, I wish he had cast more of those 10,000 votes with me. In all seriousness, however, JOE and I have found many areas where we strongly have agreed. 
   JOE has long been a leader on the issue of youth violence, an issue which has affected countless lives in Delaware, Utah, and the rest of the Nation. In 1974, he was the lead sponsor of the Juvenile Justice Prevention Act. In 1992, he sponsored the Juvenile Justice Prevention Act Amendments, which provided States with Federal grants for a complete and comprehensive approach to improve the juvenile justice system and controlling juvenile crime. 
   He has long advocated a tough stand against illegal drugs. He authored the law creating the Nation's drug czar, and in 
   1986, he was the guiding force for the enactment of groundbreaking drug legislation. He has probably done as much if not more than anybody in the Senate with regard to the antidrug stances that we all should support and that we all appreciate today. 
   With regard to juvenile justice, next week we bring up a juvenile justice bill. Senator BIDEN has been a mainstay in helping to resolve conflicts that we have in that bill and hopefully helping it to become a bipartisan bill that all of us can support. What I admire most about JOE is the fact that he is the staunchest defender of his party's beliefs, yet he does not hesitate to cross party lines to forge a consensus position when he believes it is the right thing to do. Nowhere is that more evident than with the issue of juvenile crime. 
   JOE has a history of standing up for what is right when it comes to juvenile crime, and I believe he will continue to do so. We look forward to working with him next week. 
   While chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he authored the Violent  Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which was signed into law in 1994. While I differed with much that was contained and dropped from the bill, this legislation contained the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act, the first comprehensive law to address gender-based offenses. Senator BIDEN's leadership on this issue changed how many Americans view the issue of violence against women. He even changed how we refer to domestic abuse in the Senate by continually asking, ``What's domestic about beating your wife?'' 
   JOE is widely regarded as a foreign policy expert. Many remember his leadership on NATO expansion in 1998. He stood out as a strong advocate for the inclusion of several Eastern European nations into the alliance. NATO is now engaged in its greatest test, and I am convinced that JOE's leadership was integral in strengthening the alliance. 
   In 1997, Senator BIDEN showed these same leadership skills when he led the successful effort in the Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. JOE BIDEN has truly had a distinguished career in the Senate. 
   All that said and done, I could go on and on about his distinguished career, but it is his personal qualities that have impressed his friends, his family, and his colleagues, including, of course, myself as a friend and as a colleague. 
   Many may not know that Senator BIDEN overcame two operations for a near-fatal brain aneurysm in 1988 and returned to the Senate in 1989. I remember those days and I remember how catastrophic they were for him, his family, and for those of us who prayed for him. He showed great courage and persistence in overcoming that adversity. Nobody was more thankful than his wife and three children, to whom he is a loving husband and father. Indeed, he is renowned for putting his family first, as demonstrated by his daily commute to and from Delaware. The fact that he takes a 2-hour train ride to get here every day makes the accomplishment of reaching 10,000 votes all the more astounding. 
   So it is with great honor that I ask my colleagues to join me and others in congratulating Senator JOSEPH R. BIDEN on his 10,000th vote. His many contributions to this body are appreciated and recognized. I am sure that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say we will enjoy keeping a close eye on the many votes yet to come. 
   Just as a gift this evening, this is the last CD that we have done. It is, frankly, Santita Jackson, Jesse Jackson's daughter, singing with a wonderful young African American from Nashville, who is as good a singer as anybody in the world, named Chris Willis. This CD is entitled ``Put Your Arms Around the World.'' I think it kind of applies to JOE BIDEN. When he listens to the song written by Peter McCann and me--Peter McCann wrote ``It's the Right Time of the Night'' and ``Want to Make Love''--called ``Take Good Care of My Heart,'' that particular song, I think, really applies to Senator BIDEN because, in his own way, with his tremendous interest in foreign policy, tremendous interest in the law, his tremendous interest in overcoming injustice in our society not only here but throughout the world, I think this song will mean something to him. It certainly does to me. Santita Jackson and Chris Willis are two of the rising young stars in America. I would like to give this CD to Senator BIDEN at this time and say that I look forward to serving with him for a long time to come. So hang in there. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, of all the occupations in America, teachers may deserve their own ``appreciation day'' the most. And, perhaps no occupation influences the future of our country more. I am delighted to join my colleagues today in paying tribute to those teachers all over America who have made a real difference. 
   One special teacher who made a real difference in my life was Mr. McElroy. 
   When I was a young boy, I played my violin in the school orchestra. On the day of one of our most important performances, the student who was supposed to play a solo on the bass got sick and was unable to perform. My music director, Mr. McElroy came to me and convinced me that, even though I had never played the bass, I could perform the solo. 
   I had terrible doubts about my ability to step in and do the job. But Mr. McElroy had confidence in me, even if I didn't. And he worked with me and encouraged me and coached me for most of that afternoon. That night I was able to play the solo without making a mistake. 
   As I think back on it, this was one experience that taught me that if I applied myself I could meet a challenge. When, in 1976, everyone believed I was a long-shot to win the nomination and, indeed, the election to become Utah's senator, I should have told them about Mr. McElroy. 
   I know that right now, in a classroom in Utah--maybe in the room of Diane Crim, who teaches math at Salt Lake's Clayton Intermediate School and is Utah's 1998 Teacher of the Year--another young student is learning these important lessons thanks to a dedicated and caring teacher. 
   Teaching is not just a job, it's a calling. It is a calling to impart knowledge, to mete out discipline, to inspire, to motivate. 
   Last week, our entire nation mourned the loss of a devoted teacher, Dave Sanders. The testimony of his students to his caring, whether in the classroom or on the basketball court, is a tribute better than any we here in the Senate could pay. I hope that the students he taught at Columbine High School will go on to practice the lessons he taught and be the kind of citizens in the community that he hoped they would be. 
   Mr. President, Mr. McElroy, Diane Crim, and Dave Sanders all represent the best of the teaching profession. There are thousands of others we could mention here today who have helped our children learn the keys for living such as reading, math, science, and history. But, more than that, they have helped reinforce essential values like hard work, perseverance, team work, and integrity. I am pleased to join in honoring these teachers today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. President, today I stand in support of this resolution offered by the Senator from Arizona. I think we all must acknowledge his experience in military issues. And, few of us in the Senate can speak with the authority that his personal experience in war has given him. 
   I do not believe that we should be debating this today because of the War Powers Act, which I have always believed to be unconstitutional. But, Mr. President, if the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, it is unconstitutional under President Clinton as much as it was under President Nixon. I, for one, will not reverse my legal assessment of the act just because of the current officeholder in the White House. 
   I confess that I do not have a great deal of confidence in the foreign policy of the Clinton Administration, Mr. President. I have been outspoken about this President's failures, particularly in dealing with this ongoing crisis in the Balkans. 
   But, I do not think we should shape analysis, shade history, or ignore facts to serve our profound discomfort with this Administration's foreign policy. 
   For example, I would not join some members of the other body when they argue that Operation Allied Force caused the genocidal campaign now being perpetrated by Milosevic's troops and thugs in Kosovo. That is a deplorable abandonment of analytic thinking, an egregious failure to recognize cause and effect. 
   We know, Mr. President, that the Serbs were planning this program of ethnic uprooting, of civilian massacres and worse. We know that the Serbs were preparing this for nearly a year. We know that, for many years, the official Serbian regime practiced a form of apartheid toward the Kosovar Albanians. And we know that genocide and ethnic cleansing are what Slobodan Milosevic does. It's on his resume. 
   This is Milosevic's fourth war. This is not a manipulation of reality. In 1991, Milosevic's Yugoslav military attacked Slovenia and Croatia. In 1992, he began a war in Bosnia that led to the deaths of over 250,000 people, most of whom were civilians. 
   And, let us not forget Vukovar, Mr. President, the Croatian city besieged and demolished by Serb forces, who, upon the fall of the city, entered and massacred residents, including patients trapped in hospitals. 
   Let us not forget Srebrenica, Mr. President, when Milosevic's general, Ratko Mladic, captured the Muslim town, marched 7,000 men and boys into open fields outside of town and massacred them in open graves. This is what Milosevic does. 
   His reward for these wars was to be a negotiating partner at Dayton, Ohio. He survived because the Clinton administration operates under naive notions of peace and a feckless obeisance to polls. When it leads, it follows chimeras of the Vietnam protester generation; most of the time it follows. 
   For the Clinton Administration, Mr. President, the pursuit of peace is the pursuit of a childish notion: The notion that peace is the absence of conflict. Such a simplistic view of peace explains why they have committed so many mistakes in the Balkans. The absence of conflict, Richard Nixon once wrote, exists only in two places: in the grave and at the typewriter. The point is not the absence of conflict, but the management of conflict so that it does not erupt into violence. 
   And, Mr. President, to continue to negotiate with Slobodan Milosevic, as we did until last month, and as I suspect the Administration would do if it could, is a guarantee of greater, future violence. The evidence is plenty and irrefutable, in my opinion, that the ultranationalist regime Milosevic must have war to survive. That is why, Mr. President, we are seeing the brutal effects of Milosevic's fourth war today. 
   Many are very uncomfortable in giving this President the kind of support stated in this resolution. Columnist William Safire in Monday's New York Times called it ``The Price of Distrust,'' and stated that ``Clinton has so few followers in Congress because he is himself the world's leading follower.'' 
   Recall how candidate Clinton advocated bombing Slobodan Milosevic in 1992 as part of the ``lift and strike'' strategy (lift the embargo on the Bosnians and strike the Serbs) to aid the Bosnians, who were desperately holding off Milosevic's forces. I promoted ``lift and strike'' in 1992. But when candidate Clinton became President Clinton, he lost his desire to attack Milosevic and adopted a policy of leading the Europeans, whose mismanagement of the conflict ultimately required American 
   leadership in 1995. 
   I have a vivid and bitter memory of a dramatic discussion I had with then Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladzic in the summer of 1995, when he had come to the U.S. to plead for us to lift our arms embargo against his forces besieged by the well-armed Serbs. He met with me moments after pleading, unsuccessfully, with Vice President GORE. President Clinton had refused to meet with him. When I asked the Prime Minister what was the Vice President's reasoning, I was told that the Administration believed that lifting the arms embargo would cause the Serbs to attack the eastern enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde and Srebrenica. 
   This is, of course, what the Serbs did anyway, weeks later. Over 8,000 unarmed men and boys were herded out of town and massacred. In retrospect, I do not know what is more astounding: The Administration's completely fallacious logic then, or the fact that, with the graves of Srebrenica as a glaring lesson, they were unprepared for Milosevic's campaign of genocide unleashed in the last month.  
   In spite of these criticisms, I believe there are essential American national interests at stake in the Balkans. Europe has always been important to the United States, both politically and economically. We cannot stand by and watch while this region is continually disrupted. We cannot accept instability in a region that is a geopolitical crossroads and an economic thoroughfare benefitting U.S. security and trade. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution. Its purpose is to indicate a congressional stand on a war that is going into its second month. Countries in the region are being destabilized. Albanian and Croatian borders have been crossed by Serbian military forces, and the slaughter going on in Kosovo has seen nothing like it in Europe since the Holocaust. 
   In the wake of these events, I believe the United States must lead. If we wish our own interests to be secure, we cannot afford to ignore instability in other key regions. We cannot look the other way and imagine that such conflict will not have an impact on us. 
   And, we cannot abdicate our role in NATO, perhaps the most successful military alliance of the post-war era. If NATO, comprised of democratic, freedom-loving nations of Europe, fails, we face untold political and military tests in the future. 
   Yes, Mr. President, there have been egregious mistakes conducted in the prosecution of this war. No mistake has been greater than the repeated assertion that we would not even plan for the possibility of ground forces. 
   This is not political leadership, Mr. President, it is leadership paralysis. It will lead, I fear, to a defeat for NATO, to a diminution of the symbolic power of the U.S. military, and an increase in the insecurity this country will face in the very near future. 
   Other NATO leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair--who, never once in his political career has been referred to as a ``hawk''--have at least the sensibility to recommend planning for the possibility of ground forces. 
   The most critical error made by this Administration has been to reiterate our refusal to consider ground forces. This self-limiting rhetoric--which the public doesn't even believe--has compromised our military campaign so far. 
   By declaring to Milosevic what we will not do, we have prolonged the air campaign, and thereby increased the risks to the pilots and their support. We have undermined out political goals, which, one must presume, can only be achieved by meeting our military goals. In short, we have given Milosevic the incentive to ``wait NATO out.'' 
   And this is what leads us to this debate today, Mr. President. I believe that NATO, as the alliance led by this country for half a century, embodies both the symbolic and real military strength of this country. If it is to engage in war, as it is now, it should not limit its planning so that we increase the chance of failure. That is what is happening right now. 
   Some fear that we give this President a blank check with this resolution. We should also consider that such reticence by the Senate position can be interpreted as a lack of resolve by Milosevic and his gang of killers. 
   It could also be read by this President as an excuse to conclude this war in a way that does not meet even the scant NATO objectives articulated so far. 
   One thing we have witnessed over the past decade in the Balkans, Mr. President, is that the longer we wait, the lousier the options. Fear of incrementalism can become incrementalism. We have seen this in years of ignoring the situation each time until it escalates and then meeting that escalation with stop-gap measures. 
   Had we used airpower to degrade or destroy Milosevic's 
   regime in the early part of this decade, we would most likely have seen the rise of a Serbian alternative to his regime. By allowing him to stay in power, he has eviscerated the legitimate democratic opposition in Serbia, and he has coalesced his power by bringing in the worst of the ultranationalists. So today, at the end of a decade of genocidal wars led by Milosevic, we appear feckless in the face of yet another war. 
   Mr. President, let me predict now that if Milosevic's military is not destroyed--whether by air, by land, or by sea--this will not be the last war. Ask the leaders of Albania and Macedonia if they feel secure having a strong Serb military led by Milosevic camped on their borders. Ask the Hungarian leadership. 
   Let me be clear about this: This is not an instruction to the President to send in ground forces. I do not believe we should micromanage wars. To the extent that air power can get the job done, I would be very happy not to send American troops into this theater. 
   But, this resolution indicates that we accept no self-limiting conditions on our military options. The leader of the United States has hamstrung the most modern, effective military operation in history. But, this resolution puts him on notice: If he fails to achieve the objectives, he will not turn to the supporters of this resolution and declare we were responsible for the failure. 
   Some insist that this is primarily a ``civil war,'' and that there is the matter of Serbian sovereignty to respect. I would make three brief remarks regarding this view. 
   One, the rapid depopulation of hundreds of thousands of people and their forced movement across borders is an aggressive act, with destabilizing consequences for the region. If, for example, the Chinese were to unleash a million refugees across the Pacific to our shores, we would consider that an aggressive act. 
   Second, international law is by no means clear in protecting the right of a brutal regime to slaughter its citizens. 
   And, third, Mr. President, while we can debate the level of national interest in Kosovo, I do not believe that we, in this body, Republican or Democrat, advocate for the sovereign rights of genocidal dictators. 
   Mr. President, I greatly fear the consequences of failing in our war against Milosevic. Yes, it is complicated, as are most matters of foreign policy. Yes, we do not have excellent options, although rarely in our history have we had them. 
   But we cannot deny the reality of an aggressive dictator waging war after war in Europe, in a Europe this country has recognized is in our national interest, a Europe over which we fought two hot wars and one Cold War. 
   The result of our victory in that Cold War was the liberation of eastern Europe. One dictator remaining in southeastern Europe has inflamed the region, and if he continues undefeated, others will rise in Europe and elsewhere. Among them will be some who believe they are destined to challenge America. 
   Some of these dictators have already shown themselves, such as Saddam Hussein. And, he's taking notes. Seeing the survival of Slobodan Milosevic, he and others will challenge us again and again. I predict, Mr. President, that with the survival of Slobodan Milosevic, the security of this country will be increasingly challenged. 
   Mr. President, the point of this resolution is to indicate that the Senate of the United States will support whatever it takes to achieve the NATO objectives. If NATO fails--and there is no objective reason that it should--it will be because of a failure of political will. 
   The supporters of this resolution, every one of them, indicate today that we have the political will. I expect that we will have the opportunity in the near future when members who support tabling the resolution will be able to revisit the debate and demonstrate their resolve as well. 
   Discomfort and disappointment with the Administration's conduct of this war is not an excuse for us to hedge our political will, Mr. President. That is why I will support the McCain resolution. At the end of the day, history does not wait for a heroic administration. 
   As I stand to address this debate, I recall the Boland amendment debates in the 1980s, and the constant interference with the President's right to resolve foreign policy issues. I argued that this violated the Constitution at that time, and I tend to disagree today with some Republicans who are reluctant to support the President simply because the tables have turned. 
   I support the McCain resolution. I think it is the right thing. All we do is give the President the authorization to use all necessary force to support our objectives. It seems to me that is a pretty reasonable thing for which to ask. 
   Three years ago we met with Milosevic in Belgrade. This is a man  who has put himself in power and kept himself in power through ethnic conflict. If NATO and this President don't do what is right here, this man will continue that ethnic conflict and it will lead to more wars. 
   In 1992, I recommended a lift-and-strike strategy--lift the embargo and strike Milosevic's army that was committing genocidal war. Had we done that then, we wouldn't be in this problem today. 
   The President has done what is right in going after this regime and in stopping them from further genocidal conduct and letting them know that enough is enough. But I fear the President has begun something that he is unsure of completing. His goals remain vague and, worse, he has limited the means he declares he will employ. 
   I commend those who have supported this particular resolution, and I thank my dear friend from Connecticut for allowing me this time.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Kenneth Y. Knight, a fellow Utahan whose selfless contributions have benefited many, and whose indelible imprint will be felt for many years to come across the great State of Utah. 
   Ken Knight is truly a hero to the community of Salt Lake City. His selfless acts of kindness along with his unparalleled wisdom have made him one of the most respected individuals the State of Utah has had the good fortune of calling ``one of its own.'' 
   Ken is truly a ``man for all seasons.'' He is a devoted husband and father, a highly respected businessman, a loyal community servant, and a deeply patriotic and religious leader. 
   Mr. Knight has had a life full of extraordinary achievement. As a youth, he gained the Boy Scouts of America Eagle Rank--an honor he continues to hold dear--and was elected student body president at his high school. He excelled in academics and athletics as well. 
   For the past several years, Ken Knight has distinguished himself in business, serving as Vice Chairman of the Board of Sinclair Oil Corporation and Little America. He was instrumental in the remarkable expansion of Sinclair and Little America, and he has mentored and shared his skills with dozens of corporate employees and community leaders. 
   Mr. Knight's special friend and professional partner R. Earl Holding recognized the value of Ken's service when he stated, ``Perhaps the biggest challenge I faced with Ken--a challenge in which I failed was to keep him to myself. Every organization, every board, and every worthwhile charity you can think of, all wanted him to be part of their cause. His personal contributions--in time and resources--have been profound. He loves the community and the community loves him. And he had the admiration and respect of civic and government leaders throughout the State of Utah.'' 
   Many organizations in Utah have benefited from his service and involvement including--Intermountain Health Care, the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce, Brigham Young University, the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Salt Place Advisory Board, the Utah Travel Council, LDS Hospital, U.S. West, Utah Economic Development Corporation, the LDS Foundation's National Executive Committee for Natural Resources, Utah Youth Village, and the Utah Symphony. 
   Gordon B. Hinckley, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, described Mr. Knight this way: ``The measure of any man is his contribution to the society of which he is a part. Using that measure, Ken stands very tall. He truly has been a giant in our city. He knows the pulse of the community. He measures well before he leaps. There is nothing impetuous about him. He is quiet and methodical ..... He has been a good friend to each of us. He has been a man of singular accomplishment. We are all indebted to him.'' 
   While serving as Chairman of the Utah Symphony, Mr. Knight was faced with a great challenge. ``Ken is the kind of person who relishes a challenge and it was in that spirit that he took on the chairmanship of the Utah Symphony during its darkest hour, when it  had virtually depleted its reserves after running deficits for a period of several years,'' stated Harris H. Simmons, president and chief executive officer for Zions Bancorporation. To secure its future, he led legislative efforts and a public referendum to permanently devote civic funds for artistic achievement. This action not only saved the symphony, but it also widened cultural opportunities in dance, opera, theater, and other artistic expressions. 
   ``When he was Chairman of the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors Bureau, he was the champion for expansion of the Salt Palace Convention Center, which has had a positive economic impact of hundreds of millions of dollars from increased convention and visitor spending,'' stated Richard E. Davis, president and CEO of the Bureau. 
   While serving the Chamber of Commerce he helped overhaul the Workers Compensation Fund in Utah. Fred Ball, who was the Executive Director of the Chamber at the time, stated, ``The results of his efforts have now made Utah one of the very best States in the Nation for both rates and for benefits. Costs and claims were reduced dramatically and all agree that without Ken Knight, it would never have happened. Every Utah business, large and small, are enjoying the efforts of Ken Knight.'' 
   Ken and his wife Nancy have raised five wonderful children, all of whom are decent, responsible citizens and--like their parents--achievers. Perhaps the greatest tribute written about Ken comes from his daughter Lucy Knight Andre when she wrote: ``My father is often honored for his many professional and civic accomplishments. While those honors are well-deserved, they do not represent the most important and least known side of my father--his complete devotion to his family. He adores his children and his grandchildren, and everything he has done in his life has been for the ultimate benefit of his family ..... He taught us to work hard, laugh often, and never look at any problem as insurmountable. He has a great love for his Heavenly Father and an absolute commitment to his Church. He taught us by example the importance of service to our God and our fellow men. Whatever his myriad accomplishments in the community might be, those of us in his family have a remarkable legacy of ingenuity, devotion and love.'' 
   These are indeed wonderful words for a truly remarkable man. It is an honor for me to call all of his magnificent achievements to the attention of the Senate.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to announce my submission of a Senate resolution, together with other members of the U.S. Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs and the Senate Democrat Working Group on Hispanic Issues, to designate April 30, 2000, as Dia de los Nin 6os: Celebrating Young Americans. 
   Last Congress, the resolution to designate April 30, 1999, as a day to celebrate young Americans passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. As a result, cities and towns throughout the country will host community events to celebrate the nation's children throughout this week. 
   In fact, in my home state of Utah a very special celebration is planned. Tomorrow, in Salt Lake City, on Dia de los Nin 6os: Dia de Los Libros [Day of the Children: Day of Books], we will dedicate the first Americas Award Reference and Resource Library to be established at the Centro de la Familia Center. This unique library will house over 1,500 books and will form the central part of a literacy program aimed at encouraging children and young adults to explore the written world by reading books that authentically and engagingly present the experience of individuals in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Latinos in the United States. These wonderful stories will help children learn to read, to expand their universe and dreams, to develop a better understanding of the history of the Americas, and to enhance their own self-esteem. 
   Our children are our greatest promise for the preservation and betterment of this country's healthy and competitive global edge. As leaders and purveyors of hope for a better America, we must continue to nurture their development and potential through innovative programs and discussions that encourage and challenge them to become the prime movers and guardians of investments made thus far. 
   Children's days are celebrated in many other nations, including Japan and Korea on May 5, Canada on November 20, Turkey on April 23, and Mexico on April 30. Local coalitions have formed in 17 states to realize Dia de los Nin 6os: Celebrating Young Americans as a special day for all children throughout this country. 
   I think it is imperative, especially now given the recent tragedy of Columbine, Colorado, that we celebrate, honor, and encourage our youth, in much the same way 
   we honor parents during Mother's Day or Father's Day. Our purpose is strictly to uplift children. 
   There are no easy solutions for the challenges that face our modern day society. But I do know that we need to make and take the time to listen, to support, to observe, and to accept responsibility as parents for raising children prepared to meet the challenge of living in a complex multicultural society--a society that bestows freedom on its citizens predicated on the acceptance of basic moral values. I believe that calling upon the nation to set aside a day for that purpose can be an important step in building awareness among adults that our children need parental love, care, and guidance. They need positive role models--coaches, teachers, employers--as well as from the entertainment industry and professional sports. They need to know there is satisfaction in doing their best, honor in doing the right things, and consequences for doing the wrong thing. 
   A day to reflect on what we are teaching our children and the cultural legacy we are leaving them could very well be a turning point for our country. It is my hope that when the sun goes down tomorrow evening we will have rededicated ourselves to this most important purpose of all--to nurture our children.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Twenty-first Century Justice Act. Last month, when I announced this initiative, along with my colleagues Senator THURMOND, Senator DEWINE, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator SESSIONS, Senator ABRAHAM, and Senator GRAMS, I noted that despite some modest gains in the fight against crime, violent crime still touched far too many Americans. Sadly, this has been borne out in the weeks since. 
   As the recent tragedies in Littleton, CO, and in my own hometown of Salt Lake City, UT, remind us, crime in America is still too prevalent and violent. The tragic cost imposed on law-abiding citizens requires reasoned and thoughtful action to deter these heinous crimes. We must come together as a society to address this problem. 
   Furthermore, we should recognize that there is little the Federal Government could have done directly to have prevented the tragedies in Littleton and elsewhere. There are, however, important steps we can take to address this issue. Our crime bill takes such steps. 
   Now, let me describe for my colleagues how this bill, which is a balanced, comprehensive, and focused plan to fight crime, will expand current successful law enforcement practices. It is based on what we know reduces crime. Be it increased methamphetamine abuse in Utah and other Western states, further increases in juvenile crime, or the threat of international crime, we know that our plan will make a significant difference. 
   Our plan maintains and strengthens the current federal assistance to States that has proven invaluable in reducing crime nationally, and it adds new initiatives that will further reduce crime at the federal, state, and local levels. I am proud of our plan, and I look forward to working with the administration and my Senate colleagues to enact it. 
   America witnessed an unprecedented growth in crime during the 20th century. Our plan ensures that we will become the 21st century with decreasing crime rates. Our plan contains four central elements: 
   First, it continues and improves Federal assistance to State and local law enforcement. Second, it reinvigorates our commitment to winning the war on drugs. Third, it emphasizes holding violent offenders accountable by vigorously prosecuting gun crimes. And fourth, it includes needed judicial and criminal procedure reforms and protections for the rights of crime victims. 
   Notwithstanding the leadership we have seen here in Congress and by many of our nation's governors, crime in America is still unacceptably high by historical standards. For example, for 1997--the most recent year for which national crime rate statistics are available--the murder rate was 33 percent higher than it was in 1960, and the rape rate was 413 percent higher than in 1960. In 1997, the aggravated assault rate was 526 percent higher than it was in 1960. Even with the modest declines in recent years, America still has more violent crime than any industrialized nation in the world. The first obligation of government is to protect its citizens from crime. Obviously, despite the recent declines, we have a long way to go in reducing crime in America. 
   Despite the recent progress--much of it in partnership with Governors like Mike Leavitt of Utah, George Allen and Jim Gilmore of Virginia, and George W. Bush of Texas--we cannot become complacent. The most troubling aspect of the Clinton Justice Department's budget is its elimination of block grants that have proven so successful in helping state and local authorities reduce crime. We simply cannot become indifferent. Remember the war on drugs? During the Reagan and Bush administrations, our nation began a national, long-term commitment to fight drug abuse. Due to these efforts, drug use began to decline. However, drug use, especially among teenagers, has exploded since 1992. Unless we remain vigilant, the same will happen with violent crime. 
   Permit me to review each of the four main parts to our legislative crime plan in greater detail.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to state unequivocally my strong support for a Y2K bill. 
   Let me begin by stating how important Y2K remediation is to consumers, business, and the economy. This problem is of particular interest in my State of Utah which has quickly become one of the Nation's leading high tech States. 
   Working together, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and I have produced a bill--S. 461, the Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act--that encourages Y2K problem-solving rather than a rush to the courthouse. It was not our goal to prevent any and all Y2K litigation. It was to simply make Y2K problem-solving a more attractive alternative to litigation. This benefits consumers, businesses, and the economy. The bill was voted out of the Judiciary Committee. 
   But, Senator MCCAIN's bill is the focus of the present debate. With some distinctions--this bill accomplishes the same ends as Senator FEINSTEIN's and my bill. Let me say that I support a strong bill. I do not care who gets the credit. This is of no importance to me. What is important is that the Nation needs Y2K legislation. I thus will support any mechanism that is able to pass Congress. Let me explain why. 
   The main problem that confronts us as legislators and policymakers in Washington is one of uniquely national scope. More specifically, what we face is the threat that an avalanche of Y2K-related lawsuits will be simultaneously filed on or about January 3, 2000, and that this unprecedented wave of litigation will overwhelm the computer industry's ability to correct the problem. Make no mistake about it, this super-litigation threat is real; and, if it substantially interferes with the computer industry's ongoing Y2K repair efforts, the consequences for America could be disastrous. 
   Most computer users were not looking into the future while, those who did, assumed that existing computer programs would be entirely replaced, not continuously modified, as actually happened. What this demonstrates is that the two-digit date was the industry standard for years and reflected sound business judgment. The two-digit date was not even considered a problem until we got to within a decade of the end of the century. 
   As the Legal Times recently pointed out, ``the conventional wisdom [in the computer business was] that most in the industry did not become fully aware of the Y2K problem until 1995 or later.'' The Legal Times cited a LEXIS search for year 2000 articles in Computerworld magazine that turned up only four pieces written between 1982 and 1994 but 786 pieces between 1995 and January 1999. Contrary to what the programmers of the 1950s assumed, their programs were not replaced; rather, new programmers built upon the old routines, tweaking and changing them but leaving the original two-digit date functions intact. 
   As the experts have told us, the logic bomb inherent in a computer interpreting the year ``00'' in a programming 
   environment where the first two digits are assumed to be ``19'' will cause two kinds of problems. Many computers will either produce erroneous calculations--what is known as a soft crash--or to shut down completely--what is known as a hard crash. 
   What does all this mean for litigation? As the British magazine The Economist so aptly remarked, ``many lawyers have already spotted that they may lunch off the millennium bug for the rest of their days.'' Others have described this impending wave of litigation as a feeding frenzy. Some lawyers themselves see in Y2K the next great opportunity for class action litigation after asbestos, tobacco, and breast implants. There is no doubt that the issue of who should pay for all the damage that Y2K is likely to create will ultimately have to be sorted out, often in court. 
   But we face the more immediate problem of frivolous litigation that seeks recovery even where there is little or no actual harm done. In that regard, I am aware of at least 20 Y2K-related class actions that are currently pending in courts across the country, with the threat of hundreds more to come. 
   It is precisely these types of Y2K-related lawsuits that pose the greatest danger to industry's efforts to fix the problem. All of us are aware that the computer industry is feverishly working to correct--or remediate, in industry language--Y2K so as to minimize any disruptions that occur early next year. 
   What we also know is that every dollar that industry has to spend to defend against especially frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that will not get spent on fixing the problem and delivering solutions to technology consumers. Also, how industry spends its precious time and money between now and the end of the year--either litigating or mitigating--will largely determine how severe Y2K-related damage, disruption, and hardship will be. 
   To better understand the potential financial magnitude of the Y2K litigation problem, we should consider the estimate of Capers Jones, chairman of Software Productivity Research, a provider of software measurement, assessment and estimation products and services. Mr. Jones suggests that ``for every dollar not spent on repairing the Year 2000 problem, the anticipated costs of litigation and potential damages will probably amount to in excess of ten dollars.'' 
   The Gartner Group estimates that worldwide remediation costs will range between $300 billion to $600 billion. Assuming Mr. Jones is only partially accurate in his prediction--the litigation costs to society will prove staggering. Even if we accept The Giga Information Group's more conservative estimate that litigation will cost just $2 to $3 for every dollar spent fixing Y2K problems, overall litigation costs may total $1 trillion. 
   Even then, according to Y2K legal expert Jeff Jinnett, ``this cost would greatly exceed the combined estimated legal costs associated with Superfund environmental litigation ..... U.S. tort litigation ..... and asbestos litigation.'' 
   Perhaps the best illustration of the sheer dimension of the 
   litigation monster that Y2K may create is Mr. Jinnett's suggestion that a $1 trillion estimate for Y2K-related litigation costs ``would exceed even the estimated total annual direct and indirect costs of--get this--all civil litigation in the United States,'' which he says is $300 billion per year. 
   These figures should give all of us some pause. At this level of cost, Y2K-related litigation may well overwhelm the capacity of the already crowded court system to deal with it. 
   Looking at a rash of lawsuits, we must ask ourselves, what kind of signals are we sending to computer companies currently engaged in or contemplating massive Y2K remediation? What I fear industry will conclude is that remediation is a losing proposition and that doing nothing is no worse an option for them than correcting the problem. This is exactly the wrong message we want to be sending to the computer industry at this critical time. 
   I believe Congress should give companies an incentive to fix Y2K problems right away, knowing that if they don't make a good-faith effort to do so, they will shortly face costly litigation. The natural economic incentive of industry is to satisfy their customers and, thus,  prosper in the competitive environment of the free market. This acts as a strong motivation for industry to fix a Y2K problem before any dispute becomes a legal one. 
   This will be true, however, only as long as businesses are given an opportunity to do so and are not forced, at the outset, to divert precious resources from the urgent tasks of the repair shop to the often unnecessary distractions of the court room. A business and legal environment which encourages problem-solving while preserving the eventual opportunity to litigate may best insure that consumers and other innocent users of Y2K defective products are protected. 
   There are not at least 117 bills pending in State legislatures. Each bill has differing theories of recovery, limitations on liability, and changes in judicial procedures, such as class actions. This creates a whole slew of new problems. They include forum shopping. States with greater pro-plaintiff laws will attract the bulk of lawsuits and class action lawsuits. A patchwork of statutory and case law will also result in uneven verdicts and a probable loss of industry productivity, as businesses are forced to defend or settle ever-increasing onerous and frivolous lawsuits. Small States most likely will set the liability standard for larger States. This tail wagging the dog scenario undoubtedly will distort our civil justice system. 
   Some States are attempting to make it more difficult for plaintiffs to recover. Proposals exist to provide qualified immunity while others completely bar punitive damages. These proposals go far beyond the approach taken in the Judiciary and Commerce Committees' bills of setting reasonable limits on punitive damages. Other States may spur the growth Y2K litigation by providing for recovery without any showing of fault. A variety of different and sometimes conflicting liability and damage rules create tremendous uncertainty for consumers and businesses. If we want to encourage responsible behavior and expeditious correction of a problem that is so nationally pervasive, we 
   should impose a reasonable, uniform Federal solution that substantially restates tried and true principles of contract and tort law. If there is an example for the need for national uniformity in rules, this has to be it. 
   The most appropriate role we in Washington can play in this crisis is to craft and pass legislation that both provides an incentive for industry to continue its remediation efforts and that preserves industry's accountability for such real harm as it is legally responsible for causing. 
   This will involve a delicate balancing of two equally legitimate public interests: the individual interest in litigating meritorious Y2K-related claims and society's collective interest in remediating Y2K as quickly and efficiently as possible. We need to provide an incentive for technology providers and technology consumers to resolve their disputes out of court so that precious resources are not diverted from the repair shop to the court room. 
   Let's face it, the only way a bill will pass is if it has significant bipartisan support. I think Congress can pass a bipartisan bill that is both fair and effective. Whatever bill is voted upon by this Chamber, it should at a minimum contain the following provisions that: 
   Preserves the right to bring a cause of action; 
   Requires a ``problem-solving'' period before suits can go forward. This delay must be reasonable and if so will spur technology providers to spend resources in the repair room instead of diverting needed capital; 
   Provides that the liability of a defendant would be limited to some percentage of the company's fault in causing the harm. This will assure fairness and lessen the push to go after deep pockets; 
   Allows the parties to a dispute to request alternative dispute resolution, or ADR during the problem-solving period; 
   Limits onerous punitive damages; 
   Contains a duty to mitigate. Plaintiffs should not be able to recover for losses they could have prevented; 
   Contains a contract preservation provision. This preserves the parties' bargain and prevents States from retroactively instituting strict liability; 
   Codifies the economic loss doctrine. This preserves the restatement of torts rule that you cannot get economic loss for tort injuries; 
   Allows evidence of reasonable efforts in tort. This section is very important because it prevents States from retroactively imposing strict liability or negligence per se; and 
   Contains a class action provision. The class action provision must contain a section that common material defect must be demonstrated to certify claims. It should also contain a section that allows for removal of State class actions to Federal courts based on minimal diversity. 
   Let me end by emphasizing that the Y2K problem presents a special case. Because of the great dependence of our economy, indeed of our whole society, on computerization, Y2K will impact almost every American in the same way. 
   But the problem and its associated harms will occur only once, all at approximately the same time, and will affect virtually every aspect of the economy, society, and Government. What we must avoid is creating a litigious environment so severe that the computer industry's remediation efforts will slacken and retreat at the very moment when users and consumers need them to advance with all deliberate speed. 
   I recognize that if we are to enact worthwhile Y2K problem-solving legislation this year, we must all work together--Democrats and Republicans--in a cooperative manner which produces a fair and narrowly tailored bill. I think we can do this. We can produce a measure which has broad political support, can pass the Congress, and become law. 
   I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Arizona and others to try and get this bill through and will do everything in our power to assist him and help him to do so.

   Mr. HATCH. 
   Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation on behalf of myself, Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. MACK, Mr. BRYAN, Mr. MURKOWSKI, and Mr. BREAUX. This bill would permanently extend the exclusion from Subpart F for active financing income earned on business operations overseas. This legislation permits American financial services firms doing business abroad to defer U.S. tax on their earnings from their foreign financial services operations until such earnings are returned to the U.S. parent company. 
   The permanent extension of this provision is particularly important in today's global marketplace. Over the last few years the financial services industry has seen technological and global changes that have changed the very nature of the way these corporations do business both here and abroad. The U.S. financial industry is a global leader and plays a pivotal role in maintaining confidence in the international marketplace. It is essential that our tax laws adapt to the fast-paced and ever-changing business environment of today. 
   The bill we are introducing today would provide a consistent, equitable, and stable international tax regime for this important component of our economy. A permanent extension of this provision will give American companies much deserved stability. The current ``on-again, off-again'' system of annual extension limits the ability of U.S.-based firms to compete fully in the marketplace and interferes with their decision making and long-term planning. The activities that give rise to this income are long-range in nature, not easily stopped and started on a year-to-year basis. Permanency is the only thing that makes sense. After all, the vast majority of the provisions in the tax code are permanent; it is only a select few that are subjected to this annual cycle of extensions. 
   This legislation will give U.S. based financial services companies consistency and stability. The permanent extension of this exclusion from Subpart F provides tax rules that ensure that the U.S. financial services industry is on an equal competitive footing with their foreign based competitors and, just as importantly, provides tax treatment that is consistent with the tax treatment accorded most other U.S. companies. 
   This legislation provides the U.S. financial services industry the certainty that they will be able to compete with their foreign competitors now and into the 21st century. This is important to our future economic growth and continued global leadership of American companies in the financial services industry.

   The Congressional Gold Medal is no common accolade, but Rosa Parks is no common woman. Her achievements are indeed most uncommon; they are nothing short of extraordinary. 
   None of us of sufficient age to remember the year 1955 will ever forget Ms. Parks' courage in refusing to give up her seat to a white man who wanted it. 
   What makes Ms. Parks' courage so uncommon was its manner: the type of action we usually associate with greatness in the civil rights movement might involve a speech, a march, a coalition ..... . Ms. Parks' courage was quiet, determined and resolute, but it had the volume of a great speech, the force of a mass march, and the power to coalesce that would lead to historic Supreme Court decisions abrogating segregation, and passage of the seminal Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   It has been said of our extraordinary figures that their heroic actions, as the years pass, begin to appear more accepted and less controversial. This is because, as leaders, great men and women have little company, but as their revolutionary ideas gather strength, they also gather adherents. This medal will help remind us, and generations to come, that at the time Ms. Parks refused to move from her seat on the bus, her act of defiance was anything but common.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud that the Senate is now considering S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999. First, I would like to thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, for his hard work and dedication in advancing this important legislation. I also want to pay tribute to the cosponsors of S. 249, Senators DEWINE, GRAMS, ASHCROFT, ABRAHAM, and BIDEN. This bill, which was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous vote, reauthorizes two vital laws that serve a crucial line of defense in support of some of the most vulnerable members of our society--thousands of missing, exploited, homeless, or runaway children. It is a tragedy in our Nation that each year there are as many as over 114,000 attempted child abductions, 4,500 child abductions reported to the police, 450,000 children who run away, and 438,000 children who are lost, injured, or missing. I am told that this is a growing problem even in my State of Utah. 
   Families who have written to me have shared the pain of a lost or missing child. While missing, lost, on the run, or abducted, each of these children is at high risk of falling into the darkness of drug abuse, sexual abuse and exploitation, pain, hunger, and injury. Each of these children is precious, and deserves our efforts to save them. 
   Our bill reauthorizes and improves the Missing Children's Assistance Act and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. First, our bill revises the Missing Children's Assistance Act in part by recognizing the outstanding record of achievements of this National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It will enable NCMEC to provide even greater protection of our Nation's children in the future. Second, our bill reauthorizes and revitalizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. 
   At the heart of the bill's amendments to the Missing Children's Assistance Act is an enhanced authorization of appropriations for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Under the authority of the Missing Children's Assistance Act, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has selected and given grants to the Center for the last fourteen years to operate a national resource center located in Arlington, Virginia and a national 24-hour toll-free telephone line. Today, the National Runaway Switchboard, which is a communications system designed to assist runaway youth and their families, responds to 150,000 calls a year. The Center provides invaluable assistance and training to law enforcement around the country in cases of missing and exploited children. Through the Center's work in FY 1997, almost 36,000 youth received food, 35,000 acquired shelter, over 22,000 obtained transportation home, 21,000 received substance abuse prevention services, and almost 18,000 received clothing. The Center's record is quite impressive, and its efforts have led directly to a significant increase in the percentage of missing children who are recovered safely.  
   In fiscal year 1999, the Center received an earmark of $8.12 million in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations conference report. In addition, the Center's Jimmy Ryce Training Center received $1.25 million. 
   This legislation continues and formalizes NCMEC's long partnership with the Justice Department and OJJDP, by directing OJJDP to make an annual grant to the Center, and authorizing annual appropriations of $10 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2004. 
   NCMEC's exemplary record of performance and success, as demonstrated by the fact that NCMEC's recovery rate has climbed from 62% to 91%, justifies action by Congress to formally recognize it as the nation's official missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a line-item appropriation. This bill will enable the Center to focus completely on its missions, without expending the annual effort to obtain authority and grants from OJJDP. It also will allow the Center to expand its longer-term arrangements with domestic and foreign law enforcement entities. By providing an authorization, the bill also will allow for better congressional oversight of the Center. 
   The record of the Center, described briefly below, demonstrates the appropriateness of this authorization. For fourteen years, the Center has served as the national resource center and clearinghouse mandated by the Missing Children's Assistance Act. The Center has worked in partnership with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Treasury, the State Department, and many other federal and state agencies in the effort to find missing children and prevent child victimization. 
   The trust the federal government has placed in NCMEC, a private, non-profit corporation, is evidenced by its unique access to the FBI's National Crime Information Center, and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS). 
   NCMEC has utilized the latest in technology, such as operating the National Child Pornography Tipline, establishing its new Internet website, www.missingkids.com, which is linked with hundreds of other websites to provide real-time images of breaking cases of missing children, and, beginning this year, establishing a new Cyber Tipline on child 
   exploitation. 
   NCMEC has established a national and increasingly worldwide network, linking NCMEC online with each of the missing children clearinghouses operated by the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addition, NCMEC works constantly with international law enforcement authorities such as Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and others. This network enables NCMEC to transmit images and information regarding missing children to law enforcement across America and around the world instantly. NCMEC also serves as the U.S. State Department's representative at child abduction cases under the Hague Convention. 
   The record of NCMEC is demonstrated by the 1,203,974 calls received at its 24-hour toll-free hotline, 1(800)THE LOST, the 146,284 law enforcement, criminal/juvenile justice, and health care professionals trained, the 15,491,344 free publications distributed, and, most importantly, by its work on 59,481 cases of missing children, which has resulted in the recovery of 40,180 children. Each of these figures represents the activity of NCMEC through Spring, 1998. NCMEC is a shining example of the type of public-private partnership the Congress should encourage and recognize. 
   The second part of our bill reforms and streamlines the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, targeting federal assistance to areas with the greatest need, and making numerous technical changes. According to the National Network for Youth, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act provides ``critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.'' Its three programs, discussed in more detail below, benefit those children truly in need and at high risk of becoming addicted to drugs, sexually exploited or abused, or involved in criminal behavior. 
   The cornerstone of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act is the Basic Center Program which provides grants for temporary shelter and counseling for children under age 18. My home state of Utah received over $378,000 in grants in FY 1998 under this program, and I have received requests from Utah organizations such as the Baker Youth Service Home to reauthorize this important program. Cities such as Provo, Ogden, Cedar City, and Salt Lake City have received funding under the grants. Since 1993, at least 5,000 youths have received assistance in Utah. 
   Community-based organizations also may request grants under the two related programs, the Transitional Living and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach programs. The Transitional Living grants provide longer term housing to homeless teens aged 16 to 21, and aim to move these teens to self-sufficiency and to avoid long-term dependency on public assistance. The Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach Program targets homeless teens potentially involved in high risk behaviors. 
   In addition, the amendment reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act Rural Demonstration Projects which provide assistance to rural juvenile populations, such as in my state of Utah. Finally, the amendment makes several technical corrections to fix prior drafting errors in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. 
   The provisions of this bill will strengthen our commitment to our youth. The children helped by this legislation are not nameless, faceless statistics. They are children from every State and from each of our hometowns who are lost, sometimes abused, and frequently scared. Too often, no one takes the time to care. The Missing Children's Assistance Act and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act fund programs in every State run by dedicated staff and volunteers who take the time to care. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will strengthen the Missing Children's Assistance Act, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and thus improve the safety and the lives of our Nation's most vulnerable children.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to James Q. Cannon, a fellow Utahn who has served as a distinguished leader in the health care quality movement for over twenty-five years. 
   Those of us who know Jamie recognize his tireless efforts to ensure that the thousands of seniors, the underprivileged, and other vulnerable citizens receive the highest quality medical care possible. 
   As President and Chief Executive Officer of HealthInsight, a community-based quality improvement organization in Utah and Nevada, Mr. Cannon has dedicated his life's work to fostering collaboration and continuous learning among health care providers, policy makers, consumer, and business leaders. 
   These efforts have enabled physicians and other health care professionals to respond more effectively and humanely to the many needs of their patients and have helped the best in health care science and research to become part of the usual practice of medicine. 
   Jamie Cannon's vision and pioneer spirit have assisted in bringing hundreds of people together annually to learn, discuss, and implement community-wide health care quality improvement strategies. His commitment to improving the delivery of health care has been a driving force behind countless successful efforts in our communities to prevent unnecessary illness, to reduce complications associated with chronic disease, to improve care delivery processes and outcomes, to simplify health care administration, and to develop sound, supportive government policies. 
   Over the years, these successes have touched in one way or another, virtually all aspects and settings in  health care--from government policy development to evaluations of program effectiveness, from pediatric care to end-of-life care, and from hospitals to physician offices. 
   In addition to his service to the people of Utah and Nevada, Jamie has led and supported initiatives to evaluate and improve the quality of medical care delivered to all Americans. He has served as a member of the board of directors of the American Health Quality Association, an association representing a national network of organizations and individuals striving to improve the health care delivered in every state in our nation. 
   Mr. Cannon has also chaired numerous committees and task forces at the national level, providing leadership and direction to other health business executives committed to improving the quality of clinical medicine. 
   In addition to providing a legacy of health care quality leadership regionally and nationally, Jamie has also influenced the lives of many others in the community. He is a devoted husband, father of ten children, son and brother. Throughout his life, Jamie has also given generously of his time to those in need through lay service in his church. 
   Jamie's genuine care and concern for others is apparent in every interaction. His boundless optimism and belief in human goodness engenders trust, rekindles hope, and nurtures vision in all those around him. 
   Mr. Cannon's leadership and service are respected and admired by his peers, employers, business associates, friends and neighbors, and family. I am proud to know Jamie. He deserves the recognition and appreciation of Congress, the Nation, and particularly the citizens of Utah and Nevada. 
   With honor and pride I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing and expressing appreciation to James Q. Cannon for his many contributions to quality health care in our country.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment will put the Senate on record in two important areas. 
   The first is that, notwithstanding assumptions to the contrary, the Antitrust Division needs and should have adequate resources to enable it to meet its statutory requirements, including those related to reviewing and investigating increasingly numerous and complex mergers. 
   The second, is that Congress needs to review and pursue adjustments to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. This second point, Mr. President, is an important one and one whose time is long overdue. The threshold values in this Act which trigger the requirement for businesses to file premerger notifications with government antitrust enforcers have not been changed, even for inflation, since 1976--23 years ago. 
   The overall purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Antitrust Division's resources are focused on matters and transactions most deserving of the Division's attention, and to remove unnecessary regulatory and financial burdens on small businesses. 
   Mr. President, few would disagree that it is important to adequately fund the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. They are charged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the antitrust laws, including review of corporate mergers, in order to ensure that the consumer benefits from lower prices and better goods that come with vigorous competition in the marketplace. The interests of consumers must prevail over the political interests of some companies. 
   At our oversight hearing of the Justice Department several weeks ago, I asked Attorney General Reno whether she would work with us to review the value thresholds of the Hart-Scott-Rodino. It is my belief that adjustments to the value thresholds of Hart-Scott-Rodino are needed. They are needed to ensure that the Department's merger reviews take into account inflation and the true economic impact of mergers in today's economy--not in the economy of 1976. The Attorney General, and the Federal Trade Commission have pledged to work with us, and I look forward with working with the Administration to come up with a rational proposal that is a win-win for both the Department and small business. 
   Mr. President, let me just add that this amendment is not about one company, or one issue. It is about providing rational relief for some small businesses and supporting the enforcement of our laws.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a diverse, bipartisan group of Senators in introducing  this simple, technical bill to extend the effective date of a provision included in last year's omnibus appropriations bill. My cosponsors include Senators NICKLES, BIDEN, THURMOND, KENNEDY, SESSIONS, ABRAHAM, KOHL, SCHUMER, LIEBERMAN, DEWINE, and Helms. I urge all of my colleagues to support our bill. 
   My colleagues will recall that last year's omnibus appropriations bill included a provision originating in the House, relating to the application of state bar rules to federal prosecutors. The so-called McDade amendment proposed the addition of a new section, Section 530B, to title 28 of the United States Code, which would effect the ethical standards required of federal prosecutors. 
   Although I am prepared to, I do not want to address the merits of this issue today, and our bill does not do so. Suffice it to say, however, that including this provision was so controversial that a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee opposed its inclusion in the omnibus bill. In fact, our strong opposition resulted in a six month delay in the provision's effective date being included as well. 
   When we included this six month grace period, the Senate anticipated that the time might be used to address the serious concerns with the underlying measure. Due to arguably unanticipated events, we have not been able to do so. Our amendment simply maintains the status quo, extending the grace period an additional six months. A bipartisan group of 12 Senators, including myself and 3 former chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee signed a letter, urging the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee to include this amendment in this supplemental appropriations bill.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the legislation, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999,'' which Senator ASHCROFT is introducing today. This legislation's other sponsors include: Senator DODD, Senator SESSIONS, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator SMITH, and Senator SCHUMER. 
   State and federal courts are overwhelmed by up to 150,000 asbestos lawsuits today, and there are new suits being filed. Unfortunately, those who are truly sick with asbestos and various asbestos-related cancers and illnesses spend years in court before receiving any compensation, and then usually lose more than half of that compensation to attorneys' fees and other costs. One cause of this extraordinary delay in compensation is the large number of lawsuits filed by those who, without any symptoms or signs of asbestos-related illness, bring suits for future medical monitoring and fear of cancer. 
   Mr. President, I am concerned that as juries award enormous compensation and outrageous punitive damages to non-impaired plaintiffs, others with actual illnesses receive little or no compensation. As legal and financial resources are tied up and exhausted, it is increasingly unclear whether those who are truly inflicted with asbestos-caused diseases will be able to recover anything at all in the years ahead. 
   Courts have tried unsuccessfully to cope with this problem. The major parties involved attempted to compromise on a solution that included prompt compensation. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned one such compromise, known as the Amchem or Georgine agreement, on civil procedural rule grounds, but found the settlement to be ``arguably a brilliant partial solution.'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the Supreme Court, upheld the Appellate decision and stated, ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide administrative claims processing regime would provide the most secure, fair and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. Congress, however, has not adopted such a solution.'' The Court accurately recognized that Congress is the most appropriate body to resolve the asbestos crisis. That is what this legislation is aimed to do. 
   Mr. President, through the hundreds of thousands of cases that already have been litigated in the court system, the legal and scientific issues relating to asbestos litigation have been thoroughly explored. This, along with the recent court decisions demonstrate that the asbestos litigation issue is now ripe for a legislative solution. 
   This bill we introduce today will correct the asbestos litigation crisis problems. It is crafted to reflect as closely as possible the original settlement agreed to by the involved parties in the Amchem settlement. This bill will eliminate the asbestos litigation burden in the courts, get fair compensation for those who currently are sick,  and enable the businesses to manage their liabilities in order to ensure that compensation will be available for future claimants. It is important to note that no tax-payer money will fund this bill. 
   We have carefully crafted this legislation so that it is at least as favorable--and, in many cases, more favorable--to claimants as the original Amchem settlement. As this bill makes its way through the legislative process, I look forward to working with Senator ASHCROFT and my colleagues to further refine the language in order to achieve the maximum public benefit from this legislation.

    Mr. HATCH. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend Senator BAUCUS and many more of my esteemed colleagues in the Senate in introducing legislation that would permanently extend the research and experimentation tax credit. 
   As we enter the 21st century, we need to ensure that the United States remains the world's undisputed leader in technological and scientific innovation. The global economy is becoming increasingly competitive. We must move to ensure that our economy does not fall behind. 
   The research and experimentation tax credit is crucial to stimulating economic growth. The President emphasized the value of this credit by asking that it be extended in his budget. Additionally, Congress has recognized the importance of this tax credit by extending it nine times since 1981. 
   Now is the time to end the uncertainty surrounding whether or not the credit will continue to be extended or be allowed to lapse. We must guarantee to American business, our scientists, our engineers, and our citizens who depend on technological innovations every day, that we will make this tax credit permanent. 
   Mr. President, permanence is essential to the effectiveness of this credit. Research and development projects typically take a number of years and may even last longer than a decade. As our business leaders plan these projects, they need to know whether or not they can count on this tax credit. The current uncertainty surrounding the credit has induced businesses to allocate significantly less to research than they otherwise would if they knew the tax credit would be available. This uncertainty undermines the entire purpose of the credit. For the government and the American people to maximize the return on their investment in U.S. based research and development, this credit must be made permanent. 
   Studies have shown that the R&E tax credit significantly increases research  and development expenditures. The marginal effect of one dollar of the R&E credit stimulates approximately one dollar of additional private research and development spending over the short-run and as much as two dollars of extra investment over the long-run. 
   In the business community, the development of new products, technologies, medicines, and ideas can result in either success or failure. Investments carry a risk. The R&E tax credit helps ease the cost of incurring these risks. Whereas foreign nations heavily subsidize research with public dollars, the United States has typically relied less on direct public funds and more on private sector incentives. The R&E tax credit has potential to be an even more effective 
   incentive if it were made permanent. 
   I am aware that not every company that incurs research and development expenditures in the U.S. can take advantage of the R&E tax credit. As the credit matures and business cycles change, the current credit may be out of reach for some companies. To help solve this problem Congress enacted the Alternative Incremental Research Credit to help businesses that do not qualify for the R&E tax credit. To improve the effectiveness of this alternative credit, we have included a proposal to increase it by 1 percent. 
   Mr. President, I am aware that a permanent extension of this credit will be costly. However, when you consider the value that this investment will create for our economy, it is a bargain. Making this credit permanent will encourage more companies to locate their research activities within the United States. This will lead to more jobs and higher wages for U.S. workers. We must recognize that international competition is fierce. Many other countries offer significant enticements to prompt companies to move research activities within their borders. If we fail to ensure at least a level playing field, many companies will move their research activities abroad and we will lose many precious high-paying jobs. 
   Findings from a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that workers in every state will benefit from higher wages if the R & E tax credit is made permanent. Payroll increases as a result of gains in productivity stemming from the credit have been estimated to exceed $60 billion over the next 12 years. Furthermore, greater productivity from additional R&E will increase overall economic growth in every state in the Union. 
   Mr. President, my home state of Utah is a good example of how state economies will benefit from the R&E tax credit. Utah is home to a large number of firms who invest a high percentage of their revenue on research and development. For example, between Salt Lake City and Provo lies the world's biggest stretch of software and computer engineering firms. This area, which was named ``Software Valley'' by Business Week, is second only to California's Silicon Valley as a thriving high tech commercial area. 
   In addition, Utah is home to about 700 biotechnology and biomedical firms that employ nearly 9,000 workers. These companies were conceived in research and development and will not survive, much less grow, without continuously conducting R&D activities. 
   In all, Mr. President there are approximately 80,000 employees working in Utah's 1,400 plus and growing technology based companies. Research and development is the lifeblood of these firms and hundreds of thousands like them throughout the nation. 
   If the credit is allowed to lapse, businesses will not be able to factor the credit into their long-term plans. This uncertainty causes businesses to under-invest in research. This may slow the development of the next computer chip, the next household convenience, the next generation of heart monitoring equipment, or a new drug that stops cancer. We must ensure stability so that our business leaders can count on the credit as they decide how much to invest in research and development. 
   Research and development is essential for long-term economic growth. Innovations in science and technology have fueled the massive economic expansion we have witnessed over the course of the 20th century. These advancements have improved the standard of living for nearly every American. Simply put, the R&E tax credit is an investment in economic growth, new jobs, and important new products and processes. 
   In conclusion Mr. President, if we decide not to make the R&E tax credit permanent, we are limiting the potential growth of our economy. How can we expect the American economy to hold the lead in the global economic race if we allow other countries to offer faster tracks than we do? Making the tax credit permanent will keep American business ahead of the pack. It will speed economic growth. Innovations resulting from American research and development will continue to improve the standard of living for every person in the U.S. and also worldwide. 
   Mr. President, simply put, the costs of not making the R&E tax credit permanent are far greater than the costs of making it permanent. As the next millennium closes in on us, we cannot afford to let the American economy slow down. Now is the time to send a strong message to to the world that America intends to retain its position as the world's foremost innovator.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is little doubt that the moment of truth regarding a missile defense of U.S. territory is fast approaching. 
   The need for it was not unseen. Since 1983, there has been a steady flow of evidence that the post-cold-war era would not be the single superpower cakewalk that many expected. In place of the single adversary nuclear threat, we see a fragmented threat environment populated by mentalities more given to terrorism than the mass attack, direct confrontational strategies of the cold war. 
   The cloudy grasp that we have of the true threat is not helped by the Clinton administration. They lack a strategic approach to a threat that they don't really know or understand. 
   They rely on the prevention policies. Arms control and non-proliferation agreements are of questionable value. Disarmament assistance to the former Soviet Union has not kept nuclear, missile, or warhead technology from slipping abroad and has had its most adverse impact on our own U.S. steel workers and the United States rocket launch industry. United States industry has been encouraged to purchase Russian launch vehicles, technologies, and services to keep them from slipping out of the country. The administration is reluctant to squelch illegal Russian steel imports into the United States for fear of causing civil strife among Russian steel workers. Multilateral export controls are not multilaterally enforced, and the framework agreement with North Korea is neither a framework for cooperation nor an agreement. 
   Second, there is deterrence. However, there is sufficient doubt in the world today about this administration's resolve to use force. 
   This leaves us with the third element of administration missile defense policy: the missile defense force itself. Supposedly, that is our fall back position when prevention and deterrence fail. But when the force structure depends on a strategy that does not address a threat because the threat is unknown, one seems forced toward the very disturbing conclusion that the easiest way to avoid the messier aspects of the problem, like tampering with the ABM Treaty, is simply to politicize the threat. For too long it has appeared that this administration underestimates the threat in order to preserve the sanctity of a treaty increasingly irrelevant to the contemporary threat environment. 
   Let me say more about this last issue. In starker terms this means denial, even wishing the real threat away. One would think that it was embarrassing enough for the Clinton threat team to make the sudden and very recent admission that there is a missile threat to U.S. territory. And, by the way, this now includes Alaska and Hawaii, which the administration had chosen to place outside of U.S. territorial boundaries to give academic weight to its anti-development and deployment arguments. If they are seriously seeking the truth, they do not demonstrate it by re-examining the ABM Treaty restraints. Here the administration has a rare opportunity for leadership on a badly understood and very divisive issue. The President acknowledged just this January that, with the long-range missile threat to U.S. territory better understood, progress on developing our defenses would be pursued by renegotiating rather than abandoning the ABM Treaty. 
   I do not intend to await the outcome of administration negotiations on ABM modifications and amendments, which will take some time given traditional Russian Duma management of the treaty ratification process. In the meantime, I will urge the strongest possible pursuit of conceptual strategies, like the sea-based missile defense force, as well as land-force and space-based missile defense components. 
   Inaction is eclipsing administration options. Since I join many colleagues as well as other experts outside of official circles in believing China, Russia, Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, among others, have real threat capabilities, I want something done by way of creating a viable defense of U.S. territory. For this very reason, I have joined my good friends, Senators COCHRAN and INOUYE as a cosponsor of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with great honor and reverence that I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator CLELAND, to introduce a bipartisan constitutional amendment to permit Congress to enact legislation prohibiting the physical desecration of the American flag. 
   The American flag serves as a symbol of our great nation. The flag represents our country in a way nothing else can; it represents the common bond shared by an otherwise diverse people. Whatever our differences of party, race, religion, or socio-economic status, the flag reminds us that we are very much one people, united in a shared destiny, bonded in a common faith in our nation. 
   Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens reminded us of the significance of our unique emblem when he wrote:  
   A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and national unity. It also signifies the 
   ideas that characterize the society that has chosen 
   that emblem as well as the special history that has 
   animated the growth and power of those ideas. ..... So it 
   is with the American flag. It is more than a proud 
   symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts 
   of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling colonies into 
   a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal 
   opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill 
   for other peoples who share our aspirations.  
   Throughout our history, the flag has captured the hearts and minds of school teachers, construction workers, police officers, grandmothers, and public servants. Who can forget the image of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on the moon? At that moment, the flag stood not only for the triumph of American know-how and the courage of Americans to explore the unknown, but also for freedom. It was a statement that whatever Americans do, we do to promote liberty, equality, and justice. 
   And, what of those children who recite the ``Pledge of Allegiance'' every morning in classrooms all across America? They are pledging to be good citizens, honest and loyal and just. In pledging allegiance to the flag, they are affirming their belief in ``liberty and justice for all.'' 
   And, throughout our history, men and women in uniform have drawn courage from our flag and gave their lives for the values it symbolizes. No matter the era, no matter the color of uniform--whether Army green, Air Force blue, or Navy white--no matter the theater of battle--whether at Gettysburg, San Juan Hill, Iwo Jima, Korea, Da Nang, or the Persian Gulf--our men and women had one common bond: the American flag. 
   Consider the example of Army Corporal Joseph Quintero, a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II. Quintero secretly led a group of POWs in obtaining red, white, and blue material to make an American flag. The flag lifted the hearts of the Americans who were suffering from malnutrition, overwork, and physical abuse. When American planes started to attack the prison camp, Quintero waived Old Glory and the planes stopped the attack and saved numerous American lives. Even in the worst of conditions, Joseph Quintero knew the value of the American flag. 
   From my home State of Utah, there is the courageous example of Lt. William E. Hall, whose fearless actions in the Battle of the Coral Sea earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. Lieutenant Hall attacked a Japanese aircraft carrier and then Japanese planes in a series of highly dangerous engagements. Though seriously wounded, Lt. Hall guided his plane back to a landing strip marked by the American flag. 
   General Schwarzkopf in a speech before Congress thanked the American people for their support of our troops in Operation Desert Storm, stating: ``The profits of doom, the naysayers, the protesters and the flag-burners all said that you wouldn't stick by us, but we knew better. We knew you'd never let us down. By golly, you didn't.'' 
   We respect the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform because we respect what they died for. They did not give their lives for ground, prestige, wealth, or a monarch. They sacrificed their lives for freedom, opportunity, and justice--all represented by our nation's flag of 50 stars and thirteen stripes. Through the American flags at Arlington National Cemetery, on the Iwo Jima Memorial, and at every school yard, we honor those sacrifices. But there are those who do not. 
   In 1984, Greg Johnson led a group of radicals in a protest march. He doused an American flag with kerosene and set it on fire as his fellow protestors chanted: ``America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.'' While traditional First Amendment jurisprudence would protect Johnson's ability to speak and write about the flag, it did not protect his ability to physically destroy the flag. 
   But, in 1989, the Supreme Court abandoned the history and intent of the First Amendment by creating a new standard that made no distinction between oral and written speech about the flag and disrespectful conduct toward the flag. In Texas v. Johnson, five members of the Court, for the first time ever, overturned a conviction based solely on physical conduct toward the American flag. The majority argued that the First Amendment had somehow changed and that it now prevented a state from protecting the American flag from acts of physical desecration. When Congress responded with a federal flag protection statute, the Supreme Court, in United States v. Eichman, used its new and changed interpretation of the First Amendment to strike it down by a 5-4 vote. 
   Under this new interpretation of the First Amendment, it is assumed that the people, their elected legislators, and the courts can no longer distinguish between speech and conduct. Because of this assumed inability to make such distinctions, there are those who argue that our freedom to express political ideas is wholly dependent on treating Greg Johnson's burning of the American flag exactly like oral and written speech. 
   This ill-advised argument fails because its basic premise--that legislatures and courts cannot distinguish between oral and written expression and disrespectful physical conduct--is so obviously false. It is precisely this distinction that legislatures and courts did make for almost 200 years. Just as judges have distinguished which laws and actions comply with the constitutional command to provide ``equal protection of the laws'' and ``due process of law,'' so too have judges distinguished between free speech and destructive conduct, and have limited the latter. 
   Destructive conduct, such as breaking down the doors of the State Department, may be a way of expressing one's  dissatisfaction with the nation's foreign policy objectives. Laws, however, can be enacted preventing such actions in large part because there are alternatives that can be equally powerful. I should also note that right here in the United States Senate, we prohibit speeches or demonstrations of any kind, even the silent display of signs or banners, in the public galleries. 
   Moreover, the people themselves did not elevate the act of flag desecration to a constitutionally protected status, which the Supreme Court did in Johnson and Eichman. Such an extreme view was never drafted by the Congress or ratified by the people. Indeed, such a protection is contradicted by the original and historic intent of the First Amendment. Thus, in this Senator's view, the Supreme Court erred in Johnson and in Eichman. 
   It has also been argued that another flag protection statute could pass constitutional muster under the ``fighting words'' doctrine. In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, however, the Supreme Court expanded the newly created, so-called ``right'' to burn the flag by stating that any statute that specifically targeted the American flag for protection was unconstitutional, regardless of the ``fighting words'' doctrine. Thus, a constitutional amendment is the only means left to protect the flag. 
   It has been argued that a constitutional amendment to protect the flag should be ``content neutral'' and prohibit not only disrespectful destructions of the flag, but all destructions of the flag. Such an amendment would sweep too broadly by prohibiting the ceremonial disposal of a flag and the traditional printing of regimental names on the flag. In short, a ``content neutral'' amendment misses the point. It is the traditional constitutional protection for the dignity of the flag that must be restored, not a new broad ban on any conduct with a flag that should be created. Only a narrowly tailored amendment can accomplish this honorable purpose. 
   The amendment that Senator CLELAND and I propose affects only the most radical and disrespectful forms of conduct towards the American flag. The amendment will leave untouched the current constitutional protections for Americans to speak their sentiments at a rally, to write their sentiments to their newspaper, and to vote their sentiments at the ballot box. The amendment simply restores the traditional and historic power of the people's elected representatives to prohibit the disrespectful physical destruction of the flag. 
   Further, it is clear that restoring legal protection to the American flag will not place us on a slippery slope to limit other freedoms. No other symbol of our bipartisan national ideals has flown over so many of our battlefields, cemeteries, school yards, and homes. No other symbol has been paid for with so much of our countrymen's blood. No other symbol has encouraged so many ordinary men and women to seek liberty and justice for all. 
   In recent months, my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle have called for a new bipartisan spirit in Congress. This amendment fits the bill. Restoring legal protection to the American flag is not, nor should it be, a partisan issue. Including Senator CLELAND and myself, 57 senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have joined as original cosponsors of this amendment. 
   Over 70 percent of the American people want the opportunity to vote to protect their flag. Numerous organizations, including the Medal of Honor Recipients for the Flag, the American Legion, the American War Mothers, the American G.I. Forum, and the African-American Women's Clergy Association all support the flag protection amendment. Forty-nine state legislatures have passed resolutions calling for constitutional protection for the flag. Last Congress, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed this amendment by a vote of 310-114, and will pass it again this year. 
   Mr. President, I am very honored to be a cosponsor with my dear friend from Georgia, Senator CLELAND. I appreciate the efforts he has put forth in this battle. Having served in the military as he has done with such distinction and with courage, he has earned the right to speak for the protection of the flag. 
   I am, therefore, proud to rise today and introduce a constitutional amendment that will restore to the people's elected representatives the right to protect one unique national symbol, the American flag, from acts of physical desecration.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak for a few moments on the Justice Department's ongoing case against Microsoft, and to discuss the Judiciary Committee's upcoming agenda in examining competition in the digital markets. 
   As my colleagues know, the Department of Justice and 19 states have sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust laws. In the case brought by the Department of Justice, the Government has completed its case in chief, and Microsoft rested its case on Friday, February 26. 
   While the trial is proceeding in the courts, I have not held hearings on Microsoft's apparent monopolistic activities and their impact on competition within the software and related technology markets. However, as I noted last November, the Judiciary Committee will continue to examine the important role proper and timely enforcement of federal antitrust laws can have on fostering both competition and innovation for emerging technologies, while minimizing the need for government regulation of the Internet. 
   I believe an important area of inquiry is evaluating the significant public policy concerns posed by the question of what remedies should be imposed in cases where, notwithstanding the generally dynamic and competitive nature of Internet-related industries, high technology companies have been found to have violated the antitrust laws. 
   As I have maintained in the past, these dynamic high-technology industries are different from other traditional industries of the past, and antitrust remedies must take these differences and the special characteristics of the respective high-tech industries into account. 
   Mr. President, if, at the close of the trial, Microsoft is found to have violated the law, the remedies that the court would apply will implicate many policy concerns with respect to how business in the high-technology industry is transacted. Any resolution of the matter--including any settlement, I believe, should aim to restore competition and ensure that neither Microsoft, nor any other monopolist similarly situated, is allowed to continue to benefit from the market advantages it gained unfairly. 
   Promoting real and vigorous competition, which respects intellectual property rights, will not only ensure better prices for the consumers, but will also ensure that innovation is not hampered due to the market stranglehold of a monopolist. Ensuring that true competition exists in the market is also the best way to keep the government out of the business of regulating the Internet. 
   Government should not exert unwarranted control over the Internet--even if Vice President GORE still thinks he created it. Nor should any one company. Indeed, I share Senator GORTON's interest in knowing where the Vice President stands with respect to the Microsoft case. After all, doesn't the father of the Internet have a view on who should be able to control his creation? 
   In the trial, we saw the government put forth a powerful case against Microsoft. And, we saw Microsoft put forth a not so stellar defense. Many experts, even those who were skeptical at first, now believe that the government may well prevail.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read them if they have not already done so. These articles set forth but a few examples of Microsoft's unfortunate actions that have manifested in what has been several months of missteps and embarrassments for the company. 
   The trial is not over. The case is just suspended until the week of April 12, when the court will reconvene for probably several weeks of testimony from rebuttal witnesses. But Microsoft and its defenders have again begun their public relations efforts here in the Senate. 
   Just last Friday, my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Washington, Senator GORTON, took the floor to again defend Microsoft, and attack the Antitrust enforcers and me for questioning Microsoft's actions. I have said before and will say it again: Microsoft is not above the law. The facts and the law should and will prevail regardless of Microsoft's public relations campaign, its ill-advised lobbying efforts, and its muddled defenses. 
   I had been surprised to read several weeks ago that Senator GORTON, in a February 9 press conference, ``vowed to use his influence as a member of the Appropriations Committee to cut funding for the Justice Department's antitrust division.'' I and several concerned Senators wrote to Senators GREGG and HOLLINGS and argued that a move to cut the Division's funding without justification could be perceived by many as interfering with an ongoing litigation. 
   I was pleased to hear that my colleague has apparently conceded that trying to cut DOJ's funding would be unwise. However, he has now properly downsized his ambition and is now advocating not increasing the Antitrust Division's budget by the amount the Administration has requested. 
   I am not yet convinced that the Antitrust Division has fully justified its request for a substantial budget increase. In fact, I believe the Congress should work with the Administration to examine whether we should adjust the Hart-Scott-Rodino value thresholds in order to ensure that the Department's merger reviews take into account inflation and the true economic impact of mergers in today's economy. Attorney General Reno has pledged to work with me on this, and I look forward to working with any of my colleagues who may have an interest in this issue. In this age of precious resources, we will be looking closely at the Antitrust Division's budget and operations, and making sure that any reasonable budget increase is justified. 
   A final point. My friend and Senator from Microsoft's home state has publicly stated that a number of companies across the nation, including some in my state of Utah, work with Microsoft and would be hurt by the current antitrust litigation against Microsoft. I don't know if they will be hurt, but what I do know is that there are many high technology companies and millions of consumers in the States of Washington, Utah and across the nation that would be harmed by any anticompetitive act of Microsoft. 
   In fact, we heard testimony before the Judiciary Committee from one Seattle, Washington-based company, Real  Networks, describing how Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct crippled their technology and hurt the company, although I have to say Real Networks has been doing very well ever since because of their fascinating innovations and the tremendous abilities that they have in this field. However, if violations of the antitrust laws are not pursued against powerful companies like the Microsofts of the world, as the Senator from Washington suggests, many of the technology companies, not to mention the consumers, in the states of Washington, Utah and all across the nation, will suffer. Mr. President, the survival of these companies means jobs, it means innovation, it means competition in the digital market, and it means the availability of consumer choice. 
   I just hope that Microsoft can learn from its mistakes in court and its earlier mistakes here in Congress. Frankly, some of their efforts here have reminded me of those who would tie themselves to railroad tracks and wait for a train to come just to make a point. Microsoft's misguided legal and legislative advice has not helped its case to date, and I would hope, for Microsoft's case, that they would not initiate a foolish political protest which could leave them even more damaged than they are now. Frankly, I don't think this train is going to stop. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and turn the floor over for my dear friend from South Carolina. 
   Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as this decade nears a close, and as our Nation has enjoyed an unprecedented period of economic growth, there remains an issue that affects many American families. I am referring to child care. 
   It has been nearly 9 years since the passage of the bipartisan Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. I was proud to have been a sponsor of this legislation, and I remain committed to its goals, structure, and principles. 
   Though the CCDBG has led to great improvements in the child care situation facing low-income families in every State, it has become clear that more needs to be done to help the family. In my home State of Utah, an extraordinary 57 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 are in the labor force, and 134,000 children under the age of 6 in Utah will be cared for by someone other than their parents. 
   I am pleased to again join my colleagues--Senators CHAFEE, SNOWE, ROBERTS, SPECTER, COLLINS, and COCHRAN--each of whom has a long record of concern and involvement in child care issues--in sponsoring this measure. The Caring for Children Act is a comprehensive, realistic child care proposal, which we believe will benefit middle- and lower-income American families who struggle to get ahead or struggle to keep up. 
   First, the Caring for Children Act will, by expanding the Dependent Care Tax Credit, cut taxes for many middle- and lower-income families. Under the current system, the maximum credit of 30 percent is available only to families with incomes of $10,000 or less. Our proposal increases the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) from 30 percent to 50 percent. The maximum income is also increased to $30,000. The maximum allowable expenses of $2,400 for one child and $4,800 for two or more children will remain the same. 
   For example, a working family in Vernal, UT, earning $30,000 with two children, could receive a tax credit of $2,400 (50 percent of $4,800), instead of $960 under the current law. 
   Our bill also lowers the maximum credit more gradually than current law. This provides a form of tax relief for DCTC-eligible families earning between $30,000 and $75,000. This change is intended to benefit an often forgotten group--taxpayers who earn too much for Federal breaks but not enough for child care expenses not to be a big bite out of their budget. 
   This proposal also breaks new ground. It recognizes, for the first time, as a matter of Federal child care policy, that many families elect to have one parent remain at home to serve as the primary are giver. We understand the value of a parent at home to care for a child, both in terms of quality of care and monetary sacrifice. Such families pay for their child care by forfeiting a second income. The Caring for Children Act would expand eligibility for the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) to families with young children in which one parent remained at home. 
   Our bill assumes child care expenses for such a family of $150 per month. Thus, a family earning $30,000 with two children, ages 3 and 1, in Farmington, UT, in which one parent remains at home, would receive a tax credit of $900 (50 percent of $15012 months). 
   Some have criticized our bill for not giving the same tax benefits to families with a stay-at-home parent. Frankly, I support such parity in the DCTC. I would like our bill to be able to provide a larger credit. But, expanding eligibility for this credit is an expensive proposition. While we may not be able to propose DCTC parity in one fell swoop, we should establish the concept in this bill and increase the level of benefit as quickly as we can. But, we should not fail to do something just because we cannot do it all. 
   Many families across America elect to forego a second income in order to have a parent remain at home with children. Federal policy has so far failed to recognize parental care as child care, even if many people, myself included, consider it the best possible care. I happen to believe that parental care is the best care there is. 
   And, let me offer a word of praise and gratitude for my wife, Elaine. Elaine could have had a successful career as a professional educator. Instead, she chose to stay home with our children--all of whom are now married with children of their own. 
   Of course, my daughters and daughters-in-law will make their own choices about balancing career and family. Different families make different choices and face different circumstances that drive their choices. 
   Our bill asserts that the Dependent Care Tax Credit should be available to families regardless of their choice. The DCTC should be a tax credit to help families care for children, not just a credit for employment expenses. We should not minimize the significance of this change in the federal child care paradigm. 
   Yet, many working but low-income families have no tax liability and will not benefit from our proposed changes to the DCTC. These families, many of which may be headed by single parents or headed by individuals moving from welfare to work, are struggling to make ends meet. 
   One of the family's biggest expenses is child care. 
   The cost of child care, like almost everything else, has increase in the 9 years since the implementation of the Child Care and Development Block Grant. When the CCDBG was enacted, the average cost of care per child was $3,000. Today, it is estimated to be more than $4,000 per child. 
   I invite senators to do the math: If a parent is making $10 an hour ($20,800 per year before taxes) and has just one child, child care expenses claim almost  one-fifth of the family budget. It is no wonder that the Utah Child Protective Services told me some years ago about a mother who was forced to choose between groceries and child care. 
   The Caring for Children Act proposes to increase the authorization of appropriations for the Child Care and Development Block grant Act (CCDBG), which states use to subsidize child care for low-income parents and to develop new capacity in areas--both geographic and functional--where there are shortages. 
   In Utah, as in other states as well, smaller and more rural communities often have shortages of child care. And, nearly every community suffers shortages of infant care, after school care, and care for special needs children. 
   The CCDBG is the only federal program we have for assisting low-income working families with child care expenses. We are not proposing to create another one. We are not expanding the statutory eligibility or entitlement for this program. The Caring for Children Act merely makes it possible for states to serve more eligible people and to address more of the problem of shortages under the provisions of the CCDBG. 
   I have said many times in this body that I do not support federal assistance for those who are able but do not help themselves. But, I likewise believe that some help is warranted when people are working and doing all they can to provide for their families. This is why I joined as a sponsor of the Child Care and Development Block Grant 10 years ago. I do not want Utah families to have to choose between child care and food. 
   We still face issues of quality of care. Our bill affirms state prerogatives to set their own standards for child care. My colleagues are well aware of my strong opposition to any federal effort to set or imply federal standards. States must be allowed discretion in this. But, our bill also recognizes that standards are worthless if they are not enforced. 
   To encourage states to make a stronger commitment to enforce their own standards for child care, the Caring for Children Act provides a system of bonuses for states who exceed a threshold of inspections or, conversely, penalties for those who fail to conduct a minimum number of inspections. In my view, the most stringent standards in the world do not provide any assurance of quality care if providers do not believe standards will be enforced. 
   I also believe that the best assurance of quality is a parent's own good judgment. The Caring for Children Act takes the very inexpensive, but potentially very productive step of providing funds for beefed up consumer information to parents. 
   There are other important provisions in our bill that are designed to encourage private sector initiatives in child care as well as to enhance training opportunities for child care providers. 
   All together, the Caring for Children Act attempts to address all three of the major issues in child care: affordability, availability, and quality. I believe the bill we are introducing today is measured and responsible. 
   In no way is this a government knows best model of social problem solving; rather, it builds on what we already know works and what we already know that parents want. They want resources and information to make their own decisions and to care for their own children. They want input into the plans developed by states. They want control over child care. 
   The bill we are introducing today endeavors to put government on the side of parents by returning resources to them through tax credits, by enabling states to do more under the CCDBG, by increasing available child care information, and, finally by respecting the choices they make. 
   I am again pleased to join my colleagues in this legislation and hope other Senators will support this measure as well.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act. This legislation will provide a mechanism enabling States to more effectively enforce their laws regulating the interstate shipment of alcoholic beverages. 
   Interstate shipments of alcohol directly to consumers are increasing exponentially. Unfortunately, along with that growing commerce, problems associated with that trade are also growing. While I certainly believe that interstate commerce should be encouraged, and while I do not want small businesses stifled by unnecessary or overly burdensome and complex regulations, I do not subscribe to the notion that purveyors of alcohol are free to avoid State laws which are consistent with the power bestowed upon them by the Twenty-First Amendment. 
   All States, including the State of Utah, need to be sure that the liquor that is brought into their State is labelled properly and subject to certain quality control standards. States need to protect their citizens from consumer fraud and have a claim to the tax revenue generated by the sale of such goods. And of the utmost importance, States need to ensure that minors are not provided with unfettered access to alcohol. Unfortunately, indiscriminate direct sales of alcohol have opened a sophisticated generation of minors to the perils of alcohol abuse. 
   I can tell you that my home State of Utah, which has some of the strictest controls in the nation on the distribution of alcohol, is not immune from the dangers of direct sales. A recent story which ran on KUTV in Salt Lake City showed how a thirteen year old was able to purchase beer over the internet and have it shipped directly to her home--no questions asked. If a thirteen year old is capable of ordering beer and having it delivered by merely borrowing her brother's credit card and making a few clicks with her mouse, there is something very wrong with the level of control that is being exercised over these sales. Of course the Utah case is not an isolated example. Stings set up by authorities in New York and Maryland have also shown how easy it is for minors to obtain alcohol. 
   Debate over the control of alcoholic beverages has been raging for as long as this country has existed. Prior to 1933, every time individuals or legislative bodies engaged in efforts to control the flow and consumption of alcohol, whether by moral persuasion, legislation or Constitutional Prohibition, others were equally determined to repeal, circumvent or ignore those barriers. However, the Twenty-First Amendment did, for a time, create an ordered system for the distribution of alcohol. 
   The Twenty-First Amendment was ratified in 1933. That amendment ceded to the States the right to regulate the importation and transportation of alcoholic beverages across their borders. By virtue of that grant of authority, each State created its own unique regulatory scheme to control the flow of alcohol. Some set up State stores to effectuate control of the shipment into, and dissemination of alcohol within, their State. Others refrained from direct control of the product, but set up other systems designed to monitor the shipments and ensure compliance with its laws. But whatever the type of State system enacted, the purpose was much the same: to protect its citizens and ensure that its laws were obeyed. 
   Although not perfect, the systems set up by the States worked reasonably well for many years. However, modern technology has opened the door for abuse and created the need for further governmental action to address those abuses. No longer must a State prosecute just an errant neighborhood retailer for selling to a minor--now, the ones selling to minors and others in violation of a State's regulatory laws are a continent away. A small winery can create its own web page and accept orders over the internet; a large retailer can advertise nationally in the New York Times and accept orders over the phone; an ad can be placed in a magazine with a national circulation offering sales through an 800 number. 
   Let me emphasize that there are many companies engaged in the direct interstate shipment of alcohol who do not violate State laws. In fact, many of these concerns look beyond their own interests and make diligent efforts to disseminate information to others to ensure that State laws are understood and complied with by all within the interstate industry. 
   I should also note that I am certainly sympathetic to the small wineries and specialty micro-breweries who feel that the requirement that they operate through a three tier system (producer-wholesaler-retailer) which does not embrace them may, in effect, shut them out of the marketplace. They make the argument that if wholesalers do not carry their product, they have no other avenue to the consumer other than through direct sales. However, if there is a problem with the system, we need to fix the system, not break the laws. 
   Federal law already prohibits the interstate shipment of alcohol in violation of State law. Unfortunately that general prohibition lacks any enforcement mechanism. The legislation I am introducing simply provides that mechanism by permitting the Attorney General of a State, who has reasonable cause to believe that his or her State laws regulating the importation and transportation of alcohol are being violated, to be permitted to file an action in federal court for an injunction to stop those illegal shipments. 
   This bill is balanced to ensure due process and fairness to both the State bringing the action and the company or individual alleged to have violated the State's laws. The bill: 
   1. Permits the chief law enforcement officer of a State to seek an injunction in federal court to prevent the violation of its laws regulating the importation or transportation of alcohol; 
   2. Allows for venue for the suit where the defendant resides and where the violations occur; 
   3. Does not require the posting of a bond by the requesting party; 
   4. Does not permit an injunction without notice to the opposing party; 
   5. Requires that any injunction be specific as to the parties, the conduct and the rationale underlying that injunction; 
   6. Allows for quick consideration of the application for an injunction and conserves court resources by avoiding redundant proceedings; 
   7. Mandates a bench trial; and 
   8. Does not preclude other remedies allowed by law. 
   Some will argue that State courts are capable of handling this issue. Unfortunately, States have had mixed success in enforcing their laws through State court actions. Companies and individuals have raised jurisdictional, procedural and legal defenses that have stalled those efforts, and that continue to hamper effective enforcement. It is, in part, because of those inconsistent rulings, that federal leadership is needed in this area. 
   Moreover, the scope and limitations of a State's ability to effectively enact laws under the Twenty-First Amendment are essentially federal questions that need to be decided by a federal court, and perhaps ultimately, by the Supreme Court. Only through such rulings can both the States and companies seeking to conduct interstate shipments be assured of consistency in interpretation and enforcement of the laws.  
   The introduction of a bill is just the beginning of the legislative process. It is my hope that, working together, we can reach an agreement on how best to balance legitimate commercial interests with the Constitutional rights of the States as ceded to them by the Twenty-First Amendment.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues Senators ABRAHAM and WYDEN to introduce the New Millennium Classrooms Act. 
   Technology is a wonderful thing. It increases our productivity, enhances the way we communicate with each other, and opens up access to whole new worlds at the click of a finger. 
   It is becoming an integral part of the way America does business. Our economy has become more and more globalized. Our jobs, our cars, and our toys are more and more high-tech. Computers have become such a big part of American business that it has been projected that 60 percent of American jobs will require high-tech computer skills by 2000--just next year. 
   Unfortunately, there is an important part of our society that has not kept pace with this technology craze--our schools. We are falling dismally short of meeting the Department of Education's recommendation of 1 computer per 5 students. American schools had an average of just 1 computer per 24 students in 1997. 
   Not only are there too few computers in the classrooms, but those that are there are old and outdated, unable to run today's software and applications. In fact, the most popular model of computer in our schools is the Apple IIc. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this computer, you can see one just down the street in the Smithsonian. 
   Too many of today's schoolchildren are missing out on one of the greatest advancements in computer applications--the Internet. Thirty-two percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access to the Internet. This is not right. Our kids deserve the cutting edge of technology, not the 21st century equivalent of chalk and slates. 
   In 1997, Congress recognized the need for more and better computers in our schools enacting a corporate charitable tax deduction for school computer donations. Unfortunately, the deduction was crafted narrowly with various restrictions and limitations so that we have not seen a significant increase in computer donations to our schools. 
   The New Millennium Classrooms Act is designed to address the shortcomings of the current deduction by expanding limits on the deduction and adding a tax credit equal to thirty percent of the fair market value of the donated computer equipment. This provides greater incentives for corporations to donate computer technology and equipment to our schools.  
   Allowing computer manufacturers to donate computers and other equipment returned to them through trade-ins or leasing programs will expand both the number of eligible donors and the qualified equipment to be donated. 
   An enhanced 50 percent tax credit for donations to schools located in empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations will help to address the growing technology gap between our urban and rural, rich and poor schools. This will help focus the donations to those kids who need the technology the most, to those kids who are less likely to have a computer at home. 
   A good education for our children is the key to the future of our country. Without current computers and equipment in our schools, we cannot keep our kids on the cutting edge of technology where they belong. This bill contains real incentives for private organizations to get involved and donate computers and equipment to schools in order to help educate our children. This is important to our kids, our schools, and our future. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am introducing today an amendment to subchapter II of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. My amendment would allow athletes participating in world events, such as the Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympic Games, to bring into the United States, duty free, such personal effects as equipment expressly used in the sporting events, and then re-exported with departing athletes at the termination of the events. 
   This bill is needed to relieve both Customs officials and event participants of immense amounts of documentation required in the past for such exceptions to Customs laws and practices. However, this amendment does not exempt such items from inspection by Customs officials, inspections which can be made entirely on their discretion, nor does it allow the entry of items barred under current law. This same bill, which I introduced in the prior, 105th Congress was favorably reported out by both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and incorporated in the Omnibus Trade Bill which failed passage.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce private relief legislation on behalf of my constituents, Mr. Saeed Rezai, and his wife, Mrs. Julie Rezai. 
   As my colleagues are aware, those immigration cases that warrant private legislation are extremely rare, but are warranted in some cases. I am introducing a bill for the relief of Saeed Rezai. I had hoped that this case would not require congressional intervention. Unfortunately, it is clear that private legislation is the only means remaining to ensure that the equities of Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's case are heard and that a number of unresolved questions are answered without imposing a terrible hardship on Mr. and Mrs. Rezai and on their marriage. 
   I wish to take a moment, Mr. President, to provide something by way of background to this somewhat complicated case and to explain the urgency of this legislation. Mr. Rezai first came to the United States in 1986. On June 15, 1991, he married his current wife, Julie, who is a U.S. citizen. Shortly thereafter, she filed an immigrant visa petition on his behalf. Approval of this petition has been blocked, however, by the application of 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 204(c) precludes the approval of a visa petition for anyone who entered, or conspired to enter, into a fraudulent marriage. The Immigration and Nationalization Service [INS] applied this provision in Mr. Rezai's case because his previous marriage ended in divorce before his 2-year period of conditional residence had expired. In immigration proceedings following the divorce, the judge heard testimony from witness on behalf of Mr. Rezai and his former wife. After considering that testimony, he found there was insufficient evidence to warrant lifting the conditions on Mr. Rezai's permanent residency and, in the absence of a qualifying marriage, granted Mr. Rezai voluntary departure from the United States. The judge was very careful to mention, however, that there was no proof of false testimony by Mr. Rezai, and he granted voluntary departure rather than ordering deportation because, in his words, Mr. Rezai `may be eligible for a visa in the future.' 
   Despite these comments by the immigration judge, who clearly did not anticipate the future application of the 204(c) exclusion to Mr. Rezai's case, the INS has refused to approve Mrs. Rezai's petition for permanent residence on behalf of her husband based on that very exclusion. In the meantime, Mr. Rezai appealed the initial termination of his lawful permanent resident status in 1990. In August 1995, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals denied this appeal and reinstated the voluntary departure order. Under current law, there is no provision to stay Mr. Rezai's deportation pending the BIA's consideration of Mrs. Rezai's current immigrant visa petition. 
   Mr. President, there is no question that Mr. Rezai deportation will create extraordinary hardship for both Mr. and Mrs. Rezai. Throughout all the proceedings of the past 6 years, not a single person that I know of--including the INS--has questioned the validity of Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's marriage. In fact, many that I have heard from have emphatically told me that Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's marriage is as strong as any they have seen. Given the prevailing political and cultural climate in Iran, I would not expect that Mrs. Rezia will choose to make her home there. Thus, Mrs. Rezai's deportation will result in either the breakup of a legitimate family or the forced removal of a U.S. citizen and her husband to a third country foreign to both of them. 
   It should also be noted that Mr. Rezai has been present in the United States for more than a decade. During this time he has assimilated to America culture and has become a contributing member of his community. He has been placed in a responsible position of employment as the security field supervisor at Westiminster College where he has gained the respect and admiration of both his peers and his supervisors. In fact, I received a letter from the interim president of Westminister College, signed by close to 150 of Mr. Rezai's associates, attesting to his many contributions to the college and the community. This is just one of the many, many letters and phone calls I have received from members of our community. Mr. Rezai's forced departure in light of these considerations would both unduly limit his own opportunities and deprive the community of his continued contributions.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am today introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Belinda McGregor, the beloved sister of one of my constituents, Rosalinda Burton. 
   Mistakes are made every day, Mr. President, and when innocent people suffer severe consequences as a result of these mistakes, something ought to be done to remedy the situation. 
   In the particular case of Ms. Belinda McGregor, the federal bureaucracy made a mistake--a mistake which cost Ms. McGregor dearly and it is now time to correct this mistake. Unfortunately, the only way to provide relief is through Congressional action. 
   Belinda McGregor, a citizen of the United Kingdom, filed an application for the 1995 Diversity Visa program. Her husband, a citizen of Ireland, filed a separate application at the same time. Ms. McGregor's application was among those selected to receive a diversity visa. When the handling clerk at the National Visa Center received the application, however, the clerk erroneously replaced Ms. McGregor's name in the computer with that of her husband. 
   As a result, Ms. McGregor was never informed that she had been selected and never provided the requisite information. The mistake with respect to Ms. McGregor's husband was caught, but not in time for Ms. McGregor to meet the September, 1995 deadline. Her visa number was given to another applicant. 
   In short, Ms. McGregor was unfairly denied the 1995 diversity visa that was rightfully hers due to a series of errors by the National Visa Center. As far as I know, these facts are not disputed. 
   Unfortunately, the Center does not have the legal authority to rectify its own mistake by simply granting Ms. McGregor a visa out of a subsequent year's allotment. Thus, a private relief bill is needed in order to see that Ms. McGregor gets the visa to which she was clearly entitled to in 1995. 
   Mr. President, I have received a very compelling letter from Rosalinda Burton of Cedar Hills, UT which I am placing in the RECORD. Ms. Burton is Ms. McGregor's sister and she described to me the strong relationship that she and her sister have and the care that her sister provided when Ms. Burton was seriously injured in a 1993 car accident. 
   I hope that the Senate can move forward on this bill expeditiously. Ms. McGregor was the victim of a simple and admitted bureaucratic snafu. The Senate ought to move swiftly to correct this injustice. 
   Mr. President, I am also including in the RECORD additional relevant correspondence which documents the background of this case.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my good friend Senator BREAUX the ``State and Local Investment Opportunity Act of 1999.'' This legislation would first, raise the annual limit on States' authority to issue their own tax-exempt ``Private Activity'' Bonds to the greater of $75 times population or $225 million and, second, index the limit to inflation. 
   Tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds finance much needed municipal services, student loans, affordable housing, and economic development. 
   In my home State, the Utah Housing Finance Agency has financed first-time homes for nearly 41,000 working families with Mortgage Revenue Bonds. In addition, multifamily housing bonds have financed almost 3,300 affordable apartments. Both of these bonds are subject to the cap. 
   However, many more Utah families still need the housing help that these bonds provide. According to the National Council of State Housing Agencies, demand in Utah for these bonds and other Private Activity Bonds more than doubled supply. Nationwide, demand for bond authority exceeded supply by almost 50 percent in 1997. 
   The current bond limit is the greater of $50 times population or $150 million. Cap growth is restricted by State population growth, which has been less than 5 percent nationwide over the past decade. During the same period, inflation has sliced bond purchasing power nearly in half, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
   Last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act included a partial, phased-in bond restoration among its limited tax provisions. However, the increase will not become effective until 2007. By then, nearly one-third of the purchasing power of Private Activity Bonds will have been lost even with the phase-in. 
   Bond restoration has strong bipartisan support. A majority of the Senate, and nearly three quarters of the House, cosponsored full restoration and indexation in the 105th Congress. Furthermore, three-quarters of the House, including nearly three-quarters of the Ways and Means Committee, cosponsored identical House legislation. 
   The Nation's governors and mayors, along with other State and local groups, and the public finance community strongly support full bond cap restoration. 
   I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the ``State and Local Investment Opportunity Act of 1999,'' so that their States can continue to make vital investments in their citizens and communities.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act.'' This bill addresses what is popularly known as the ``Y2K Problem'' or the ``Millennium Bug.'' It is supported by over 85 industry organizations and is important to the state of Utah, our nation's fastest growing high-tech state. 
   Due to a simple decision years ago to save space on computer punch cards, many computers and electronic devices around the world still express years in only two digits. As a result, these computers will be incapable of making a smooth transition to the next millennium. Technicians and economists have predicted that this problem, if not corrected in time, could result in either a recession or at least serious economic dislocation. 
   Over the last several years, the U.S. government and the private sector have made great strides in aggressively targeting the technology side of the Y2K problem. Although there remains much to do, many critical areas have already been addressed. 
   Last year, a unanimous Congress passed a bipartisan Senate Judiciary Committee-reported bill that unleashed the genius of the American private sector by fostering the sharing of remedial information on the Y2K problem. Prior to the bill's passage, various businesses were fearful of being sued if they shared corrective and other information concerning the Y2K problem. In essence, the bill insulates statements about Y2K information and solutions from being used as admissions in a court of law. This legislation has spurred solutions to the Y2K problem by increasing the amount of information available to address the Y2K challenge. 
   But while this first step was important, additional reforms are needed to aid innocent users and manufacturers and to nurture an environment where solutions to the Y2K problem will be forged. Last year's advances are threatened by frivolous Y2K lawsuits--which will disrupt and perhaps even cripple our courts, our high-tech industry, and thousands of businesses, large and small, around our nation. Indeed, one respected analyst recently estimated that the world-wide cost of Y2K-related litigation would be a staggering one trillion dollars. 
   The anticipated flood of lawsuits from those affected by the Y2K crisis may very well impede the progress we have been making in solving the problem. Companies of every variety will be forced to devote precious resources to litigation rather than to repairing and preventing computer problems, and many of these companies may even go bankrupt as a result. Our courts could very well be deluged with lawsuits, clogging the arteries of justice. These consequences must be addressed. 
   The legislation introduced today will ameliorate the Y2K dilemma in a fair and reasonable manner. One of the main features of this new Y2K bill is that it provides for a problem-solving, cooling off period before Y2K-related litigation may commence. The problem-solving period is designed to allow prospective plaintiffs an opportunity to describe the nature of the problem of which they seek legal remedy and give the prospective defendants an opportunity to respond and, if necessary, correct any material Y2K defect. 
   The parties may be able to resolve their disputes during the mediation period, thus forestalling the need for costly and time-consuming litigation. Correspondingly, the bill establishes an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to resolve private disputes and avoid litigation. 
   Of particular significance is the bill's limitations on damages. The bill limits punitive damages in Y2K-related suits to three times economic damages or $250,000, whichever is greater, or, if a small business is a defendant, whichever is lesser. This and other provisions will prevent frivolous lawsuits while preserving the ability of the truly injured to recover damages and to deter future abuses. 
   The bill also remediates potential problems arising out of Y2K-related class suits. Class action cases are currently a source of abuse, and this bill seeks to limit such abuses by allowing class actions to proceed only if a majority of class members' claims involve material defects relating to Y2K problems. Thus, as a practical matter, specious class action suits are barred. 
   The purpose of our bill is clear--to promote and increase the chances that innocent users and businesses gain access to solutions to the Y2K problem. And while the purpose is clear, we recognize that the solution is not simple, We have worked to produce a fair, reasoned bill that preserves the rights of all parties to settle disputes, but will help avert the potential disasters awaiting us if we choose not to act. 
   This bill reflects the high levels of cooperation and broad consensus that large manufactures, small businesses, the telecommunications industry, the information technology industry, electric utilities, and professional associations have been able to achieve. They  are all to be commended for their efforts in supporting this vitally important legislation. 
   Let me explain the bill in more detail. 
   I. PURPOSE OF THE BILL
   The bill's main purpose is to promote Y2K readiness and problem-solving by discouraging a wasteful diversion of resources that would otherwise support readiness and problem-solving toward Y2K-related litigation. Such a costly diversion of resources could exacerbate the risk of nationwide economic dislocation that the Y2K problem poses. Accordingly, the bill aims to prohibit Y2K-related litigation but to impose a slight delay 
   in its commencement so as to promote resolution of Y2K problems and disputes without resort to litigation. I believe this will benefit plaintiffs, defendants, consumers, businesses, and innocent users. We want to create an environment when people think, ``Let's try to solve it'' before they say, ``Let's sue them.'' 
   II. SUMMARY OF THE BILL'S PROVISIONS
   Pre-litigation Remediation Period (&#167;101): 
   If a person aggrieved by a year-2000-related (Y2K-related) problem wants to file a lawsuit based on that problem, he must first provide the prospective defendant, at least 90 days before filing suit, with notice regarding how the Y2K defect manifests itself, what injury he suffered or risk he bore as a result, and what relief he seeks. The only exception to this mandatory 90-day remediation period is if the prospective plaintiff is party to a contract that provides for a period of delay before suit for breach of contract may commence. In that case, the contract's waiting period prevails over the bill's. 
   If the prospective plaintiff fails to give notice to the prospective defendant, as outlined above, and sues anyway, the defendant can treat the plaintiff's lawsuit itself as a substitute notice, thus triggering the 90-day remediation period. If the 90-day remediation period is triggered by an actual lawsuit (instead of the notice) all discovery will be stayed and pleading deadlines will be tolled for the duration of the period. 
   The bill imposes responsibilities on prospective defendants as well as plaintiffs. If a defendant has been given notice, as outlined above, he must respond to this notice within 30 days of receiving it. In this response, the prospective defendant must state in writing his acknowledgement of receipt of the notice and what actions he will take or has taken to address the Y2K problem identified in the plaintiff's notice. Even if the plaintiff has not given notice and the defendant treats his actual lawsuit as substitute notice, the defendant must still respond to that notice within 30 days with all required particulars. 
   If the defendant fails to respond to the plaintiff's notice, then the remediation period terminates at the expiration of the defendant's 30-day response deadline; the lawsuit can then proceed. 
   Also of particular significance, the 90-day remediation period may be extended as part of mutual agreement of the parties to engage in alternative dispute resolution. See &#167;102(a). 
   Pleading Requirements (&#167;103): 
   The bill requires all Y2K plaintiffs seeking money damages to make a detailed statement in their lawsuits of the nature and amount of the damages they seek to recover, specific facts that form the basis for calculating those damages, and how material Y2K defects manifest themselves. In addition, if the claim being pursued requires proof that the defendant 
   acted with a particular state of mind, the plaintiff must ``state in detail the facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.'' 
   The bill allows the court to dismiss a Y2K lawsuit that fails to meet the above pleading requirements. However, the plaintiff can re-file his lawsuit with the required detailed statements and still get a chance to pursue his claim. 
   Duty to Mitigate (&#167;104): 
   This provision codifies the common-law rule that bars recovery of damages for injuries that the plaintiff could reasonably have been avoided. 
   Evidence of Reasonable Efforts and Contract Defenses (&#167;202(a)): 
   This provision allows a defendant, ``for the purpose of limiting or eliminating the defendant's liability,'' for breach of contract to offer evidence that his performance was ``reasonable in light of the circumstances.'' This would overcome any objection, based on Federal or State rules of evidence, that evidence of such reasonable-efforts performance is irrelevant to the issue of breach. Also, this provision expressly preserves the common-law and Uniform Commercial Code defenses of impossibility and impracticability. 
   Contract Damages Limit (&#167;203): 
   Contract damages are limited either to those provided for in a liquidated damages clause or by operation of law that governed the contract's interpretation at the time of contract formation. This does not alter present-day contract law. Rather, it is designed to preempt any State's attempt to change its contract law relating to Y2K problems after the contract that is the subject of the lawsuit was entered into. 
   Proportionate Liability in Tort Cases (&#167;301(b)): 
   This provision essentially codifies the tort doctrine of pure comparative negligence in that it requires the court to assign a percent share of liability to each person determined to have caused or contributed to the plaintiff's loss in proportion to the relative fault of each. Personal injury cases are exempt from this provision. 
   State of Mind and Foreseeability Requirements in Tort Cases (&#167;302): 
   This provision establishes a heightened state-of-mind element for three types of lawsuits: For fraud and negligent misrepresentation cases, the plaintiff must, in addition to proving all other elements of the claim, prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant ``actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known and substantial risk, that [a Y2K] failure would occur.'' For cases that require proof of gross negligence or recklessness, the plaintiff must, in addition to proving all other elements of the claim, prove by clear and 
   convincing evidence that the defendant ``actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known and substantial risk, that plaintiff would suffer [actual or potential] harm. For ordinary negligence cases, the plaintiff must, in addition to proving all other elements of the claim, prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant ``knew or reasonably should have known that its actions would cause harm to the plaintiff.'' 
   Reasonable Efforts Defense in Tort Cases (&#167;303): 
   Under this provision, a plaintiff may not recover simply by showing that a Y2K failure occurred in something that was under the control of the defendant. This is intended to avoid a defendant being held strictly liable for harm caused by a Y2K failure. Also, the bill provides the defendant with a complete defense to liability if he can show that he took reasonable efforts under the circumstances to prevent the Y2K failure or its attendant damages. Breach of contract cases are exempt from this provision. 
   Tort Punitive Damages Limit (&#167;304): 
   This provision limits punitive damages to either: (1) lesser of three times actual damages or $250,000 for individuals whose net worth is $500,000 or less and for small businesses; or (2) the greater of three times actual damages or $250,000 for all other defendants. 
   Limit on Economic Loss Recovery in Tort Cases (&#167;305): 
   This provision essentially codifies the common-law economic loss doctrine found in section 766C of the Restatement of Torts. Accordingly, the provision allows recovery of economic losses only when permitted by statute or judicial decision and (1) where permitted under a contract to which the plaintiff is a party; (2) where permitted under applicable law that governed interpretation of the contract at the time of contract formation; (3) when they are incidental to a Y2K-related personal injury claim; or (4) when they are incidental to a Y2K-related property damage claim. 
   Liability of Officers and Directors (&#167;306): 
   This provision limits the personal liability of corporate officers and directors to the greater of $100,000 or the amount of cash compensation such officer or director received in the year preceding the act or omission for which he was found liable. This limitation on personal liability does not apply where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the officer or director specifically intended to harm the plaintiff by (1) intentionally making materially misleading statements on  which the plaintiff relied or (2) intentionally withholding material information regarding a Y2K failure that he had a duty to disclose. This provision expressly does not pre-empt State law on liability of officers and directors. 
   Class Action Requirements: 
   Regarding Y2K-related class suits, the bill allows these actions to proceed only if a majority of class members' claims involve material Y2K defects. Also, only those individuals who have actual notice, as certified by the court, of the suit are entitled to join the class, unless they inform the court in writing prior to commencement of trial or entry of judgment of their desire to join the class. 
   Finally, the bill changes the requirements of Federal jurisdiction for Y2K-related actions in three respects: (1) there is no amount in controversy requirement for Federal diversity jurisdiction; (2) diversity of citizenship can be established as to any member of the class, not just the named members; and (3) plaintiffs as well as defendants can remove Y2K-related actions from state court to Federal court. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to emphasize that the Y2K problem is not a partisan issue. This is a bipartisan, fair bill. We must all work together--now--to ensure that a rush to the courts does not cripple the ability of American businesses to solve the Y2K problem swiftly, efficiently and without unnecessary distractions. The real beneficiaries of this bill will be individual consumers and businesses, the engine of the American economy. I ask my colleagues to support this worthwhile legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished Senators, Daniel Webster once observed that a ``sense of duty pursues us ever. It is omnipresent like the Deity. If we take to ourselves the wings of morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, duty performed or duty violated is still with us.......'' The duty which has faced each United States Senator is the obligation to do impartial justice in a matter of significant historical import with lasting consequences for our constitutional order--the consideration of the impeachment articles against President William Jefferson Clinton. 
   Our duty calls on us to answer a serious question--whether the President's actions warrant his removal from office. Fundamentally, in arriving at our individual decisions, we must consider what is in the best interests of the American people. The President engaged in conduct, that even his defenders recognize, was reprehensible and wrong. A bipartisan majority of the House also found that he committed serious, impeachable crimes. 
   So, the test for the Senate must be to do what's in the best interest of our nation. It is not a matter of what is easiest or cleanest. It is a matter of what is in the immediate and long term national interest. This has been, and it will continue to be, a subjective and difficult standard and one which I will discuss in greater detail later in my remarks. 
   First, however, I wish to speak on the Senate's procedural responsibility when sitting as a Court of Impeachment, the constitutional law concerning impeachable offenses, and the Articles of Impeachment at issue in the present case; finally, I will conclude with a discussion of whether--assuming the facts alleged have been proven--the best interests of the country would be served by removing President Clinton from office. 
   I. THE SENATE'S ROLE
   Let me begin by explaining what the role of the Senate is in the impeachment process. 
   Simply put, the Senate's role in the impeachment process is to try all impeachments. As Joseph Story wrote:  
   The power [to try impeachments] has been wisely deposited with the Senate....... That of all the departments of the government, `none will be found more suitable to exercise this peculiar jurisdiction than the Senate.' ..... Precluded from ever becoming accusers themselves, it is their duty not to lend themselves to the animosities of party, or the prejudices against individuals, which may sometimes unconsciously induce'' the other body. In serving as the tribunal for impeachments, we must strive to attain and demonstrate impartiality, integrity, intelligence and independence. If we fail to do so, the trial and our judgment will be flawed.--Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, Section 386.  
   In short, impeachment trials require Senators to act, wherever possible, with principled political neutrality. One question I have repeatedly asked myself during this scandal--when faced with questions concerning the interpretation of the relevant law, the process, the calls for resignation, or forgiveness--has been whether I would have taken the same position were this a Republican President. I have done this throughout the past year I and expect many of my colleagues have done the same. 
   In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of United States versus Nixon that the process by which the Senate tries impeachments was nonjusticiable. As a result of the Nixon decision, the Senate has a heightened constitutional obligation in impeachment cases. As constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt notes in his 1996 book, The Federal Impeachment process, ``Congress may make constitutional law--that is, make judgments about the scope and meaning of its constitutionally authorized impeachment function--subject to change only if Congress later changes its mind or by constitutional amendment. Thus, Nixon raised an issue about Congress's ability, in the absence of judicial review, to make reasonably principled constitutional decisions.'' 
   I believe the Senate has conducted this trial in a fair manner and that we have made principled constitutional decisions. I want to commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--in particular the Majority Leader, TRENT LOTT--for the impartial and proficient manner in which we have conducted our constitutional obligation. 
   At the core of our deliberations was the tension between, on the one hand, our shared interest in putting this matter behind us and getting on with the Nation's business, and, on the other hand, our interest in affording the President, and the weighty matter of impeachment, that process which is  due and fair. While there are decisions the Senate reached with which I differed, I want to make clear my view that the Senate has ably balanced these competing interests. A fair and full trial that we were once told would take one year has been completed in less than six weeks. The credit for this process rests with every Member of the Senate, with the House Managers, counsel for the President, and the Chief Justice. 
   II. THE IMPEACHMENT STANDARD
   Of great concern to me is what the standard should be for impeachment in this and future trials. The President's Counsel has argued that the President can only be removed for constituting, what Oliver Wendell Holmes termed in free speech cases, a ``clear and present danger.'' It was contended that a President can only be removed if he is a danger to the Constitution. As such, according to the President's Counsel, removable conduct must relate to egregious conduct related to performance in office. Even if the House's allegation--that President Clinton committed acts of perjury and obstruction of justice is proven true--it was 
   argued--than such behavior does not rise to impeachable offenses because it was private, not public, conduct. In this case an inappropriate sexual relation with a subordinate employee--was the predicate of the charged offenses. 
   But such a standard establishes an impossibly high bar as to render impotent the impeachment clauses of the Constitution. I hope that no matter the outcome of this trial, President Clinton's view of what constitutes an impeachable offense does not become precedent. If it does, I fear the moral framework of our Republic will be frayed. If it does, the legitimacy of our institutions may very well become tattered. It would create the paradox of being able to convict and jail an official for committing, let's say, homicide, but not to be able to remove that official from holding positions of public trust. Committing crimes of moral turpitude, such as perjury and obstruction of justice, go to the very heart of qualification for public office. 
   The overwhelming consensus of both legal and historical scholars is that the Constitution mandates the removal of the ``President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States''--which includes federal judges--``upon impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate of ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' (U.S. Const. Art. II. Sec. 4). The precise meaning of this latter clause is critical to the outcome of the impeachment trial. 
   The President's advocates agree with their critics that this standard is the sole standard for presidential impeachment, but contend that the ``or other'' phrase indicates that grounds for impeachment must be criminal in nature because treason and bribery are crimes or acts committed against the state. 
   Such crimes or acts must be heinous, they contend, because the term ``crimes and misdemeanors'' is preceded by the descriptive adjective ``high'' in the impeachment clause. These advocates also claim that there exists no proof of criminal wrongdoing, that we have evidence of only a private affair unrelated to performance in public office, and that abuse of power related to official conduct--not present here--is a prerequisite for impeachment. 
   Many learned scholars oppose this view. Looking at the debates in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, they note that the Convention originally chose treason and bribery as the sole standard for impeachment. George Mason argued that this standard was too stringent and advocated that ``maladministration'' be added to the list. James Madison objected, believing that no coherent definition of ``maladministration'' existed and that such a lenient standard would make the President a pawn of the Senate. The Convention, as a result, settled on the phrase ``treason, bribery or other high crime or misdemeanor.'' It is clear that the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' was considered by the Framers to have a more narrow and specific meaning and, indeed, it is a term taken from English precedent. 
   Accordingly, many scholars, including Raoul Berger, the dean of impeachment scholars (Impeachment: the Constitutional Problems (1973)), contend that the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is a common law term of art that reaches both private and public behavior. Treason and bribery are acts that harm society in that they constitute a corruption on the body politic. Consequently, ``other high crimes and misdemeanors'' encompasses similar 
   acts of corruption or betrayals of trust, and need not constitute formal crimes. Indeed, Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist No. 65 makes clear that impeachment is political, not criminal, in nature and reaches conduct that goes to reputation and character. In the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries the term ``misdemeanor'' refers not to a petty crime, but to bad demeanor. 
   History thus demonstrates that acts or conduct that demeans the integrity of the office, or harms an individual's reputation in such a way as to engender a lack of public confidence in the office holder or the political system is an impeachable offense. Justice Joseph Story, in his celebrated Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States &#167;762 (1835), made this abundantly clear when he wrote that impeachment lies for private behavior that harms the society or demeans its institutions:  
   In the first place, the nature of the functions to be performed: The offences, to which the power of impeachment has been, and is ordinarily applied, as a remedy, are of a political character. Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power, (for, as we shall presently see, treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors are expressly within it;) but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed, political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct, or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, in the discharge of the duties of political office.  
   Even though the Framers rejected the English model of impeachment as a form of punishment and promulgated removal as the remedy for conviction, most scholars contend that the Framers looked to English precedent to define ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' There is a wealth of evidence that a betrayal of public trust or reckless conduct that places a high office in disrepute constitutes ``high misdemeanors.'' The modifier ``high'' refers to acts against the state or commonwealth. In the eighteenth century, the term ``political'' also encompassed our modern term of ``social.'' So conduct that harmed society as a whole, or denigrated the public respect and confidence in governmental institutions, constituted ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
   As such, both English and American officials have been impeached for drunkenness, for frequenting prostitutes, even for insanity, in other words private conduct that is unrelated to official acts. Such behavior is seen as defaming the office that the accused held and diminishing the people's faith in government. Impeachment is thus seen by many scholars as a means of removing unqualified office holders. 
   Thus, impeachment and removal does not have to be predicated upon commission of a crime. Consequently, impeachment and removal is not in essentially a criminal punishment, a conclusion that is also textually demonstrated by the fact that the Framers expressly provided for later indictment and criminal conviction of an impeached and removed President. 
   A high crime and misdeameanor--according to this view--does not have to amount to a crime or be related to official conduct. Even if President Clinton's acts of perjury were 
   predicated upon lying about a private sexual relation, they still must be considered high crimes and misdemeanors. The fact that the underlying behavior was private in its genesis is irrelevant. Such private acts demean the Office of the President, and betray public trust. Those acts therefore are impeachable. 
   But I must emphasize that even if the President's Counsel is correct in that private acts unrelated to performance in office are not impeachable offenses, I believe the gravamen of what President Clinton committed are public, not private, acts that are unambiguous breaches of public trust. Perjury and particularly obstruction of justice are conduct that attack the very veracity of our justice system. (Furthermore, I vehemently disagree that the underlying conduct was a purely private concern because the conduct involved a federal employee in a work environment). 
   Lying under oath, hiding evidence, and tampering with witnesses destroy  the truth-finding function of our investigatory and trial system. Perjury and obstruction of justice are particularly pernicious if committed by a President of the United States, who has sworn pursuant to the oath of office to protect the Constitution and laws of the United States. Whether perjury and obstruction of justice can be considered private or public acts is of no moment. They are twin ``high crimes'' harming the political order and requiring impeachment and removal from office. 
   A related argument made by the President's Counsel is that a President should be held to a less stringent standard than federal judges in impeachment trials. Because many judges have been removed for conduct unrelated to performance in office, such as Judges Clairborne and Nixon, who were convicted and removed for perjurious statements unrelated to their performance in office, the President is almost compelled to make this argument. 
   In essence, The President's Counsel contend that Article III's requirement that judges hold office for ``good behavior'' is not simply a description of the term of office, but a grounds for impeachment if violated. Presidents--and other civil officers--are subject to the more stringent high crimes and misdemeanor standard. 
   Most scholars reject this view. For instance, Michael J. Gerhardt (The Federal Impeachment Process (1996)) testified in the House Constitutional Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee in November that the impeachment standard of high crimes and misdemeanors applies to all civil officers, including judges as well as the President. This is the sole constitutional ground for impeachment. Article III's good behavior provision for judges simply sets the duration for judicial office (lifetime unless impeached). There are simply no differing standards for judges and the President. 
   III. ARTICLE ONE--PERJURY
   Let me now turn to the facts of this case. The House alleges in Article I that the President should be removed because he committed acts of perjury. The House alleges in Article II that the President should be removed because he obstructed and interfered with the 
   mechanisms and duly constituted processes of the justice system. 
   To demonstrate why I believe it is so, it is necessary to discuss both the legal standards and how the facts meet the requirements of those standards. I will first discuss perjury, and, next, turn to obstruction of justice.

   Mr. HATCH. I concur with my colleagues. This is a very important tax credit for alternative fuels. It is an issue of fairness, not one of corporate welfare. 
   Earlier this year I, along with 18 of my colleagues, introduced a bill that would extend for eight months the placed-in-service date for coal and biomass facilities. The need still exists to extend this date and I am very disappointed that this was not included.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, even as the Senate has been weighing historic matters, the important work of the Judiciary Committee has gone forward as well. I am pleased to report that the Judiciary Committee is working to develop an agenda that will continue the Senate's commitment to the American people to make our streets safe from crime, to ensure that the benefits of this great technological and communications age reach all our people unencumbered by artificial legal barriers, and to ensure that we preserve and protect the rule of law. I will have more to say in the coming days about this agenda. Today, however, I would like to focus my comments on what I believe are highly irresponsible cuts to administration of justice programs in the President's budget proposal. 
   This year, criminal justice issues should and will once again require the attention of the Senate. Many of our communities are not sharing equally in the decline in crime rates. For instance, according to FBI data, while the rate of violent crimes decreased nationally by four percent in 1997, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports demonstrate that in the Mountain West, the decline was only 2.4 percent, and my state of Utah posted a slight increase. Similarly, property crimes decreased nationally 3.1 percent, but only decreased one-half of one percent in the Mountain West. Again, my state of Utah actually had an increase in property crime. Compared to rates in the Northeast, the violent crime rate is 46.4 percent higher in the West and 52.1 percent higher in the South. 
   And it is not just crime rates that need further improvement. The youth drug epidemic continues to plague us. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse's Monitoring the Future surveys, drug use among our youth has grown substantially, and recent marginal improvement cannot hide the fact that more of our young people than ever are ensnared by drugs. From 1991 to 1998, the lifetime use of marijuana--the gateway to harder drugs--has increased among school-age youth. The number of 8th graders reporting to have ever used marijuana has increased by 55 percent from 1991 to 1998, and the number of 8th graders who have used marijuana within the past year has increased by 173 percent in that same time. 
   Not surprisingly, then, use of harder drugs has also increased. The number of 8th graders who have used cocaine within the past year has increased by 181 percent from 1991 to 1998, and the number these students who have used heroin within the past year has increased by 86 percent in the same time period. And significantly, 1997 to 1998, lifetime heroin use by 8th and 10th graders has increased by 0.2 percent, meaning that the use of this deadly drug is still on the rise among our youth. 
   Because we have so far to go in our fight against crime and drugs, I am particularly disturbed by the President's proposed budget for the Department of Justice. The Clinton budget provides only a marginal 1.6 percent increase in DOJ funding for FY 2000. But even this slight increase pales compared to the massive cuts President  Clinton is proposing in assistance to state and local law enforcement. Let me alert my colleagues to what the President is proposing. 
   Undisclosed by the Administration's spin machine and most media reports, President Clinton is proposing more than $1.5 billion in cuts to state and local crime fighting efforts. Among the programs on the President's chopping block is the entire Violent Offender and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grant program. This program has, by any measure, been a tremendous success, providing critical seed money to states for bricks and mortar prison construction and thus making our streets safer. 
   Incarceration deters crime. Dramatic and historic reductions in sentence lengths and the expectation of punishment from the 1950s onward fueled steep increases in crime in the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties. Only after these incarceration trends began to be reversed in this decade, did crime rates start to fall also. 
   The Violent Offender and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grant program has been an important component of this effort. In response to federal assistance, states have changed their sentencing laws. As the President's own Justice Department reported just last month, because of this program, 70 percent of prison admissions in 1997 were in states requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. The average time served by violent criminals has increased 12.2 percent since 1993. With such success, why would the President want to eliminate this program? 
   And he doesn't stop there. Also eliminated in the President's budget is the highly successful Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program, which since 1995 has provided more than $2 billion in funding for equipment and technology directly to state and local law enforcement. The President wants to cut 20 percent from the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which he signed into law just last year, to provide vests to protect officers whose departments otherwise could not afford this life-saving equipment. The President wants to cut $50 million from the successful and popular Byrne Grant program, which provides funding for numerous state crime-fighting 
   initiatives, and he proposes funding changes that put this program at further risk in future budgets. The President wants to cut by $85 million funding that reimburses states for the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens. He wants to cut $4 million from the Violence Against Women program, and $12.5 million from COPS grants targeting violence against women. And the Clinton budget slashes the entire juvenile accountability block grant, which over the past two years has provided $500 million for states and local government to address the single most ominous crime threat we face--serious and violent juvenile crime. 
   Mr. President, the recent gains of state and local law enforcement in the fight against violent crime are fragile, and have been based largely on the Congress's endless push to place the interests of the law abiding over the establishment of new social spending programs. Time and again, Congress has had to remind President Clinton that government's first domestic responsibility is to keep our streets and communities free from crime. 
   From the earliest days of the Clinton Administration, the President proposed severe cuts in law enforcement. For example, in March 1993, the President took the unprecedented step of firing every incumbent United States Attorney, a move the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts later said contributed to significant declines in federal prosecutions. 
   In 1994, the President proposed cutting 1,523 Department of Justice law enforcement positions, including 847 in the FBI, 355 in the DEA, and 143 in U.S. Attorney's offices. Congress said no. 
   In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the President has proposed cuts to state and local law enforcement assistance. Congress has said no. 
   And ever since 1995, the President has wanted to use badly needed prison construction grants intended for bricks and mortar to fund drug treatment and other social programs not shown to have the same crime deterrent effect. Congress has said no. 
   Now the President wants to cut the program entirely, and make further cuts in assistance to state and local law enforcement. Let me summarize these cuts: 
   $50 million in Byrne grants for state and local law enforcement--Cut. 
   $523 million in Local Law Enforcement Block Grants--Cut. 
   $645 million in Truth in Sentencing Grants--Cut. 
   $85 million for criminal alien incarceration--Cut. 
   $250 million for juvenile crime and accountability grants--Cut. 
   $4 million in Violence Against Women Grants--Cut. 
   $12.5 million in COPS grants targeting domestic violence--Cut. 
   Even the President's own COPS program--$125 million Cut. 
   And what does the President want to fund? $200 million for a program to turn prosecutors into social workers, who ``focus on the offender, rather than the specific offense,'' and provide punishments such as recreational programs for criminals up to age 22 who commit violent offenses, including weapons offenses, drug distribution, hate crimes, and civil rights violations. 
   It appears that Congress will have to say no again, and once again remind President Clinton that our government's first domestic duty is to protect the people from crime and violence. I will have more to say in the coming days about the President's budget and the Judiciary Committee's agenda, but suffice it to say, however, that I find President Clinton's budget for Administration of Justice spending is in need of significant attention. 
   I intend to see that this budget and administration of justice programs get that attention. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would like to advise my colleagues that a priority of the Committee this year will be the reauthorization of the Department of Justice. Included in this will be efforts to address expiring authorizations from the 1994 crime law, a number of which have been vital to assisting state and local government in reducing crime. I hope and expect that we will consider, on a bipartisan basis, the important funding and policy questions inherent in this effort, so to ensure that the Department can continue into the next century its important mission of upholding the rule of law. 
   We will hold a series of hearings, both in the newly established Criminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee and at Full Committee, with the goal being to ensure that the Department of Justice is making the most of the precious law enforcement dollars appropriated and that essential law enforcement priorities are being met for the American people. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' attention. I look forward to working with them on these important matters. I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.

    Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 324, the ``Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999''--the DATA Act. The goal in this bill is simple but it is important: S. 324 attempts to help make drug treatment more available and more effective. 
   In developing this legislation I have worked closely with Representative THOMAS BLILEY of Virginia, Chairman of the House Committee on Commerce who plans to introduce shortly the House counterpart of this bill. I am very pleased to report that in sponsoring this bi-partisan bill I am joined by two colleagues from across the aisle--Senator LEVIN from Michigan and Senator MOYNIHAN from New York. Senators LEVIN and MOYNIHAN and I have long shared an interest in speeding the development of anti-addiction medications. 
   One of the most troublesome problems that our Nation faces today is drug abuse. The spectrum of deleterious by-products of drug abuse include rampant and often violent crime, breakdown in family life and other fundamental social structures, and the inability of addicted individuals to reach their full potential as contributing members of American society. For example, a 1997 report by the Utah State Division of Substance Abuse, ``Substance Abuse and Need for Treatment Among Juvenile Arrestees in Utah'' cites literature reporting that heroin-using offenders committed 15 times more robberies, 20 times more burglaries, and 10 times more thefts than offenders who do not use drugs. 
   In my own state of Utah--I am sorry to report--a 1997 survey by the State Division of Substance Abuse reported that 9.6% of Utahns--one in ten of our citizens--used illicit drugs in the past month. That is simply too high. 
   Unfortunately, no state or city in our great Nation is immune from the dangers of illicit drugs. I want the children of Utah to grow up drug free so that they may realize their enormous potential. And I want to help my neighbors in Salt Lake and fellow citizens across Utah and throughout the country who are addicted to break the grip of this deadly epidemic. 
   The wide variety of negative behaviors associated with drug abuse require policymakers to employ a wide variety of techniques to cut down both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. We must do all we can do to stop the criminal behavior involved in supplying the contraband products as well as taking steps to stop all Americans from starting or continuing to use drugs. 
   This legislation I am introducing today focuses on increasing the availability and effectiveness of drug treatment. The purpose of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 is to allow qualified physicians, as determined by experts at the Department of Health and Human Services, to prescribe schedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in physicians' offices without an additional Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration if certain conditions are met. 
   These conditions include certification by participating physicians that: they are licensed under state law and have the training and experience to treat opium addicts; they have the capacity to refer patients to counseling and other ancillary services; and they will not treat more than 20 in an office setting unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services adjusts this number. 
   The DATA provisions allow the Secretary, as appropriate, to add to these conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a physician's DEA registration if these conditions are violated. This program will continue after three years only if the Secretary and Attorney General determine that this new type of decentralized treatment should not continue based on a number of determinations. These determinations include whether the availability of drug treatment has significantly increased without adverse consequences to the public health and the extent to which covered drugs have been diverted or dispensed in violation of the law such as exceeding the initial 20-patient per doctor limitation. This bill would allow the Secretary and Attorney General to discontinue the program earlier than three years if, upon consideration of the specified factors, they determine that early termination is advisable. 
   Nothing in the waiver policy undertaken in the new bill is intended to change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or other facilities or practitioners that conduct drug treatment services under the dual registration system imposed by current law. 
   In drafting the waiver provisions of the bill, the co-sponsors have consulted with the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. As well, this initiative is consistent with the recent announcement of the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, General Barry McCaffrey, of the Administration's intent to work to decentralize methadone treatment.  
   In 1995, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences issued a report, ``Development of Medications for Opiate and Cocaine Addictions: Issues for the Government and Private Sector.'' The study called for ``(d)eveloping flexible, alternative means of controlling the dispensing of anti-addiction narcotic medications that would avoid the `methadone model' of individually approved treatment centers.'' 
   The Drug Addiction Treatment Act--DATA--is exactly the kind of policy initiative that experts have called for in America's multifaceted response to the drug abuse epidemic. I recognize that the DATA legislation is just one mechanism to attack this problem and I plan to work with my colleagues to devise additional strategies to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs. I urge all my colleagues to support S. 324 because it promises to get more patients into treatment and back on the road to honest, productive lives.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by Senator SESSIONS, the distinguished chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, as well as Senator DEWINE. 
   There are few issues that will come before the Senate this year that touch the lives of more of our fellow Americans than our national response to juvenile crime. Crime and delinquency among juveniles is a problem that troubles us in our neighborhoods, schools and parks. It is the subject across the dinner table, and in those late night, worried conversations all parents have had at one time or another. The subject is familiar--how can we prevent our children from falling victim--either to crime committed by another juvenile, or to the lure of drugs, crime, and gangs. 
   Their concerns should be our concerns. The sad reality is that we can no longer sit silently by as children kill children, as teenagers commit truly heinous offenses, as our juvenile drug abuse rate continues to climb. In 1997, juveniles accounted for nearly one fifth--18.7 percent--of all criminal arrests in the United States. Persons under 18 committed 13.5 percent of all murders, over 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 30 percent of all robberies, and 50 percent of all arsons. 
   In 1997, 183 juveniles under 15 were arrested for murder. Juveniles under 15 were responsible for 6.5 percent of all rapes, 14 percent of all burglaries, and one third of all arsons. And, unbelievably, juveniles under 15--who are not old enough to legally drive in any state--in 1997 were responsible for 10.3 percent of all auto thefts. 
   To put this in some context, consider this: in 1997, youngsters age 15 to 19, who are only 7 percent of the population, committed 22.2 percent of all crimes, 21.4 percent of violent crimes, and 32 percent of property crimes. 
   And although there are endless statistics on our growing juvenile crime problem, one 
   particularly sobering fact is that, between 1985 and 1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year olds increased 207 percent. We have kids involved in murder before they can even drive. 
   Even my state of Utah has not been immune from these trends. Indeed, a 1997 study by Brigham Young University Professor Richard Johnson found that Utah's juvenile arrest rate is the highest in the nation. Additionally, as an indication of the increasingly serious nature of juvenile offenses in Utah, between 1990 and 1996 the number of juveniles sentenced to youth corrections increased 142 percent, and the number of juveniles requiring detention in a secure facility more than doubled. And in 1995, the average Utah juvenile offender had accumulated an astonishing average of 23 misdemeanors, 8 felony convictions, and 2.4 status offense convictions before being sentenced to a secure youth facility. 
   In short, our juvenile crime problem has taken a new and sinister direction. But cold statistics alone cannot tell the whole story. Crime has real effects on the lives of real people. Last fall, I read an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch by my good friend, crime novelist Patricia Cornwell. It is one of the finest pieces I have read on the effects of and solutions to our juvenile crime problem. 
   Let me share with my colleagues some of what Ms. Cornwell, who has spent the better part of her adult life studying and observing crime and its effects, has to say. She says ``when a person is touched by violence, the fabric of civility is forever rent, or ripped, or breached .....'' This is a graphic but accurate description. Countless lives can be ruined by a single violent crime. There is, of course, the victim, who may be dead, or scarred for life. There are the family and friends of the victim, who are traumatized as well, and who must live with the loss of a loved one. Society itself is harmed, when each of us is a little more frightened to walk on our streets at night, to use an ATM, or to jog or bike in our parks. And, yes, there is the offender who has chosen to throw his or her life away. Particularly when the offender is a juvenile, family, friends, and society are made poorer for the waste of potential in every human being. One crime, but permanent effects when ``the fabric of civility is rent.'' 
   This is the reality that has driven me to work for the last three years to address this issue. In this effort, I have been joined by a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which last Congress reported comprehensive legislation on a bipartisan,  two to one vote. Indeed, among members of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, the vote was seven to two in favor of the bill. 
   The Judiciary Committee's legislation last Congress would have fundamentally reformed the role played by the federal government in addressing juvenile crime in our Nation. It was supported by law enforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers Coalition, as well as the support of juvenile justice practitioners such as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and victim's groups including the National Victims Center and the National Organization for Victims Assistance. 
   The bill we introduce today builds on those efforts. Our reform proposal includes the best of what we know works. It combines tough measures to protect the public from the worst juvenile criminals, smart measures to provide intervention and correction at the earliest acts of delinquency, and compassionate measures to rehabilitate juvenile offenders and to supplement and enhance extensive existing prevention programs to keep juveniles out of the cycle of crime, violence, drugs, and gangs. 
    Mr. President, let me spell out in great detail the provisions of this bill, and how it will help reform the juvenile justice system that is failing the victims of juvenile crime, failing too many of our young people, and ultimately, failing to protect the public. 
   First, this bill reforms and streamlines the federal juvenile code, to responsibly address the handful of cases each year involving juveniles who commit crimes under federal jurisdiction. Our bill sets a uniform age of 14 for the permissive transfer of juvenile defendants to adult court, permits prosecutors and the Attorney General to make the decision whether to charge a juvenile offender as an adult, and permits in certain circumstances juveniles charged as an adult to petition the court to be returned to juvenile status. 
   It also provides that when prosecuted as adults, juveniles in Federal criminal cases will be subject to the same procedures and penalties as adults, except for the application of mandatory minimums in most cases. Of course, the death penalty would not be available as punishment for any offense committed before the juvenile was 18. 
   The bill similarly provides that juveniles tried as adults and sentenced to prison must serve their entire sentences, and may not be released on the basis of attaining their majority, and applies to juveniles convicted as adults the same provisions of victim restitution, including mandatory restitution, that apply to adults. 
   Finally, in reforming the federal system, I believe that we must lead by example. So our bill provides that the federal criminal records of juveniles tried as adults, and the federal delinquency records of juveniles adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses such as murder, rape, armed robbery, and sexual abuse or assault, will be treated for all purposes in the same manner as the records of adults for the same offenses. Other federal felony juvenile criminal or delinquency records would be treated the same as adult records for criminal justice or national security background check purposes. 
   The bill also permits juvenile federal felony criminal and delinquency records to be provided to schools and colleges under rules issued by the Attorney General, provided that recipients of the records are held to privacy standards and that the records not be used to determine admission. 
   Let me assure any who may be concerned that it is not our intent in reforming the federal juvenile code to federalize juvenile crime--indeed, no conduct that is not a federal crime now will be if this reform is enacted. I do not intend or expect a substantial increase in the number of juvenile cases adjudicated or prosecuted in federal court. It is our intent, rather, to ensure that when there is a federal crime warranting the federal prosecution of a juvenile, the federal government assumes its responsibility to deal with it, rather than saddling the states with that burden. 
   Second, at the heart of this bill is an historic reform and reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, the most comprehensive review of that legislation in 25 years. The States for several years have been far ahead of the Federal Government in implementing innovative reforms of their juvenile justice systems. For example, between 1992 and 1996, of the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 48 made substantive changes to their juvenile justice systems. Among the trends in State law changes are the removal of more serious and violent offenders from the juvenile justice system, in favor of criminal court prosecution; new and innovative disposition/sentencing options for juveniles; and the revision, in favor of openness, of traditional confidentiality provisions relating to juvenile proceedings and records. 
   While the States have been making fundamental changes in their approaches to juvenile justice, however, the Federal Government has made no significant change to its approach and has done little to encourage State and local reform. Thus, the juvenile justice terrain has shifted beneath the Federal Government, leaving its programs and policies out of step and largely irrelevant to the needs of State and local governments. This bill corrects this imbalance between State and Federal juvenile justice policy, and will help ensure that federal programs support the needs of State and local governments. 
   First, our bill reforms and strengthens the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) of the Department of Justice. The effectiveness of the OJJDP will be enhanced by requiring its Administrator to present to Congress annual plans, with measurable goals, to control and prevent youth crime, coordinate all Federal programs relating to controlling and preventing youth crime, and disseminate to States and local governments data on the prevention, correction and control of juvenile crime and delinquency, and report on successful programs and methods. 
   And, most important to state and local governments, in the future, OJJDP will serve as a single point of contact for States, localities, and private entities to apply for and coordinate all federal assistance and programs related to juvenile crime control and delinquency prevention. This one-stop-shopping for federal programs and assistance will help state and local governments focus on the problem, instead of on how to navigate the federal bureaucracy. 
   Second, our reform bill consolidates numerous JJDPA programs, including Part C Special Emphasis grants, State challenge grants, boot camps, and JJDPA Title V incentive grants, under an enhanced $200 million per year prevention challenge block grant to the States. The bill also reauthorizes the JJDPA Title II Part B State formula grants. In doing so, it also reforms the current core mandates on the States relating to the incarceration of juveniles to ensure the protection of juveniles in custody while providing state and local governments with needed flexibility. 
   This flexibility is particularly important to rural states, where immediate access to a juvenile detention facility might be difficult. Since many communities cannot afford separate juvenile and adult facilities, law enforcement officers must drive hours to transport juvenile offenders to the nearest facility, instead of patrolling the streets. Another unintended consequence of JJDPA is the release of juvenile offenders because no beds are available in juvenile facilities or because law enforcement officials cannot afford to transport youths to juvenile facilities. Juvenile criminals are released even though space is available to detain them in adult facilities. Our reform will provide the states with a degree of flexibility which currently does not exist. 
   However, this flexibility is not provided at the expense of juvenile inmate safety. The bill strictly prohibits placing juvenile offenders in jail cells with adults. No one supports the placing of children in cells with adult offenders. To be clear--nothing in the bill will expose juveniles to any physical contact by adult offenders. Indeed, the legislation is explicit that, if states are to qualify for federal funds, they may not place juvenile delinquents in detention under conditions in which the juvenile can have physical contact, much less be physically harmed by, an adult inmate.  
   These provisions are largely based on H.R. 1818 from the 105th Congress, but are improved to ensure that abuse of juvenile delinquent inmates is not permitted by incorporating definitions of what constitutes unacceptable contact between juvenile delinquents and adult inmates. 
   Third, and finally, our reform of the JJDPA reauthorizes and strengthens those other parts of the JJDPA that have proven effective. For example, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act are reauthorized and funded. Gang prevention programs are reauthorized. And important, successful programs to provide mentoring for young people in trouble with the law or at risk of getting into trouble with the law are reauthorized and expanded. Operating through the Cooperative Extension Service program sponsored by the Department of Agriculture, the University of Utah has developed a ground-breaking and highly successful program that mentors to entire families--pairing college age mentors with juveniles in trouble or at risk of getting in trouble with the law, and pairing senior citizen couples with the juvenile's parents and siblings. This program gets great bang for the buck. So our bill provides demonstration funds to expand this program and replicate its success in other states. 
   Finally, our bill provides an important new program to encourage state programs that provide accountability in their juvenile justice systems. All or nearly all of our states have taken great strides in reforming their systems, and it is time for the federal government's programs to catch up and provide needed assistance. 
   Despite reforms in recent years, all too often, the juvenile justice system ignores the minor crimes that lead to the increasingly frequent serious and tragic juvenile crimes capturing headlines. Unfortunately, many of these crimes might have been prevented had the warning signs of early acts of delinquency or antisocial behavior been heeded. A delinquent juvenile's critical first brush with the law is a vital aspect of preventing future crimes, because it teaches an important lesson--what behavior will be tolerated. Accountability is not just about punishment--although punishment is frequently needed. It is about teaching consequences and providing rehabilitation to youth offenders. 
   According to a recent Department of Justice study, juveniles adjudicated for so-called index crimes--such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, and auto theft--began their criminal careers at an early age. The average age for a juvenile committing an index offense is 14.5 years, and typically, by age 7, the future criminal is already showing minor behavior problems. If we can intervene early enough, however, we might avert future tragedies. Our bill provides a new Juvenile Accountability Block Grant to reform federal policy that has been complicit in the system's failure, and provide states with much needed funding for a system of graduated sanctions, including community service for minor crimes, electronically monitored home detention, boot camps, and traditional detention for more serious offenses. 
   And let there be no mistake--detention is needed as well. Our first priority should be to keep our communities safe. We simply have to ensure that violent people are removed from our midst, no matter their age. When a juvenile commits an act as heinous as the worst adult crime, he or she is not a kid anymore, and we shouldn't treat them as kids. 
   State receipt of the incentive grants would be conditioned on the adoption of three core accountability policies: the establishment of graduated sanctions to ensure appropriate 
   correction of juvenile offenders, drug testing juvenile offenders upon arrest in appropriate cases; and recognition of victims rights and needs in the juvenile justice system. 
   Meaningful reform also requires that a juvenile's criminal record ought to be accessible to police, courts, and prosecution, so that we can know who is a repeat or serious offender. Right now, these records simply are not generally available in NCIC, the national system that tracks adult criminal records. Thus, if a juvenile commits a string of felony offenses, and no record is kept, the police, prosecutors, judges or juries will never know what he did. Maybe for his next offense, he'll get a light sentence or even probation, since it appears he's committed only one felony in his life instead 10 or 15. Such a system makes no sense, and it doesn't protect the public. 
   So the reform we offer in this bill also provides the first federal incentives for the integration of serious juvenile criminal records into the national criminal history database, together with federal funding for the system. 
   Finally, we all recognize the value of education in preventing juvenile crime and rehabilitating juvenile offenders. When trouble-causing juveniles remain in regular classrooms, they frequently make it difficult for all other students to learn. Yet, removing such juveniles from the classroom without addressing their educational needs virtually guarantees that they will fall further into the vortex of crime and delinquency. The costs are high--to the juvenile, but also to victims and to society. These juveniles too frequently become crime committing adults, with all the costs that implies--costs to victims, and the cost of incarcerating the offenders to protect the public. So our bill tries to break this cycle, by providing a three-year $45 million demonstration project to provide alternative education to juveniles in trouble with or at risk of getting in trouble with the law. 
   The bill we introduce today authorizes significant funding for the programs I have described. In all, our bill authorizes $1 billion per year for 5 years, in the following categories: $450 million per year for Juvenile Accountability Block Grants; $435 million per year for prevention programs under the JJDPA, including $200 million for Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grants, $200 million for Part B Formula grant prevention programs, and $35 million for Gangs, Mentoring and Discretionary grant programs; $75 million per year for grants to states to upgrade and enhance juvenile felony criminal record histories and to make such records available within NCIC, the national criminal history database used by law enforcement, the courts, and prosecutors; and $40 million per year for NIJ research and evaluation of the effectiveness of juvenile delinquency prevention programs. 
   Additionally, the bill authorizes $100 million per year for joint Federal-State-local law enforcement task forces to address gang crime in areas with high concentrations of gang activity. $75 million per year of this funding is authorized for establishment and operation of High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas, and the remaining $25 million per year is authorized for community-based prevention and intervention for gang members and at-risk youth in gang areas. 
   And, finally, as I have already noted, the bill authorizes $45 million over 3 years for innovative alternative education programs to make our schools safer places of learning while helping ensure that the youth most at risk do not get left behind. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, let me address a provision in the bill which will prohibit firearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. This section extends the ban in current law on firearm ownership by certain felons to certain juvenile offenders. Juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for an offense which would be a serious violent felony as defined in 18 U.S.C. 3559(C)(2)(f)(i)--the federal three strikes statute--were the offense committed by an adult will no longer be able to legally own firearms. This is common sense. If tried and convicted as adults, these criminals would automatically forfeit their right to own a gun. 
   However, we should learn our lesson as well from the so-called domestic violence gun ban enacted several years ago. If the offense records that allow us to know who is covered by the ban are not available, the law is hollow, or worse--it will be enforced only in arbitrary cases. For this reason, the ban we propose is prospective only, applying only to delinquent acts committed after records of such offenses are routinely available within the National Instant Check System instituted pursuant to the Brady Law. 
   We should also resist seeing this provision as any sort of panacea. Laws banning 
   criminals from owning firearms have not stopped them from doing so, for a simple reason--criminals do not respect or obey the law. So  while this provision is an appropriate step, we should be under no illusion that it is the answer to our juvenile crime problem. 
   Mr. President, I believe that we all agree that it is far better to prevent the fabric of civility from being rent than to deal with the aftermath of juvenile crime. In the face of a confounding problem like juvenile crime, it is tempting to look for easy answers. I do not believe that we should succumb to this temptation. We are faced, I believe, with a problem which cannot be solved solely by the enactment of new criminal prohibitions. It is at its core a moral problem. Somehow, too frequently we have failed as a society to pass along to the next generation the moral compass that differentiates right from wrong. This cannot be legislated. It will not be restored by the enactment of a new law or the implementation of a new program. But it can be achieved by communities working together to teach accountability by example and by early intervention when the signs clearly point to violent and antisocial behavior. 
   Mr. President, that is what the bill we introduce is all about. It is a comprehensive approach to this national problem. I believe that it now is time for the Senate to act. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation, to support it, and to support its early debate and passage by the Senate.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great and escalating importance: database piracy. While perhaps not an issue on the tips of most Americans' tongues, it is nevertheless an issue that has garnered considerable attention in recent years both in the United States and in international forums. The 106th Congress is now the third consecutive Congress in which database legislation will be considered. This is an appropriate reflection of the fact that while intellectual property has become the heart of our Nation's economy, information is its lifeblood. 
   Utahns are interested in an appropriate balance of interest here. Utah is a leader in the hi-tech and information industries, and is home to both producers and users of information and database collections. Utah is blessed with world class scientists and scholars, genealogists, and computer and hi-tech companies that create new information, organize information, and use information--often using information created by others in innovative ways to create new information or to make it more easily or inexpensively accessible. I would guess that most of my colleagues would find that similarly in their own home states that many of their constituents are interested in this issue at some level because so many are producers or users of information, and often both. 
   American database providers render an invaluable service by collecting, organizing, and disseminating billions of bits of information from myriad sources of every possible sector of our economy. They give us such widely-used tools as phone books, directories, catalogs, almanacs, encyclopedias, and other reference guides. They provide specialized products like statistical abstracts, medical and pharmaceutical reference tools, stock quotes, pricing guides, genealogical data and countless other sources of information for businesses, researchers, scientists, educators, and consumers. Indeed, it is the information they collect that allows us to predict the weather, to treat disease, to preserve our national security, to use computers to communicate over global networks, like the Internet, to travel, to buy a home, and even to watch the evening news. 
   It is not surprising that the cost of creating and maintaining accurate, reliable, and user-friendly databases is significant. Yet, the commercial viability of these products has, for many years, served as an incentive to investment and spawned a thriving information industry in the United States. Nevertheless, events in the past several years have caused some to question the continued viability of these products, raising the question of whether current law is sufficient to maintain the same sort of incentives that have served to keep the United States on the cutting edge of the information age. 
   The most debated among these is perhaps the 1991 decision in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,  499 U.S. 340, in which the Supreme Court rejected the so-called ``sweat of the brow'' theory as a basis for copyright protection for databases. Under Feist, the degree of labor and investment associated with producing a database is irrelevant to the question of copyrightability. Rather, a database may be protected by copyright only where it exhibits a minimum level of originality in the selection and arrangement of its contents. And, even then, the copyright in the database is said to be ``thin'' in that it extends only to the original selection and arrangement of the material but does not protect against the wholesale appropriation of the facts themselves. Thus, Feist made clear that a database owner who spends several years and a substantial amount of money to respond to an unmet market for data cannot look to copyright law for protection against a competitor who seeks ``to reap where he has not sown'' by reproducing and commercializing the same information in a different format, so long as the competing product does not copy the original selection or arrangement of the underlying information, if any. For example, in Martindale-Hubbell, Inc. v. Dunhill Int'l List Co., No. 88-6767-CIV-ROETTGER (S.D. Fla. Dec. 30, 1994), the court held that wholesale copying of attorney's names, addresses, and other information from the Martindale-Hubbell directory for inclusion in a competing directly was not infringing. 
   Having no recourse to copyright law, such database producers must rely on  state law regimes of contract and unfair competition to protect their investment. While there has been an ongoing and healthy debate as to whether such protections are sufficient, it is clear that the varying nature of the patchwork of state laws has led, at the very least, to some uncertainty among database producers regarding the degree of protection they may expect. 
   Also of growing importance is the effect of technology on the database industry as a whole. To a large extent, technology has been the fire that has fueled the growth of the database industry. Many also look to emerging technology as the solution to many of the problems sought to be addressed in the current debate. But while technological measures for protecting databases are still emerging, current technology has greatly contributed to the uncertainty that surrounds existing database protections. As databases move from hard-bound printed text versions to fully searchable electronic information-bases, selection and arrangement of the material becomes less important, and copyright protection is further removed. Thus, a database that in print form might be protected by copyright based on its arrangement of facts would likely no be protected by copyright when the same information is placed in a searchable electronic database where the arrangement of the facts is unimportant. And the digital networked environment has made piracy of databases much easier, both in terms of the facility of reproduction and in terms of the ease of unauthorized access to the contents of the database itself. 
   Finally, recent international proposals for database legislation and have heightened awareness of database piracy and prompted a greater sense of urgency among some to elevate the level of protection for databases in the United States. Most significant among these is the 1996 directive of the European Union requiring its member states to adopt certain protections for both copyrightable and noncopyrightable databases by January 1, 1998. Of particular relevance is a provision withholding protection for those databases produced in countries that do not afford 
   a similar level of protection for European databases. Thus, failure by the United States to exact legislation extending federal protection to noncopyrightable databases will likely result in the withholding of protection for American databases in Europe--a significant market for U.S. database providers. 
   Mr. President, I have long been on record as supporting some form of federal protection to fill the gap of protection created by Feist for those databases that are the result of significant effort and investment. Nearly 2 years ago I initiated a process that I hoped would enable Congress to balance the varied interests at stake in order to preserve appropriate incentives for investment in information while promoting the widest possible dissemination of information, as well as the greatest innovation in making information inexpensive and easy to use. I began this process by asking the Copyright Office to conduct a comprehensive study of the issues involved and to make recommendations to the Judiciary Committee. The Register of Copyrights and her staff did an outstanding job in responding to my request, and the Copyright Office issued a formal report in August 1997, shortly before the 104th Congress adjourned. 
   Congressman COBLE, chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property in the House of Representatives, spearheaded the effort to report database legislation in the 105th Congress. His subcommittee reported legislation, which was ultimately passed twice by the House of Representatives in the 105th Congress--once under suspension of the rules an then again as title V of the H.R. 2281, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. I commend him for the hard work that he has done and for his work in bringing the various parties together on this particular issue. 
   As my Senate colleagues will recall, while the Coble bill encountered very limited opposition on the House floor, it proved to be more controversial in the Senate. In order to address the outstanding concerns of various information users, I requested that the parties sit down under the auspices of the Judiciary Committee to discuss their differences and seek a resolution that was favorable to all. These discussions went on almost daily for approximately three weeks, and considerable progress was made. Based on these meetings, I put forward a series of discussion drafts that sought to narrow the gaps and arrive at an acceptable solution. While ultimately a solution could not be reached before the Congress adjourned, we did make considerable progress. Each of these discussion drafts represented an additional step toward a resolution, and I believe that in the end we were close to a workable compromise. 
   As we begin the 106th Congress, I want to stand before my colleagues to reiterate my commitment to the timely enactment of database legislation. There are many people that stand to be affected by such legislation, and many points of view about what the proper approach should be. While I am not wedded to a specific proposal or a particular approach, I do believe that any bill should keep in mind the dual priorities of providing the protections necessary to ensure the continued proliferation of databases in the United States and of protecting widespread access to and dissemination of information. In an effort to build upon the progress we made in the Senate last year, I am sharing with my colleagues a discussion draft that is identical to the last of the

   Mr. HATCH. By putting forward this particular draft I do not mean to suggest that this is necessarily the appropriate starting point for debate in the 106th Congress. Provisions of this draft must be read in light of the circumstances in which they were written, mainly the consideration of the conference report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It does, however, represent a number of significant advances toward consensus as well as ideas and principles that I expect will prove useful in crafting a database bill that meets the above-stated objectives. For these reasons I commend it to my colleagues for their consideration. But there are other approaches we should be cognizant of as we work toward the best possible solution.

   Mr. HATCH. Second, there are many who believe a narrower unfair competition model is preferable to the model set forth in the Coble bill. One such proposal has been proposed by certain commercial database users, with the support of the scientific, education, and library communities. I ask unanimous consent that this proposal also be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. HATCH. I include this proposal in the RECORD hoping that it will also help our deliberations be more fully informed and spur discussion of the merits of each approach. The existence of, and my dissemination of, these various approaches, however, should not be used to delay prompt action on this important issue. 
   In short, Mr. President, as we rapidly approach the new millennium, it is time for Congress to act to ensure adequate federal protection for American investment in information. I intend this to be a high priority in the Judiciary Committee this year and intend to move forward with hearings and timely consideration of appropriate legislation. I look forward to working with the interested parties in an effort to build consensus in this area, and I encourage my colleagues to join with me in support of this process.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss for the benefit of my colleagues a matter of great importance--consideration this Congress of legislation to reauthorize the Department of Justice. 
   It has been nearly two decades since Congress has passed a general authorization bill for the Department of Justice. It is in my view a matter of significant concern when any major cabinet department goes for such a long period of time without congressional reauthorization. Such lack of reauthorization encourages administrative drift, and permits important policy decisions to be made ad hoc through the adoption appropriations bills or special purpose legislation. 
   However, these concerns are amplified when the department in question is of such central importance to our national life as is the Department of Justice. The Department is entrusted critical duty of primary responsibility for the enforcement of our Nation's laws. Through its divisions and agencies including the FBI and DEA, it investigates and prosecutes violations of federal criminal laws protects the civil rights of our citizens, enforces the antitrust laws, and represents every department and agency of the United States Government in litigation. Increasingly, its mission is international as well, protecting the interests of the United States and its people from growing threats of trans-national crime and international terrorism. And, among the Department's key duties is providing assistance and advice to state and local law enforcement. 
   The growing importance of the Department's role is demonstrated by the growth of its budget in the last two decades. In fiscal year 1979, the Department of Justice's budget was just $2.538 billion, and represented one half of one percent of the federal government's $559 billion budget. In fiscal year 1999, the Department of Justice's budget is more than seven times greater--an estimated $18.2 billion, representing about 1 percent of the $1.75 trillion federal budget. 
   As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would like to advise my colleagues that a major priority of the committee this year will be the reauthorization of the Department of Justice. Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee reported a bipartisan, 3-year Justice Department reauthorization bill which was sponsored by myself and the distinguished ranking member, Senator LEAHY. Unfortunately, this legislation, which was similar to a bill passed by the House of Representatives, never received consideration by the full Senate. 
   In the next several weeks, I will reintroduce legislation to reauthorize the Department of justice. The Judiciary Committee will redouble its efforts to address this important issue. 
   I look forward to continuing reports to my colleagues on the important issue of Department of Justice reauthorization, and to working with each of my colleagues on this matter.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to the introduce the Four Corners Monument Interpretive Center Act. The Four Corners is the only location in our nation where the boundaries of four states meet at one point. 
   Each year more than a quarter of a million visitors from around the world  brave heat and discomfort to visit the Four Corners. This legislation will provide basic amenities to these travelers and provide an important economic opportunity for the Indian Nations who share the Four Corners area. 
   The Four Corners area is unique for reasons other than the makeup of its political boundaries. This location was home to some of the earliest Americans, the Anasazi people. Little known about this ancient people, but the Four Corners area contains many of the clues left behind to help us learn about their society. This heritage has created an area of rich historical, archeological, and cultural significance as well as natural beauty. 
   In more recent history, in 1949, the Governors of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah met at the Four Corners Monument for a historic meeting. Each Governor sat in his state's corner and ate a picnic lunch together. The governors pledged to meet every so often to reaffirm their commitment to working together for the good of the four states and for the Four Corners region. This year marks the 50th anniversary of that historic meeting. I think we should reaffirm their commitment to cooperation by establishing this center that will promote opportunity in this region. 
   This legislation is important for the Navajo Nation and the Mountain Utes who share control of the existing Four Corners Monument. And, we must be clear what we mean by ``monument.'' In contrast to the 1.7 million acre Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument recently declared by President Clinton, the ``monument'' that marks the spot at Four Corners is a simple concrete disk containing the four states' seals. 
   Native Americans have set up small open air stalls around the monument to exhibit and sell their native crafts. But, there is no electricity, no running water, no permanent restroom facilities, and no phone service in the area. 
   The interpretive center provided by this legislation would not only assist these Native Americans economically, but it would provide a valuable resource to visitors who would like to learn more about the culture, history, and environment of the Four Corners region. 
   Mr. President, I wish to emphasize that this bill reflects the initiative of the local tribes and elected officials. This is not a federal imposition, but federal support of sustainable economic development in an area that is in desperate need of it. The Four Corners Heritage Council, which is comprised of tribal leaders, local government and private sectors leaders, has been instrumental in developing this bill. 
   Not only will the interpretive center benefit the local tribes, but it will help to create more interest among tourists of other attractions and sites in the entire Four Corners region. Within a 100 mile radius of the monument there are multiple sites and parks for the enjoyment of tourists, such as Zion National Park, Arches National Park, the Grand Canyon, Rainbow Bridge, Hovenweep, Mesa Verde, and much, much, more. Because of its central location, the center would act as a staging ground for the entire Colorado Plateau. 
   That this proposal reflects the needs of so many in the area, is reflected by the strong support among all the region's tribal and local governments, and the San Juan Forum, which represents federal state and local interests in the four states. The Albuquerque Tribune editorialized last year that ``the project merits New Mexico's strong support.'' The state of Arizona has already set aside $250,000 for their share of the project. In addition, the Arizona Department of Transportation has produced draft plans for the new center and for the road changes that would be required. The other states have also shown interest as well, which is important as they will be required to match the $2 million authorized by this bill for the project. 
   Mr. President, this bill represents cooperation of federal, state, local, and tribal governments in an effort to reaffirm our ties to our past while building for our future. I urge my colleagues to give this proposal their full support.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill titled ``Violence Against Women Act of 1999.'' I expect that this will be one of several bills introduced this week in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, reflecting an array of ideas and views on the reauthorization of existing programs and the creation of new ones. 
   Let me say at the outset, that one of my proudest accomplishments in this body was my work with Senator JOE BIDEN earlier this decade culminating in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. I have great hopes that Senator BIDEN and I can duplicate that strong bipartisan effort in the 106th Congress. 
   Five years after the passage of VAWA I, I think it is fair to say that this Act has significantly enhanced the efforts of law enforcement in combating violence against women and improved the services available to victims of domestic violence in my home state of Utah and across the nation. 
   But five years later, it is time to advance the process in three major respects: (1) it is time to review and evaluate the effectiveness of programs created by the 1994 Act and to reexamine the adequacy of the funding levels for these programs; (2) it is time to review law enforcement's efforts and successes as a result of the 1994 Act; and (3) it is time to survey and consider the need for new programs and further changes in the law. 
   Thus, while I am today introducing a bill that reauthorizes the majority of current programs, many at increased funding levels, I think that these programs need first to be evaluated as to whether available funds are being used in the most effective way possible. Further, I know that Senator BIDEN has a number of ideas for new programs and changes in the law, and I look forward to working with him on some of those ideas. 
   Finally, let me just note that my bill also contains some new proposals regarding campus violence, battered immigrant women, and the victims of domestic violence on military bases around the country. Like many Americans, I watched with some horror on Sunday night as ``60 Minutes'' detailed the degree of domestic violence on and around our military bases and the apparent lack of serious responsiveness by persons in charge. This situation, if accurately portrayed, is not acceptable, and this Administration needs to act swiftly and effectively to change what is reportedly happening. To that end, my bill includes a provision requiring a prompt review and report by the Secretary of Defense on the incidence of and response to domestic violence on our military bases. 
   In sum, Mr. President, I hope that enacting effective legislation to combat violence against women will be a priority in the 106th Congress. I intend to do my best, working in a bipartisan fashion, to ensure that it is.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help provide for greater consumer choice and competition in television services, the ``Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act of 1999.'' Joining me in introducing this bill are the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, and my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Senators DEWINE and KOHL. 
   The options consumers have for viewing television entertainment have vastly increased since that fateful day in September 1927 when television inventor and Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth, together with his wife and colleagues, viewed the first television transmission in the Farnsworth's home workshop: a single black line rotated from vertical to horizontal. Both the forms of entertainment and the technologies for delivering that entertainment have proliferated over the 70 years since that day. In the 1940's and 1950's, televisions began arriving in an increasing number of homes to pick up entertainment being broadcast into a growing number of cities and towns. 
   In the late 1960's and early 1970's, cable television began offering communities more television choices by initially providing community antenna systems for receiving broadcast television signals, and later by offering new created-for-cable entertainment. The development of cable television made dramatic strides with the enactment of the cable compulsory license in 1976, providing an efficient way of clearing copyright rights for the retransmission of broadcast signals over cable systems. 
   In the 1980's, television viewers began to be able to receive television entertainment with their own home satellite equipment, and the enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1988 helped develop a system of providing options for television service to Americans who lived in areas too remote to receive television signals over the air or via cable. 
   Much has changed since the original Satellite Home Viewer Act was adopted in 1988. The Satellite Home Viewer Act was originally intended to ensure that households that could not get television in any other way, traditionally provided through broadcast or cable, would be able to get television signals via satellite. The market and satellite industry has changed substantially since 1988. Many of the difficulties and controversies associated with the satellite license have been at least partly a product of the satellite business attempting to move from a predominately need-based rural niche service to a full service video delivery competitor in all markets, urban and rural.  
   Now, many market advocates both in and out of Congress are looking to satellite carriers to compete directly with cable companies for viewership, because we believe that an 
    increasingly competitive market is better for consumers both in terms of cost and the diversity of programming available. The bill I introduce today will move us toward that kind of robust competition. 
   In short, this bill is focused on changes that we can make this year to move the satellite television industry to the next level, making it a full competitor in the multi-channel video delivery market. It has been said time and again that a major, and perhaps the biggest, impediment to satellite's ability to be a strong competitor to cable is its current inability to provide local broadcast signals. (See, e.g., Business week (22 Dec. 1997) p. 84.) This problem has been partly technological and partly legal. 
   Even as we speak, the technological hurdles to local retransmission of broadcast signals are being lowered substantially. Emerging technology is now enabling the satellite industry to begin to offer television viewers their own local programming of news, weather, sports, and entertainment, with digital quality picture and sound. This will mean that viewers in the remoter areas of my large home state of Utah will be able to watch television programming originating in Salt Lake City, rather than New York or California. Utahns in remote areas will have access to local weather and other locally and regionally relevant information. In fact, one satellite carrier is already providing such a service in Utah. 
   Today, with this bill, we hope to begin removing the legal impediments to use of this emerging technology to make local retransmission of broadcast signals a reality for all subscribers. The most important result will be that the constituents of all my colleagues will finally have a choice for full service multi-channel video programming. They will be able to choose cable or one of a number of satellite carriers. This should foster an environment of proliferating choice and lowered prices, all to the benefit of consumers, our constituents. 
   To that end, the ``Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act'' makes the following changes in the copyright governing satellite television transmissions: 
   It creates a new copyright license which allows satellite carriers to retransmit a local television station to households and businesses throughout that station's local market, just like cable does, and sets a zero copyright rate for providing this service. 
   It extends the satellite compulsory licenses for both local and distant signals, which are now set to expire at the end of the year, until 2004. 
   It cuts the copyright rates paid for distant signals by 30 or 45 percent, depending on the type of signal. 
   It allows consumers to switch from cable to satellite service for network signals without waiting a 90-day period now required in the law. 
   It allows for a national Public Broadcasting Service satellite feed. 
   Many of my colleagues in this chamber will recognize this legislation as substantively identical to a bill reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last year. I am pleased with the degree of cooperation and consensus we were able to forge with respect to this legislation last year, and I hope that we can pick up where we left off to bring this bill before the Senate for swift consideration and approval. 
   As I indicated late in the last Congress, the bill I am introducing is intended to be a piece of a larger joint work product to be crafted in conjunction with our colleagues on the Commerce Committee. Once again in the 106th Congress, it is our intention that the Judiciary Committee will move forward with consideration of the copyright legislation I am introducing today, which, as I indicated, is cosponsored by the Chairman of the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee will proceed simultaneously to consider separate legislation to be introduced by Chairman MCCAIN to address related communications amendments regarding such important areas as the must-carry and retransmission consent requirements for satellite carriers upon which the copyright licenses will be conditioned, and the FCC's distant signal eligibility process. It is our joint intention to combine our respective work product as two titles of the same bill in a way that will clearly delineate the work product of each committee, but combine them into the seamless whole necessary to make the licenses work for consumers and the affected industries. 
   We need to act quickly on this legislation. The Satellite Home Viewer Act sunsets at the end of this year, placing at risk the service of many of the 11 million satellite subscribers nationwide. Many of our constituents are confused about the status of satellite service because of a court order requiring the cessation of distant-signal satellite service in February and April to as many as 2.5 million subscribers nationally who have been adjudged ineligible for distant signal service under current law. The granting of the local license, together with some resolution of the eligibility rules for distant signals and a more consumer-friendly process can help bring clarity to these consumers. 
   Let me again thank the Majority Leader for his interest in and leadership with respect to these issues, and the Chairman of the Commerce Committee for his collegiality and cooperation in this process. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who have worked on this legislation. This bill is a product of a bipartisan effort with Senators LEAHY, DEWINE, and KOHL. I look forward to continued collaboration with them and with our other colleagues to help hasten more vigorous competition in the television delivery market and the ever-widening consumer choice that will follow it.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senators ASHCROFT, THURMOND, KYL, and SESSIONS, the ``Judicial Improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation is designed to preserve the democratic process by strengthening the constitutional division of powers between the Federal Government and the States and between Congress and the Courts. I introduced this legislation last session, but, to my regret, the Senate did not have an opportunity to act upon it. I am re-introducing it because the same ills that were plaguing our judicial system continue to exist, and I believe this legislation can remedy these ills. I have every expectation that this legislation will be acted upon and favorably passed this session. 
   I have always given credit where credit is due. So let me state that on the whole, our federal judges respect their constitutional roles and the Senate is aware of these judges' dedication to administering their oaths of office. Yet, unfortunately, this dedication is not universal and a degree of overreaching by some judges dictates that Congress move to more clearly delineate the proper role of federal judges. In our constitutional system, judges can not conveniently forget or blatantly ignore that the Constitution has exclusively reserved to Congress the power to legislate and limited their power to the interpretation of the law. 
   This careful, but deliberate, separation of legislative and judicial functions is a cornerstone of our constitutional system. Regardless of the temptation to embrace a certain judge's decision that some may find socially or politically expedient, we must remember that no interest is more compelling than preserving our Constitution. 
   Now, attempts by certain federal judges to infringe upon Congress's legislative authority deeply concern me. I have taken the floor in this chamber on numerous occasions to recite some of the more troubling examples of judicial overreaching. I will not revisit them today. Suffice it to say that activism, and by that I mean a judge who ignores the written text of the law, whether from the right or the left, threatens our constitutional structure. 
   An an elected official, my votes for legislation are subject to voter approval. Federal judges, however, are unelected, hence they are, as a practical matter, unaccountable to the public. While tenure during good behavior, which amounts to life tenure, is important in that it frees judges to make unpopular but constitutionally sound decisions, it can become a threat to liberty when placed in the wrong hands. And substituting the will of life-tenured federal judges for the democratically elected representatives is not what our Constitution's framers had in mind. 
   In an effort to avoid this long-contemplated problem, the proposed reform legislation we are introducing today will assist in ensuring that all three branches of the Federal Government work together in a fashion contemplated by, and consistent with, the Constitution. In addition, this legislation will ensure that federal judges are more respectful of the States and their respective sovereignty. 
   I want to be clear in stating that this bill does not, as some may claim, challenge the independence of federal judges. However, there are currently some activist federal judges improperly expanding their roles in an effort to substitute their own ideas and interests for the will of the people. Judges, however, are simply not entitled to deviate from their roles as interpreters of the law in order to create new law from the bench. If they believe otherwise, they 
   are derelict in their duties and should leave the federal bench to run for public office--at least then they would be accountable for their actions. It is time that we pass legislation that precludes any federal judge from blurring the lines separating the legislative and judicial functions. 
   It is important to note that the effort to reign in judicial activism should not be limited simply to opposing potential activist nominees. While the careful scrutiny of judicial nominees is one important step in the confirmation process, a step reserved to the Senate alone, Congress itself has an obligation to the public to ensure that judges fulfill their constitutionally prescribed roles and do not encroach upon those powers delegated to the legislature. Hence, the Congress performs an important role in bringing activist decisions to light and, where appropriate, publicly criticizing those decisions. Some view this as an assault upon judicial independence. That is untrue. It is merely a means of engaging in debate about a decision's merits or the process by which the decision was reached. Such criticism is a healthy part of our democratic system. While life tenure insulates judges from the political process, it should not, and must not, isolate them from the people. 
   In addition, the Constitution grants Congress the authority, with a few notable limitations, to set federal courts' jurisdiction. This is an important tool that, while seldom used, sets forth the circumstances in which the judicial power may be exercised. A good example of this is the 104th Congress' effort to reform the statutory writ of habeas  corpus in an attempt to curb the seemingly endless series of petitions filed by convicted criminals bent on thwarting the demands of justice. Legislation of this nature is an important means of curbing activism. 
   In an effort to accomplish these goals, I have chosen to re-introduce, along with my colleagues, the Judicial Improvement Act. It is a small, albeit meaningful, step in the right direction. Notably, this legislation will change the way federal courts review constitutional challenges to state and federal laws. The existing process allows a single federal judge to hear and grant applications regarding the constitutionality of state and federal laws as well as state ballot initiatives. In other words, a single federal judge can impede the will of a majority of the voters merely by issuing an order halting the implementation of a state referendum. 
   This proposed reform will accomplish the twin goals of fighting judicial activism and preserving the democratic process. In essence, this bill modestly proposes to respond to the problem of judicial activism in part by: (1) Requiring a three judge district court panel to hear appeals and grant interlocutory or permanent injunctions based on the constitutionality of a state law or referendum; (2) placing time limitations on remedial authority in any civil action in which prospective relief or a consent judgment binds State or local officials; (3) prohibiting a federal court from having the authority to order state or local governments to increase taxes as part of a judicial remedy; (4) preventing a federal court from prohibiting state or local officials from reprosecuting a defendant; and (5) preventing a federal court from ordering the release of violent offenders under unwarranted circumstances. 
   As I said last session and still believe to be true, this reform bill is a long overdue effort to minimize the potential for judicial activism in the federal court system. Americans are understandably frustrated when they exercise their right to vote and the will of their elected representatives is frustrated by judges who enjoy life tenure. It is no wonder that millions of Americans do not think their vote matters when they enact a referendum only to have it enjoined by a single district court judge. By improving the way federal courts analyze constitutional challenges to laws and initiatives, Congress will protect the rights of parties to challenge unconstitutional laws while at the same time reduce the ability of activist judges to abuse their power and circumvent the will of the people. 
   I want to take a few moments to again describe how this legislation will curb the ability of federal judges to engage in judicial activism. The first reform would require a three judge panel to hear and issue interlocutory and permanent injunctions regarding challenged laws at the district court level. The current system allows a single federal judge to restrain the enforcement, operation and execution of challenged federal or state laws, including initiatives. There have been many instances where an activist judge has used this power to overturn a ballot initiative only to have his or her order overturned by a higher court years later. 
   One need only remember how Proposition 209, a ballot initiative passed by the voters which prohibited affirmative action in California, was held in abeyance after a district court judge issued an injunction barring its enforcement to understand how the three judge panel provision may in fact play a role in 
   ensuring that the will of the people is not wrongfully thwarted. The injunction was subsequently overturned by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which ruled that the law was constitutional. A three judge panel perhaps may have ruled correctly initially, allowing the democratic process to work properly while also saving taxpayer dollars. 
   Obviously, I have no problem with a court declaring a law unconstitutional when it violates the written text of the Constitution. It is, however, inappropriate when a judge attempts to act like a legislator and imposes his own policy preference on the citizens of a state. Such an action weakens respect for the federal judiciary, creates cynicism in the voting public, and costs governments millions of dollars in legal fees. By requiring a ruling by a three judge panel to overturn the validity of a State law, the proposed law would eliminate the ability of one activist judge to unilaterally bar enforcement of a law or ballot initiative through an interlocutory or permanent injunction. 
   In addition, new time limits on injunctive relief would be imposed. A temporary restraining order would remain in force no more than 10 days, and an interlocutory injunction no more than 60 days. After the expiration of an interlocutory injunction, federal courts would lack the authority to grant any additional interlocutory relief but would still have the power to issue a permanent injunction. These limitations are designed to prevent the federal judiciary from indefinitely barring implementation of challenged laws by issuing endless injunctions, and facilitate the appeals process by motivating courts to speedily handle constitutional challenges. What this reform essentially does is encourage the federal judiciary to rule on the merits of a case, and not use injunctions to keep a challenged law from going into effect or being heard by an appeals court through the use of delaying tactics. 
   The bill also proposes to require that a notice of appeal must be filed not more than fourteen days after the date of an order granting an interlocutory injunction and the appeals court would lack jurisdiction over an untimely appeal of such an order. The court of appeals would apply a de novo standard of review before reconsidering the merits of granting relief, but not less than 100 days after the issuance of the original order granting interlocutory relief. If the interlocutory order is upheld on appeal, the order would remain in force no longer than 60 days after the date of the appellate decision or until replaced by a permanent injunction. 
   The bill also proposes limitations on the remedial authority of federal courts. In any civil action where prospective relief or a consent judgment binds state and local officials, relief would be terminated upon the motion of any party or intervener: (a) Five years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief; (b) two years after the date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief; or (c) in the case of an order issued on or before the date of enactment of this act, two years after the date of enactment. 
   Parties could agree to terminate or modify an injunction before relief is available if it otherwise would be legally permissible. Courts would promptly rule on motions to modify or terminate this relief and in the event that a motion is not ruled on within 60 days, the order or consent judgment binding state and local officials would automatically terminate. 
   However, prospective relief would not terminate if the federal court makes written findings based on the record that relief remains necessary to correct an ongoing violation of a federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation and is the least intrusive means available to correct the violation of a federal right. 
   Moreover, this measure would also prohibit a federal court from having the authority to order a unit of state or local government to increase taxes as part of a judicial remedy. When an unelected federal judge has the power to order tax increases, this results in taxation without representation. Americans have fought against unfair taxation since the Revolutionary War, and this bill would prevent unfair judicial taxation and leave the power to tax to elected representatives of the people. 
   The bill would not limit the authority of a federal court to order a remedy which may lead a unit of local or state government to decide to increase taxes. A federal court would still have the power to issue a money judgment against a State because the court would not be attempting to restructure local government entities or mandating a particular method or structure of State or local financing. This bill also doesn't limit the remedial authority of State courts in any case, including cases raising issues of federal law. All the bill does is prevent federal courts from having the power to order elected representatives to raise taxes. This is moderate reform which prevents judicial activism and unfair taxation while preserving the federal courts power to order remedial measures. 
   Another important provision of the bill would prevent a federal court from prohibiting State or local officials from re-prosecuting a defendant. This legislation is designed to clarify that federal habeas courts lack the authority to bar retrial as a remedy. 
   This part of the legislation was co-sponsored by Congressman PITTS and Senator SPECTER in response to a highly-publicized murder case in the Congressman's district. Sixteen year old Laurie Show was harrassed, stalked and assaulted for six months by the defendant, who had a vendetta against Show for briefly dating the defendant's boyfriend. After luring Show's mother from their residence, the defendant and an accomplice forcefully entered the Show home, held the victim down, and slit her throat with a butcher knife, killing her. After the defendant was convicted in state court, she filed a habeas petition in which she alleged prosecutorial misconduct and averred her actual innocence. A federal district court judge not only accepted this argument and released the defendant, but he also took the extraordinary step of barring state and local officials from reprosecuting the woman. This judge even went so far as to state that the defendant was the ``first and foremost victim of this affair.'' 
   Congress has long supported the ability of a federal court to fashion creative remedies to preserve constitutional protections, but the additional step of barring state or local officials from reprosecution is without precedent and an unacceptable intrusion on the rights of States. This bill, if enacted, will prevent this type of judicial activism from ever occurring again. 
   This bill also contains provisions for the termination of prospective relief when it is no longer warranted to cure a violation of a federal right. Once a violation that was the subject of a consent decree has been corrected, a consent decree must be terminated unless the court finds that an ongoing violation of a federal right exists, the specific relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right, and no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right. The party opposing the termination of relief has the burden of demonstrating why the relief should not be terminated, and the court is required to grant the motion to terminate if the opposing party fails to meet its burden. These provisions prevent consent decrees from remaining in effect once a proper remedy has been implemented, thereby preventing judges from imposing consent decrees that go beyond the requirements of law. 
   The proposed reform law also includes provisions designed to dissuade prisoners from filing frivolous and malicious motions by requiring that the complainant prisoner pay for the costs of the filings. These provisions will undoubtedly curb the number of frivolous motions filed by prisoners and thus, relieve the courts of the obligation to hear these vacuous motions designed to mock and frustrate the judicial system. 
   Finally, the bill proposes to prevent federal judges from entering or carrying out any prisoner release order that would result in the release from or nonadmission to a prison on the basis of prison conditions. This provision effectively will preclude activist judges from circumventing mandatory minimum sentencing laws by stripping federal judges of jurisdiction to enter such orders. This will ensure that the tough sentencing laws approved by voters to keep murderers, rapists, and drug dealers behind bars for lengthy terms will not be ignored by activist judges who improperly use complaints of prison conditions filed by convicts as a vehicle to release violent offenders back on to our streets. It will also prevent any federal judge from ever endangering families and children in our communities by preventing these judges from releasing prisoners based on prison conditions. 
   Congress repeatedly has tried to ensure that convicted prisoners stay where they belong: in prison for the term to which they were sentenced. This effort has been ongoing for over 10 years. Consider the following examples: (1) In 1987, Congress passed the Sentencing Guidelines which effectively limited the probation of prisoners; (2) the 1994 Crime Bill contained incentives for States to pass Truth in Sentencing Laws which kept convicted prisoners incarcerated for longer periods; and (3) the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act of 1996 allowed for the revocation of good time credit if prisoners filed malicious, repetitive and frivolous law suits while in prison. The reform bill being introduced today will further Congress' ongoing efforts to provide safer streets for all Americans by ensuring that convicted prisoners who pose a danger to our communities are not released prior to the expiration of their mandated sentences. 
   This timely legislation is a measured effort to improve the way the federal judiciary works. It is not an attempt to infringe upon judicial independence. To the contrary, this reform bill is a sensible, balanced attempt to promote judicial efficiency and to prevent egregious judicial activism. I encourage all of my colleagues to act swiftly on and support this truly needed legislation.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce an important piece of corrective legislation--the Federal Prosecutor Ethics Act. This bill will address in a responsible manner the critical issue of ethical standards for federal prosecutors, while ensuring that the public servants are permitted to perform their important function of upholding federal law. 
   The bill I am introducing today is a careful solution to a troubling problem--the application of state ethics rules in federal court, and particularly to federal prosecutors. In short, my bill will subject federal prosecutors to the bar rules of each state in which they are licensed unless such rules are inconsistent with federal law or the effectuation of federal policy or investigations. It also sets specific standards for federal prosecutorial conduct, to be enforced by the Attorney General. Finally, it establishes a commission of federal judges, appointed by the Chief Justice, to review and report on the interrelationship between the duties of federal prosecutors and regulation of their conduct by state bars and the disciplinary procedures utilized by the Attorney General. 
   No one condones prosecutorial excesses. There have been instances where law enforcement, and even some federal prosecutors, have gone overboard. Unethical conduct by any attorney is a matter for concern. But when engaged in by a federal prosecutor, unethical conduct cannot be tolerated. For as Justice Sutherland noted in 1935, the prosecutor is not just to win a case, ``but that justice shall be done. ..... It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.'' 
   We must, however, ensure that the rules we adopt to ensure proper prosecutorial conduct are measured and well-tailored to that purpose. As my colleagues may recall, last year's omnibus appropriations act included a very controversial provision known to most of my colleagues simply as the ``McDade provision,'' after its House sponsor, former Representative Joe McDade. 
   This well-intentioned but ill-advised provision was adopted to set ethical standards for federal prosecutors and other attorneys for the government. In my view, it was not the measured and well-tailored law needed to address the legitimate concerns its sponsors sought to redress. Nor was I alone in this view. So great was the concern over its impact, in fact, that its effective date was delayed until six months after enactment. That deadline is approaching. In my view, if allowed to take effect in its present form, the McDade provision would cripple the ability of the Department of Justice to enforce federal law and cede authority to regulate the conduct of federal criminal investigations and prosecutions to more than 50 state bar associations. 
   As enacted last fall, the McDade provision adds a new section 530B to title 28 of the U.S. Code. In its most relevant part, it states that an ``attorney for the government shall be subject to State laws and rules ..... governing attorneys in each state where such attorney engages in that attorney's duties,  to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that state.'' 
   There are important practical considerations which persuasively counsel against allowing 28 U.S.C. 530B to take effect unchanged. I have been a frequent critic of the trend toward the over-federalization of crime. Yet the federal government has a most legitimate 
   role in the investigation and prosecution of complex multistate terrorism, drug, fraud or organized crime conspiracies, in rooting out and punishing fraud against federally funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, in vindicating the federal civil rights laws, in investigating and prosecuting complex corporate crime, and in punishing environmental crime. 
   It is in these very cases that Section 530B will have its most pernicious effect. Federal attorneys investigating and prosecuting these cases, which frequently encompass three, four, or five states, will be subject to the differing state and local rules of each of those states, plus the District of Columbia, if they are based here. Their decisions will be subject to review by the bar and ethics review boards in each of each of these states at the whim of defense counsel, even if the federal attorney is not licensed in that state. 
   Practices concerning contact with unrepresented persons or the conduct of matters before a grant jury, perfectly legal and acceptable in federal court, will be subject to state bar rules. For instance, in many states, federal attorneys will not be permitted to speak with represented witnesses, especially witnesses to corporate misconduct, and the use of undercover investigations will at a minimum be hindered. In other states, section 530B might require--contrary to long-established federal grand jury practice--that prosecutors present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Moreover, these rules won't have to be in effect in the district where the subject is being investigated, or where the grand jury is sitting to have these effects. No, these rules only have to be in effect somewhere the investigation leads, or the federal attorney works, to handcuff federal law enforcement. 
   In short, Section 530B will affect every attorney in every department and agency of the federal government. It will effect enforcement of our antitrust laws, our environmental laws prohibiting the dumping of hazardous waste, our labor laws, our civil rights laws, and as I said before, the integrity of every federal funding program. 
   Section 530B is also an open invitation to clever defense attorneys to stymie federal criminal or civil investigations by raising bogus defenses or bringing frivolous state bar claims. Indeed, this is happening even without Section 530B as the law of the land. The most recent example is the use of a State rule against testimony buying to brand as ``unethical'' the long accepted, and essential, federal practice of moving for sentence reductions for co-conspirators who cooperate with prosecutors by testifying truthfully for the government. How much worse will it be when this provision declares it open season of federal lawyers? 
   What will the costs of this provision be? At a minimum, the inevitable result will be that violations of federal laws will not be punished, and justice will not be done. But there will be financial costs to the federal government as well, as a result of defending these frivolous challenges and from higher costs associated with investigating and prosecuting violations of federal law. 
   All of this, however, is not to say that nothing needs to be done on the issue of attorney ethics in federal court. Indeed, I have considerable sympathy for the objectives values Section 530B seeks to protect. All of us who at one time or another have been the subject of unfounded ethical or legal charges, as I have been as well, know the frustration of clearing one's name. All no one wants more than I to ensure that all federal prosecutors are held to the highest ethical standards. But Section 530B, as it was enacted last year, is not in my view the way to do it. 
   The bill I am introducing today addresses the narrow matter of federal prosecutorial conduct in a responsible way, and I might add, in a manner that is respectful of both federal and state sovereignty. As all of my colleagues know, each of our states has at least one federal judicial district. But the federal courts that sit in these districts are not courts of the state. They are, of course instrumentalities of federal sovereignty, created by Congress pursuant to its power under Article III of the Constitution, which vests the judicial power of the United States in ``one supreme Court and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' 
   As enacted, Section 530B is in my view a serious dereliction of our Constitutional duty to establish inferior federal courts. Should this provision take effect, Congress will have ceded the right to control conduct in the federal courts to more than fifty state bar associations, at a devastating cost to federal sovereignty and the independence of the federal judiciary. Simply put, the federal government, like each of our states, must retain for itself the authority to regulate the practice of law in its own courts and by its own lawyers. Indeed, the principle of federal sovereignty in its own sphere has been well established since Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland [17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 1819]. 
   However, it may only be a first step. For the problem of rules for the conduct of attorneys in federal court affects more than just prosecutors. It affects all litigants in each of our federal courts, who have a right to know what the rules are in the administration of justice. This is a problem that has been percolating in the federal bar for over a decade--the diversity of ethical rules governing attorney conduct in federal court. 
   Presently, there is no uniform rule that applies in all federal courts. Rather, applicable ethics rules have been left up to the discretion of local rules in each federal judicial district. Various districts have taken different approaches, including adopting state standards based on either the ABA Model Rules or the ABA Code, adopting one of the ABA models directly, and in some cases, adopting both an ABA model and the state rules. 
   This variety of rules has led to confusion, especially in multiforum federal practice. As a 1997 report prepared for the Judicial Conference's Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure put it, ``Multiforum federal practice, challenging under ideal conditions, has been made increasingly complex, wasteful, and problematic by the disarray among federal local rules and state ethical standards.'' 
   Moreover, the problem may well be made worse if Section 530B takes effect in its present form. First, as enacted, Section 530B contains an internal conflict that will add to the confusion. Section 530B provides that federal attorneys are governed by both the state laws and bar rules and the federal court's local rules. These, of course, are frequently different, setting up the obvious quandary--which take precedence? Finally, Section 530B might further add to the confusion, by raising the possibility of different standards in the same court for opposing litigants--private parties governed by the federal local rules and prosecutors governed by Section 530B.

   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am today, once again, introducing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. In so doing, I continue the effort that I and many of my colleagues have long pursued to provide a permanent and strong mandate for a fiscally responsible path for our Nation. 
   It is a political reality, of course, that Congress' success in decreasing our deficit levels and achieving a balanced budget in the 105th Congress to a certain extent mitigated the urgency of passing this Constitutional Amendment. 
   In my view, however, this is the ideal time to move forward on a constitutional amendment. The fact that we have reached a balanced budget has shown that it can be done. Significantly, it has refuted the arguments and scare tactics of opponents that a balanced budget would mean the end of Social Security and Medicare. Rather,  we now have a record to demonstrate the strong benefits of a balanced budget to our economy in general and to each segment of our society in particular. 
   I am as proud as any Member of this body of our recent success in restraining the deficit. But that success does not mean that this amendment is no longer necessary. Our history, unfortunately, demonstrates that the fiscal discipline of recent years is the exception, not the rule. The political incentives in this town to spend now and pay later remain. Thus, it is as true now as it always been that only a structural change in our basic charter can ensure long term fiscal responsibility and a secure future for our children and grandchildren. This is a matter that remains vital to the economic health of the State of Utah and the Nation.
