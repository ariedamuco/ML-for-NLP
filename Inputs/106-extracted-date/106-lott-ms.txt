   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have just spoken to Senator DASCHLE. We have been communicating with our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol. I understand the Senate will shortly receive from the House the appropriations bill containing the final appropriations measures, and we hope to have some agreement on how to proceed shortly. 
   We will notify Senators and hotline that information. Once Senator DASCHLE arrives on the floor, hopefully we can move forward with that. In the meantime, there are just a couple of bits of information for our colleagues about the remainder of this session and the dates for activities we will have next year. 
   Of course, we hope to have the sine die adjournment resolution here shortly. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I jointly will have resolutions thanking the officers of the Senate, the staff of the Senate who do just a magnificent job on our behalf and on behalf of the American people quite often during long and weird hours. They really do a magnificent job, and we thank all of them for what they do. 
   Also, I see Senator REID is here, the assistant Democratic leader. He has really made a difference since he has been in his leadership position. He is always calm and always diligent. He works on both sides of the aisle. I want to acknowledge that and thank him for all of his work. I will not overdo it now because I don't want to get him into trouble as we approach the last few minutes of the session. 
   I want to inform the Members of some important dates and events of interest concerning the beginning of the 107th Congress. I see Senator DASCHLE is here. He can communicate with the staff. I will run over these dates quickly, and then we can visit. 
   Of course, at 12 noon on Wednesday, January 3, the 107th Congress will convene with an immediate live quorum, to be followed by the swearing-in ceremonies for the newly elected Senators. 
   I want to emphasize that. That is on January 3. It is at 12 noon. There will be a live quorum, and all Senators are required by law, if they want to be sworn in and receive pay, to be here for that occasion. 
   On Saturday, January 6, the Senate will proceed as a body to the Hall of the House of Representatives for the official counting of the electoral college votes. 
   The Senate has passed a resolution that would move that to January 5, which would be a Friday, instead of Saturday, January 6. The House has not yet passed that resolution. But they have indicated that they may pass a resolution changing the date to Friday, January 5, for the counting of the electoral college votes. We will let all of our colleagues know exactly about that. 
   I believe we are required to proceed at 1 p.m. on either Friday, January 5, or, as it now stands, January 6. We will make that clear later on. Senators will be notified if there is a date change, if and when it is confirmed. 
   Of course, Inauguration of the 43rd President of the United States will occur at 12 noon on Saturday, January 20. 
   Furthermore, because a Senate committee is a continuing body, committees may begin working on committee nominations on January 5 or 6. Senator DASCHLE and I will be working on that. But there is the possibility, between January 3 and the 
   Inauguration, that there could be some committee hearings on nominations. We will have to work through that. Of course, it will depend on the receipt of those nominations once the investigations have been completed. We will work through what committees and how that will be handled. Members who might be involved will be notified as early as possible, and hopefully that will be even before the end of the year. 
   Votes on confirmations may take place even on Saturday, January 20. I believe that has been the case in the past--if not January 20, certainly beginning on Monday, January 22. We will want to move forward very quickly on actually confirming the nominations. Senators will be further notified on January 3.  
   Regarding the Cabinet nominations schedule, when we receive those nominations, again we will work together on what that schedule may be. 
   Again, I want to thank the Senate officers, Senators, and leadership on both sides of the aisle for what I believe has been a very productive session and for the dedication of Senators to the American people. 
   I see Senator DASCHLE is here. We have some resolutions we can do if we have a break here in a moment. Then we will have some that we want to do at the very end of the session. 
   At this point, I yield the floor if Senator LAUTENBERG wishes to make any comments.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from New Jersey would yield, perhaps that is a good point. Yes, I would like to hear the story uninterrupted. If the Senator would allow us to do a little bit of leadership business--one of which, or both of which I know the Senator would be very interested in--I ask, with the agreement of the Senator from New Jersey, that his statement appear in the RECORD as if uninterrupted, and the exchange with Senator DASCHLE, our colloquy, appear after his remarks.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his fine work on this issue. I know there is a lot of passion, a lot of support for Amtrak. But let me remind my colleagues, I am one of those supporters. I have been an active supporter of the national rail passenger system and was very much involved a couple of years ago when we passed the Amtrak legislation. I had some strong opposition on our side of the aisle. I think we need it. 
   Now, I must confess one of the reasons I think we need it is I want us to have good service, not just in the northeast but I also would like to have access from my own State of Mississippi to be able to get to Atlanta and Washington and Boston, and we are the beneficiaries of Amtrak service. I think we have to do it. I have pledged if it can't run efficiently, if it cannot run without going into debt, at some point we may want to say we just can't do that and decide what is going to be the successor program. 
   But I also think it is guaranteed and doomed to failure if we don't give it an opportunity to succeed. If you don't have modern equipment, if you don't have the new fast trains, if you don't have a rapid rail system, it will not work. 
   So I support this legislation. I want to commit to our colleagues here that I will join with Senator DASCHLE in cosponsoring this legislation next year. We will work together to get the appropriate hearings in the Finance Committee and hopefully in the Commerce Committee, too--even though this bill is under the Finance subcommittee jurisdiction because of the tax aspects of it--but the Amtrak part of it, of course, would fall under Commerce. I am on both committees and Senator DASCHLE will probably be on the Finance Committee, too. We will work with the ranking member and the chairman to get hearings and move this legislation. 
   I cannot guarantee we will have the votes or that it will not be filibustered or that we can break a filibuster, but I think it is the right thing to do. I might just add, the chairman of the Amtrak board, Governor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, has been very actively involved. He supports this legislation. He has called me personally about this legislation. He really cares about it. 
   When we talk about bipartisanship, transportation is an issue on which we have been able to work together in a bipartisan way, whether it is roads, AIR-21, TEA-21, Amtrak, rapid rail system. We can do it again. 
   Maybe we can improve on this bill. We talked about that in an exchange yesterday. Maybe there are some things we can do, some tweaks that would make it better and resolve some of the concerns. And we will try to do that. I am prepared to make that commitment. I believe we can do it early next year. I am not talking about having it languish; I am trying to get movement on it in the first 3 months, 6 months of the session, so those who have reservations can offer amendments and we will vote on them. Hopefully, we can get it done, and I commit to do that.

It seems there is an objection, notwithstanding the receipt of the papers, that we have a vote and then go to debate, but we are working on an arrangement that will allow us to proceed with debate and get some certainty about how the vote will be dispensed with. We should be able to get that clarified in a few minutes. I would hate to ask the Senator to yield again in a few minutes, but in view of the importance of the issue, I might do that. For now, that is all the business Senator DASCHLE and I have.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now have a list of Executive nominations which have been cleared on both sides. 
   We have been working on this for several days. A number of these nominations were running the risk of not being confirmed, or possibly having recess appointments, which we would like to avoid. This list includes Executive calendar nominations and nominations to be discharged from several committees and confirmed. 
   In executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the nominations I send to the desk be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. 
   I add that this list is comprised of approximately 41 nominations, plus an additional list of almost 400 Foreign Service career officers.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one note on these nominations and appointments: 
   I understand that United States Presidents have for years had the ability to recess appoint nominations. I know of many instances going back at least to the 1950s. I also understand that many majority leaders--including Senator BYRD and Senator Mitchell--have had words of caution for Presidents of the United States when they were majority leader with respect to recess appointments. I know that this majority leader, as well as Senator BYRD, are very much concerned about recess appointments--especially appointments to the Federal judiciary--Ðduring a period of time after we adjourn sine die, or at the beginning, frankly, of the year right as we go into the new administration. Congress has seen this area to continue to erode. I think we need to deal very aggressively with it. The Vacancy Act that Senator BYRD has worked on is something about which we need to be very serious. I hope this administration will heed these words of caution and understand the concerns of the whole Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. I understand, of course, that is a possibility. We have not been notified of any recess appointments or any Federal judicial appointment during this recess period. However, I note it has been done in the past, and there has been some suggestion it could occur during the next 6 weeks before the next Inauguration. 
   I want to check on exactly what would be the situation. I understand even a Federal judge's term would expire, depending on when it happened, at the end of the Congress, but there would be tremendous pressure then to reappoint that person. I agree with the Senator that any appointment of a Federal judge during a recess should be opposed, regardless of who they are or whether it is Republican or Democrat. I commit myself now to remember that when there is a Republican administration, as well as a Democratic administration. 
   I do know there were Federal judges back in the early 1950s appointed by President Eisenhower. That was a mistake then, and it would be one now. I understand that could be contemplated. This word of caution on your behalf and on mine on behalf of the Senate, hopefully, will cause that not to happen.

No matter what hour of the day the Senate came in, Senator THURMOND was in the chair and recognized the Chaplain and called on a Senator to lead the Pledge of Allegiance. On a few occasions, I even suggested a substitute could fill in, but on rare occasions did that ever happen. 
   He has set a tremendous example for all of us in the Senate. He continues the tradition that Senator BYRD of West Virginia also exhibited when he was President pro tempore. So I am sincere when I say we extend our appreciation to Senator THURMOND for his diligence as our President pro tempore.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I could go on for quite some time about my colleague from South Dakota. He does a magnificent job as the Democratic leader. He is thoughtful. He is accessible. He is tenacious. He is committed. He is courteous. And while, as leaders  of our respective parties in the Senate, we sometimes disagree and sometimes even clash publicly--it has been rare--we have a very good working relationship. When the day is done and we have conversations, they are quite often personal and very kind. I appreciate his courtesies. I look forward to working with him in the next Congress. 
   It is going to surely test us in every way, every day, but I hope and pray we will be up to the task. I will certainly try to fulfill that new, challenging role. And I know I can count on my friend and partner to do his part on the other side of the aisle. 
   So I am delighted to be able to offer this resolution of commendation to Senator DASCHLE.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me take this occasion to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and, in his absence, Senator BYRD for his cooperation with Senator STEVENS. They work together as a team every day. They do an incredible job. They have one of the toughest jobs in the Congress. 
   I have been working in budget processes now directly for I guess about 20 years. When I was in the House as the whip, I sometimes reluctantly became a participant in those budget renegotiations. They were never easy. But I don't think I have ever seen more fire, lightning, and thunder than we had on this bill, when you compare it to bills of the past that were relatively small in size and various parts. 
   It was very tough. Everything was fought over so aggressively. Things didn't get in, such as Amtrak, and things got in, such as Medicare adjustments. But we found a way to make it happen. We found it very hard to let go. But the Senator from Alaska hung in there. I know he was working at 2 o'clock this morning, and I know he was back at the office today at 6:30. I talked to him sometime between 6:30 and 8 o'clock this morning. The amazing thing was he was sweet and charming and pleasant. 
   Is this the deed? Is this what we have here?

   Finally, all of us learned in the last 2 days more than we 
   ever wanted to know about the Steller sea lion. What is it, and what are they? Whatever they are, I am sure they are beautiful, and I know they appreciate the effort of the Senator from Alaska. I know about 10,000 Alaskans appreciate the fact that their jobs will not be wiped out almost instantly. 
   The administration was very tough, but they were protecting the Endangered Species Act. I don't know quite how Senator STEVENS found common ground. But he did. Thank goodness for all of the persistence. He is affectionately known as ``The Tasmanian Devil.'' But today he did this job without his Tasmanian necktie. 
   While we get very testy with each other sometimes, we still really appreciate the work that is done. 
   Senator STEVENS, congratulations, and I look forward to someday being able to know all that is in the bill.

   Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the concerns of the two Senators from Ohio. They have made a very strong and convincing case on the need for a solution to this problem. I pledge to work with them to see that this issue is addressed as early as possible in the 107th Congress.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know that Senators are interested in the schedule. 
   First, just very briefly, I want to recognize the achievement that has just taken place. A lot of hard work went into this bill over a long period of time by, of course, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator HATCH, Senator LEAHY, and Senator TORRICELLI. But it also took cooperation from Senator WELLSTONE. Whether he is for it or against it, I think again it showed that when we try we can get a final result which gets some 70 votes. 
   I commend all of them. 
   This upcoming vote on the continuing resolution should be the last vote of the week. It will be necessary to pass an additional continuing resolution on Friday. However, we are not aware of any request on the other side of the aisle for a rollcall vote. 
   Tomorrow's continuing resolution should carry us over until Monday or Tuesday, and we will make further announcements to update Members as to the schedule for next week. 
   During this time, we will be putting the finishing touches on the appropriations bills and a final determination on the Medicare adjustments. 
   We are working in a bipartisan way and in a bicameral way with the administration. 
   We hope to be able to finish the business for the year and for this Congress before the end of next week. It will take a lot more work, but we are making some progress in that direction.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to the Country Doctor of the Year, Dr. Howard Clark of Morton, MS. Clark was selected for this award out of 501 doctors from 41 States by a national physicians association. At the young age of 73, Dr. Clark sees an average of 60 patients a day, cares for about 20 who are hospitalized and 110 who reside in the local nursing home. He is a graduate of Mississippi State University and attended medical school at both the University of Mississippi and Tulane University. Clark was among the first doctors hired when the University of Mississippi Medical Center opened its doors in 1955. He has been in practice in Morton since 1956. I want to commend Dr. Clark not only for his service to the people of Morton and the surrounding areas but also for the service he gave this great Nation. When Howard Clark joined the Armed Forces following graduation from high school, he was stationed in the South Pacific. At the time, there was a dire need for medics and he volunteered. This altruistic act sparked the start of a career that has made life better for those around him. Dr. Clark's selflessness spills over into his personal life as well. He is an active member of the Morton community, serving as the local school doctor at sporting events, missing only one game in 43 years. Dr. Clark, you are to be admired for your service to the community, the Nation, and for being chosen Country Doctor of the Year. I join your family, friends, and colleagues in congratulating you on this honor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of an admiring Senate, I extend happy birthday and best wishes to our great Senator, the favorite son of South Carolina, STROM THURMOND. What a career he has had and what an example he sets for all of us: A soldier, a patriot, a teacher, a political leader, a man of good will, and a gentle man. We appreciate his presence every day and hope he has a very happy day today and many more to come.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m. By previous consent, the Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly party conferences to meet. When we reconvene, the Senate may continue morning business. However, it is possible the Senate will have one or as many as four votes this afternoon. I don't want to lock it in at this point, but it is possible we could have a recorded vote at 2:15 on the continuing resolution that would be for 2 days. We also could have one or more votes this afternoon on or in relation to cloture on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2415, the bankruptcy legislation.  
   I see the distinguished assistant Democratic leader here. He may want to comment on that. I emphasize that we do expect at least a couple, maybe as many as four, votes this afternoon. 
   I welcome back all Senators of the 106th Congress. I hope this session can come to an early conclusion. It would be very important at this time, considering all that is going on. If we show we can act quickly on the remaining appropriations bills and dispose of the tax and Medicare issues, that will be very positive for our country. I look forward to working with the chairman and senior member of the Appropriations Committee to see if we can get that worked out and see if there is any way that maybe we can complete it by Thursday night when this continuing resolution will expire. We will get more information to all Senators later this afternoon, after consultation with the Democratic leaders. 
   I yield to Senator REID.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we will shortly proceed to a continuing resolution that will fund the Government through December 5. I should note there were a number of conversations during the day on Monday between the leadership in the Senate and the House and the President. The agreement was that a continuing resolution to a later date would be appropriate. There were earlier dates considered, but there was conflict with House Members on November 27. That is why the date of December 5 was agreed to. 
   It is expected that the Senate will also receive the adjournment resolution from the House fairly quickly so that it can be considered prior to the policy luncheons. Both the continuing resolution and the adjournment resolution will be passed by unanimous consent. Therefore, no votes will occur during today's session. 
   I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving and also urge that we complete our discussions at 12:30 p.m. as scheduled for the policy luncheons and that we move toward a quick adjournment when we return after the luncheons, hopefully by 2:30 p.m. 
   We will continue to work on the issues that are outstanding between the Republicans and the Democrats, House and Senate, and the administration during this interim period. Senator DASCHLE and I expect to meet tomorrow to talk over the substance of the issues pending.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will make one comment at this point, and that is, this morning I had occasion to see Senator REID as he was passing by my office. We talked a little bit about history and the fact that the very office in the Capitol where I sit was where the House of Representatives met in 1801 to determine who would be President because there had been a tie in the election. The House of Representatives voted 36 ballots before they determined the winner by 1 vote to be Thomas Jefferson. He won over Aaron Burr. He went on to be one of the greatest Presidents in the history of our country. I leave that for a little thought for all concerned, and now worried, about what the future holds. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Salissa Wahlers of Gulfport, Mississippi, for her selection to the Peace Corps program. Salissa is teaching English in Uzbekistan, where she will be working for the next two years. This is only Salissa's most recent accomplishment, and it adds to a long list that has grown throughout her life. 
   Salissa graduated from Middlebury College where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and sociology/anthropology. She was named Woman of the Year by the Women's Studies Program while at Middlebury. While in college, Salissa participated in the semester abroad program by attending Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Additionally, she attended a winter semester at Berea College in Kentucky as a part of her college's winter term exchange program. 
   Mr. President, Salissa worked for three years during college to complete her honors thesis, which is very impressive for an undergraduate student. Her hard work paid off when she was able to present part of her thesis at the Northeastern Anthropological Association Conference in Queens, New York, this spring. She is clearly a model student, and she exemplifies the rewards that individuals and society as a whole realize when education is a priority. I know her family, especially her mother, Kemmer McCall of Gulfport, is very proud of her.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately proceed to a cloture vote on H.R. 2415, the bankruptcy legislation. Following the vote, it is hoped, if cloture is invoked, that there will be a reasonable amount of postcloture debate time to be followed by a vote on the adoption of the conference report. 
   As a reminder, the Senate will recess for the weekly party conferences from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. 
   Also, today a vote on a continuing resolution may be necessary. But we are working on how that will be handled, and we should be able to determine that right after this recorded vote. If there is a vote on the continuing resolution, it is expected to be late this afternoon. But we are seeing if some other arrangement can be worked out. Senators will be notified if and when that vote is scheduled.

I know it is not easy, but I think this is the right thing to do. I hope the House will accept this resolution and then we would proceed to wrap things up after that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Speaker of the House. There have been staff contacts with the leadership on both sides of the aisle. It is my impression that the leadership on both sides will work for this to be accepted. We had some discussion about a different date, but the House felt very strongly that this date was preferred to the later one, and 
   that is basically one of the reasons why we settled on this date. Hopefully, they will move quickly to accept this and then we will be able to go do our responsibilities in other areas. 
   I say also that while we will be home and will not be here for awhile, there has been further progress made on the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations bill. I understand there are only a few issues remaining. The staff will not be on vacation. Work will continue. It would be my hope that the areas of disagreement can be worked out and when we come back on November 14, we will have a vote or two and that is all, that we would be done with it. But hope springs eternal, and it doesn't always come true. That is what we are thinking about right now.

   Mr. LOTT. We have seen here today persistence does pay off. Yesterday very little was said about it, but a lot of credit goes to the members of the committee that produced the Water Resources Development Act under the chairmanship of BOB SMITH. There was some disagreements with the House, but they put their shoulder to the wheel and we passed that very important legislation last night. Today, thanks to a lot of good effort by Senator DASCHLE and Senator REID, and working with Senators on our side, we were able to move the FSC legislation, which we had not been able to get done earlier. So at this very moment, we are continuing to work to get agreement on the bankruptcy vote. I agree that this is an indication of why we probably should take a time-out. We didn't pass that cloture today because of absentees. I believe when we get everybody here, cloture will be invoked, and we will go forward with that important legislation. 
   Again, I thank the Senator for his good work as always. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before this session of the 106th Congress comes to an end, I'd like to take the time to say farewell to Tom McIlwain, who served on my staff this year as a fellow from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Prior to coming to my staff in March, he served as Fishery Administrator for the NMFS Southeast Fishery Center. Tom is a native of my hometown, Pascagoula, Mississippi. He understands the importance of oceans and fisheries issues to the Gulf Coast, and the Mississippi coast in particular. 
   This is Tom's second stint as a fellow on my staff. Back when I was a member of the other chamber, and Tom worked for the State of Mississippi, he spent a year as a fellow on my staff advising me on oceans and fisheries matters. Tom is a longtime expert in this area. His advice and counsel was just as vital to me this year as it was back then. 
   As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I have participated in development and passage of a number of oceans and fisheries authorization bills during this session, and Tom has advised me on every one of them. This year alone, he assisted in the enactment into public law of the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000, Fishermen's Protective Act Amendments of 1999, Yukon River Salmon Act of 1999, and the Fisheries Survey Vessel Authorization Act of 1999, and the Senate passage of the Pribilof Islands Transition Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Act of 2000, Shark Finning Prohibition Act, Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, and Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act of  1999. I expect several of the latter bills to be enacted this year. 
   Tom also identified key funding shortfalls in NMFS and State of Mississippi programs for the Gulf of Mexico. His concern that Gulf of Mexico needs were being overlooked as NMFS funding was increased to address high-profile issues in other regions of the country led me to fight for additional funding for our region. The NMFS appropriation for Fiscal year 2001 includes an additional $8.25 million for red snapper research and $1 million to expand the NMFS Mississippi Laboratory at Pascagoula. I know he is pleased with that the State of Mississippi will receive much needed additional funding for coastal impact assistance, almost $28 million in Fiscal Year 2001. This vital piece of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act was authorized and funded this year. 
   I wish Tom and his wife Janet all the best as they prepare for his next assignment within NMFS. I know that whatever he does, he will bring to it the same keen insight, practical solutions, and good humor that has served him so well in the past.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we were all saddened to learn of the death of a long-time Senate employee and good friend, Ms. Betty Bunch. Betty died last week after a long struggle with a pulmonary infection. 
   Betty started working for the Senate on January 3, 1977, when she moved to Washington, DC, to be the office manager for Senator Malcolm Wallop, the Republican Senator from Wyoming. As a graduate of the University of Wyoming, Ms. Bunch worked for some years at the University before deciding to move East with the Senator. 
   After serving Senator Wallop for 10 years, Betty transferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration and worked for ranking member Senator TED STEVENS of Alaska. In July 1991, Betty moved to the Senate Sergeant at Arms office and worked on a number of projects for the Education and Support Services team of the Computer Center. 
   One of Betty's major projects was to assist with the final construction planning for the Sergeant at Arms' operations move to the Postal Square building. She was very involved in the relocation of the Senate's computer and communications center and staff, as well as the financial and procurement staffs. This was a major initiative, and Betty accomplished it with the utmost professionalism. 
   Betty continued on a number of special projects for the Sergeant at arms until her retirement in June 1999. In total, Betty served the Senate well for over 22 years. 
   We will all miss her loyalty, professionalism, integrity, and wonderful sense of humor. Her son Jamie and daughter-in-law Glennis are in our thoughts and prayers.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 6:45 p.m., with Senators speaking for up to 10 minutes each. A vote on a continuing resolution that funds the Government for another day will occur at approximately 6:45 p.m. if the papers have been received from the House. We will try, once again, to see if we can get a vote before that time. The House, I believe, goes in at 6, so we probably will not have the papers before 6:45. We will see if we can go ahead and arrange for a vote to occur before that time but hopefully no later than 6:45. Senators will be updated throughout the afternoon's session. 
   By previous order, the Senate will convene on Monday at 5 p.m. to consider another continuing resolution. That vote will occur at 7 p.m. and will be the first vote of the day. I might say that there have been meetings with the appropriate Members of Congress and the administration on Saturday. There have been ideas exchanged--are being exchanged even now--that are being developed. I think we are very close, even though it is never over until we get an agreement on the final four or five issues that are still in play. 
   I think it would be wise for the Senate, the House--the Congress--and the administration to complete their work as soon as possible so that we can leave to be with our constituents and attend to our duties back in our respective States. But it is more important that we look after the people's business first. We will continue, as we have been now, until an agreement can be worked out. We are prepared to exchange some suggestions today, and hopefully we will get some additional information later on this afternoon. 
   It is still my hope that perhaps by Tuesday we could have the final two or three votes that would be required. That would mean the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, in whatever final form it might be, would have to be filed not later than Monday night. So we would need to have time, of course, for that to be filed and printed and for Senators to have a chance to review it. I presume that would then mean that the vote, if it came on Tuesday, would be late on Tuesday. But I will confer with Senator REID--we were just talking about it--and with Senator DASCHLE to make sure we give Senators the maximum amount of notification when those substantive recorded votes might occur. 
   Again, I do not want to give the impression it is just about to be done, but that would be our fervent hope. We will give as much advance notice as possible for a final vote on the tax relief package, and also the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and bankruptcy. I expect to file cloture on the bankruptcy bill 
   today or tomorrow, depending on what might be happening with the schedule. 
   With that, Mr. President, I see Senator REID is here. Would the Senator like me to yield to him?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend my hearty congratulations to the University of Mississippi football team. Their homecoming was yesterday. My daughter and wife and son-in-law, along with a large number of friends, were there; I, however, was not there; I was here. But our very worthy opponent was the Running Rebels of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It was a hard-fought victory in overtime. The University of Mississippi prevailed 43-40. So I know all present would be interested in having that information. I extend my congratulations to Senator REID on his outstanding team and his outstanding quarterback who almost gave me a very miserable Saturday night but, thank goodness, good fortune did prevail.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, for the interest of all Senators, I know they are wondering when a vote or votes will occur. It is anticipated that there will be at least a couple, maybe three or four votes, within the next 2 or 3 hours. We are not certain exactly what time that will occur, but I will try to get it started shortly so we can get to the votes that are needed. 
   For instance, once again we are going to need to set up a process so we can get a vote on the very important bankruptcy legislation. As a result of trying to get on the tax bill yesterday, I had to set aside an action that had been taken earlier on the bankruptcy reform, and it is my intention still to try to file cloture on that to try to get that very important legislation addressed before the Senate completes its work. 
   Also, we would need to vote on the continuing resolution that would take us over into tomorrow. 
   Also, we would possibly need to move to proceed to the D.C. appropriations conference report and the Commerce-State-Justice conference report. Within a few minutes we will try to get those started. 
   Mr. President, as to what has been said last night and this morning, it has been interesting. You know, the American people understand this is a political season and that tempers get a little short, people get a little desperate in their actions, and I think that begins at the White House with the President. I have tried to communicate with the President, but it is not always easy. He was in New York City the night before last. He was playing golf yesterday afternoon. He did return the call I made to him yesterday afternoon, even though I placed the call the day before to talk about some of this. But he has written this letter threatening a veto. 
   So much of this is complaints about procedure, complaints about ``inside baseball,'' complaints about what may not be in the bill. Let me say to the American people some very important things they need to hear. Let's not get into all the brush of the way we do business around here. Let's talk about the result. 
   First of all, some people may be surprised to learn--some people may not even like it--but 80 percent to 90 percent of this bill has been requested by the President of the United States. He wants these things, and they have been negotiated with the administration. There have been negotiations between the House and Senate. Once again, that is procedure. But let me assure the American people there are a lot of things in here that he wanted that I don't particularly like. Let me also say there are some things that were taken out at his specific request. 
   When you get down and analyze his complaints, it is because 
   he doesn't think we did quite enough to suit him on this school bond construction tax credit. There are a lot of people over here who do not think that what we have done should be in this bill. But there was an effort made to accommodate a lot of different thinking. But he is not opposed to what is in here necessarily; he just wants more. 
   On the Medicare adjustments, lots of people have had input on that. The House of Representatives had an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote on that subject. I don't know exactly what it was, but probably 300 or more for the Medicare adjustments. The Finance Committee reported it out, I believe it was 19-0. I will clarify for the record these exact votes. So there has been an awful lot of bipartisanship. 
   But let's not get all wrapped up in that. Let's look at what is in the bill. Let's look at what is in the bill that is overwhelmingly good, that everybody is for, and we are reduced to complaining about how it got here. 
   Once again, It's the old saying we are going to defeat the good--no, we are going to defeat the excellent because we do not like the procedure or because it is not perfect or everything that the President wants. We are a coequal branch. He should not expect, and he will not get, 100 percent of what he wants. No President will--none. But we worked with him. When you get 80 or 90 percent of what you want, then most people say that is pretty good. He sits over there or in California or New York and says: Give me everything. 
   Let me talk to the American people about what is good about this bill. Let's not get into the politics and the procedure and all that is happening. Let us just go down the list and let's talk a little bit about what is included. 
   Who among us is opposed to the IRA and pension reform provisions in this bill? Who thinks we should not raise IRA contributions up to $5,000 per year? 
   Who thinks we should not increase contribution limits for 401(k)s, 403(b)s and 457 plans from $10,000 to $15,000? And, by the way, with a lot of bipartisan requests, another $5,000 I believe is available for people over 50 for these 401(k) and other plans. There are some 50 modifications in this bill with regard to IRAs and pensions. We want to encourage people to save, don't we? Who is opposed to this? 
   By the way, unfortunately, it has limits. This is really targeted at middle-income and low-income people to encourage savings. The chairman of the Finance Committee has become the hero of the IRA proposals, the Roth IRA. Here again, we take one more small step to give people a little opportunity to save for their needs, for their children, without the Government saying: Oh, we will tell you how you may do that and we will limit it. So I think there are pretty good provisions in there. 
   There is small business tax relief for the one group left in America that may save us, the small business men and women, those young entrepreneurs, men and women and minorities who take a chance, people who start the little restaurant, as the Senator from Nebraska did. He went out there; he found out about the restaurant business--it is tough. You have to get people hired. You have insurance costs. You have crime. You have management problems. You have food spoilage. It is endless. Bless their hearts. 
   So we do a little something for small business men and women. I do not apologize for that. My only complaint is we do not do enough. The ridiculousness of the request from the administration that we take out a provision that would have eliminated the .02 percent Federal unemployment tax surtax--it doesn't take out the FUTA tax, just the so-called surtax that was temporary, just stuck it on the small business men and women to boost this fund which I understand now has $22 billion in it. 
   So we had a proposal to take off that little .02. That is something that will actually help the small business man and woman who is working on the margins, barely making it, a little extra they can keep that is not needed in this $22 billion trust fund. 
   Then the tip credit. The President threatened to veto this bill over the tip credit issue. He is wrong. The Senator from Nebraska knows that was a mistake. These are people who never had another job, couldn't get another job. This is a little help for the people who are working on tips. My Lord, we are taxing tips. If you work hard and you get a bonus, you pay extra. If you work hard, you do a really good job, and you get a little extra tip, you pay a little extra. The whole concept is ridiculous. 
     But in an effort to accommodate that, in a conversation I had with the President himself, we took out the FUTA and the tip credit. I apologize to small business men and women. I apologize to the workers out there busing those tables. That was unfortunate, but it was taken out at the specific request of the President of the United States. 
   I wanted those taxes taken out, but he would not let us do it. So in this spirit of cooperation--there is so much rain and so many dark clouds here about how we do not have more cooperation. Next year, thank goodness, we are going to have a different President. Hopefully, we will have a better atmosphere around here. Maybe we can work together. I believe George W. Bush means that, believes it, and will reach out and try to bring us together. This is a classic case of where we tried to accommodate the President of the United States, and he writes this letter threatening his veto. He may veto it, but the American people are going to know who did what needed to be done and who vetoed it. 
   We do have this package of small business tax relief that has been negotiated by Chairman ROTH, Chairman ARCHER, a lot of input from Democrats in the House and Senate, and the administration. It also includes above-the-line deductions for health insurance for employees in small businesses. This is bad? 
   What about that restaurant owner who provides insurance for his supervisory personnel, but he or she cannot provide it for all of their workers because it would just eat up all the margin of profit he has? Here you can allow the employees to deduct the cost of their health insurance. This is a good idea. This would help entry-level workers, minority workers, people who are carrying the load in this country get a little break on health insurance. But, oh, no, ``We don't really like that idea because it is above-the-line deductions''--once again, explain that to the man and woman down there working in the trenches--``We ought to have a credit or something.'' This is good, and it would help people in that low-income area. By the way, we have been hearing all year long that we have to have a minimum wage increase. A minimum wage increase is in here: $1 over 2 years, raising it to $6.15. It is in there. Is the President against that? 
   Then also there is a provision in here called community renewal. This would allow rural areas, poor areas to have a chance for economic development, to have a chance to recruit a little business. The Mississippi Delta pops into my mind: poor people struggling to get a little infrastructure, improve their education, get a few jobs in the area. 
   Enterprise zones: There are 40 of those, 40 of the new community renewals. This is a deal, by the way, asked for by the President and the Speaker. I had reservations about a lot of the provisions, but we worked through that. This was negotiated with the administration interminably for weeks and months. It is in here. Some people on my side think this is not a good idea, but I supported it. 
   The President made a deal with the Speaker; that is, President Clinton, in case you do not quite understand, and Speaker Denny Hastert made a deal they wanted to do it and, by the way, supported by J.C. Watts passionately. This is a way we can help rural and poor communities. Let's do this; let's do this. I have been in meetings when there was an effort to kill this until J.C. Watts spoke up and everybody went silent. It is 
   in here. Are you against that? 
   I have tried on this floor for weeks to move the foreign sales credit fix for WTO compliance. It came out of the Finance Committee unanimously. I have asked unanimous consent to move it. For some strange reason, it has been objected to by the Democrats in the Senate. When you are in the leadership, you have to do some of these things, and Senator REID had to object on behalf of somebody; he would not object. It has been objected to. 
   What are we going to do here? On November 1, we will have a problem with our European allies. I do not think they are doing very good, frankly, complying with WTO, and they are not reacting to sanctions. I am not going to cry alligator tears over the Europeans and WTO, but that provision is in this bill. Is the President going to veto that? Those are four broad categories and a lot of subcompartments about which I have talked. 
   The Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU, has been very supportive of this concept of encouraging adoption. We should encourage more adoption for people who are not only wealthy but people in the lower and middle-income area. This bill doubles the tax credit for adoption to $10,000, I believe is the number. Is that not good? No, no, that is good.

   Mr. LOTT. I wanted to work on that. I told the President the other day: Mr. President, if there is something in here you don't particularly like, we can change that maybe in the next bill. Mr. President, if there is something more you want, let's add it in the next bill. This is not the be all to end all. This is not the end of the world. This is a giant step for mankind though. And he is going to veto it because he does not get every last dot and tittle that he wants? I do not think that is defensible. 
   Let me go on down the list. For years, I have been an advocate under pressure from the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, for farm savings accounts. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee does not like this sort of thing. He says it will never end. We have savings accounts for education, for medical expenses, now for farms. My attitude is, why not? I never met an incentive to encourage people to save for their own needs I did not like, and to encourage farmers to save a little for the bad times because, more than anybody else, they know the good times when the crops are abundant, weather is good, prices are fine; they do fine. And then rain, sleet, snow, drought, locusts--they have to deal with all of it. Allow them to save a little for the bad times. Is that a bad idea? No, that is a good idea. 
   Deduction for computer donations to schools and libraries: Businesses and industries, big and small, are willing to give their 2- and 3-year-old computers to schools and libraries to help with programs such as Power Up. Let's power up these kids. Let's use these used computers to teach them to read and to become computer literate. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. 
   ABRAHAM, has been relentless in pushing for that. The amazing thing to me is, why would anybody not be for that? This is good. That is in this bill. 
   Deduction for long-term health insurance and long-term health expenses: This is an interesting category. We have been worried legitimately about the people who are worried about the long-term needs they have with their health. We want to do something about it. We do it in this bill, but when I talked to the President: Gee, I really prefer a credit as opposed to a deduction, but if you make the deduction high enough, maybe it will be OK. 
   When I talked to him yesterday, he said: Yes, you did go up higher. We are going to nitpick a gnat to death. Should we have long-term health insurance deductions or not? We have an opportunity here. The President is going to veto it, flitter it away. I do not understand that. 
   I have taken a lot of unkind commentary from my colleagues on this side of the aisle about the Amtrak bonds credit. The Senator from Massachusetts knows I have tried to be helpful to Amtrak. I believe in America, if we are going to be a modern nation and lead the world, we need a national rail passenger system. I think we need it, I think we can have it, and I think it can be self-supportive. Maybe not. I think it can. 
   I supported Amtrak reform. I stood on this floor--the Senator remembers--and helped make that happen with some opposition. There were people ready to pull the plug and say: Goodbye, adios, Amtrak. I do not think that is wise. 
   I made a commitment, and I will keep it some day: If we have done everything we can to get Amtrak in the position of providing the service, making ends meet and paying for themselves, if we can get that done, great. If  we cannot, at some point, we have to say Americans do not support a national rail passenger system and we pull the plug. 
   I do not like tax credits, particularly. I prefer deductions. You can argue this is not good, and I have heard that argument from the Senator from Texas and others. 
   Again, Senator ROTH from Delaware has made this one of his highest priorities and so has, by the way--once again, proving the bipartisanship of this legislation--the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, the ranking member on the Finance Committee. 
   People come to me and say: How in the world could you let that in there? 
   First of all, I am not a dictator. And secondly, how can anybody, any leadership person, tell the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the Finance Committee that they cannot have in this bill one of their highest priorities, the Amtrak issue? So it is in here. Is that bad? No. I think it is pretty good. 
   We repealed the diesel barge tax. We have modes of transportation other than Amtrak that are kind of having a hard time--rail and barge. We have here a 4.3-cent tax we dumped on them. We ought to take it off. We ought to take it off of the automobile gasoline also. 
   We expanded the qualified zone academy bonds for school construction. The President says he wants this. I think we are starting down a track that is not going to be very healthy where we eventually build all schools in America with Federal funds. That is where we are headed. That is where a lot of people want us to be. I do not think that is good. I think that ought to be done at the local level. 
   I am willing to give them an incentive through bonds, where they have to pay the principal, and they get some consideration on the interest. I am willing to do that. But what some people want, once again, is they want everything in school, in education, run from Washington. That is what really is at stake. 
   Once we start building schools, local schools, from Federal funds, let me tell you, Mississippi will have the nicest, newest schools in all of America--all of America--because we have more poor people and greater needs probably than anybody. But I do not think we should just totally take over education. 
   I still trust parents, teachers, administrators, and students at the local level. I do not trust bureaucrats in Washington at the Department of Education or the IRS or anywhere else. So that is some of the good stuff in this bill. 
   Let me also point out--and I did not even get very much into the Medicare add-backs. Everything says we need them. What about hospitals? What about rural hospitals? What about home health care? What about hospice? What about managed care? What about the nursing homes? They need some help. This bill provides that. 
   There has been a lot of bipartisan input on that. If I had my druthers, I would mix it a little differently. I would put in more for hospitals and rural hospitals, a little less for probably some other categories, but it is not just about Mississippi hospitals; it is about Massachusetts hospitals; it is about managed care facilities in New Mexico; it is about nursing homes in Kentucky. You have to try to find a blend. You also have to try to keep it from exploding totally out of control because it could be $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion. I think this bill is between $28 and $30 billion. It is enough to do what is needed. And it has the endorsement of many organizations. I have a list.

   Mr. LOTT. I have a letter from the American Hospital Association--I believe that is correct; yes, here it is--  
   On behalf of 5,000 members of the American Hospital Association, I am writing to express our views regarding the ``Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act of 2000.'' We believe this legislation will take another step forward in addressing the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Consequently, as we approach the remaining hours of the congressional session, we are urging Members to vote in favor of this legislation, and have recommended that the President not veto the legislation.  
   That is dated October 26, 2000, signed by Rick Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association. 
   So you do not like the mix. You think maybe there is too much going to managed care. But when you help hospitals and rural hospitals, there is a passthrough provision that adds to the managed care provision. 
   You do have people in the Senate and from all over the country who believe the Medicare+Choice is a very important provision. They worked very hard in advancing their provisions--Democrats and Republicans. 
   So while it is not perfect--if we took that same $30 billion and gave it to a Senator from Wyoming, and then a Senator from Pennsylvania, they would come up with a different mix--after a lot of work, this is close to being fair to everybody. And again, it is not the end of the road. There will be another opportunity to work on it further. 
   I know the Senator from Idaho had wanted me to yield, perhaps on the adoption credit, or any comments he would like to make.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know a lot of Senators would like to speak. I also know we need to again have some votes here in a reasonable period of time. So I will try to get an agreement on how we can get some further comments and then move to a vote. I know the Senator from California had wanted me to yield on that particular point.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's comments on that. It is something we should work on. We have made progress. It is a shame we won't have it for the next 3 or 4 months. If the President insists on vetoing this bill, then I guess we will come back next year and have a chance to rework this whole area. I presume the tax bill next year, no matter who is elected President, will look different than this one. Maybe it would be better from my perspective, fairer overall, but provisions such as that could be worked on next year. I just hate that there are going to be adoptions that won't occur if the President vetoes this bill, that would occur if they had this additional credit. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the following Senators be recognized for times allotted, and that I be recognized immediately following those Senators: Senator GRAMM of Texas for up to 15 minutes and Senator WYDEN of Oregon for up to 15 minutes.

Then we could go ahead and have a vote on an issue on which we need to proceed. Then when that is over or during that vote, we can work on an order to make sure everybody has a chance to be heard, the time that they need to speak, and we can continue on, having had one vote disposed of.

   The bill has been debated for weeks, and many amendments have been offered on both sides. Minimum wage was offered, as a matter of fact, to this bill while it was pending on the Senate floor, but minimum wage now is going to be put in the tax relief package we have been discussing. 
   The bankruptcy bill ultimately passed by a vote of 83-14, so I will file cloture on this bill probably Sunday or Monday so we can get to a cloture vote and complete its action.

   Mr. LOTT. Therefore, the next vote will occur at 3:15 this afternoon. 
   Mr. President, for the information of Senators who are interested in the schedule, it is expected that the vote at 3:15 p.m. will be the last vote of the day. However, at this time, in view of the need for continuing resolutions, unless some different agreement can be worked out, we will be expected to have votes on Saturday and on Sunday with continuing resolutions. 
   Of course, there is serious work underway right now on the matters of disagreement. I note Saturday is the sabbath for a number of our colleagues and for observant Jews, and Sunday is my sabbath. I prefer we get a CR that will take us to Monday while we continue to work, but we have not been able to enter into that agreement yet. If necessary, we will be here and voting on CRs on Saturday and on Sunday. It is my expectation that vote will come late in the afternoon or early evening on Saturday. 
   Also, again, Senator STEVENS from the Appropriations Committee and the appropriators are meeting right now on the final details of the Labor-HHS bill. There is also some discussion about how we can move some of the problem issues out of the CSJ bill that has been reported out of conference and passed by the House. Corrections or changes, if agreed to, could be entered into the Labor-HHS bill. 
   I do want you to know the appropriators are busily working in their magical way, and I am sure at sometime a cone of honey will be produced, or maybe that is the wrong terminology to use, but they are getting closer to agreements. I hope it is something that can be signed, or I hope it is something I can vote for, too. Both of those are undetermined at this point. I know Senator KERRY wants to make further comments about an earlier issue. We now have 3 hours and 15 minutes to talk about the CR or other issues Senators wish.

I urge you to get Senator BYRD to discuss that with the leadership on the other side, and if you talk with Senator REID, we will communicate with the administration and hopefully maybe by 3:15 p.m. we can take that reasonable action. I certainly would support it. But we have to get an agreement.

   Mr. LOTT. I can assure the Senator that the change has absolutely no effect on the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over that program. As the Senator knows, at one time there were discussions about adding the entire CARA package to the Interior appropriation bill. The allocation of funding required us to add this portion, which includes Coastal Impact Assistance, to the Commerce appropriation. The change made in what Secretary disburses the funds does not alter in any manner the nature of the program, the purposes of the program, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over the program.

   Mr. LOTT. Therefore, unless an additional consent can be granted--and I will continue to work on that, along with Senator DASCHLE and Senator REID and others--the next two votes will be at approximately 9:30 a.m. on Saturday and approximately 7 p.m. on Sunday. The reason for those times is we understand now that the House will be voting on those continuing resolutions around 9 o'clock or so on Saturday and around 6 o'clock or so on Sunday. 
   I still hope that when we vote tomorrow, we could prevail upon those who insist on a vote on Sunday night to consider doing a continuing resolution that would take us over until Monday night for the next continuing resolution. 
   In the meantime, the members of the Appropriations Committee are going to be meeting further this afternoon on the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations conference report. I am sure other issues will be discussed and other discussions will occur with regard to the tax bill. Also, the Commerce-State-Justice conference report just passed. It is our intent to take up the Tax Relief Act early next week. We haven't locked in a time yet because there is no necessity for it at this moment. I know as many Senators as possible will want to be here and know when the vote is coming. I presume that would probably be sometime during the day Tuesday--probably late afternoon--but we will talk about that. Members will have as much advance notice on that as possible.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor this resolution to extend the authorities of the Senate National Security Working Group through December 31, 2002. 
   The Senate National Security Working Group is a bipartisan Group, established almost two years ago by myself and the Democratic Leader, that seeks to shed further light on important national security topics of interest to the Senate and the American people. Such topics include, but are not limited to: ballistic missile defenses, arms control, export controls, and weapons of mass destruction. 
   During the 106th Congress, the Working Group held numerous important briefings on topics of concern to the members of the Group and the Senate. Senior Executive branch officials from the Departments of Defense and State and other U.S. Government agencies appeared before the Group to describe the status of and rationale for on-going diplomatic discussions and formal and informal negotiations on various issues and to answer questions from Republican and Democratic Senators about those discussions and negotiations. 
   I am certain the Administration would agree with my assessment that the give-and-take in those meetings served a useful purpose. 
   In addition, I am pleased to report that members of the Group and staff were able to travel overseas, as part of their official responsibilities, to witness first-hand on-going diplomatic discussions and negotiations involving the United States, Russia, and other nations, and to visit certain foreign capitols for intensive discussions with foreign diplomatic and military leaders on topics of mutual concern. I strongly encourage the members of the Group to continue and expand this practice during the 107th Congress. 
   I am also pleased to announce that Senator THAD COCHRAN from my home state of Mississippi has agreed to serve during the 107th Congress as the Republican Administrative Co-Chairman of the Group. I appreciate his willingness to once again serve in this capacity. I look forward to participating in the Group's activities beginning early next year.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in our legislation, we also sought, at the request of our Mississippi State officials, to clarify the State of Mississippi's ownership in the mineral rights underlying the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Mississippi conveyed much of the surface property to create the Seashore in 1972. Until recently, the National Park Service has conceded ownership of these subsurface rights to Mississippi, as is reflected in the State's authorizing legislation in 1971 and the subsequent deed signed by the Governor and other Mississippi State officials. A copy of such deed is entered into the record with this statement. The only limitation on these rights was to be the way in which any future development of them occurred, so that the surface of the Seashore property would not be used for extraction of the minerals.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the bill as introduced included language which would have allowed the State of Mississippi to maintain the State's rights in or to any oil, gas, or other minerals through this acquisition. After further review of this legislation and the deed and related documents, our inclusion of the mineral rights provision was unnecessary, as the language was merely redundant with respect to the deed of 1972. It is our understanding that the deed clearly reserves the State of Mississippi's mineral rights with respect to the Gulf Islands National Seashore, and that no additional legislative language on mineral rights is required in the Cat Island legislation, because the State has made no conveyance with respect to Cat Island. Does the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee agree?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to recognize and bid farewell to an outstanding naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Clayton O. Mitchell, Jr., upon his departure from my staff. Lieutenant Commander Mitchell has truly epitomized the ``Can Do'' spirit of the Seabees and Navy core values of honor, courage, and commitment during his assignment as a Navy Legislative Fellow on my staff. He has been a valued team member who has had an enduring impact upon the State of Mississippi. He will be sorely missed. 
   Lieutenant Commander Mitchell reported to my staff from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Seventy Four, a Seabee battalion homeported in my home State of Mississippi. As operations officer for the ``Fearless'' Seabees of NMCB 74, he directed the military and construction operations for the unit at 11 deployment sites throughout the Atlantic coast, Caribbean, and Central America in addition to leading disaster recovery efforts in the aftermath of hurricane Georges. He spearheaded recovery operations which helped clear roads and restore vital services at Construction Battalion Center Gulfport and the Mississippi Gulf Coast within 24 hours. 
   Lieutenant Commander Mitchell is a 1985 industrial engineering graduate of California Polytechnic State University (Cal-Poly), San Luis Obispo. He was commissioned as an Ensign through the Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode Island after working two years as an engineer for Rockwell International. He began his career as a Navy Civil Engineer Corps officer with Chesapeake Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command as the Assistant Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Andrews AFB, Maryland. He then reported to Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Forty for two nine month deployments which included Assistant Officer in Charge, Detail Sigonella, Sicily and Officer in Charge, Detail Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territories. 
   After his first Seabee tour with NMCB Forty, Lieutenant Commander Mitchell then attended the University of California at Berkeley, earning a Master of Science degree in civil engineering. He followed Berkeley with an assignment to the United States Naval Academy as Shops Engineer in the Public Works Department, directing a 270 member workforce responsible for the Academy's facilities maintenance, transportation, and utilities operations. 
   His next challenge was as Facilities Planning Officer, Public Works Center, Yokosuka, Japan. In this capacity, he directed a host nation construction program with over $1.7 billion in projects under design and/or construction. He spearheaded execution of some of the Navy's most critical projects in Japan, including the delivery of 854 family housing units with the completion of the $1 billion Ikego family housing complex and a $41 million carrier pier at Yokosuka. For nine months during this tour, Lieutenant Commander Mitchell also served as Staff Civil Engineer to the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Japan, where he was the Navy's ``go to'' man for facilities and civil engineering issues. 
   Lieutenant Commander Mitchell has also made a significant impact in the various communities in which he has served. He directed a Mids'N'Kids tutorial/mentorship program, providing Annapolis youth with a midshipman sponsor and access to Naval Academy facilities on a weekly basis during the school year. As treasurer for the Samuel P. Massie Educational Endowment, he distributed over $35,000 in scholarship awards to Maryland college and university students. In 1995, he was recognized as the ``Volunteer of the Week for Father's Day'' by the Annapolis Capitol newspaper for his contributions in the community. In 1997, he was recognized by Black Engineer magazine with an ``Engineer of the Year: Special Recognition Award'' as one of the nation's promising young engineers of the future. 
   On my staff, he has established himself as a consummate professional providing guidance and oversight on a plethora of Department of Defense issues ranging from Defense health care, military construction, shipbuilding, and various weapons systems programs. His efforts also yielded over $100 million in research, development, test, and evaluation funds for Mississippi Universities. 
   Lieutenant Commander Mitchell is married to the former Karen Elaine Blackwell of Washington, D.C. and their family includes daughter, Kendra and son, Austin. He is a registered professional engineer in the Commonwealth of Virginia and a Seabee Combat Warfare qualified officer who enthusiastically returns to his Navy. I have appreciated greatly Lieutenant Commander Mitchell's contributions to my team and wish him fair winds and following seas in the future.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding NASA Manager, Stephen C. Nunez, upon his departure from my staff. Mr. Nunez was selected as a NASA Congressional Fellow to work in my office because of his knowledge of the aerospace industry, NASA programs, and NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in my home state of Mississippi. It is a privilege for me to recognize the many outstanding achievements he has provided for the United States Senate, NASA, and our great Nation. 
   During his NASA fellowship, Mr. Nunez worked on legislation affecting NASA, the aerospace industry, and veterans. He worked hard to ensure the NASA Authorization Bill and the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 2001 included legislative provisions that will lead to the next generation of reusable launch vehicles. These initiatives will reduce the cost of getting payloads into orbit by a factor of 10. These provisions also support specific programs aimed at fostering the development of a robust U.S. propulsion industry, which includes rocket engine testing at the Stennis Space Center. Specifically, he helped ensure that NASA's Space Launch Initiative was fully funded in fiscal year 2001 at $290 million. 
   Mr. Nunez also worked to ensure that legislative provisions were included in  both bills to support robust funding of the Commercial Remote Sensing Program to enable a $10 billion commercial remote sensing industry by 2010. He assisted greatly in the economic development in the State of Mississippi by bringing Aerospace companies and Mississippi Economic Development officials together. 
   Mr. Nunez worked with former Congressman G. V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery to enhance the educational benefits of the Montgomery G.I. bill through S. 1402, the ``Veterans and Dependents Millennium Education Act.'' He also worked with the Veterans Administration to open more Community Based Outpatient Clinics in Mississippi. 
   Mr. Nunez began his aerospace career as a contract engineer supporting the Space Shuttle Main Engine Test Program at NASA's Stennis Space Center shortly after graduating from Mississippi State University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering. He joined NASA as a systems engineer supporting various propulsion development programs at Stennis Space Center, including the Space Transportation Main Engine and Space Shuttle Main Engine. He then took on additional responsibilities as Chief Engineer for various component and hybrid motor development test programs, including the first ever successful tests of a turbopump-fed hybrid motor. His next challenge was project lead for test program support of Boeing's Phase I Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Low Cost Concept Validation Program. The test program support was completed under budget and ahead of schedule. This program demonstrated water recovery of a Space Shuttle Main Engine propulsion module and culminated in a successful hot fire test after the propulsion module was dropped into the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Mr. Nunez is no stranger to Washington, D.C. where he served a one year detail to the Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight at NASA Headquarters. Prior to starting his Congressional Fellowship, Mr. Nunez served as X-33 Project Manager at Stennis Space Center where he was responsible for all reusable launch vehicle initiatives there totaling $35 million. As X-33 Project Manager, he led a team of engineers and technicians in the successful test firing of the X-33 Linear Aerospike Engine, whose success has been a major highlight of the X-33 Program. 
   A native Mississippian, Mr. Nunez is married to the former Cynthia Marlene Cuevas of Leetown, Mississippi. They have one son, Stephen C. Nunez, II. Mr. Nunez is a registered Professional Engineer in Mississippi who looks forward to returning to the NASA team. I will truly miss his talents and expertise, and wish him all the very best as he helps NASA's efforts to advance human space flight in the 21st century.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a short session today for scheduling announcements and to accommodate some morning business requests. The Senate is expected to take action on the conference report to accompany the foreign operations appropriations bill as soon as it becomes available. However, votes are not expected to occur during today's session of the Senate. Votes are more likely to occur on Wednesday, and all Senators will be notified as to the exact time votes can be expected to occur. It is the leadership's intention to complete all business by the end of this week. I hope that that can be achieved, and I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Let me emphasize again, at this time, as I had indicated to Senator REID last week, we will notify the Members as to whether or not there will be votes on Tuesday or what time they will occur. As it now stands, while there will be, I believe, reports filed on Tuesday to accompany appropriations bills and perhaps even a tax bill, we do not anticipate any votes to occur on Tuesday, but we do expect perhaps even several votes to occur on Wednesday. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, let me reclaim the floor. I do have some additional business here that we can go ahead and do at this time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am happy to repeat it because I know we want to make sure all Senators have heard this. We have four appropriations bills that are in some degree of completion. I think two of them have been wrapped up and two are still being discussed between the House, the Senate, and the White House. It is possible the House will act on one of those appropriations bills on Tuesday, but it appears it wouldn't be until late in the afternoon or even early evening, so we wouldn't get it until late Tuesday or perhaps Wednesday morning. 
   We also have a discussion underway involving a tax bill which would provide for FSC and the pension and IRAs that have been approved by the Senate Finance Committee, so that could be completed and be available late tomorrow afternoon. But both of those would also probably be done on Wednesday. 
   Hopefully, with three or four votes, we would be able to complete the session for the year. That could be done Wednesday; hopefully it will be done not later than Thursday. Of course, that all is dependent upon final agreement between the two bodies and final comments we might get from the White House.

   Mr. LOTT. I don't mean for that to be all inclusive. I assume we will be clearing bills right along as we did last week and this week. We also have a number of Executive Calendar nominations that we anticipate clearing. I started the process last week to get to a vote on bankruptcy. We hope that will also come up, probably Thursday, before we go out. 
   With regard to the tax provisions, there is a bill to which they would be attached. I don't recall the number right offhand. It does relate to small businesses, small business tax relief, but I can't give an exact name.

But we have the list and we are going to be working on that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, time has been reserved for two or three other Senators. We are checking to see if they are going to make it this afternoon. 
   While we are waiting on that, I do want to put in the RECORD a report of some of the things that have happened in the Senate. 
   There are those who are complaining that the Senate has not been doing its business. In fact, I have about four pages of legislation that has been passed over the past 2 years, but I want to read the list of things that have passed since Labor Day alone. I am not going to read them all. When the assertion is made the Senate has not been doing serious work, this belies that and  makes it clear we have been doing very important and serious work. 
   For instance, we have already repealed the telephone excise tax, a tax that was put on temporarily to help pay for the Spanish-American War. That was a part of one of the bills we passed a week or so ago. That has been repealed. 
   We passed the Safe Drug Reimportation Act as part of one of the bills that passed last week. 
   We passed permanent normal trade relations with China, legislation I am sure most people would describe as important trade legislation, whether they disagreed or agreed with it. 
   We passed the H-1B visa bill which certainly has a very important effect on small businesses and high-tech industries in the United States, as well as other bills related to children's health, breast and cervical cancer prevention, rural schools and community self-determination, and Aimee's law wherein a State can require or use law enforcement funds in relation to the release of a convict who commits a crime in another State. That information can be provided to the other State. 
   The Violence Against Women Act was passed; victims of terrorism legislation; the Water Resources Development Act, including the very important Everglades provisions. We passed portions of the conservation bill called CARA, and perhaps even more of it will pass before we leave. We passed the intelligence authorization bill; the NASA authorization bill; and the Department of Defense authorization bill just last week, very important legislation for the future of our military men and women, not only in terms of their readiness and modernization of their equipment, but also a pay raise of 4.8 percent for our military men and women, and the strongest health care package for our military men and women, their families, and our retirees in the history of the country. 
   In addition, we have passed seven appropriations conference bills. There have been questions about the tax bill. I do not think there is any big secret about it. All you have to do is look at bills that have passed the House or the Senate or the Finance Committee, and you will see that there is the community renewal legislation, which has the support of the President, the Speaker of the House, and a number of Senators. There has been an expectation that it would be done in some form before we leave; the very important improvements in pensions and IRAs, as well as 401(k)s, so that a greater amount can be put into these IRAs and 401(k)s. 
   Then, since we have not been able to overcome objections from some of the Senators--I think Senator WELLSTONE, Senator KENNEDY, and maybe others--the small business tax relief package, which is attached to the minimum wage, would be something that we want to get done before we leave here. 
   Finally--certainly not least--I have tried to move, several times, the Foreign Sales Corporation legislation reported overwhelmingly by the Finance Committee--very important for our ability to do business in the trade area with Europe. We have not been able to clear it from an objection. 
   So the expectation is that several of these bills that have broad bipartisan support would be joined together and passed before we leave at the end of the session. So I want the RECORD to reflect a portion of what has been done since Labor Day--not exactly an inactive period of time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one of the more glaring disappointments of the 106th Congress has been the recent rejection by the House of Representatives of comprehensive pipeline safety legislation. This legislation, S. 2438, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, passed the Senate unanimously on September 7, 2000. It is the result of months of an extraordinary bipartisan effort by Senators JOHN MCCAIN, PATTY MURRAY, SLADE GORTON, JEFF BINGAMAN and PETE DOMENICI. Significant contributions to the legislation were also made by Senators JOHN BREAUX, FRITZ HOLLINGS, SAM BROWNBACK, RON WYDEN, JOHN KERRY, KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON and BYRON DORGAN. 
   I also feel some ownership of this effort. I serve on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which prepared the bill for the Senate's consideration, and my home state of Mississippi hosts many, many miles of pipelines. These issues are important to me. 
   Mr. President, S. 2438 is an excellent bill. It is probably the most significant rewrite of our pipeline safety laws in more than a decade. It is a tough bill. It comes on the heels of horrific accidents in Bellingham, Washington, Carlsbad, New Mexico, and in locations in Texas, that resulted in the deaths of a total of 17 people. The authors of this bill were determined to put the necessary specific requirements into the pipeline safety statutes that would prevent these kinds of accidents from happening in the future. They were successful. The bill represents a watershed change in the types of requirements on pipeline operators for inspection, pipeline facility monitoring and testing, employee training, disclosure of information, enforcement, research and development, management and accountability. It is as comprehensive, tough, and complete as to be expected of a bill that emerged from a thorough process of hearings, both here and in the field, data gathering, and working with the Administration, states and local groups. It is the kind of legislative work product to be expected from the experience, independence and determination of the Senators who worked on S. 2438. The pipeline industry had no choice but to submit to this legislation. Ultimately it received the affirmative vote of more than three-fourths of the Congress--all of the Senate and just under two-thirds of the House. It received the written praise of the Secretary of Transportation and the Vice President of the United States. 
   However, this comprehensive bill was opposed bitterly by a minority of the House, a minority who was still of sufficient number to prevent the bill's passage by the House under suspension of the rules. The Administration did not lift a finger to help pass the bill in the House. The motivation of this opposition may have been to prevent enactment of good legislation so the 106th can be called a ``do nothing'' Congress. It may have been aimed at keeping an issue unresolved so it can be exploited in the future. There may have been other motivations. Whatever the motivations were, admirable or not so admirable, the result is another form of tragedy--there will be more accidents resulting in more deaths because thus far the 106th Congress has been prevented from implementing this improvement of public safety. 
   Mr. President, there is no question that this bill would make much needed improvements in pipeline safety. The Administration and the pipeline industry could have begun work on these improvements--and could still if the bill were yet to pass in the waning days of the 106th Congress. But if, on the other hand and as is likely, this minority in the House gets its wish, and the bill does not pass, these safety improvements will not be made. They will not be made until that time in the future when we have returned to this issue and overcome this minority's opposition. 
   In the meantime there will be pipeline accidents. I would not want to be the one to have to explain to the victims of such an accident that I sacrificed the protections of this good bill so that a future Congress could enact protections too late. I say shame on those in the House and in the Administration who are letting these protections die. 
   Mr. President, the protections of S. 2438 should be put in place now. If additional protections are shown to be needed, they should be added by the next Congress. Senator MCCAIN and his coalition in the Senate have pledged to continue their good work on pipeline safety in the future. However, Congress should not adjourn empty-handed. To do so with such an excellent bill in our hands now makes no sense. 
   The most powerful source of cynicism about government is the suspicion by our citizen's that politicians put political advantage above doing the work of the public. In looking at the House minority's actions on pipeline safety, I find much justification for that cynicism. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, then, the Senate will have conducted its last vote for the day. We will adjourn shortly, although I understand there is one bill that is going to be taken up with some brief debate, and also there will be some debate on the bankruptcy issue. The Senate will not be in session on Friday, but the appropriations negotiators and others who are negotiating some policy decisions will be meeting tomorrow and throughout the weekend, if necessary. 
   The Senate will be in session on Monday, and I expect that there will be a period for morning business. Unless some procedural step is necessary regarding the bankruptcy bill, I do not expect any further announcements with regard to the schedule. 
   The Senate will next be in session after that on Tuesday. Therefore, votes could occur on Tuesday in an effort to wrap up the session of Congress. We do have four appropriations bills that need to be completed, and, one way or another, we also are looking at a tax package and, of course, bankruptcy, with a vote on cloture if necessary. 
   Later on, either tomorrow or Monday, we will notify Members jointly as to exactly when votes could be expected, but it will depend on when agreements are reached, when the conference reports are filed, and when the House acts because I think in each of these four instances the House would have to act first. We will move on the bankruptcy, depending on what is happening on these appropriations bills and the tax package.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will not be in session on Monday. On Tuesday, the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report on this Agriculture appropriations bill--very important legislation. The debate will be limited to Tuesday's session and approximately 2 hours on Wednesday morning, with the vote scheduled to occur at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday on the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   For the remainder of the week, the Senate is expected to complete all action necessary for sine die adjournment. I pause for applause. That is certainly what we should do. It is possible we can do it. We were able to get a good deal accomplished this week. It took a lot of work on both sides of the aisle. We were able to get a package of five bills done, which included, of course, the sex trafficking issue as well as Aimee's law and the Violence Against Women Act. We were able to pass four appropriations bills and complete action on the Defense authorization bill and begin debate on the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   Next week we will have to deal with the foreign operations conference report final passage in some form; the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill; the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations conference report, and there are several tax provisions that need to be considered, including the FSC issue that we have been trying to get cleared, a bill that came out of the Finance Committee to make sure the United States complies with WTO requirements. We need to get that completed as well as several other items that have broad support in the House and in the Senate and the administration. 
   So there are four categories that we will need to act on next week. I have been having conversations and meetings this morning with Members of both sides of the aisle and with the administration to try to help facilitate that. 
   I notice Senator CONRAD reacted positively to ``both sides of the aisle.'' 
   I think it is clearly possible to complete our work by next Friday. I had hoped we could do it by Saturday, the 14th, but the unfortunate death of our friend and colleague, Congressman Vento from Minnesota, occurred and, therefore, Members are in Minnesota this morning for the funeral service. Clearly, we can get our work done next week, and we certainly will try to. Senators should expect votes throughout the day Wednesday and Thursday and into Friday, if it is necessary. 
   I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question or comment.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just say, Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Senator has raised this issue. It is appropriate that we acknowledge the service of our military men and women who are serving all over the world, more often than we realize, in very dangerous situations, and that we recognize those who lost their lives--in this instance, sailors on the U.S.S. Cole. 
   I, too, have a personal feeling about this. I would like to make some comments on it myself. Before I do that, I yield to Senator DORGAN from North Dakota for his remarks.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the U.S.S. Cole was built in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS. I have been on it. I have visited with the sailors, the crew, and officers on many of these ships --destroyers, cruisers, and LHDs--that are built there. It is always a thrilling experience to see the enthusiasm of these young men and women and the caliber of the young men and women who serve our country, and also the tremendous sophistication of these ships. These ships are the most sophisticated in the history of the world, with an incredible array of radar and weapons systems. 
   These ships can fire at 120 different targets simultaneously, using missiles and Gatling guns. They are incredible vessels. They are referred to as ``aegis class" destroyers. They have a tremendous shield where they can track and identify targets or enemy activities. But we see, once again, no matter how big, how sophisticated, or how capable they are in destroying enemy ships or aircraft, they are still vulnerable to a suicide attack by two men on a small rubber vessel. 
   I think it is a very sobering thing that we are learning from this experience. You can be in a marine barracks somewhere, in a hotel, in a public building, or on a sophisticated ship, and you are still vulnerable to this kind of attack. This is clearly an unjustified, heinous, indescribable act that has taken place, and I know that our Government will act very aggressively to protect and provide aid to those who are injured and work with the families who are certainly going through a period of grieving now. It will also try to identify exactly who did this, who gave the order, and be prepared to take swift and very strong action against those who did it. 
   I have no doubt that our Government will work in unity to accomplish that. 
   In addition to that, I have a list before me which is not yet ready for release, and I would not want to do it before it has been properly released. But there are at least 7 identified as dead now and another 10, at least, missing potentially, and likely now 17 sailors on that ship who lost their lives. 
   One of those was Ens. Andrew Triplett of Macon, MS. I have before me his record of service, and I take note that this is a young man who was very forward leaning and had advanced very quickly through the ranks to reach the position of ensign. 
   To his entire family, and particularly his mother, Savanna Triplett of Shuqualak, MS, I extend my sympathy and prayers and also the grateful appreciation of our Nation. 
   I know that Americans all over the world will be touched by what we have seen happen and will be thinking of the family and praying for them in this difficult time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief. I want to commend Senator WARNER for the effort he and his staff have put into this bill. I am hoping we can wrap up the debate and get to the votes that are going to be required on the point of order and final passage before too late in the evening. 
   This has been a long time coming. It has been a laborious process. Senator WARNER stuck with it. Obviously, he had help from his colleague on the other side of the Capitol, the gentleman from South Carolina, Congressman SPENCE. He worked with Senator LEVIN, the ranking member. But this is a monumental achievement. 
   There are some people who have the idea we do not need the Defense authorization bill if we have already done the Department of Defense appropriations bill and military construction appropriations bill, but we need this bill because it authorizes important programs; it authorizes important changes in the law; it authorizes the money that we need. I want to touch on a few of those very briefly. 
   The funding level for new budget authority for the Department of Defense in this bill is $309.9 billion, which is $4.6 billion above the President's budget request. It is an increase over what was requested for procurement, for research, development, test and evaluation, and operations and maintenance. It also has a 3.7-percent pay raise for our 
   military personnel effective January 1, 2001. 
   Last year, when we had a pay raise for our military men and women, the word I got from the rank-and-file troops, and also from the Joint Chiefs, including specifically the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was that it absolutely transformed the attitude of our military men and women who were leaving and were not ``reuping,'' as the saying goes in the military, because they really wondered if we appreciated them and knew they were there. At least by improving their pay, by dealing with their retirement benefits, and now in this bill, another pay raise, and dealing with this question of health care, it is going to have a good effect on morale. Obviously, we want the morale to be good. We want quality of life in the barracks. We want the ships and tanks and everything we need. But if we do not begin with decent living arrangements for our military men and women, then all is lost. 
   This bill comes at a critical time. Just today we see what the risks are--the U.S.S. Cole, built in my hometown of Pascagoula--I believe I was there when it was commissioned--300 sailors on the ship, and now we see 3 dozen or more of them are killed or injured and others are missing. Yet this is one of the most sophisticated ships in the world. But it shows once again, if we have kamikazes who are willing to put it all on the line, to get killed, to do damage, they can do damage to our equipment and to our men and women. This is no time to nitpick this bill and turn away from it. 
   There are those who say we should not be starting these new programs or make them permanent. But for our military men and women, active duty and retirees, and for their families, we need to address this health care question. For our military people to be told, at 65, you are off, you are off this program, go there and get on Medicare or find some other arrangement, is wrong. When we talked to our military personnel and our retirees and we said: what is really the thing that you want the most in helping you deal with your health care needs, they cited the pharmaceutical problem, the need for pharmacy benefits, either mail order or, in this bill, through retail. 
   This is a major achievement. I have already had military retirees and veterans call my office literally in tears to say thanks for what we are doing here. Maybe it was not done exactly the prettiest way, or in the way it should have been done early on, but this is a major achievement. I do not want to be the one to explain to some veteran, because of a procedural issue or a point of order, that we don't address this need of our military men and women and their families and our retirees. I am not going to explain that. I am going to vote for this bill, and I am going to do it proudly. 
   Then there is another provision that objections have been raised about, and that is the Department of Energy employees who were injured due to exposure to radiation and other problems at our DOE facilities and nuclear facilities. Again, there may need to be more work on it. Maybe it should have been handled in a different way. But who wants to tell these people who have been injured by our Government operation, ``There is no program for you.'' Not me. I do not think we should walk away from this at this point. 
   This is a reasonable compromise. Both the retirement and the DOE program that was added as we went along, and expanded, while it may present certain difficulties for some of our people, in the end it is the right thing to do. Also, it is attached to a bill that we need desperately--a good bill, a bill that has been a long time coming. 
   I thank all those involved. There are so many parts of it I could refer to that are important, but I didn't want us to get to final passage without me saying we should do this bill--we should defeat the point of order, and we should pass this bill. It is the right thing for the defense of our country, for our veterans, and the right thing for people who have been injured and haven't been properly compensated. We can fine tune the program as we learn more about the extent of the damages and how much they are injured and the proper way to deal with it, but for now I urge my colleagues, vote for this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after extensive collaboration with Senator DASCHLE, we have come to this consensus which we believe is in the best interests of all concerned. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 801, H.R. 4635, the HUD-VA appropriations bill, on Thursday at 9:30 a.m., the committee substitute be agreed to, one amendment which will be offered by Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI be immediately agreed to, and the bill time be limited to the following: 
   Fifteen minutes under the control of Senator MCCAIN; 
   Five minutes under the control of Senator KYL; 
   Ten minutes equally divided between the subcommittee chairman and ranking minority member; 
   Ten minutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the full committee. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that there be one amendment in order by Senator DASCHLE, or his designee, regarding the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, and following the offering of that amendment there be 10 minutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form, and no amendments be in order to the amendment. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the vote relative to the Byrd amendment, Senator BOXER be recognized to offer up to two first-degree amendments relative to environmental dredging, drinking water regulations, and Clean Air Act area designation, and there be up to 30 minutes of debate on each amendment to be equally divided in the usual form, with no other amendments in order, and the amendments not 
   be divisible. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the amendments just described, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the votes just described occur beginning at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday and there be 2 minutes before each vote for explanation. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the vote, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, those conferees being the entire subcommittee, including Senators STEVENS and BYRD.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto message with respect to the conference report accompanying H.R. 4733 be considered as having been read, printed in the RECORD and spread in full upon the Journal, and the message then be referred to the Appropriations Committee. 
   Before the Chair grants this request, I would like to say to my colleagues that, unfortunately, the Senate does not have the votes to override this veto. I still believe strongly that the energy and water appropriations conference report should not have been vetoed and that there is a real threat of danger as a result of the provisions that are in controversy. The vote in the Senate was 57-37, which is a very strong vote. But at this point it appears there certainly would not be sufficient votes to override the President's veto. 
   I regret the veto. The Senate needs to proceed now to complete these appropriations bills, and therefore we have had to go through the process as just be outlined in these previous unanimous consent requests. Therefore, this consent addresses the immediate concern of the veto message entering the Senate Chamber.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while Senator DASCHLE is here, he may want to make comments. I thank him again for working to help get this agreement worked out, as Senator REID certainly has been helpful, and Senator BOND, chairman of the committee, and Senator MIKULSKI, ranking member of the HUD-VA appropriations subcommittee; they have done good work. 
   As a result of these agreements, we will be able to act tomorrow on the HUD-VA appropriations bill, the energy and water appropriations bill, as will be modified to put in the agreed-to language with regard to section 103, and we also will then have the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill included in this process. 
   We will continue to work after this vote at 4:30 to get an agreement with regard to the time and a vote on the Defense authorization bill. We are working through the difficulties which are probably on this side; maybe on both sides. We will try to work that out, and also a time when a vote will occur on the Agriculture appropriations conference report. 
   I will have to communicate some more. I thought it important to go ahead and get these agreements lined up. 
   I remind Members, we have two votes scheduled at 4:30.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am sure there is a good faith effort being made here. So I will revise my unanimous consent request. 
   But let me emphasize to all the Members that this is a very important bill. Some people think: We have passed the Defense appropriations bill, the military construction appropriations bill; what do we need an authorization bill for? This is the bill that makes the law that authorizes things for our military men and women, including an increase in pay, including the very important, laboriously worked out provisions with regard to health benefits for our active duty men and women and their families and our retirees. It also has the Department of Energy language in which the Presiding Officer has had so much interest. This is really a big bill and an important bill. So I hope we can get agreement. I believe we will. 
   Also, I emphasize that by spending 6 hours on this bill, you know that is time we could be spending on the Agriculture appropriations conference report or other conference reports that may be ready by tomorrow afternoon. So I hope we can get this locked up soon. 
   But, in view of the legitimate request that was made by the Senator, I modify my unanimous consent request and end it after the words ``considered as having been read'' in the first 
   paragraph.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, we will keep working to try to get agreements accepted. I do not quite understand why the Agriculture appropriations bill cannot be debated tonight, now, and voted on tomorrow. And I do not understand why we cannot get an agreement to have debate on it on Friday and Tuesday, and a vote on Wednesday. I know there are Senators who want to talk on it. That is their right in the Senate. But if we are ever going to get this process completed, we need to get the Agriculture appropriations conference report done. 
   I am still holding out some hope that maybe the Commerce-State-Justice conference report and even the Labor-HHS conference report could be agreed to and could be dealt with tomorrow in such a way we could have a vote on them on Thursday or Friday. But we do not have that yet. 
   Is there objection?

   Mr. LOTT. I think the Senator knows there is a great difference between moving to proceed and asking unanimous consent. For now, obviously, we cannot get the unanimous consent agreement, so we will not be able to proceed. 
   In light of the discussions we have just had, and since we cannot get an agreement on taking up Agriculture now, the next votes will occur at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow regarding HUD-VA and related issues, and additional votes will occur late tomorrow afternoon regarding the DOD authorization conference report if we can get this time agreement worked out, and I assume we will be able to. With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have been involved in other meetings this morning, and I have not heard the discussion. I have not had an opportunity to see the level of disagreement on this. Let me just say to Senator MCCAIN --and we just talked about it--I don't have a personal problem with this. But give me a little time to make sure that all of our people know to what we are about to agree. Hopefully, within the next few minutes he can offer that again. I will object at this point, but if he will withhold, because I understand there may be more objections, I will check that out.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the upcoming retirement of Mr. Charles A. Gillis, who will retire on October 20, 2000, as Branch Manager of the Gulfport Branch Office, United States Small Business Administration (SBA). I know that I am joined by the entire business community of South Mississippi, Charlie's colleagues at the SBA, and all those who have had the privilege of interacting with him over the years. 
   I especially want to thank Charlie for a long career of completely devoted service to his community, the State of Mississippi, and this Nation. I have known Charlie for many years and have seen firsthand the substantial impact his extensive knowledge and business expertise have had on countless small businesses and the local economy of Southern Mississippi. 
   Charles Gillis' ties to the Gulf Coast run deep, as does his record of service and achievement. He is a life-long resident of Harrison County and a graduate of Gulfport High School. Charlie served in the First Cavalry Division in Korea in 1951. He received his Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration from the University of Southern Mississippi (USM), and later completed additional graduate studies in business at the USM-Gulf Park Campus. 
   Prior to serving with the SBA, Charlie was a small business entrepreneur in his own right, as owner and operator of Gillis Furniture in Gulfport. Moreover, Charlie served as a furniture manufacturers representative with regular travel assignments covering five states. Throughout his private sector career, Charlie honed the business skills that later made him such an invaluable public sector resource to other small business owners and operators. 
   Charlie began his tenure of service with the SBA in July 1982, and has faithfully served the agency ever since. His service in the SBA's Gulfport Branch Office is especially important to me since the branch office was created after Hurricane Camille devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast and its economy in 1969, and during my service as Administrative Assistant to then Congressman William Colmer. 
   Charlie has been recognized for his continuous dedication to duty and his tireless community spirit. Over the years, he has been chosen as one of the ``Outstanding Men in America,'' recognized as among the ``Personalities of the South,'' and selected as ``SBA District Employee of the Year.'' 
   In addition to personal accolades and longstanding official service, Charlie generously has given of his time in many ways to improve his community. He served as President of the University of Southern Mississippi's Alumni Association, as Chairman of the Harrison County Election Commission, and as Vice President of Governmental Affairs for the Gulfport Area Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, Charlie is an associate member of Delta Sigma Pi Fraternity, and serves as a Mason, a Shriner, Rotarian, and a charter member of Trinity United Methodist Church in Gulfport. 
   Charlie's constant professionalism and vast knowledge will be greatly missed by the Small Business Administration, the South Mississippi business community and officials at every level of government, who have had the distinct pleasure and benefit of his insight. Whenever called, Charlie always responds in a timely and effective manner with eagerness, efficiency and courtesy. Although I know he will miss daily interactions with his co-workers and colleagues, I also know that Charlie, his wife Rose, and their family, will have many opportunities to focus their abundance of energy and exemplary community spirit.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Interior appropriations conference report obviously is a very important bill. There has been an awful lot of work that has gone into it. It does have bipartisan support. As I understand it, it is positioned to be signed into law. It passed the House 349-69, something of that nature. 
   The Senator from Illinois has some difficulties with a provision in this legislation. Certainly, as any Senator, he is entitled to make his point, and to make his point at length within the provisions of our rules. It is important we move forward now. We are prepared to move forward on this legislation.

The problem now is, as I stated, that Senator FITZGERALD has a problem. The Senator from Nevada has worked on his part of the problem on which, by the way, I agreed with him. I believe we have gotten the language we need, so it is not necessary for that objection to be filed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may comment, as Senator REID mentioned, we hope to move to the Transportation and Agriculture appropriations conference reports. I had hoped one or both of those would be ready today. I believe they are both close to completion. In fact, I am sure the Transportation appropriations conference report is completed, and we should have it, hopefully, early in the morning. Agriculture has been more difficult for obvious reasons: Getting an exact reliable number on what is needed for disasters, but also dealing with issues such as the drug reimportation question and the sanctions issue. They are going to attempt to close that conference this afternoon. We hope to have a vote and be ready for action on tomorrow. 
   With regard to this particular bill, the foreign sales corporation, I understand there are some reservations, but hopefully we can find a way to consider it.

   Mr. LOTT. I would like to make clear, if there is a technical amendment, or if there is a germane amendment, we could certainly get an agreement to make that in order. 
   What bothers me is that earlier on there had been indications that there were unrelated amendments that would ball the Senate up and this bill into protracted debate. What bothers me even more is, as we get closer, hopefully, to the end of the session, the thinking, I guess, would be, well, we will just drop this into something. The opportunity for mischief at that point is endless because if one Senator shows up and objects, we could lose it. 
   So I know Senator REID will be working on this. But this is something that is important to our country. I assume that the White House also would like to get this done. We need to continue to focus very closely on this piece of legislation.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the efforts of everyone who worked to pass S. 1198, the Truth in Regulating Act. Last evening, the House passed this important legislation, following the Senate's passage of the bill on May 9th of this year. I was pleased to learn of the final passage of this bill in the House, as this event marks the culmination of the hard work of many Senators, Representatives, and members of their staffs in achieving another milestone in our journey towards comprehensive regulatory reform. 
   This legislation establishes a process for Congress to obtain reviews of economically significant rules. These reviews, to be performed by the General Accounting Office, will help Congress to better assess the impact of federal agency regulations. I am confident that the information which will be provided in these reports will enable Congress and the public to have a better understanding of the potential costs and benefits of these regulations, and I believe that these independent analyses will help federal agencies to develop the most efficient and beneficial regulations for all concerned. 
   Mr. President, passage of this legislation would not have been possible without the hard work of several Senators on both sides of the aisle. Both Senator SHELBY and Senator THOMPSON have been active in addressing this issue for quite some time, and the efforts of Senator BOND and the input of Senator LEVIN were also helpful to the process. Similarly, I know that Representatives KELLY and MCINTOSH worked hard on the House side to get the Truth in Regulating Act passed. The details of this legislation were worked out by countless hours of work by a number of staff members, both former and current, for these Senate and House members. In addition to members of my staff, these staff members include Paul Noe, Mark Oesterle, Suey Howe, Linda Gustitus, Meredith Matty, Barry Pineles, Larry McCredy, Barbara Kahlow, and Marlo Lewis. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the President signing this legislation.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote relative to the H-1B bill and the visa waiver bill on Tuesday, the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar, en bloc: No. 652, Michael Reagan; No. 654, Susan Bolton; and No. 655, Mary Murguia. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the en bloc consideration, the following Senators be recognized to speak for the allotted timeframes. They are: Senator HATCH for 20 minutes; Senator KYL for 20 minutes; Senator LOTT or designee for 20 minutes; Senator LEVIN for 20 minutes; Senator ROBB for 10 minutes; Senator HARKIN for 30 minutes; Senator LEAHY for 20 minutes; and Senator DURBIN for 10 minutes. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding back of time, the nominations be temporarily set aside. 
   I also ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the Senate then proceed to the nomination of Calendar No. 656, James Teilborg, and there be up to 1 hour each for Senators HATCH, KYL, and LEAHY, and up to 3 hours for Senator HARKIN or his designee, and following the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to that nominee, without any intervening action or debate, to be followed immediately by a vote en bloc in relation to the three previously debated nominations. I further ask consent that the vote count as three separate votes on each of the nominations. 
   Finally, I ask consent that following the confirmation votes, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then return to legislative session.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's interest in that additional nomination. I do not think I have ever moved to discharge the Judiciary Committee on a single nomination or a judge. There are other judges presumably that will also need to be considered. I do appreciate the agreement that has been reached here. I know that it has been difficult for the Senator from Iowa to even agree to this. But in view of the fact that the committee has not acted, I could not agree to that at this time, so I would have to object.

   Mr. LOTT. I respond, Mr. President, that I do not get into the background of all the nominees when they are before the committee. I do not know all of the background on these nominees. 
   As majority leader, when nominations reach the calendar, I try to get them cleared. I do think the fact that we had not been able to clear these four, even though they were already on the calendar, has maybe had a negative impact on other nominations being reported on the assumption that, well, if we could not move these, which were, I think, unanimously cleared quickly without any reservations, that that had become an impediment. I do not know that this will remove that impediment, but it looks to me as if it is a positive step.

So he has made it clear he does support her. I do not know all of the problems or if there are any. But perhaps further consideration could occur. I am sure you won't relent.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to take this opportunity to recognize the exemplary service and career of an outstanding naval officer, Rear Admiral Louis M. Smith, upon his retirement from the Navy at the conclusion of more than 33 years of honorable and distinguished service. Throughout his exemplary career, he has truly epitomized the Navy core values of honor, courage, and commitment and demonstrated an exceptional ability to advance the Navy's facilities requirements within the Department of Defense and the Congress. It is my privilege to commend him for a superb career of service to the Navy, our great Nation, and my home State of Mississippi. 
   Since September 1998, Rear Admiral Smith has served as the Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and Chief of Civil Engineers. As the senior civil engineer in the Navy, he is responsible for the planning, design, construction and maintenance of naval facilities around the globe. On Capital Hill, he is best known for his quick wit, entertaining and informative testimony, and ability to communicate the Navy's facilities requirements in addition to his role in developing and executing the Navy's Military Construction, Base Realignment and Closure and Environmental programs. He often testified before congressional committees and ensured  that Members of Congress and their staffs fully understood the Navy's shore infrastructure requirements. In this capacity, Rear Admiral Smith was second to none. 
   Previously, he served as the Director, Facilities and Engineering Division for the Chief of Naval Operations where he had a hand in shaping the Navy's readiness ashore, as well as numerous quality-of-life initiatives to improve the lives of Sailors and Marines. A true shore facilities expert, his previous public works assignments included Assistant Public Works Officer, Naval Air Station, Brunswick, Maine; Public Works Officer, Naval Air Station, Keflavik, Iceland; and Commanding Officer, Public Works Center, San Diego, California. 
   As an acquisition professional, he has had numerous contracting assignments, including Officer-in-Charge of Construction, Mid Pacific, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and Head of Acquisition and Vice Commander of Western Division, San Bruno, California. He embarked on his brilliant naval career as the Officer in Charge of Seabee Team 5301, making three deployments to Vietnam and earning the Bronze Star and Combat Action Ribbon. 
   The Navy will best remember Rear Admiral Smith for his mastery of the Navy's financial system and his prowess in effectively navigating the political waters within the Beltway. His eight tours in the Nation's Capital began with duty in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations as Facilities Engineer, Security Assistance Division (OP-63). After an exchange tour on the Strategic Air Command staff, he then served as the Director of the Chief of Naval Operations' Shore Activities Planning and Programming Division (OP-44), followed by a tour in the Office of the Comptroller of the Navy. Later, he served in the offices of the NAVFAC Comptroller and the Director of Programs and Comptroller, NAVFAC. After his Command tour in San Diego, he returned to NAVFAC Headquarters as Vice Commander and Deputy Chief of Civil Engineers. Rear Admiral Smith's knowledge of the Fleet, coupled with his unparalleled planning and financial acumen, was absolutely vital to successfully charting the Navy's course through both the 1980s build-up and the post-Cold War draw-down. 
   Rear Admiral Smith is a native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and a graduate of Marquette University where he received his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. He later attended Purdue University where he earned his Master of Science in Civil Engineering. Married to the former Susan Clare Kaufmann of Milwaukee, he and Susan have two sons, Brian and Michael. 
   My home State of Mississippi has benefitted greatly from the contributions of Rear Admiral Smith's visionary leadership, consummate professionalism, uncommon dedication, and enduring personality. For the State of Mississippi, he was there to assist in the disaster recovery from Hurricane George; he was there to provide outstanding facilities support for U.S. Navy bases in Mississippi; and he was there to assist my staff in providing the highest levels of facilities support for our Navy. On January 1, 2001, he will enter retirement and the Navy will wish him fair winds and following seas. On behalf of the Congress, I congratulate Rear Admiral Louis Martin Smith on the completion of an outstanding and successful career with very best wishes for even greater successes in the future.

   We did clear it on this side. I understand there are some Senators on the Democratic side who wish to offer amendments. A lot of the amendments on the list I saw were the usual suspects that have now been offered that do not relate to the bill. I understand that has to be worked out. Senator REID and others will be trying to clear up those objections based on those amendments. 
   But I do want to say, if there is any germane or relevant amendment to this bill, certainly we will work to make sure that will be included in the agreement. 
   Failing that, this is something we need to do, and I hope we can get it cleared up in the next few days.

   I further ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or use of the debate time and the disposition of the above-described amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and a vote occur on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, all without any intervening action or debate.

I know there are objections to it on both sides, and there is no question that there is objection on this side. I felt constrained to make this effort. It is a serious effort.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania will yield, let me acknowledge the fact that the Senator from Pennsylvania did agree at a critical moment last year to remove this issue from the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill so we could complete it. It was clearly one of the difficulties we were having in wrapping up the session. 
   I committed at that time that we would make an effort to get it up this year and that I would do that. We probably should have made this effort earlier. I owe him an apology for not doing that. Let me say, in recent days we have tried to clear it. There is objection to it. I believed it was important that I go ahead and make that request publicly because we made that commitment to the Senator. 
   I know how strongly the Senator from Pennsylvania feels about this issue, and a lot of other people feel very strongly about it. I know we had some testimony on it within the last couple of weeks in the Senate. There are strong and passionate feelings about it on both sides in terms of what it can do for some health problems, and there are others who obviously think this is an improper use. I am sure it will be a good debate whenever it is debated and wherever it is debated. I will work with the Senator next year to try to get it up earlier in the session. Before I make a commitment at this time that I will file cloture, I have to make sure it will not fall through and I can keep that commitment. 
   But I will work with him to see that he gets a shot at it. He always has the opportunity to offer amendments on bills that come along. There is not just one way to get it done. I do believe I owe him a commitment to keep working with him. Even though I don't necessarily agree with him on the substance, I think on the procedure I have an obligation to keep a commitment to help him.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in response, I believe the Senate has voted one or more times on all of the issues that Senator REID mentioned. It is my full expectation that before this session is over a minimum wage bill, coupled with a small business tax relief package that we will have to work through the final details on, will be incorporated in some other bill or moved in one way or another and sent to the President. I fully expect that it will be accomplished. 
   I think maybe the Senator knows there is a Patients' Bill of Rights conference that is still meeting. I think there are 
   meetings, even today, to see if we can come to an agreement to get a bill that truly protects patients, but not just become a bill that provides more opportunities for my brother-in-law to sue people. So I am hopeful on a combination there. In fact, I discussed that with the President directly and said we would still like to see if we couldn't have some sort of a sit-down meeting and a broad, bipartisan, bicameral, ``bi-branch'' of the Government discussion and get an end result. I am still hopeful that can occur. 
   On education, obviously, when we get to the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations conference report, it is going to have funds for education in it--more funds than was requested by the administration or was in our budget resolution. We will have to come to some agreement about how we help local school districts in terms of flexibility, accountability, school construction, and if the best way to be helpful is a bond or some other program. All of that is under discussion now, and it is occurring between the House and Senate and the administration. 
   So certainly I understand that there is a desire to perhaps offer other amendments. I am sure the Senator can understand my feeling that we have already voted on all of those issues, and repeated votes don't necessarily render a result. I think what we need to do in this final period of the session is get agreements and work together. 
   I had a meeting with Senator DASCHLE. We talked about a bill that has broad bipartisan support--actually, a couple of bills. We looked at whether we can consider them on the floor, or if there is another way we can get a result that would be satisfactory to the largest number of Senators without having an extended cloture process, such as we had on H-1B. 
   I have indicated I would like for us to see if we can find a way to do the railroad retirement bill. But if I bring that up, it probably would have to go through a lot of hurdles, and there is opposition to some aspects of it. Instead of trying to find a way to have a fight, I am trying to find a way to get an agreement and get it done. 
   I certainly understand Senator REID's position. He has been persistent in that effort, and he has done it without rancor. I appreciate that. As we go into these final few days of the session, hopefully we can keep the channels of communication open and see what we can do to facilitate a conclusion with which most Senators can be satisfied.

   Mr. LOTT. That is what I was going to inquire about. I believe we are scheduled to take a break in 5 minutes, at 12:30, for the respective party policy luncheons. I had hoped to be 
   able to make some comments and respond to some of the things that were said. I know that Senator HATCH hoped to do that, too. In order to do that, if he is not going to have time yielded, I guess the only alternative would be for me to yield leader time and ask unanimous consent that we extend the time for 5 minutes beyond 12:30. Is that correct, Mr. President?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself a minute of leader time and allot the remainder of the time to Senator HATCH to comment on where we are and some of the things that have been said. 
   I know there is a lot of clarification and correcting that the RECORD needs. 
   With regard particularly to workers in shipbuilding, I believe we have plenty of people in my State of Mississippi who would be perfectly happy to fill any job that might be available in the shipyards in my State. 
   It is very clear what has happened. For weeks, for months, this bill has been delayed, stalled, by all kinds of demands for unrelated amendments, amendments of all kinds. That resistance still continues. 
   The high-tech industry indicates this is vital to them--big and small--this has to be done, and there is bipartisan support. 
   The time is here. We are going to see very clearly whether we want to extend these immigrants visas or not. All the delays to change the subject, deflect it, to demand votes on other things which could tangle up and cause problems for this bill will not work. We will file cloture. We are going to have successful cloture and we will either get this bill done or not. 
   Everybody needs to understand here and outside this Chamber that it is time we get to the issue at hand, that we have a vote, get this work done, and move on. 
   The Senators are entitled to make their case for other amendments. I thought we recognized last Friday in our exchange that there are other bills, there will be other venues where these amendments could possibly be considered, if that is the will of the House and the Senate and the Congress. 
   The point is, do we want to pass it or not? Time is running out. It is time to make that decision. We will have a clear vote on it before this week is out.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has voted 94-3 to invoke cloture with respect to H-1B legislation. 
   As Members know, cloture limits debate and restrains amendments to germane amendments only.  
   With that in mind, I want all Senators to know that the Senate is going to conduct a final vote on this legislation. We are committed to that, and we will get to that point even if it takes some more time. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will allow this bill to be voted on in the Senate. We have worked on it for months trying to get agreements to find a way to get conclusion. But it is time that we get to the conclusion and have a vote. I predict that the final vote on this bill will be somewhat like the vote we had on the FAA reauthorization bill some 4 years ago. There was a lot of resistance. It took a week to get to a final conclusion. The final vote was something like 97-3. I suspect that when we get to a final vote here it will be 90-10, if we can ever get a vote on the substance.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be happy to vitiate the cloture votes on this bill if the Democrats would agree to that. I think we could get a time agreement and have germane amendments that could be offered, and we could complete it in a reasonable period of time. Perhaps we should have gone through a procedural effort different from what we wound up with, but I really thought that once we had the cloture vote this morning, we would be able to get some sort of reasonable time agreement--6 hours or more if necessary--and get to a conclusion so that we could move on to other issues. I am still open to that. I know Senator REID has put a lot of time on it and had some remarks today. I certainly understand that. 
   The issue or issues that have been raised, I think, could be or would be considered on other bills and other venues. I hope we can work together to find a way to complete this important legislation. 
   Failing that, I had no alternative but to go this route.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to Senator REID, I think he knows an effort was made a few days ago to see if we couldn't clear a limited number of amendments--and either without identifying what those amendments would be or identifying them--and we are not able to clear it. We couldn't clear it on this side. 
   We had Senators on this side that wanted to offer other issues, too, including the H-2A issue, involving how we deal with visas for agricultural workers. There are some Members who think we ought to do that. There are others who didn't think we ought to do it on this bill. While I understand what the Senator is saying, I have not been able to clear that, and therefore I had to move forward to try to get the bill to conclusion. 
   I always enjoy working with the Senator from Nevada. He has been unfailingly fair and has worked with us to move a lot of issues. I appreciate that. I regret we couldn't get this cleared. I did try to, but I couldn't get it done. So now we need to get to a conclusion on the underlying.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say we are going to try to clear that bill so we can get it into conference with the House. 
   If we run into problems, whatever they may be, it is my intent that legislation will be on a bill that is signed into law before the end of this session. It is our intent to get it done. We will try a variety of ways to achieve that. We will want to put it on a bill that we hope will be signed into law. We are not going to try to put it on something that might not be. We will also be taking cognizance of what the House has done.

   We are trying to get appropriations bills considered by the Senate. We are trying to get an agreement to take up the District of Columbia, and we ran into a problem. I think maybe we are fixing that problem, but I am saying to the Senator at this point it is hard to get clearances. We did get one worked on regarding the water resources development bill, and we are doing other issues. 
   This is a bill we will find a way to get done before this session is over. We will see what happens when we get it together and try to work through it.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, I know there is a lot of interest in this amendment, and there are a number of Senators who have interest in other amendments on both sides of the aisle--additional immigration amendments. 
   There is a lot of interest on this side--and probably on both sides of the aisle--with regard to a H-2A provisions, which has to do with additional, I guess, temporary visas in the agriculture area. I understand the interest and support in both of these areas. But Senator DASCHLE and I tried to get clearance. We worked on it over a period of days. We both were very serious in trying to get it agreed to. We have not been able to get it cleared. Even though I think Senator DASCHLE got an agreement cleared on his side, there was objection on our side. 
   We have tried over a period of months to get an agreement on how to take up this H-1B immigrant visa issue. It is important to industry in America. We have over 2,000 jobs that are going unfilled now. We need these high-tech workers. It is not something that is critical in my own State, but it is critical to the economy and the high-tech industry in our Nation. 
   We are down to the last few days. We need to get this done. Therefore, I have to object. I object, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to try to respond to some of the questions and comments. 
   First of all, I certainly understand the Senator's interest in this very important funding bill for agriculture in America. There is a lot of funding here. I don't know the total amount of this bill, but it is multibillion dollars, and it is important for our farm economy, for food for our people in this country, and also for exports in many ways. 
   My State also is heavily involved in agriculture and has to deal with a number of problems, all the way from droughts to floods--everything but locusts. 
   Then, of course, we have the timber industry, which is an important part of our agricultural economy. Now that is in very difficult straits, caused to a large degree because of subsidized timber products and lumber from other countries--Canada, Russia, and every place else. It is just killing our domestic timber industry. When you add to that the administration's very bad national forest policy and timber policies, they are having a hard time. So I agree, it is important, and I share the Senator's interest in it. 
   Maybe he is asking the wrong Mississippian about this bill. I certainly have an interest, and as majority leader I continue to try to urge the various Senate committees of appropriations and conferees to get together and complete their work. But the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN, is the chairman of the Senate agriculture appropriations subcommittee. He is directly and intimately involved. 
   I think there are two or three reasons that conference has not yet met. First of all, the main reason is the House hasn't appointed conferees. They have to appoint conferees. One of the reasons they haven't done that, as the Senator from North Dakota knows, as a former House Member knows, and I do, after they do that, they are then subject to motions in the House that could be a further complicating factor in getting the work done. I think they are waiting to appoint conferees when they are ready to complete action in conference. That is one thing. 
   The second thing is there still has been, up until yesterday, I think, some question about exactly how much money was going to be needed in the disaster area because, as the Senator knows, there continue to be problems that are related to the fires, and they are still trying to get an estimate of exactly what that amount of money would be. 
   Then there are some issues that are not going to be easy to resolve, but they are going to have to be resolved--reimportation of drugs, as the Senator mentioned. The Senate acted on that. We had the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment as amended by Senator COCHRAN, then the House language by Congressman COBURN, I believe. 
   You have to find some way to get a result. I am satisfied that there is  going to be some language in that bill in this area. I don't know what it is going to be. There are a lot of people with a lot more expertise in how that will work, and the safety aspects of it, and what individuals will be able to do. All of that is going to have to be resolved. 
   You have the sanctions question. There is no easy solution there. You have kind of the Senate position, the House position, a third position, and other options. I wish the Senator the very best in working all of that out. I am not a member of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee, and I hope not to be there when the final decision is made. 
   Last but not least, I assume within the next week or so the conferees will meet. 
   There are areas sometimes when communication between the bodies of the Congress or between the parties is not as good as it could be, I guess. But usually in agriculture you have pretty good input all around because it is so important to individual Senators. 
   But I am assuming conferees will be appointed at some point before too long and that there will be a vote and action taken. I quite often wish for magic, but I rarely see it in dealing with these appropriations issues.

   Mr. LOTT. Has the Senator ever tried giving Senate or House appropriations members orders or directions? What I am saying to the Senator is, it won't do any good; they are going to do what they are going to do in due time. 
   All I ask from the appropriators on Agriculture, Energy and Water, and Interior is to give me a bill. Whatever you agree on is fine with me. All I want is to be able to schedule the conference report. I have tried saying, Do this; do that. How about that? What about this time? What about another time? They will act when they get ready, I guess. 
   They will have a conference meeting and do their work or they won't. It beats the heck out of me. It is mystifying. 
   They have a job to do. All I am saying is I have confidence in THAD COCHRAN. I will support whatever he wants to do. I believe the farmers of North Dakota and Mississippi are going to be better for whatever he does. That is all I can do. 
   I am ready to go the minute they get a conference report. We will bring it to the floor like white lightning. Hopefully, that is next week. I would love to do it next week. The last time I checked, that is the end of the fiscal year. If they have it ready Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, the happier I will be.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support today and bid farewell to a dear colleague and a member of our Senate family. That person is Patricia ``Pat'' Wade, who has worked on Capitol Hill with distinction and loyalty for over 28 years. 
   Pat came to Washington from Memphis, TN. I have known her throughout these 28 years. I have been in Congress all those years and remember when she first came. She came in 1970 and actually began working for Congressman Dan Kuykendall from Tennessee--the Tennessee talking horse, we affectionately called him, a great guy and a good friend. 
   During her tenure on the House side, she also worked for then-Congressman THAD COCHRAN and his successor in the House, Jon Henson, both from the great State of Mississippi. 
   After a stint in the House, she moved over to the Senate side to work for Vice President George Bush in his Capitol office. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's office was her next stop. Then I brought her on board when I took the position in the Senate majority leader's office. 
   She now works with Elizabeth Letchworth, and she is administrative  assistant to the secretary for the majority's office. She is invariably friendly and effective. When I call looking for this very important floor staff director, Pat can find her no matter where she is. She always has a smile on her face. She has a fun-loving attitude and is just a very nice person. I will miss her dearly. Pat will certainly do well as she goes back to her home State and spends more time with her beloved mother. We will miss her, but we wish her luck in all future endeavors and thank her for her contributions to this body over these many years.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will convene on Monday at 12 noon and will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Senator DURBIN will be in control of the first hour and Senator THOMAS in control of the second hour. Following morning business, the Senate will resume debate on the motion to proceed to S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act. This is all on Monday. 
   As a reminder, cloture was filed on the pending amendment to the H-1B visa bill, and that vote will occur on Tuesday, 1 hour after the Senate convenes. 
   At 3:50 p.m. on Monday, the Senate will begin closing remarks on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, with a vote scheduled to occur at 4:50 p.m. 
   Let me say, the chairman of the committee, Senator BOB SMITH of New Hampshire, has done an excellent job on this piece of legislation. He worked through a number of concerns that Senators had, but he would not have been able to get that agreement without the support and cooperation of Senator DASCHLE and Senator REID. This is important legislation. Water resources are important for our country. I am glad we are going to be able to complete this bill in the way it is being done and we will have it completed by 5 o'clock next Tuesday.

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of Morning Business until 11:30 a.m. Following Morning Business, the Senate will resume the final debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 4516, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill. A vote on final passage of the Conference Report is expected to occur at approximately 3:30 p.m. After the vote, it is hoped that the Senate can begin consideration of the Water Resources Development Act under a time agreement. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout this afternoon's session. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. LOTT. First, Mr. President, this is the last day of a very critical and helpful staff member working here with the Senate in the Finance Committee. That person is Debbie Lamb on Senator MOYNIHAN's staff. She has been his chief trade counsel and has been very helpful, obviously, to Senator MOYNIHAN and, before that, to Senator Bentsen. 
   I remember specifically one night we were negotiating the final contours of a bill between the House and the Senate. I wound up relying on her counsel as we made the final decisions. People may find it somewhat a surprise that the majority leader, a Republican, would be relying on the counsel on the other side of the aisle, but it does work that way and it attests to her credibility and expertise. She has done a wonderful job. We wish her the very best. 
   In that connection, too, I want to recognize the outstanding work that has been done by Senator MOYNIHAN and by Chairman ROTH. Here he is, sitting right behind me. They have been patient; they have been willing to spend hours here in the Senate. They waited weeks to get their opportunity to have it considered in the Senate. There was no effort made to cut off a full debate. I think every Senator believes he or she had the opportunity they needed to make their case, state their positions, and raise their concerns or why they supported it. 
   Also, we had numerous amendments, and all of them failed. Some of them were very attractive. In fact, I felt very strongly about a couple of them, obviously. But they waded through all of this and we are going to have a final vote in a moment. I think it is going to be an overwhelming vote. I think it is the right thing to do and I commend Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN for their leadership. 
   When history is written about this session, one of the things I believe it will say is that this is a session of Congress that did spend time and wound up passing some important trade bills with relation to not only China but the Caribbean and also Africa. A lot of credit goes to the leaders of this committee. 
   Regardless of one's views on the merits, there is no question about the significance of the measure we consider today. Normalizing trade relations with China will not only have profound effects upon our economic well-being, but it will undoubtedly have significant implications for our relations with China and our national security. 
   China accounts for a quarter of the world's population. It has one of the largest economies in the world--an economy that has been growing at a remarkable rate of nearly 10 percent per year. China unquestionably is and will be a major factor in the world, especially economically. 
   There is also no question that China's entry into the World Trade Organization holds great opportunities for the United States. Chief among them are the economic benefits that would flow from the dismantling of Chinese trade barriers--barriers that deny benefits to our workers and businesses. 
   But many people in this country have legitimate questions. They question whether China will live up to its commitments, whether it will trade fairly in our market, and whether we are ignoring China's human rights abuses and its destabilizing behavior in the world. 
   These are not questions to be taken lightly. And that is why I have insisted that the Senate not rush to action on this bill, and that those on both sides have a full opportunity to air their views and their amendments. 
   The Senate has had ample time to consider the agreements reached with China, has held numerous hearings on its potential accession to the WTO, and has engaged in a full and vigorous debate on this issue. That is certainly fitting on an issue of this magnitude. 
   I know that many of my colleagues, like myself, have struggled with this issue in light of our larger concerns about China and its behavior in the world. We all know that China is a one-party State that denies the most basic rights to its people. We must acknowledge that it deprives its people of religious freedom, that it has flagrantly engaged in weapons proliferation, and that it has repeatedly used unfair trade practices in our market. 
   Whle some may argue that we should, I do not believe that we can totally separate these broader issues from the question of our trade relationship with China. But I also believe that we cannot allow our desire for reform in China to blind us not only to the benefits we receive from trade with China, but from the positive effects trade may have within that country. 
   On balance, I am convinced that expanding our trading relation with China is not only in our economic self interest, but in our broader national interest as well. 
   There are many misconceptions about the action Congress is taking with this legislation. Chief among them is the view that we are voting on whether to allow China into the World Trade Organization. The fact is that China will almost certainly enter the WTO, regardless of whether the United States approves this legislation. 
   What this legislation will decide is whether the commitments of WTO membership are applied bilaterally between the United States and China. 
   Applying WTO commitments to trade between the United States and China is in our economic interest--and for a simple reason. We already grant China the favorable access to our market required by the WTO. China, however, does not grant similar access to our products. As such, this agreement will expand our access to China's market; it will not expand China's access to ours. 
   Many of my colleagues have gone through in detail the market-opening concessions China will be forced to make upon entry into the WTO. Let me just highlight some of the major terms that will have a direct impact on our workers and companies: 
   China will be required to cut tariffs from a current average of almost 25 percent to an average of around 9 percent by 2005--with particularly sharp reductions for farm products and information technology products; 
   China will be required to provide our companies with full trading and distribution rights--eliminating the need to go through trading companies blessed by the Chinese government; 
   China will be required to greatly expand access to its market for agricultural goods, ranging from cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice and farm products across the spectrum. 
   China will for the first time be required to provide real access to financial services providers--allowing U.S. banks, insurers and other providers significant new access. 
   Why would we walk away from these new and dramatic benefits--particularly when our market is already open to Chinese imports? 
   Both the farming and manufacturing community in my home state--as in states across the country--have voiced strong support for increased trade with China. 
   They know that we cannot afford to neglect economic ties with a nation of more than 1 billion people, and a market that already is the sixth largest for U.S. agricultural exports. They know that with expanded trade China is projected to account for more than one third of the growth in U.S. agricultural exports. Whether it is cotton farmers in the delta or poultry producers in central Mississippi, our farmers need China's market. 
   We also stand to make huge gains in the high tech sector, where the U.S. leads, and where my state is growing in leaps and bounds. Only 2.5 percent of China's population has a computer and only 1 percent has access to the Internet--but these numbers are growing rapidly. 
   If we do not trade with China, you can bet that our competitors in Japan and Europe will. And it will be their workers and industries--not ours--that reap the benefits of increased access to China's market. 
   If the economic benefits are clear, what is it that we give up by approving permanent trade relations with China? Most concretely, we end the automatic annual review of China's trade status under the Jackson-Vanik amendment. I do not take this lightly. We must acknowledge that gaining permanent trading status in our market has been a major objective of China's. And we should not dismiss out of hand the salutary effects that have resulted from a yearly review of China's actions and status. 
   But we must also question how much leverage this review continues to provide--particularly given that China's most favored nation status has never been withdrawn in the 20 years since relations with the PRC were normalized in 1979. And we must consider as well what benefits and favorable effects are likely to accompany a closer trading relation between our countries. 
   Trade will not solve all of our problems with China, and it will not change China's behavior overnight. But economic forces are powerful--often beyond anything we can imagine. China's commitments under the WTO agreements will require it to loosen its grip--perhaps not dramatically at first, but in real and observable ways--over the economic life of its people. 
   As wealth grows among China's middle class, as they see the benefits of open markets and freedom, as they share in the unbelievable exchange of ideas that the new economy and the Internet bring, change will come to China. And we must be there, to engage, to influence, and to foster ideas that will hopefully lead to a new flowering of democracy and freedom--and over the long run to a more peaceful and stable world. 
   I want to stress one thing. The passage of this bill must not--and I can tell you that as long as I have anything to say about it, it will not--mark a lessening of our commitment to scrutinize China's behavior, to combat proliferation, and to advance the cause of human and religious rights. 
   Our friends and allies around the world should not misinterpret what happened with our vote on the Thompson amendment--a vote that was caught up in the back and forth of how best to consider the measure. This country is united in its determination to combat weapons proliferation in China and around the world. Our commitment has not wavered, and we have not seen the last of this issue on the Senate floor. 
   We must recognize the legitimate fears and concerns of many citizens regarding trade with China. They know China has abused our market in the past and has failed to live up to its end of the bargain in recent trade agreements. 
   Ensuring Chinese compliance with its commitments will not be easy. But it is essential that we are unwavering in our vigilance to see that our workers and our companies get the benefits they are promised. This agreement maintains our ability to use our trade laws fully to combat Chinese unfair trade practices, and to take trade measures necessary to protect our national security. We must respond swiftly and forcefully where the need arises. 
   This will be one of the most closely scrutinized trade agreements in history, as it should be. The American people know that we can compete and win with fair and open markets, but they will not long tolerate the systematic flouting of our agreements and the abuse of our market. This will be a test--not only of our own resolve to make trade agreements work for our citizens, but of the ability of the WTO and the international system to deliver on the promises it has made. 
   This has been a remarkable year for trade legislation. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN once again for their extraordinary efforts to get our trade agenda back on track--passing this year both the Africa-CBI trade enhancement act and now this critical piece of legislation. It is a record of accomplishment for which we can all be proud. 
   But it is not a time to rest or sit back. We saw in Seattle the consequences of indecision, mixed messages and lack of resolve in the cause of freer and fairer trade. 
   Making the case for freer trade and open markets will never be easy. The concrete dislocations and challenges that come with increased global trade are often easier to see and to seize upon than the more diffuse gains from new markets and new economic growth. It is up to us as policy makers and public officials to ensure that our workers and our businesses see the gains from trade, that they receive the benefits of the agreements we make, and that our security and our economic well-being are enhanced as we seek further engagement in the global economy. 
   I know there are legitimate concerns about this legislation and that there are those having to struggle with whether or not we can trust China's compliance. They are legitimate concerns about human rights violations, religious persecution, and nuclear weapons activities. But I also believe it would be a tremendous mistake to ignore the advantages of this trade legislation. There are a billion people in China. These are markets that are not now open to us. Just last night, I looked over what would come out of this legislation. The fact is, they will have to open markets. China will be required to cut tariffs from the current average of almost 25 percent to an average of 9 percent by 2005, with a particularly sharp reduction for farm products and information technology. 
   China will be required to provide our companies with full trading and distribution rights; it will be required to greatly expand access to its markets for agricultural goods, ranging from cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice, and farm products across the spectrum. For the first time, China will be required to provide real access to financial services providers. 
   This is legislation that is good for America, that is good for the working people in our country. It will take a lot of vigilance. I think we need to make sure of its compliance. But it is the right thing to do. I will vote for this legislation and I hope it will be accepted overwhelmingly.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I rise today to inform the Senate of a sad loss for our Senate family. Yesterday, Murray Zweben, former Parliamentarian Emeritus, passed away at Suburban Hospital from a bout with pneumonia. 
   Murray served the Senate for 24 years over the span of four decades. He began this long and distinguished Senate career during the late 1950's serving as Secretary to the Parliamentarian while attending law school. After clerking for a Federal judge, he returned to the Senate in 1963 to fill the vacated position of Second Assistant Parliamentarian. Murray was promoted to the position of Assistant Parliamentarian in 1964, where he served under the legendary Dr. Floyd Ridick for 10 years. In 1975, Murray ascended to the rank of Senate Parliamentarian, a position that he held until 1981. Two years later, he was honored with the prestigious title Parliamentarian Emeritus. Although I never had the honor of working with Murray, I am well aware of his enormous contributions to this body. 
   A native of New Jersey, Murray graduated from Clarkson College of Technology, and later received his masters degree in education from the State University of New York in Albany. After serving his country for 4 years in the Navy, Murray moved to the Washington, DC, area in 1956. In 1959, he graduated from George Washington University law school, where he served on the law review. After his tenure in the Senate, Murray opened a successful private law practice here in DC. 
   Murray is survived by his wife Anne; his five children Suzanne, Lisa, Marc, John, and Harry; and five grandchildren. I along with the rest of my colleagues send our deepest condolences to the Zweben family over their loss.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there have been numerous efforts over the past several months to find a way to come to agreement on how to proceed to the so-called H-1B bill, which is a bill to provide for additional high-tech workers to come into this country. Since we have already reached the limit, I believe, for this year, there is a need for additional workers in this area. We have negotiated back and forth. At one point we were talking about 10 amendments on each side. Then we got down to seven, six, and yet Senator DASCHLE and I were working to see if we could clear five amendments. 
   Then you get into all kinds of discussions. Are these just relevant amendments or can it be five agreed-to amendments? How do we deal with Senators who would want to add clearly unrelated amendments that could take down the whole issue? 
   Without questioning the motives of anybody, I think Senator DASCHLE and I have been serious in trying to work something out. We have tried repeatedly, but there have been objections for one reason or another on both sides. I do not think we can pursue that any further, although one of the major problems, I had a Senator tell me yesterday maybe he would feel he would not object by Tuesday. But if we wait until Tuesday, then we have lost more days. So if we should be able to come to agreement that would be good. We could vitiate cloture and go to it. If we cannot, we need to go ahead and get to this issue. 
   Hopefully we can get cloture, and when we do, relevant amendments would still be in order, and we still would have to go through a conference. Obviously, there would be input from both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Capitol, and from the administration on the final contours on this bill. But we are down to the point now where there are a number of important bills remaining on the calendar, and if we don't find a way to address them one of two things will happen: They either won't be considered in a conference at the end of the session, or they will be considered in such a way that they will be added to some other bill, unrelated, some appropriations conference report, or something else. 
   At times that is the best way to proceed, and we should keep that option open. But I would prefer to have the Senate act its will on a bill of this type and relevant amendments be offered and debated and voted on. So that is what I want to try to set up here. 
   I have notified the Democratic leader--he has a representative here--that this is what we are going to do now, that we would move to a cloture motion and then we will get to vote on it next week.

   Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield on another point? He and I have discussed the fact that we need to make sure that, wherever possible, some of these high-tech jobs be available in areas now that are underserved--rural areas, including my own State and the State of North Dakota and several other States. I think Nebraska would be in that group. You know, you can't direct where those jobs go, but we could encourage some of those programs, some of these people to be taken into areas where there are not now opportunities, that training be available for them. That certainly would be very attractive so we do not have the high-tech industry only concentrated on the west coast and Northern Virginia or in some other areas, but to try to spread it as much as possible. That is an issue I would like us to consider. 
   With regard to the immigrant problems, I think, as he knows, we have in the past supported some movement in that area. I believe there is some application now to Nicaraguans that are here. Of course that causes some of the problems. Some of their neighbors don't have that same consideration. We should look at this issue. We should do it thoughtfully. But that is one of the problems. 
   H-1B has been pending a long time. We need to get it done. The argument can be made that these are different issues. For instance, I understand the other issues mentioned would not be relevant postcloture to the bill, but I do think it is going to be an issue that is going to be discussed as we get to the end of this session to see if there is some way some of those can be addressed. The Senator is talking, in some instances, about a relatively small number of people. One he mentioned was Liberian immigrants, focused primarily on one State. Maybe something can be done on that. 
   I want us to find a way to get this bill done. It has been dragging for 6 months. We are down to the last 2 weeks of the fiscal year. I am trying to set up a process that guarantees we get to a conclusion while we continue to work with those on both sides who may have objections. 
   The problem we have is, if you include these three, four, or five, you will have other people who will say: What about this issue, that would cause a filibuster to begin and we would wind up having to pull down the bill. I would rather that not be the end result.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I support and will vote for granting permanent normal trade relations status to the People's Republic of China . 
   I will do so because the agreement negotiated between the United States and China will help level the playing field for a wide range of American companies who seek to do business in China. 
   I also support the bipartisan amendment offered by Senators FRED THOMPSON and ROBERT TORRICELLI to require certain reports and to impose sanctions on entities identified by the President for their sale or transfer of dangerous technology to rogue regimes. 
   We cannot stand idly by while China continues to proliferate nuclear weapon and missile technology to unstable regions. 
   There are numerous reports that this pattern of dangerous behavior by Beijing is continuing. For example, the CIA Director George Tenet recently issued a report to Congress on recent developments in proliferation. 
   That report asserts that China has increased its missile-related assistance to Pakistan and continues to provide missile-related assistance to Iran, North Korea, and Libya. 
   These are governments which our own State Department has labeled as state sponsors of terrorism. 
   Who are the ultimate targets for these missiles and nuclear and chemical weapons in the hands of terrorist states? It is the American people, our friends and allies, and our military forces deployed in hot-spots such as the Persian Gulf. 
   Let me state it differently: When China proliferates dangerous technology to dangerous states, it directly and very negatively affects our national security. 
   The Clinton administration says it, too, is concerned about this behavior. But it has failed--resoundingly failed--to stop it. Our CIA tells us that these activities are on-going today. 
   So we need to do more, and this bipartisan amendment makes a strong statement that either this proliferation behavior stops or real and credible penalties will be imposed. 
   I say to my colleagues who, like me, support granting PNTR for China: Let's not lose sight of the national security issues at stake here. 
   I, like Senator THOMPSON, would have preferred to consider this important legislation on another bill and not on H.R. 4444. In fact, I made every effort to see to it that the Thompson-Torricelli legislation could be considered either as a free-standing measure or as an amendment to some other piece of legislation. 
   However, my efforts to have the Thompson-Torricelli amendment considered separate from the China PNTR legislation was blocked. 
   Therefore, we now are faced with a vote on the Thompson-Torricelli amendment on H.R. 4444. Given this situation, I will support the amendment and oppose the motion to table.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to begin my comments by commending the determined efforts of my friends from Oregon, Senator RON WYDEN, and my friend from Idaho, Senator LARRY CRAIG, on Behalf of rural counties. I would like to ask my colleague from Idaho a few questions about S. 1608. First, I am concerned about the composition of the resource advisory committees in section 205(d) of the bill. The bill identifies 3 groups of community interests that must be represented, and provides examples in each group. Is it the mangers' intent that the Secretary concerned will pick a representative from each example interest if that interest resides in the local area served by the advisory committee?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today marks the passage of S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. 
   This bill is a promising example of bipartisanship and what can be accomplished when members of this body work together. Senator WYDEN and Senator CRAIG have worked furiously over the past year to put together a bill that gives relief to communities in economic stress due to changes in management on our Federal lands. Our national forests need the involvement of Federal, State, and local interests to restore ecosystems, provide stewardship opportunities and maintain forest infrastructure. This bill attempts to bring people together to solve land management issues, working to create healthy forests and healthy communities.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again that I think we have made good progress. We have had good debate on both sides of the underlying China PNTR bill, and also on the amendments. But we are reaching the point where we really need to pick that speed up. We need to get an agreement on what amendments will be offered, time agreements for them to be debated, and votes. And we ought to do it tomorrow. Without that, certainly we will have to file cloture; and I may have to anyway. But I think the fair thing to do is give everybody who is serious a chance to offer amendments, have a time for debate on both sides, and then have votes. 
   I am going to try to get that started with this request. And we may have other requests. We are working on both sides of the aisle to identify amendments that really must be moved. 
   I just want to say to one and all that in the end we are going to get the bill to a conclusion. It is going to pass. We have been fair to everybody. But it is time now we begin to get to the closing. With a little help, we can finish this bill Thursday, or Friday, or, if not, early next week. I just have to begin to take action to make that happen so we can consider other issues. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the pending Thompson amendment at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, and the time between 9:30 and 10:30 be equally divided in the usual form, and that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote in relation to the amendment. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending Byrd amendment immediately following the 11 a.m. vote and there be time between 10:30 and 11 a.m. for closing remarks on that amendment to be equally divided in the usual form. 
   Before the Chair rules, I want to say that if any objection is heard to this agreement, we will attempt to set two votes tomorrow on these or other issues beginning at 11 a.m. 
   Therefore, there will be no further votes this evening, and votes will occur at 11 a.m.--hopefully including the Thompson amendment in those 11 o'clock votes. But if there is a problem with that, then we will ask consent to put in place two of the other amendments. 
   With that, I ask the Chair to put the request to the Senate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there will be another consent request  propounded later so that we can have two--the Byrd amendment and another--considered and voted on at 11 o'clock. 
   I note that the Senator from Tennessee will want to respond to the objection just heard. 
   Let me say on that issue that I have been supportive of the Export Administration Act and tried several different ways earlier to get that to the floor. There were problems raised by a number of our committee chairmen. We were not able to get that done. I think the Thompson amendment is a very serious and legitimate amendment that has been considered, and it should be voted on. I think we should go ahead and vote on it tomorrow. I think people know where we are. We ought to go ahead and have that vote and move on. 
   I also must say I am trying to get these votes done so that the largest number of Senators can be accommodated and be here for the vote. 
   I also want to say I don't know exactly what the Senator from Tennessee is going to do. But I predict right now that if we don't get this agreement to vote on the Thompson amendment tomorrow, we are going to vote on it at some point--I believe probably on or in relation to this bill. 
   I don't think it serves anybody's purpose to try to put this off or to object to it. In fact, it may make the situation worse, not better. I think we are ready to go. I think everybody knows how they are going to vote. I think while it may be a close vote, everybody pretty much is reconciled to getting it done tomorrow. 
   I regret that there was objection. 
   I hope we can still find a way to get a vote on it in the next sequence that we will try to put together. 
   By the way, on the Export Administration Act, I believe we are prepared to try to find a way to consider that because I think we need to act on it, making sure that we consider national security interests. That, obviously, is an underlying factor on the Export Administration Act. I have no doubt that the Senator from Wyoming wouldn't be for it if he had any doubts in that area himself because he has worked so extensively on it. 
   The same thing applies on this amendment. Senator THOMPSON is trying to raise a general concern about national security interests. The Chinese are not complying with the nuclear proliferation regimes to which they have committed. 
   What worries me is we are going to have this vote, we are going to pass this bill, and in a month or 6 months we may have a lot of explaining to do. I spent 2 months trying to get a way to have this issue considered separately. That is the way it should have been considered. But it will be considered, I predict, before we get out of here. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator FRIST for the good work that he does on behalf of his constituents but also the entire Senate. He is the only doctor we have in the Senate, a very outstanding heart surgeon. He did quite an outstanding number of things before he ran for the Senate, the first time he had ever run for office, and he has become a very valuable Member of this body. When he talks about health care, health care delivery, he has seen it as a doctor; he has seen it from the standpoint of the patients with whom he has had to deal. He has seen it from the standpoint of what hospitals do or can't do. He has seen unbelievably magnificent technological medical advances that have allowed our people to live longer and have a better quality of life. He knows about heart, lung, and liver transplants. It is a miracle. 
   We want to continue to improve health care in America. I think we have to recognize that it is changing so fast, we have so many people living so much longer with different kinds of needs, we have to be flexible and we have to make changes. He also understands that we could kill the goose that laid the golden egg. We still are blessed in this country to have the best health care, the most sophisticated, technologically advanced health care the minds of men have ever conceived in the history of the world. And we want to make sure that we protect that, preserve it, and make it better. 
   A good way to begin to kill it is to turn it over to the Federal Government. The Government can kill the goose that laid the golden egg; it can take it down. That is why the American people and the Congress didn't go along with the Government takeover of health care that was advocated in 1993. 
   Senator FRIST, as a doctor, has come in and has gotten involved. He is working on these issues. He has been involved in our debate on health issues. That is why I asked him to serve also on our Medicare Bipartisan Commission. We had five or six Senators on that Commission: Senator GRAMM of Texas, Senator FRIST, Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator KERREY, and Senator BREAUX of Louisiana was the chairman, the Democrat chairman of this Bipartisan Commission. I also was very pleased to have a lady in her seventies from my State of Mississippi as one of the commissioners. She was the only one with gray hair on the whole Commission. She was the only one not only eligible for Medicare, she was the one person who dealt every day with Medicare, where the rubber hits the road, 
   dealing with Medicare cases in my State office in Jackson, MI--Eileen Gordon. Dr. FRIST will tell you she was an outstanding member of the Commission, but she used to say during the meeting: Let me tell you how this really works. Among all these experts, all those theoreticians, there was one person dealing with it on an individual basis who did a magnificent job. 
   That Commission did a good job. They came up with Medicare reforms which would preserve and improve the system, and it included a prescription drug component, with choice, with the private sector involved but prescription drug benefits for those with incomes up to 135 percent of poverty. It was a good plan and a bipartisan plan. 
   I thought we should have moved it forward. I called and talked to President Clinton on Monday, I believe it was, of the week that they were supposed to report, pleaded with him to take another look at it; not shoot it down, in effect. He said he had a problem with this or that. 
   I said: Mr. President, that has been changed. Please talk to JOHN BREAUX, the chairman of the Commission. Get the latest proposal. Let's keep the process going. Let's let it come on up to the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee can have hearings and look at it. Let's get this thing going. We can get some reforms; we can get prescription drug benefits. 
   As a matter of fact, he did call Chairman BREAUX and he did take a look at it. But he did walk out into the Rose Garden a day or two after that and said: This is no good. We are not going to do it. 
   That was a magic moment missed. That was in the spring of 1999. 
   But they got it started in the right direction. Really, that is still where we should go. We should have prescription drug benefits available to those, the low-income elderly, who really need help who can't afford it, can't get it now, but not subsidize it for everybody. We don't need prescription drug benefit assistance for Donald Trump or Bill Gates or BILL FRIST. We need it for low-income elderly people such as my mother, who has to live on $859 a month and pay her bills in an assisted care facility, and pay her drug bills. She needs help. A lot of people like her need help. But they don't need it 15 months from now or 8 years from now. They need it now. 
   That is why I am pleased that Chairman ROTH has come up with a package that will do that. It doesn't have the Medicare reforms we ought to have. 
   Senator FRIST is right; if we just put more passengers on this ship that is sinking, it is going to sink even faster. So we need to preserve Medicare. We need some improvements and reforms. We need to make sure none of this money is used for anything but Medicare. Then we need to have a very sensible prescription drug component aimed at the elderly poor who really need it. 
   I appreciate the time he spent in the Medicare commission. I think we ought to reconstitute the Medicare commission. I hope the next President will reconstitute that group and say: You have 120 days. I want to hear from you then. We are going to act on what you recommend; up or down, but we are going to act on it. 
   I hope Senator FRIST will be willing to serve. But have I given an accurate assessment of what happened with the Medicare commission? Is that a correct description of the prescription drug component of that bill?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Pete O'Brien, who has served the Senate community for 32 years, plans to retire. This loss will be felt by all offices of the Senate and the Sergeant at Arms as he completes his final day as Manager of Parking, I.D., and Fleet Operations on September 11, 2000. 
   Pete started his career with the U.S. Capitol Police in 1968 and worked his way up to Sergeant in the Patrol Division. During his training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center he was nicknamed ``100%'' after earning the first perfect score in the class on an examination. 
   In 1980 he moved to the Senate Sergeant at Arms office as Supervisor of Administrative Operations. In 1985 he became Manager of Senate Parking. The challenge of managing limited parking with ever increasing needs has been skillfully maintained during the years under his watch. His institutional knowledge of the Senate's history and operations will be surely missed in this great institution. 
   Both Pete and his wife Jeanie are native Washingtonians. Pete attended P.G. Community College and the University of Maryland where he studied Political Science. Pete and Jeanie recently moved to Springfield, Virginia, after 20 years in Clinton, Maryland. He plans to spend his retirement enjoying his hobbies of photography, downhill skiing and electronics. His elder daughter Kelly and her husband Colman Andrews have brought something new to Pete's life, grandson Connor Shawn Andrews, born in April. Pete is also looking forward to the upcoming marriage of his younger daughter Erin. 
   So on behalf of the Senate, I want to thank Pete for his dedicated, selfless service and wish him many years of happiness with the new joy of his life, Connor, and with all of his family.

   It is about safety; it is about manufactured housing construction. I have a feeling the problem is not with this bill, that it is an unrelated issue. But I hope we can work through the objection and we will come back on Monday or Tuesday of next week, I might say to Senator REID, and see if we cannot get that worked out.

   Just so everybody in the Senate will understand, this is the rural local satellite bill. Most of us refer to it as the satellite bill. It is the bill that was developed as a result of an agreement last year to make sure that there was some way for these loans to be available so satellites could be put up in space, where those of us in rural States, smaller communities, would have access to these satellites with dishes, just like the cities have. This is an effort to keep that commitment. 
   I know Senator BURNS has worked very hard on this matter. I think Senator BAUCUS had a part in it. A number of Senators have worked on it. I thought this morning at 11:30 we had it cleared. I understand there was some concern that maybe we would use this bill as a vehicle for some other specific bill or bills. This is too urgent. It is too important to my State and other States such as mine to not get it done. So there will not be any extraneous matter added to this bill. This bill will come out of conference clean. If any Senator has any reservations about that, if that is why there is an objection, if there is one, I assure the Senators and the leadership that that is not going to be the way it works. 
   I ask unanimous consent that we be able to take that legislation up under the request I made.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond, we will be working with the chairman and the ranking member on that. Thank goodness, we were able to get the energy and water appropriations bill completed. I believe the DC appropriations bill will not be ready until the week after next. We still have the Commerce-State-Justice and the HUD-VA appropriations bills on which we have to make a decision as to which one will go first. There is a problem with the level of funding, the cap on funding. We are going to have to work that out. 
   We are looking next week at, once again, possibly dual tracking with the China PNTR during the day and an appropriations bill at night. The principal focus next week, I believe, has to be on completing work on the China PNTR bill. We are about halfway there, but we still have, I believe, about 11 or 12 amendments that have been identified that may very well require votes.  
   It appears I will still have to file cloture on Tuesday. I want to do whatever is necessary to try to complete that bill by Friday of next week. It may not be possible, but if it means staying on that bill during the day and night, we will look at that option, and I will consult with the leadership on the other side for the need to do that if it appears it is necessary.

   Mr. LOTT. As the Senator knows, we are hoping that early next week the House will take up the legislative appropriations bill coupled with the Treasury-Postal Department appropriations bill. It would be done in such a way that both sides find it acceptable. It is my understanding that the administration would sign it. So that would move two bills to the President. We hope to have that acted on in the Senate next week, hopefully by Thursday. So if that is done, that would put us then at 10 appropriations bills having been acted on by the Senate, leaving only three. 
   I will be working, again, as I said, with the chairman about which we would do next week, the HUD bill or CJS. And I don't know whether the HUD bill has come out of committee yet. So we are still working on that. We are still committed to getting through these appropriations bills, hopefully getting them all done through the Congress, going into conference, and hopefully down to the President before the end of the fiscal year.

   Mr. LOTT. It is possible that we would have votes on Monday. But if we are making good progress--like this week, we didn't force votes on I guess it was Tuesday or Wednesday because we had debate, and we were able to get on the bill. We were able to get amendments done. But I would say this: If there are votes Monday, it will depend on--we were not able to get work done on amendments to the point where they could get a vote today. Votes will not occur before 5:30 or 6 o'clock. We will consult on the time. But it could be that the next votes will not occur until Tuesday morning. It just depends on whether we can get one racked up and in order.

   Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. on Monday, Senator THOMPSON be recognized to offer an amendment to H.R. 4444, and that Senator HELMS be recognized at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday to offer an amendment to the same.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I really had hoped that we could find a way to consider Senator THOMPSON's amendment, or bill, as a separate issue. I worked throughout the month of July to do that. I even tried as late as yesterday to have it considered separately. But I was told that there would be an objection to taking it up. Then we would have to file cloture under a motion to proceed, and it would take days. If it took all that time, it actually could have displaced the China PNTR bill. 
   So I think that Senator THOMPSON has no option but to offer his amendment on China PNTR. It is a very serious matter. Chinese nuclear weapon proliferation is something about which we have to be concerned. And I am convinced it continues to this day. We need a way to monitor it. And there should be a way to impose sanctions if that continues. 
   So that issue will come up on this bill and we will have to see how it works out. I think this is going to be the toughest issue we have to face on China PNTR. There is opposition by some for other reasons, but this is one that will test the will of the Senate, I believe, in getting the work completed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at 12 noon the Senate will resume debate on the China trade bill, with a Byrd amendment to be debated until 1 p.m. At 1 p.m., Senator THOMPSON will be recognized to offer his amendment regarding the China nonproliferation issue. Debate on that amendment is expected to consume most of the day; however, other amendments may be offered during Monday's session. 
   Those Senators who have amendments are encouraged to work with the bill managers on a time to offer the amendments. Also, it is hoped that the Senate can complete action on this important trade legislation by early next week, or certainly by the end of next week. Then we will be able to move on to other issues.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could speak briefly about the schedule, I have been talking with Senator REID and Senator DASCHLE and the managers of this legislation. We are making progress on the amendments. We have had a good debate throughout the week. We are going to keep pushing ahead until we get through the amendments. I had committed not to file cloture before next Tuesday, but it would be my intention to file cloture next Tuesday, if necessary, to get this legislation completed. I think everybody is working hard and doing a good job. 
   Tonight, at 6 o'clock we will go back to the energy and water appropriations bill. I know Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID are prepared to work on that tonight. Our intent is to push ahead. Hopefully, we will get Senators' amendments considered and disposed of quickly. The intent is to stay and get it done tonight. I believe Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID have indicated that is what they intend to do and we will certainly support their efforts. 
   I ask unanimous consent that following the vote in relation to the Hollings amendment, Senator SMITH of New Hampshire be recognized to offer his amendment to H.R. 4444, and at 6 o'clock p.m. the amendment be immediately laid aside and the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4733, the energy and water appropriations bill under the previous order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a couple of unanimous consent requests that I will offer at this time and hopefully it will not take too long to consider these and we can go ahead and stay on schedule. 
   I ask unanimous consent that no later than the close of business on Tuesday, September 26, the majority leader be recognized to turn to calendar 527, which is S. 2340, regarding the Amateur Sports Integrity Act, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, the committee amendments be immediately agreed to, and the majority leader then be recognized to send a cloture motion to the desk to the bill. 
   Under rule XXII, the cloture vote would occur 1 hour after the Senate convenes following the ascertainment of a quorum on Thursday, September 28. 
   I also ask consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, if the cloture is invoked, the bill be considered under the following agreement: That there be 2 hours for debate on the bill to be equally divided in the usual form; that there be up to two relevant amendments in order for Senator REID of Nevada and Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas or their designees, that they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that no motions to recommit or commit be in order. 
   I further ask consent that following the disposition of the above-listed amendments, and the use or yielding back of time, the bill be advanced to  third reading and passage occur, all without intervening action or debate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have another unanimous consent request. 
   First, let me say there has been a lot of discussion about the support and the need for a lockbox on Social Security and Medicare. I certainly agree. We have tried to get that put in place in the Senate. We have not been successful. So I am going to ask consent that we get an agreement to do that. 
   I remind my colleagues, it was passed in the House overwhelmingly, 46-12, to do that with regard to Social Security and Medicare. We have attempted to do it. We tried to invoke cloture in June of 1999, which failed basically along party lines. I think maybe there has been a lot of movement in this direction, so I think we ought to try to set this up before we go out. 
   I ask unanimous consent it be in order for the majority leader, after notification of the minority leader, to turn to Calendar No. 152, H.R. 1259, regarding the Social Security and Medicare lockbox, and following the reporting of the bill by the clerk, all remaining amendments to the bill be germane to the subject contained in H.R. 1259.

   Mr. LOTT. But I hope the minority leader would consider working together to see if we could get a vote on the Social Security/Medicare lockbox itself. Perhaps he would like to have an alternative proposal in that area. I think we can work it out where there would be alternative proposals on Social Security/Medicare lockbox, if you have a different idea about how to do it. I don't think we ought to get into other issues at this point. 
   Let's make it clear whether we want to have the Social Security/Medicare lockbox or not. I would be glad to talk with the Democratic leader about seeing if we can at least set it up. There will be other bills where I am sure the prescription drug matter is going to come up, is going to be debated, and it is going to be voted on. 
   There is a lot of talk out across the land about the lockbox and how there is one or should be one. I think we ought to go ahead and complete that action, and I will work with the Senator on that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I would like to welcome all of my colleagues and our staff back from the August period when we had time to be with our families and our friends and our constituents. We are inspired by the Chaplain's prayer and ready, I am sure, for a lot of good work. As I have visited with some of my colleagues already, I see that they look mighty rested and ready for a busy legislative period, and I think they are probably going to need to be. We still have to complete action on five appropriations measures, as well as conference reports as they become available. 
   In addition, there are a number of other legislative matters we hope to finish as we move toward the adjournment period of the Congress. We have some bills we hope to take up freestanding in the Senate, and, of course, we have some conference reports other than appropriations bills on which we will be working. So we have a lot of work we are going to need to consider. 
   Today, the Senate will have a period of morning business prior to the 12:30 p.m. recess for weekly party conferences and meetings. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15 p.m., it will begin postcloture debate on the motion to proceed to the China PNTR legislation. Those Senators who wish to make statements are encouraged to notify the bill managers. Hopefully, a lot of Senators who wish to speak on the China trade issue will take advantage of the time today, and we will go to as late as possibly 6 p.m., although we may be prepared to go a little bit earlier than that if our colleagues have made their statements and we can get agreement to do that. But at least at 6 p.m. the Senate will begin consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill with amendments in order. 
   As a reminder, we will be considering these two bills on a dual track throughout the week with the motion to proceed to the China trade bill being considered during the day and the appropriations bill or bills being considered at night. So votes could still occur if we move toward the time when we could need to have a vote today, but certainly during the day on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and possibly Friday morning we will be having votes on the appropriations amendments that are offered at night or on China PNTR when amendments become available.  
   So there will be long days, but we will do our best to keep Senators advised after communicating with the leadership on both sides of the aisle what the schedule will be. I hope we can make good progress and complete this appropriations bill and move to another one later on this week or early next week.

   Mr. LOTT. Let me explain, if I could, what just occurred. 
   We will have 15 to 20 minutes of time now that will be used for Senators to speak, those I just mentioned. That will be followed by the vote on the China PNTR motion to proceed. Then there will be a period of morning business time to follow that. 
   When we return in September, we will go during the day to the China PNTR debate. That will be laid aside at 6 o'clock, and we will do the energy and water appropriations bill. This is classically described as a double tracking. We will be doing the appropriations bill at night. I hope it won't take but a couple nights. It may take three. During the day, we will be debating the China PNTR. 
   I have assured Senators on both sides of the aisle that we are not going to shove this through. Senators who need time, Senators who want to offer amendments on the China trade bill are going to have the opportunity to do that. I think that is the right way to do it. We are not going to do it in the wee hours of the night. We are going to do it in the day. This is a major international trade agreement, and it needs to be done carefully and with thought. The Senate has a long tradition of acting carefully and with dignity when it comes to important matters of this nature. That is the way we are going to treat it when we return. There will be no rush to judgment, but I do think the responsible thing to do is to begin to make progress toward an eventual judgment. 
   I thank my colleagues, Senator DASCHLE and Senator BYRD, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator WELLSTONE and all, for their cooperation on this. 
   I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-14-20000727</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Certainly, we want the Senator to have that information. I believe the Senator has it before him. If I could sum it up in laymen's language so the rest of us will understand it, we would have four speeches before the vote on the motion to proceed on China PNTR, to be followed by a vote on that motion to proceed; that we would then come back in on September 5. We would have debates on China PNTR during the day. At 6 o'clock on that Tuesday, we would turn to debate and action, perhaps, on the energy and water appropriations bill, and that we would continue the next day on China PNTR and 
   continue that next Wednesday night on energy and water, if necessary. So, basically, it was to get a vote on this motion to proceed this afternoon, with some prior statements, and then we would work on debate on China PNTR during the day, as we should, and that we would double track and try to move these appropriations bills. 
   I know Senator BYRD wants us to do our work and wants our appropriations bills to be done. I would like to have an agreement beyond this, but it is progress. We will get back on the energy and water bill, which was the next bill in order. I believe Senator REID and Senator DOMENICI will finish that bill probably in a matter of hours.

   Mr. LOTT. If Senator BYRD will allow me to comment on that, this does get us started back on the appropriations bills, with energy and water. It will be my intent, as soon as that is completed, to try to move to another appropriations bill. I will have to consult with the chairman and the ranking member. We still have Treasury-Postal Service, Commerce-State-Justice, Housing and Urban Development, VA, and DC. I want to do them all as soon as we can so they can move on to conference. That is four bills we need to get done as soon as we can. 
   I will continue to try to move those, but it takes consent, or I have to file a cloture motion, which doesn't expedite the proceedings. But we will continue to work with Senator BYRD, Senator STEVENS, and Senator DASCHLE to try to move on to the other appropriations bills. It is pretty obvious by now that I am very committed to that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the oldest African-American church in the City of Jackson, Mississippi, Mount Helm Baptist Church. Not only is it the oldest African-American church, but it is also one of the oldest churches in the State of Mississippi. Throughout this year, Mount Helm will be celebrating its 165th Anniversary with a theme ``Celebrating Our Heritage: Anticipating Our Future''. This year's theme should be echoed in the hearts and minds of everyone. This church clearly exemplifies this theme. Mount Helm, which was founded in 1835, has continuously been a community leader and a strong advocate for Christianity and the spreading of the Gospel. 
   Prior Lee, a prominent Jacksonian, developed a deep interest in religion  and provided the resources for the construction of the First Baptist Church. After the church was completed, Lee persuaded the congregation to allow the African-Americans to hold their own worship services in the basement of the church. The Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, was ratified in 1867 and African-Americans withdrew from the First Baptist Church and erected their own church home, thus forming Mount Helm Baptist Church. 
   During its 165 years of existence, Mount Helm Baptist Church has had the leadership of 21 pastors. Mount Helm is currently being pastored by the Reverend John R. Johnson, Jr. Under his leadership, it has always been a pillar of faith and support to local churches and the surrounding community. The Thomas and Mary Helm family, motivated by a benevolent and sympathetic spirit, donated the land upon which African-Americans built their first church edifice. 
   The City of Jackson and the State of Mississippi are grateful for Mount Helm's Baptist Church leadership and accomplishments.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, obviously I had hoped we would be making a lot more progress this week on appropriations bills and other issues. That has not transpired yet. But we have been filing cloture motions, and we will be getting votes. In some way we will deal this week with the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. I hope we can find a way to proceed on the energy and water appropriations bill. We will get to a vote at some point on the intelligence authorization bill. So, hopefully, we can still go forward. 
   I do not feel as if we are proceeding appropriately, but in spite of that, I think it generally was interpreted or understood that I would try to begin the discussion on the China PNTR bill. Even though it will be difficult to get through the maze of clotures we have  had to file this week, I still think it is the appropriate thing to do to begin this process because we do not know exactly how long it will take to get to a final vote on the China trade issue. 
   I am still going to do my best to find a way to have the Thompson-Torricelli legislation considered in some manner before we get to the substance of the China trade bill because I think Chinese nuclear weapons proliferation is a very serious matter. We should discuss that and have a vote on it. I think it would be preferable to do it aside from the trade bill itself. 
   In the end, if we can't get any other way to get at it, these two Senators may exercise their right to offer it to the China PNTR bill. But I am going to continue to try to find a way for that to be offered in another forum. I think Senator DASCHLE indicated he would work with us to try to see if we could find a way to do that. But I do think if we can go ahead and get started--and since there will be resistance to the motion to proceed--then we will file cloture and have a vote on it then on Friday.

I hope we can get to a vote on Friday; and then when we come back in September this will be an issue we can go to soon rather than later in the month.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this cloture vote will occur on Friday, unless consent can be granted to conduct the vote earlier or we are in a postcloture situation on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. There is opposition, obviously, to this motion to proceed. But I still think that adequate time can be used for discussion. I know there are a number of Senators who would like to see this vote occur on Thursday instead of Friday. I am willing to accommodate that. But if that cannot be worked out, then we will have the vote on Friday. If we are in a postcloture situation, the vote could be postponed for some time. But I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum be waived.

   Mr. LOTT. In conclusion, while we seek Utopia in dealing with these appropriations bills, the promised land of how we can work together to do the people's business, which we are not doing right now, at least in the case of this bill, I believe we will have broad bipartisan support for the China PNTR bill. I might add, there is going to be some bipartisan opposition, too. 
   So as we get into the substance of this--which I would rather be getting into rather than having to once again file cloture on a motion to proceed--I think we will have a good debate. I think it is going to serve the Senate well. I think it will serve the American people well. I believe when we do finally get to a vote, it will pass--and probably should. But there are a lot of serious questions still involved in how we are going to deal with China. So I look forward to this discussion. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond to the Senator's questions and comments, he knows a major effort was made last Thursday evening to come up with an agreement on how to proceed further on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   One of the problems we had then, and we continue to have, is Senators on both sides of the aisle have nongermane, noneducation issues they want to get into or, conversely, amendments they do not want to be offered. I know there had been some suggestion that maybe the NCAA gaming issue would be offered, and there was a feeling on the Democratic side that 
   should not be included in the package of what we proceed to consider. 
   There is at least one Senator on this side who is interested in being able to offer an IDEA amendment which, in fact, relates to education, but there was resistance to that Senator being able to offer his amendment. 
   Then it got into immigration, and we were close to working out an agreement that connected, in a way, this bill with H-1B. In the end, we could not get the agreement. A lot of time was put in on that by Senators on both sides. Senator DASCHLE and I worked very hard on it. We were up the hill, down the hill. 
   We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this legislation this year and get it completed. I have another idea I am considering right now that will get us back on it in a way that will actually get it to completion. That is my goal. I am not interested in only going back to it and playing games with it and having nongermane, noneducation issues poured on this bill. I want to stick to education. I think we can have a good debate and a lot of amendments that are strictly related to elementary and secondary education. I realize the ingenuity of Senators can stretch the idea of related amendments to education. 
   That is the way I would like to proceed. Right now we are having trouble getting agreement to do appropriations bills and the intelligence authorization bill. I am even worried about being able to go forward with the commitment to begin the proceedings on the China PNTR tomorrow, which I still hope to be able to do, but it is going to take some concessions, again, as to how we proceed to get that done. 
   I will be glad to keep working with Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, Senator REID, Senator GREGG, and Senator ASHCROFT. I like the bill. I would like to get it done. I would like to vote on it just as it is myself. I do not think we need to fix it up anymore. It does not need more bells and whistles. Let's just vote. I know others have amendments, and we will try to find agreement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the week's schedule, we had hoped we would be making progress now on the energy and water appropriations bill. But a disagreement developed on Friday afternoon, and we are continuing to see if we can work through that. I have spoken to Senator DOMENICI, the chairman of the energy and water appropriations subcommittee, about trying to find a way to proceed. 
   It is very important legislation for our country. It does involve appropriations for the Energy Department, the very important nuclear weapons labs, as well as water projects all over this country in which Members and States and various groups are very interested. So I hope we can find a way to proceed on that. 
   It has been held up, basically, by a disagreement over how to handle the water levels on the Missouri River, affecting the States of North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, and perhaps others downstream. It is not easy to reconcile or to 
   come to an agreement because there are very strong feelings about it, and it is very important to local areas. I know Senator DOMENICI is ready to proceed. He will be over later to make some comments about the importance of this legislation. 
   We also hope to take up the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill this week. It should not be that controversial. I understand there may be some amendments to it; It may take some time, but that is understandable. That is fine. We could do that and still  conclude that legislation probably in a day or so. 
   We had hoped that during the pendency of the week we could also go to the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. We had hoped to do all three of them, or at least two of the three, and make some progress on Commerce-State-Justice. 
   We also would like to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill. As is always the case, after the Armed Services Defense authorization bill for the year is done, we, in relatively short order, then go to the intelligence authorization. I do not need to talk about the importance of the intelligence authorization bill and what it means to the security of our country, but we have not been able to work out exactly how to proceed on that either. 
   Then on Wednesday, we had indicated we would go to the China PNTR issue. Indications had been that there would be resistance to moving forward on the motion to proceed, and I would have to file cloture on that, with that cloture motion then ripening on Friday. So we would go ahead and go to that and get over the first hurdle in being able to complete the China trade legislation when we come back in September. 
   We had hoped to go to the Executive Calendar and get some nominations completed this week and also consider some additional judges that might be reported from the Judiciary Committee during the week. 
   All of that right now is in abeyance. We have not been able to get an agreement on how to proceed at this time. I think that is unfortunate because we do have 4, 4 1/2 days this week in which we need to make real progress on appropriations bills and other issues, as well as the China trade legislation. 
   If we cannot get an agreement here in the next couple of hours or so, then I will have to try to proceed to one of the appropriations bills and the intelligence authorization bill, and perhaps even file cloture on them. Both of those will then ripen on Wednesday. Of course, if cloture is obtained, then we will be on those bills, which will then get tangled up in the China permanent normal trade relations issue. So this is not a good way to proceed, but that may be our only alternative. 
   But I have talked to Senator DASCHLE this morning. I have talked to Senator HATCH. We will continue to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to see if we can find a way to make some good progress this week, because this is the last week before the August recess, and it will have an effect on what we are able to do in September.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise at this time to talk about our beloved friend, Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. I had hoped to be able to make some further comments last week, after it fell my duty to come to the floor and announce his very untimely death, but I just could not do it because I was so emotionally disturbed and grieving over the loss of this good friend. 
   I guess maybe the week and the services in Georgia on Saturday have helped me come to peace with this very difficult loss and to say a fond farewell to my good friend from Georgia. But I wanted to speak now because I felt, even this morning, a void for this week; Paul will not be here. He will not be here saying, What can we do next? How can I help? He was willing to work with all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats, going over to the Democratic side of the aisle and seeking out Senator HARRY REID or Senator TORRICELLI, trying to find some way to make a bipartisan piece of legislation possible. So we will have a void this week. 
   But, as I was thinking about it a few moments ago, there will be a void forever in the Senate with the loss of Paul Coverdell because his was an unfinished symphony. A lot more beautiful sounds were going to come from that somewhat uncertain trumpet from Georgia. 
   Folks have talked about his flailing hands and his squeaky voice, but that is what really made Senator Coverdell all the more attractive. He was not always as smooth as some of us like to think we might be, but he was always effective. Maybe it was because of the way he presented his speeches and the way he came across in his daily relationships with all of us. 
   The Chaplain of the Senate, Lloyd Ogilvie, at the church services in memory of Paul Coverdell on Saturday, referred to him as a peacemaker. And maybe this is a good time of the year to be thinking about the beatitudes because I think it really did describe Paul. Even though he felt very strongly about the issues he believed in or that he was opposed to, he was always binding up everybody else's wounds. He would find a way to make peace and get results. 
   I thought the Chaplain's description of him as a peacemaker was apropos. When I did my Bible study this morning, I came to that particular passage, ``Blessed is the peacemaker.'' Again I thought, that is just one more message about Paul and the great job he did in the Senate. 
   I met Paul years ago actually, way back in the 1970s when there was a very fledgling Republican Party in Georgia. We didn't have much of a Republican Party at that time in my State, but we were beginning to make progress. Maybe Georgia was even a little bit behind us. I remember going down to Atlanta and then having to go to Albany, GA, to attend events, then back into Atlanta. It was one of those occasions where a number of Congressmen and Senators came in for a fly around the State, and then we all came back in for the big dinner. It was logistically hard to orchestrate. Then I finally met the maestro; the maestro was Paul Coverdell. 
   Typically, I learned later, it was the way he would work. He had five or six of us come in. We went to five or six different places in the State like spokes on a wheel. We came back. We had dinner. It was a very effective event. Everything worked like clockwork. It worked like clockwork because Paul Coverdell was making it happen. 
   In those days, as I recall, he was in the State legislature, in the State senate. They had three Republicans. He was the minority leader. They had a minority whip and they had a whipee. There were three of them. That is the way he used to describe his powerful role in the senate, although, as I came to find out a lot later, he was a very effective member of the State senate, working as always both sides of the aisle, even though he only had three in his party in the State senate at that time. 
   Of course, he went on to work in the Bush administration in the Peace Corps. I wasn't quite sure what that meant, but I am sure he did a great job at the Peace Corps. I remember then supporting him when he actually ran for the Senate in 1992. I wasn't that intimately involved in the campaign but knew him to be a good man. I remember making a pitch for him both here and in Georgia. 
   When I really got to know him was when he came to the Senate. Almost immediately he started throwing himself into the fray, whatever was going on. I remember we had the Clinton health care plan. I think he made 147 appearances in one State or another, on one occasion or another, against the Government takeover of health care. He felt passionately about it. He took off on the trail with Senator PHIL GRAMM and Senator JOHN MCCAIN. They had a lot to do with the eventual, and in my opinion, appropriate demise of that legislation. I learned that he wouldn't just talk a good game or wouldn't just give direction; he would put his body on the line. He would go anywhere, anytime to see that the message was delivered. 
   Immediately he started saying: If we are going to do this in a positive way, if we are going to be fighting this legislation, how are we going to get our message out? He would be persistent about it. He would follow you around and keep wanting to talk about it. I remember he actually instigated meetings, at that time between the Speaker of the House and me, first as whip and then as majority leader, in which he would get the two of us together. He would have charts. Here he is from Georgia in probably his fourth year in the Senate, and he is using charts to explain the situation to the Speaker of the 
   House and the majority leader. Only we listened because he had thought about it; he was organized. He had some ideas.  
   I remember one occasion he said: You have to come to Atlanta. 
   I said: I don't want to come to Atlanta. 
   He said: Just come for lunch; Newt and I want to sit and talk with you. 
   So I flew down. We had lunch. He had charts and he had a video this time. He talked about how we should be planning our strategy. Then we flew back. I thought about that many times, in a way, the temerity of that. But that was Paul. Nobody objected. Nobody took it as a threat. Nobody worried he was stepping on their turf. And thank goodness, somebody was thinking and planning. That was Paul. 
   Then after that, of course, he got involved as a member of the leadership team. I really liked that because I can remember very early on I realized that if there was a task that needed to be performed that nobody else would do, I could call on Paul; he would be glad to do it. I can remember going down the leadership line: Would you have the time to do this? Do you have the staff to do this? It would come down to the third person. He always sat at the other end of the leadership table. I would get to Paul, having had three turndowns, and Paul would say: Sure, I'll do it. 
   Very quickly I developed the moniker for Paul of ``Mikey.'' I like to nickname Senators. Most of them wouldn't like for me to talk about it publicly. But Paul actually kind of liked being called Mikey. Mikey came from the television cereal commercial where the two kids are pushing a bowl of cereal back and forth saying: You eat it; no, you eat it. Finally, they push it to the third little boy and say: Give it to Mikey; he will try anything. 
   That was the way Paul was. When all the other great leaders of the Senate were not willing to take the time, not willing to do the dirty, difficult, time-consuming job, Mikey would do it. I remember every time I called him Mikey, he would break out in a big smile. Tricia, my wife, picked it up, too. We liked too talk to Nancy about how sorry we were to have kept him tied up a little extra, too, sometimes in the Senate. But Mikey had his work to do. So it was a very affectionate term I had for him, and it described him so perfectly. 
   He was not a funny, ha-ha sort of guy, but he was willing to laugh. He had a sense of humor. He was willing to laugh at himself, which really made him attractive. He was self-effacing. There was no grandeur there. He was, as PHIL GRAMM said in his remarks at the services Saturday--I believe it was PHIL--or as somebody said: An ordinary man with extraordinary talents. He was willing to work hard to make up for whatever he lacked in some other way. He surely was loyal. I never had to worry about anything I said or asked Paul to do being used in an inappropriate way against me or against anybody else. He would handle it properly. And he was sensitive. He was always sensitive: Did I do the right thing? Did this Senator react some uncertain way? 
   I remember asking him to come and help us on the floor on issues he cared about. He really cared about education. He wanted education savings accounts. He believed it would help parents with children in school. He believed it would help low-income parents have the ability to save just a little bit of their money, just a little bit to help their children with 
   clothes or computers or tutoring. If we ever find a way to pass that legislation, instead of education savings accounts, it should be the Coverdell savings accounts. That would be an appropriate memorial and monument to Paul Coverdell. He believed in it. It wasn't a partisan political thing. It was something he thought would make a difference. 
   As for drugs, I remember him following me around in the well heckling me about the need to pay more attention to the drug running in the Gulf of Mexico area across the borders in the Southwest. The Senator from Arizona worked with him on that issue. I remember his commitment to trying to be helpful to the Government in Colombia to fight drug terrorism there. He was passionate about it because he felt it threatened our country, threatened our very sovereignty, and it threatened our children. Once again, as with education, he saw it in terms of what it was doing or could do to our children. Again, he was involved. 
   One of the last discussions I had with him was on the intelligence authorization bill. There is a provision in it which he didn't particularly like. He was determined to have a way to make his case on that. In his memory, we will make sure his case is made by Senator KYL, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator DEWINE, perhaps others. He really would dig into issues and make a difference. 
   I also called on him at times when there really was nobody else who could take the time to do the job. 
   He worked with us for a solid week on the floor on the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill. I came in one day and found that we had over 200 amendments pending. Somebody had to take the time to work with both sides to begin to get those amendments reduced, accepted, eliminated, withdrawn, or whatever. To his credit, Senator SPECTER said: I would like to have Paul spend time helping me with this. 
   Other leadership members were involved in other issues. I could not be here. Senator NICKLES could not be here. We had other things we had to do. Within a short period of time, the 200 became 50. Before the week was out, it was done. 
   Senator REID will tell you that Paul really made the difference. He didn't just hang out on this side of the aisle; he was rummaging around on the other side trying to see if we could work through it. I remember at the end of the week he was a little pale and, obviously, a little stressed. He came to my office and said: Boy, do I understand a little bit better what your job entails. 
   Well, he was able to do it because nobody felt threatened by Paul. He wasn't getting in my hair, stepping on Senator NICKLES' turf, or inappropriately shoving amendments away. He was working with everybody involved. Nobody got mad. Nobody got even. It is sort of a unique thing for a Senator to be able to do that. 
   So I guess I will be trying to find another ``Mikey.'' But I don't think there is one. And so as I thought about doing this speech, I tried to find some statement, some poem, something that would pay a final appropriate treatment to Senator Coverdell. I came across a passage from a poem, ``The Comfort of Friends,'' by William Penn. 
   He said: 
 They that love beyond the world Cannot be separated by it. Death cannot kill what never dies, Nor can spirits ever be divided That love and live in the same divine principle: [Because that is] the root and record of their friendship.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we have worked this morning, in some ways long distance because Senators who have been involved in these discussions are on their way back, and we have been trying to get agreements on how to proceed. We have not gotten it worked out yet. But in a full measure of precaution, because we want to make sure we are doing everything we can to complete our work this week, it is necessary for me to go ahead and move to call up an appropriations bill and the intelligence authorization bill and file cloture. They would then be ripened on Wednesday. We would be prepared to vote on cloture, if necessary, on Wednesday. 
   It is my hope that, through communications and meetings that will take place--perhaps later on this day or in the morning--we will be able to vitiate that because there is no need, really, to have to invoke cloture on the motions to proceed. But it is the only way I can begin the discussion and be assured that we get to the substance of these two bills some time this week.

   The motion was agreed to, and at 3:21 p.m., the Senate adjourned until 3:22 p.m. the same day. 
   The Senate met at 3:22 p.m. and was called to order by the Honorable SUSAN COLLINS, a Senator from the State of Maine.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I note that we had hoped this week to complete action on some additional judicial nominations, to complete at least two appropriations bills and begin a third one, and have the first cloture vote on China PNTR. It is still our hope, but at this time, at least, there is objection from our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle to proceeding on appropriations bills. We have a lot we can do this week, and I certainly hope we will do that. Under this action we have just taken, we can have some discussion by the chairman of the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations subcommittee. I see the manager, the chairman of the subcommittee, is here. I am sure he will want to make some comments and outline what is included in the bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we also need to get the intelligence authorization bill done this week. I don't think it will take that long to complete it, although I suspect there are at least a couple issues that will have to be debated and voted on. I had the impression maybe half a day or a night would be all that would be necessary to complete this. I am hoping maybe sometime even Thursday we might complete it, and before, if possible. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 654, S. 2507, the intelligence authorization bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I want to note that I did not move to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. I did that on purpose. I did it out of respect for the Democratic leader and the objection he has made to a particular section and the fact that it is obviously something very important to him and the Senators from North Dakota and South Dakota and other States. 
   But there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who actually support section 103 because of the impact this might have on the Missouri downriver in States such as Missouri, Illinois, and perhaps even, most importantly, as far as my own State of Mississippi. I talked to Senator DOMENICI and Senator DASCHLE this morning. I still hope we can find a way to resolve that. If that one issue can be resolved, I think that bill might take a couple hours and could be completed. I still have that on our list as one of the three bills we really must do this week. 
   With regard to the judges, I have made a commitment to try to continue to move judges who have been reported by the Judiciary Committee. I continue to urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to act on those judges who could be reported out. They did report out five judges last week, including a circuit judge from the State of Nevada who will wind up being on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California, I guess, and so I think I have been keeping my word to try to move those. 
   I believe the Judiciary Committee is prepared to have a hearing or is having a hearing tomorrow and will move at least four more judges tomorrow. I think it would be unfortunate if those four got tangled up in these difficulties we are outlining now. 
   It is very hard for me to understand why these appropriations bills and this authorization bill, the intelligence authorization bill, would be held up over one circuit court judge or even two circuit court judges who may still be acted on or have hearings and be reported out. But the majority leader cannot just direct the Judiciary Committee or the chairman that he must report a specific judge. I think it is responsible for me to say: Report those judges where you can and that can be cleared and voted on. But I am not now in a position to guarantee that a specific one judge will be reported by the Judiciary Committee. We will keep working with the chairman of the committee, and hopefully some solution can be found. I think we can find it. 
   In the meantime, we are losing a day here. I hope we don't lose all day tomorrow. But that is our goal this week, to try to get some judges, try to do two or three appropriations bills, try to do intelligence authorization, and to begin debate on the China PNTR issue. 
   I guess there is no option for me at this time, though, but to move to proceed to the bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we could manufacture a vote, as the Senator knows, and force that vote. But in light of all that is going on, I don't see that it would serve any purpose other than sort of a bed check vote. It had been my intent to have votes on amendments to the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill, but that is not possible. I think since we have had to take this action and file cloture, we should announce that there will not be a recorded vote or votes tonight at 6 o'clock. 
   The next opportunity to vote, I presume, will possibly be in the morning. I hope we can begin to make progress in some way during the day today, or early tomorrow, so votes can be held, if necessary, before the luncheon, or immediately thereafter.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished assistant minority leader will yield to me under his reservation, I will be brief. Then under his reservation or on his own, Senator DASCHLE may want to comment. 
   What I have asked is consent that we go to the energy and water bill, and I asked consent that if a motion to strike section 103 is offered, the motion to strike be limited to 3 hours to be equally divided in the usual form, and we would go to a vote. 
   Under Senator REID's reservation, if I could respond to two points: One, in addition to the very important energy aspects of this legislation that have been mentioned, I will focus on the water side. So much of America benefits from our water and our water projects, whether it is navigation or recreation, flood control. These are not just projects that individual Members want to get for their particular district for political benefit. They have a lot to do with the economy of this country, the creation of jobs and the lifestyle in America. 
   This is an important bill both on the energy and water side. I know both sides want to get it done. I have absolutely no doubt about that. I know the managers of this legislation, Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID, are probably two of the best we have in the Senate. It would probably look as though magic had been performed, how quickly this bill could be completed. 
   The issue we are talking about is a very difficult one with which to cope. It has been in the mill a long time. I know there are very strong beliefs on both sides of the issue, probably on both sides of the aisle. I hope we will continue to work to see if we can't find a way to deal with this issue in a way that is fair. My thinking is under an agreement to try to 
   take it out with a time limit; that is fine, or an agreement to try to take it out and then put it back in with a time agreement; that is fine. We are looking for any possible solution. I hope we will find a solution in the next few minutes or next couple hours today. 
   If we can't, then I am already looking, I say to Senator DASCHLE, to see if we can get managers available and try to proceed to the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill Monday afternoon, see if we can make progress on that. I don't know of any big controversy on that one. Of course, it funds the Treasury. It also funds the Postal Service, and it funds White House operations. Hopefully, we could look to that as an alternative. I would rather do energy and water. I would like to do them both so we can get them into conference and so progress can be made next week and they will be hopefully ready to go to the President soon after that. 
   I thank Senator REID for allowing me to speak under his reservation. I will withhold if Senator DASCHLE wants to respond or comment under reservation, too.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again, of course, judicial nominations are important to the country on both sides of the aisle. I guess in the Senate everything is related to everything else. But who the hearings are on in Judiciary doesn't directly affect this bill. We need to get the intelligence authorization bill done. 
   Once again, this is important to the national security of our country. There had been some objections to it, but we have worked through those, and it took a lot of give and take and cooperation on both sides because there were objections on both sides of the aisle. We have cleared that. 
   Regarding the amendment I pointed out of Senator THOMPSON, I have been looking for any number of ways to have this very important matter of nuclear weapon proliferation by China reviewed. Senator THOMPSON has been very helpful and willing to withhold, or to consider any number of options as to how that would be considered. It seems to me that if we can get the intelligence authorization bill up, that would be an appropriate place for this issue to be considered, so that we can move to the PNTR for China issue on Wednesday. We are going to do that anyway. But I would like to have been able to deal with Senator THOMPSON's very meritorious amendment, either freestanding or as an amendment before we go to the China PNTR issue because I think he is going to be constrained to offer it as an amendment to the bill. That would be difficult because if it should be approved, of course, it would have to go on the bill and it would go back to conference and the House would have to consider it again. Perhaps, there will be enough votes to defeat it, but I, for one, do not feel constrained to vote against an issue of this significance. I think it is a legitimate argument that this is a national security and nuclear proliferation issue that should maybe be considered separate from the trade issue, but it is related to how we are going to deal with China in the future. 
   So, again, Senator DASCHLE objected with the recognition that we are working on another angle or issue. We will try to get that worked out, and then we will try again later this afternoon on this issue. Rather than me controlling the floor for the debate, I think it would be best at this point if perhaps I would yield the floor, and perhaps Senator THOMPSON and Senator HOLLINGS, who are very interested in this issue, could speak on their own time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I know a lot of Senators on both sides are wondering about the proceedings at this time. I understand there are at least a couple of amendments that may take a few minutes. And then, of course, we are not sure at this point whether they would require a recorded vote or not, and then final passage. 
   We still hope to get an agreement that would allow us to go to the marriage penalty tonight, and have an hour of debate on that, and then continue on that tomorrow. And beyond that, we will have to get an agreement worked out. 
   I urge my colleagues to, if they will, agree to time limits and cooperate with the managers as much as they can. We need to finish this bill in the next 30 minutes, if we can, and get an agreement on how we proceed for the rest of tonight, tomorrow, and Monday.

   I further ask consent that following the disposition of the marriage tax relief conference report on Friday, the Senate immediately proceed to executive session in order to consider the following nominations, that they be considered en bloc, confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be notified, and the Senate return to legislative session.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the amendment we have before us will return to the text of the committee-reported bill. If this amendment is agreed to, we will then be voting on a clean marriage penalty relief bill with the exact text that was reported from the Finance Committee. It is a simple vote. It is a simple choice. Last night the Senate did accept some amendments on several issues that are not relevant to marriage penalty relief, several of them on voice vote, perhaps a couple of them along the way on recorded votes. 
   Some of them are good amendments. We will have another opportunity to vote for them or have them included in other legislation. They are good ideas that deserve to be on another bill. This bill is about tax relief for married couples and about eliminating the marriage penalty when a couple gets married, so I urge my colleagues to support cleaning up the bill so we can pass a clean marriage penalty bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are working with the managers of various pieces of legislation to determine the best way to proceed. Senator DASCHLE and I have been discussing how to proceed. We have had a very busy time over the past 8 days. We have had a lot of votes. We have completed a lot of work: The Department of Defense authorization bill--actually, we completed that with debate at night--the Interior appropriations bill today, the death tax elimination legislation last Friday, and the marriage tax penalty today. 
   The question is how to proceed at this point. We hope we can complete action on the foreign operations appropriations bill so it can go to conference, as we did yesterday on the legislative appropriations bill. 
   Our colleagues will recall, we did take that up but didn't complete it. We need to get that done so that can go to conference and the House and Senate conferees can begin working with the administration to get that important legislation passed. I know they have interest in it. We do, too. 
   We are also committed to getting four appropriations bills done before we go out for the August recess: Agriculture, which is, I believe, ready to proceed. The managers are in the area. Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL are in the area; 
   The energy and water appropriations bill is ready to go when we complete Agriculture; Treasury-Postal Service will be ready next week, and Commerce-State-Justice. 
   That would be 11 appropriations bills. That would still leave the HUD-VA appropriations bill and the DC appropriations bill. But for a variety of reasons, we probably could not get those two done until some time in September, maybe even the middle of September anyway. 
   Now, there are other issues in which Senators are interested. We have been discussing ways to proceed to them, or if we could proceed to them. We had discussed the possibility of going to the NCAA gaming issue. I discussed that with some of the advocates on this side of the aisle at noon today. I understand, in fact, we may not be able to proceed to that because we have to clear it with a lot of different Senators. But we will continue to look to see if we can find a way to have that legislation considered. 
   Senator DASCHLE will want to comment on a number of these things, and maybe ask questions, too. 
   We still have pending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We put about a week or more into that legislation. A lot of amendments have been offered and voted on. There is a feeling, I hope, on both sides of the aisle that we would still like to actually complete that legislation. 
   I would like to consider working on it and at some point proceed the way we did on the Defense authorization bill so we actually get it completed. I am going to talk more with Senator DASCHLE about that. He will want to consult, I am sure, with the ranking member on his side. I will want to consult with the chairman on our side, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator CRAIG, and others who are involved in that. 
   I continue to urge the Judiciary Committee to make progress on judicial nominations. There are a number of nominations that have had hearings, nominations that are ready for a vote, and other nominations that have been pending for quite some time that should be considered. 
   I have discussed this matter regularly with Senator HATCH, including last Friday afternoon and, again, just briefly yesterday. I cannot make the Judiciary Committee vote. I cannot tell them who to vote on, but I can urge them to continue to work on those nominations that can be cleared and can be reported to the Senate. 
   I have been assured by the chairman that they are going to have a markup and report out some judges on Wednesday of this week or--I thought it was Wednesday. Has it been moved to Thursday? I thought it was 10 o'clock on Wednesday. But they are going to report out judges this week and have at least one more hearing before the August recess. They expect to report out another group of judges next week. In that group will be not only district judges but circuit judges. So I want to make that record clear. 
   With regard to the issue a lot of Senators are interested in, the China permanent normal trade relations issue, we have to finish the appropriations bills. But we are discussing now a procedure, which we can discuss, that would allow us to go ahead and proceed to it, take some action on it next week but recognize that because of the time that could be required in having to debate and file cloture on a motion to proceed, and other cloture motions that might be necessary, we would not be able to complete it and do the appropriations bills next week. 
   Also, I continue to have a desire to find a way for the Thompson-Torricelli issue to be considered, either freestanding or as an amendment. So we need to get that resolved before we actually move to proceed to the China PNTR bill. 
   But I can see, again, the possibility of doing some work on that freestanding at night or doing it as an amendment, or, of course, he may reserve his right and may, in fact, believe he has to actually offer it when we go to China PNTR. 
   So what I am proposing here--and I would like Senator DASCHLE to comment on it--is that we go ahead and complete action on the foreign operations appropriations bill, send it to conference; that we go to the Agriculture appropriations bill; that we then take up the other appropriations bills in this group --energy and water, Treasury-Postal Service, and CJS--but that we work to see if we can proceed at night, perhaps on Thursday, perhaps next Monday, on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I need to consult with Senators that have been involved in that from the committee--the chairman and others I mentioned--and Senator DASCHLE needs to do the same thing. 
   If we could get an understanding that we would work on all these, we would also entertain the idea of proceeding to the China PNTR legislation next Wednesday. I believe, as it now stands, I would have to file a cloture motion on that. That cloture, then, would ripen on Friday; I believe that would be the 28th of July, which would be the Friday that we would hope to go out for the August recess. That would be the final action, unless 30 hours had to be run off of it at that time. Then we would go back to that when we come back after the August recess in September. The positive effects of that  would be that we would show clearly we intend to go to this legislation. 
   We are going to work together to get these appropriations bills done. We are going to go to China PNTR. We are going to get over the first hurdle, recognizing that there are several other hurdles that could require quite a bit of time to complete. 
   But those are sort of the parameters of what Senator DASCHLE and I and others have been talking about. 
   I say to Senator DASCHLE, why don't I yield the floor so you can make comments on that and/or ask any questions.

   Mr. LOTT. If I could respond to Senator MCCAIN's comments, as I indicated to him at lunch, I was prepared and am prepared to move to proceed to that issue. I understand perhaps there may be objection to proceeding. I had hoped maybe we could get an agreement to go ahead and proceed. But we can call it up, and if there is objection, there is objection. We will have to deal with it at that point. 
   Of course, one option is to file cloture to try to overcome that objection. But we would have to factor in the time that would take and how that would play in all these other issues we are trying to balance. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I thought maybe we could go to it, but we have an obligation. Just like I had to talk to Senator MCCAIN, I need to talk to Senator BROWNBACK. He has Senators he needs to talk to. I believe--I do not want to speak for him--he indicated he thought perhaps there would be an objection to proceeding. We did not think that was the case as early as 11 o'clock today. We will continue to work with the Senator because I am committed to working with him and Senator BROWNBACK to find a way for this issue to come up and be considered. If we can ever get it to a vote, I think the Senator is right; it is going to pass overwhelmingly.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator. 
   Let me note, for instance, the types of things we do need to accommodate. The Senate tomorrow will want to accommodate Senators wishing to attend the services for Senator Pastore, a  great Senator from the State of Rhode Island. A delegation will be attending those services tomorrow morning. We will continue to work, but we will withhold the votes or stack the votes, if any are required, until the afternoon at 2 or 2:30. I don't know exactly what time it would be, but I know Senator COCHRAN would want to do that. That is the kind of situation we have to try to accommodate. We can't always dictate how we will proceed because we want to do this in memory of a Senator who served in this body for many years. 
   We will continue to act in good faith to try to make sure Senators' wishes are known and accommodated. We may not be able to get them all worked out. As to the NCAA gaming, I thought maybe we could move to proceed to that without objection, but there may be a legitimate one. I had promised a couple of Senators we would make sure they knew of that. 
   I will also need to talk to Senators about the best night that we could do some work on ESEA. Senator DASCHLE will want to do the same in view of that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation temporarily suspending duties on imports of certain piano plates. This legislation is needed to address a difficult situation facing the domestic piano industry. 
   A piano plate is an essential part of a piano. It is the iron casting over which the strings are stretched and tuned by pins inserted in the plate. Baldwin Piano & Organ Company, which employs more than 600 workers in the production of pianos in Arkansas and Mississippi, is one of a diminishing number of piano producers in the United States. Piano plates are produced in the United States by a single company, a competitor of Baldwin, whose production is for the most part captively consumed. As such, Baldwin lacks a domestic source for piano plates, other than the surplus production of one of its competitors. Due to its own demand for plates, Baldwin's competitor cannot meet Baldwin's requirements. 
   Mr. President the history and recent contraction in the domestic piano industry points to the critical need for this legislation. Indeed, were the production of Baldwin or other domestic producers to be curtailed due to the insufficient availability of domestically-produced piano plates, it is likely that this would engender an increase in foreign piano supply, rather than an increase in market share of other domestic producers. This is evident from the fact that, in the early 1980s, there were 15 domestic piano producers supplying approximately 80 percent of U.S. consumption, whereas now only nine domestic producers remain--servicing approximately half, if not less, of the U.S. market. The domestic piano industry is well aware that foreign production stands ready to fill any gap in domestic supply. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would temporarily suspend, through the year 2004, the rate of duty applicable to imports of piano plates provided for in subheading 9209.91.80 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Currently, the applicable rate of duty is 4.2 percent ad valorem. If the legislation is approved, the reduction in duty collection is estimated to be between $300,000 and $400,000 per year through 2004. 
   Given the situation currently facing domestic piano producers, it is unlikely that there will be objection from other domestic manufacturers to the legislation proposed today. In view of the fact that Baldwin must resort to imported plates regardless of the duty rate applicable to such imports, and that no appreciable domestic production of piano plates will be displaced by imports, suspension of the duty rate will have no adverse affect upon the domestic industry. This legislation stands to ensure only that a U.S. piano producer will find a reliable source of supply for a critical component and thus will be better positioned to stand with other domestic producers in providing a secure and stable supply of pianos for the domestic market.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have one of the most difficult things to do now that I have had to do since I have served as majority leader of the Senate, and that is to announce that our beloved colleague from Georgia, PAUL COVERDELL, passed away today at approximately 6:10 p.m. in the Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, GA. PAUL has been a close friend and confidant, an outstanding Member of this body, and we will miss him greatly. 
   At the appropriate time, I will join the rest of my colleagues in trying to make appropriate remarks to pay tribute to PAUL, but for now I can't do any more than just make this announcement. I do want to say to Nancy Coverdell and the family that we extend our sympathy and our love. Our hearts are breaking also. 
   Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration; further, that the resolution be read.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I express my appreciation also once again to our Chaplain of the Senate, Lloyd John Ogilvie, and for his remembering our friend and my most trusted confidante, most reliable lieutenant, the Senator from Georgia, PAUL COVERDELL. I don't know of a Senator who works any harder or has a more indomitable spirit. I noticed particularly Friday afternoon how happy he was as he took leave of this Chamber because of the vote that we had just taken and realizing that he would have the opportunity to be home in Georgia on Friday afternoon and on Saturday. Our thoughts and our prayers are with him as he apparently undergoes a surgical procedure at this hour. I thank the Chaplain for his prayer. 
   Coincidentally, this weekend I also had a little more time than I anticipated and was able to spend some time thinking about our country and reading some books. One of those that I read was ``Going For The Max,'' by Senator MAX CLELAND, also of Georgia. It is a really inspirational book about his life and his experience as a Vietnam veteran and the recovery period he had to go through and the inspiration from things he had learned in his life--12 principles of life that he had learned and on which he relies. I talked to him this morning to tell him how much I enjoyed his book; that I was inspired by it. And he said he was at that very moment standing there looking at Piedmont Hospital where our friend, Senator COVERDELL, is, and he was saying a prayer for him. He offered to cover any meetings or appointments that needed to be done today or this week by Senator COVERDELL. 
   That is the kind of real love and appreciation and bipartisanship we need more of in this institution and in our lives. So I encourage my colleagues in the Senate, if you have not read it, get a copy of ``Going For The Max,'' and it will be an inspiration to you.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. with Senators BYRD and THOMAS in control of the time. 
   Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill, and hopefully we will be able to complete our deliberations on that bill and get to final passage on all amendments and the bill itself tomorrow morning. 
   Under the previous agreement, there are up to 10 amendments remaining to the Interior bill that must be offered and debated during today's session. Hopefully, some of those amendments will be withdrawn, others will be accepted, and maybe we will not need to have more than a couple of them actually voted on, and then go to final passage tomorrow morning. I believe those votes will be stacked in the morning at 9:45 a.m. 
   At 6:15 this evening, the Senate will begin the final 
   votes on the reconciliation bill which provides for the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. Senators should be aware that during the remainder of the afternoon on Friday, when all amendments were offered and/or debated, almost 40 potential votes could occur in regard to this legislation. 
   Again, I hope and I think that several of those amendments were just filed as a precaution and that not nearly that many will actually require a vote; some of them can be accepted. But I do expect there will be somewhere between 10 and 15, at least, that will require a recorded vote. We will try to do a major portion of those tonight, if not all of them. We may try to get a consent to finish the remainder of the votes on amendments and final passage tomorrow morning after we take a  look at exactly how many we are going to have to do, look at how many we would have to vote on tonight, how many we would have to vote on in the morning, and try to be reasonable in how we schedule those votes. But we do need to get both of them completed not later than tomorrow morning. So votes are expected into the night. We could have, I guess, conceivably 10, 15, or more votes tonight beginning at 6:15. Of course, we have stacked them and the votes will be limited to 10 minutes in length after the first vote. Senators will be encouraged to remain in the Chamber again during the votes. 
   We were able to record 10 votes in about 1 1/2 hours I think on Friday, which probably is some kind of new record. A lot of the credit for that goes to Senator HARRY REID, the assistant minority leader, because he stayed in the Chamber and helped me make sure that we wrapped those votes up as quickly as was possible. 
   This will be an important week. After we complete those two very important issues, we will need to go to the Agriculture appropriations bill which has been awaiting action in the Senate now for probably a month. Senator COCHRAN has indicated he will be ready to go tomorrow morning or right after lunch, whichever is available to him, to begin debate on this very important legislation. 
   We also would like to have the opportunity to consider the energy and water appropriations bill this week also. It is ready and should not take a lot of time. But that will depend on how long it takes on the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I see smiles throughout the Chamber, the idea that we would complete these two bills I have already mentioned and then take up two appropriations bills, but with determination we can get it done. 
   We achieved more last week than most people thought we would be able to do. It took work and it took some time and it took cooperation between leaders on both sides of the aisle. We were able to get that. I hope we can do it this week. I thank my colleagues for their participation and their cooperation. 
   With that, I will yield the floor and I observe the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tonight, as we adjourn, we do so in memory of John O. Pastore, who served the people of Rhode Island here in the Senate from 1950 to 1976. 
   Senator Pastore's life was in many ways a realization of the American dream--characterized by humble beginnings, hard work, opportunity, and accomplishment. His father was an immigrant tailor who passed away when John was a young boy. From that time on, he and his four siblings were reared by their mother, who supported the family as a seamstress. 
   Senator Pastore earned his law degree from Northeastern University, through evening classes the school offered at the Providence YMCA. The family home was his first law office. 
   Senator Pastore, was initially elected to office in 1934, when he became a Member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He subsequently served as assistant state attorney general, lieutenant governor, and in 1945 became governor when his predecessor resigned for another office. Senator Pastore was then elected to two terms in his own right. 
   In 1950, he was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill a vacant seat. Two years later, he won the first of four full terms in this institution. He never lost an election. 
   Many individuals have passed through the doors of this great chamber, and each has left a unique imprint. Senators for years to come will think of John Pastore whenever the ``Pastore rule'', relating to germaneness of debate, is invoked. 
   Senator Pastore will be remembered in the United States Senate as a servant of the people and a man committed to his beliefs.  
   Today, the thoughts and prayers of the Senate are with his family and his constituents.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield briefly, first of all, I listened carefully to the comments of the two distinguished Senators who are the ranking member and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The service of these two Members surpasses all the rest of us, with the possible exception of the President pro tempore, Senator THURMOND. But beyond that, the wisdom and the sage advice they give all of us is greatly appreciated. 
   I certainly believe and will continue to believe that we should give the highest possible priority to these appropriations bills. We have an agreement now that will lead us to the conclusion of the Interior appropriations bill, I believe next Monday. I believe the votes could possibly be on Tuesday morning. I hope before we go out for the August recess that we do at least four more or all five of the remaining bills. I know clearly we could do four of the remaining bills: Agriculture, Energy and Water, Treasury-Postal Service, and Commerce-State-Justice. There may be some difficulty with HUD-VA that would cause it to go over until September. 
   But I appreciate their comments and their good advice. I will certainly weigh that very carefully. I appreciate the fact that they are willing to take to the floor and ask for this help in getting their work done. In fact, it is our work. It is the people's business. 
   I appreciate their comments. 
   I commend and thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and also the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, for the work they did on the Department of Defense authorization bill. We got it finished. Hallelujah. The Senate has produced the final vote on one of the most important bills we will do all year, the Department of Defense authorization bill. There is a lot of important language in there. It is not only about the ships, the planes, and housing; It is also about health care. It is a big, important bill. Without the patience and the tenacity of the chairman, the Senator from Virginia, and the help he received from the Senator from Michigan, we wouldn't have it done. 
   I commend them; and, again, the senior leadership of the two Senators on the Appropriations Committee who spoke is admirable. I appreciate it very much. As a leader, you have to rely on the senior leaders, and the managers, the chairmen. In this case, I did, and they did it. 
   I thank Senator STEVENS for his comments and for yielding me this time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly want to move this along. I want to have a vote on the Moynihan substitute on the death tax, and then have a vote on our alternative. That would be the best way to proceed. We would have two votes and Senators could cast their votes accordingly, and we would move on. 
   Instead, we have an agreement that will take all day and into the night. Instead of taking 2 or 3 hours, it will wind up taking probably 10 or 12 hours. I hope on the marriage penalty tax we could vote on the alternative. Senator MOYNIHAN has a reasonable alternative. We could vote on that, vote on our alternative, and be through with the marriage penalty tax and move on to the appropriations bills. 
   We do have a matter we are working through on both sides to try to deal with the question of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, the language suggested by Senator THOMPSON. We are trying to find a way to get an agreement on the language and a way to consider that. 
   We must do the people's business. We have to do these appropriations bills. We have to do at least four appropriations bills beyond the Interior appropriations bill. When we get that done, I don't see any problem then in moving to China PNTR. I can't make days out of whole cloth, and I can't make commitments until we get our work done. But we are all working on that, I think, in good faith. 
   Senator REID worked assiduously on these appropriations bills. Energy and water we may be able to do in a day or two. Agriculture, I will be surprised if we don't have 80 or 100 amendments pop up. That bill could take a week. It is very important to our country. We all want the Agriculture appropriations bill completed. Commerce, State, and Justice--no matter what Members might think about Commerce or State or Justice, we need to get that bill done very badly. That bill quite often is like fly paper, it draws a lot of amendments. If we made a commitment, if we made up our minds on both sides of the aisle we will complete Interior and do three more appropriations or four more appropriations bills next week, we could do it. But it would take an extraordinary amount of heavy lifting to get that done. 
   I will work with Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD. It is rare for these two Senators to take the floor and say what they have said today. I have to weigh that carefully.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. This is the only way we are going to be able to get through this list. This is a good way to do it. In light of the agreement, the next votes will be in a stacked sequence at 6:30. We will try another stacked sequence of six at that time. If we can proceed on this basis, we can get this work completed at a reasonable time tonight. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senators are anxious to get an agreement on how we proceed at this point. Once again, I thank the Democratic leader for his work with us as we develop these unanimous consents. It is next to impossible to accommodate every Senator's wishes. My goal is to try to find a way to get this work completed in as reasonable a time as possible. I think this will help us get that done. 
   With regard to the legislation before the Senate, I ask consent that the time  between now and 10 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form between the two leaders, and the following amendments be debated for up to 10 minutes, equally divided, in the following order: the Kerry amendment regarding housing; Santorum regarding community renewal; Harkin on Social Security; Roth on retirement; Wellstone-Dodd on child care adoption tax credit; Bayh on long-term care, self-employed health care; Lott on ESAs, et cetera; Feingold amendment on $100 million cap; and the final motion to recommit by myself. 
   I further ask consent at 9 a.m. on Friday the Senate proceed to a series of votes in relation to the above-listed amendments in the order offered, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided for each amendment prior to each vote.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to reconciliation and the marriage penalty tax issue, there is an awful lot of interest in that matter in how we proceed tomorrow. We will have a series of stacked votes tomorrow morning, possibly as many as nine. 
   But I believe we can get through it in a reasonably short period of time--hopefully 2 hours. If Senators will come to the floor for the first vote and stay on the floor, we can move much more quickly and we will be able to be completed with that series, I hope, by 11 o'clock, on the marriage penalty.

   I further ask consent that the votes ordered with respect to the amendments occur in a stacked sequence beginning at 6:15 p.m. on Monday, July 17, with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, if it is requested of course, and all votes after the first vote in the sequence be limited to 10 minutes each.

   Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement then, Mr. President, there will be no further votes tonight. The next votes will occur at 9 a.m. on Friday in stacked sequence, with 9 or 10 back-to-back votes that could be required. I hope Senators will 
   consider the possibility of not offering their amendments or agreeing to a voice vote, if there is any way possible to accommodate other Senators, so the sequence won't go on longer than a couple of hours. 
   Following those stacked votes on Friday, Members who have amendments to reconciliation and marriage penalty tax will have to stay around to offer and debate them. It can take up  to as long as 20 hours. Senators who have amendments on these lists, if they want to offer them, need to be here to offer them and they need to make their case because there will not be an opportunity, other than the 2 minutes equally divided, to talk about the specifics on Monday night. So these votes will be stacked in sequence at 6:15 on Monday, July 17. 
   I thank again all my colleagues for their cooperation. I know this does not meet everybody's scheduling desires. I had actually hoped to be able to finish the marriage penalty tax tomorrow night or Saturday, but this agreement allows us to get it done, I think, in an efficient way, have it completed on Monday night, complete the Interior appropriations bill on Tuesday morning, and be prepared to go to the next appropriations bill after that. 
   I thank all Senators for their willingness to help us work through this. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to H.R. 8 at the conclusion of morning votes on Thursday and it be considered under the following agreement: 
   That there be up to 10 amendments for each leader, with one of the 10 amendments for the minority leader described as the ``Democratic alternative''; 
   That no more than 20 amendments be in order, they be first-degree amendments only and limited to 40 minutes equally divided in the usual form, with the exception of the Democratic alternative, which would be limited to 2 hours equally divided, and an additional 90 minutes for each leader to be used at their discretion. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   I finally ask unanimous consent that either leader be able to make this agreement null and void at any time during the consideration of this bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this has been very delicately developed with a lot of careful consideration and very aggressive work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I know Senator DASCHLE has Senators who have tax amendments they would like to offer. 
   I should emphasis that this is not the last effort to try to make our Tax Code fairer this year. We will have the reconciliation bill that will involve marriage penalty tax elimination, and obviously tax amendments would be offered in that area. We still have legislation that would eliminate the Spanish American telephone tax, which we probably can't get to until the first of September. But it is something we should eliminate. Obviously, there will be an opportunity for additional tax-related amendments to be offered to these two. 
   There may be a number of amendments on both sides that Senators would like to offer that maybe cannot be included in this type of agreement. But this is not the last train out of Dodge, thank goodness. We will have other opportunities to develop a fairer Tax Code, and Senators will have an opportunity on both sides to offer amendments. 
   I thank Senator DASCHLE for his effort. I did not want us to just get to a cloture vote which might or might not pass. But if it failed, we would get no result. 
   I think the death tax needs to be eliminated. It needs to be phased out. There may be some modifications in the bill as we go forward. But a result is what we should always seek for the American people--not just a show vote. This could get us to that point. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:15. Following morning business, a cloture vote will occur on the motion to proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act.

   I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 10:15 this morning.

   Mr. LOTT. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will continue postcloture debate on the motion to proceed. The Senate may also resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill in an effort to make further progress on that important piece of legislation. It is the intention of the managers of the Interior appropriations bill to lock up a filing deadline for first-degree amendments during today's session. 
   Senators should expect votes each day this week. Also, we will have late nights to have debate on amendments on the Defense authorization bill with votes on amendments, if necessary, occurring the following morning. I have been assured by the managers of that legislation, Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN, that we will be working tonight and we probably will have some votes the first thing in the morning on the bill. 
   I regret that we have to have a vote on the motion to proceed. A good faith effort has been made to work out an agreement on a limited number of amendments, but we have not been able to come to an agreement on that. 
   It is important that we get to the substance of this legislation--the elimination of the death tax. It is high time we take action on this unfortunate tax provision that has been on the tax rolls since Theodore Roosevelt was President. I know from personal experience that it is having a very devastating effect on small businesses, family farms, and homesteads. I have come across members of families in tears in my own State on finding they had to sell their small business or their farm that has been in the family sometimes for two or three generations because they had to pay this most unfair death tax. 
   Many commentators seem perplexed, trying to understand why this legislation would have received such overwhelming support in the House of Representatives with an almost unanimous vote among the Republicans and 65 Democrats, from all regions, backgrounds, races, sex, and everything else. They can't understand why it got this very outstanding vote. 
   The answer is really very simple. First of all, all of us would like to be able to have an estate of some value when we reach the end of our role. We would like to be able to pass it on to our children for the next generation. The idea that the Federal Government would come and reach into the grave and pull back 40, 45, 50, or 55 percent of a life's work offends the American people regardless of financial status. It is a basically and patently unfair tax provision. 
   I am pleased we are going to move forward this week to get a vote. Of course, we will have to have a vote on cloture so that there won't be an extended series of unrelated, nongermane amendments or filibusters. But I hope we will get that vote. Then we will get to final vote on the substance. It is long overdue. 
   I commend the chairman of the committee, Chairman ROTH, and the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, for allowing this legislation to come to the floor today for a vote. Also, again I must express my admiration for the way the House handled this matter. 
   I understand there will be a period for morning business. Senators are here prepared to speak on the substance of the legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

I still hope that while we have had debate on both sides today, for the most part on the death tax issue, we would still be able to keep our verbal commitment to Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN that not later than 7 o'clock tonight we will go to the DOD authorization bill and see if we can make some progress on that. 
   Again, I appreciate the Senator for allowing me to interrupt him to get a clarification on that. I thank the Senator.

I further ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered with respect to the amendments offered and debated tonight occur beginning at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, with no second-degree amendments in order, where applicable, and 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, and that there be 2 hours prior to the 11:30 a.m. votes to be equally divided prior to proceeding to H.R. 8. 
   To sum up, we would complete the remaining debate time between now and 6:30 on the death tax issue. Then we would go to the Department of Defense authorization bill for debate on amendments tonight. Those votes on amendments, if any are required, would occur at 11:30. 
   When we come in at 9:30 tomorrow, we would have 2 more hours for debate time on the estate tax/death tax issue with no second degrees in order, and there will be 2 minutes prior to each recorded vote at 11:30, prior to the vote.

   Since the 1960's, the Senate has recognized those members who preside over the Senate for 100 hours with the Golden Gavel. This award continues to represent our appreciation for the time these dedicated Senators contribute to presiding over the U.S. Senate--a privileged and important duty. 
   On behalf of the Senate, I extend our sincere appreciation to Senator FITZGERALD for presiding during the 106th Congress.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately begin consideration of H.R. 4578, the Interior appropriations bill. I see that the chairman of the subcommittee is here and ready to proceed. Opening statements will be made and amendments are expected to be offered during today's session. 
   At 3:30 today, however, it will be my intention to turn to the executive nomination of Madelyn Creedon to be Deputy Administrator of the National Security Administration. This was included in an earlier agreement, that we would complete debate and have a vote on this nomination prior to Wednesday of this week. I thought it was best we do it today. The vote will occur on her confirmation at 5:30 p.m. today. 
   During the Senate's consideration of the Interior bill, those Senators who have amendments should work with the bill managers in an effort to complete action on the bill as soon as possible. I commend the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior for the work they have done on this legislation. Many areas could have been added that would have been controversial and would have made it difficult to complete the bill. They were not included. I hope, therefore, that in a relatively short period of time we can complete action on this very important Interior appropriations bill. 
   Members should be on notice that it will be the leadership's intent to debate amendments to the DOD authorization bill during the evening sessions this week. That was agreed to before we went out for the Fourth of July recess. There was a unanimous consent agreement entered into that limits Senators to relevant amendments to the Department of Defense authorization bill. I believe all amendments had to be 
   filed by the close of business that day, which was Friday of the week before last. Any amendment votes ordered during the DOD authorization bill will be postponed to occur the next morning. We are hoping we can proceed under that agreement so that Monday night, Tuesday night, and Wednesday night, if necessary, we can go to the Department of Defense authorization bill around 6:30 or 7 o'clock each night so we can complete action on this very important bill. 
   I emphasize again that this Department of Defense authorization bill has been pending in one form or another before the Senate for quite some time. A number of nongermane amendments were offered and voted on that are connected to this bill. They have been dealt with in one way or another now. We are ready to complete action on the underlying Defense authorization bill itself. It has a lot of very important items for the future of our military. Included among those are significant improvements in the health care provisions for our military men and women and their families and for our retirees and their families. This is important legislation. Hopefully, we can complete it under this procedure of taking up amendments each night and having votes at the beginning of the session the next morning. 
   As a remainder, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to the death tax legislation prior to the July recess. Pursuant to rule XXI, that cloture vote will occur 1 hour after the Senate convenes tomorrow, unless an agreement is reached where we don't have to have a recorded vote on the motion to proceed, that we can pass that by voice vote and move straight to the bill itself. We haven't worked that out yet. That is always a possibility. Otherwise, though, we will have that vote 1 hour after we come in on Tuesday morning. 
   The Senate is expected to return to the reconciliation bill, which has a statutory time limitation of 20 hours, the latter part of this week. Of course, that is the reconciliation bill for the marriage penalty tax relief. Votes will occur each day of the Senate's session, with late nights and possibly a late Friday or Saturday session in order to complete the reconciliation bill. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. I emphasize that point again. It is our hope to go to the reconciliation bill on the marriage penalty tax Thursday, and complete action on that bill before the end of the session this  week. Since we could take up to 20 hours under the reconciliation provisions--and of course amendments at the end of that process don't count against the 20 hours--we could very easily go into the afternoon on Friday, Friday night, or Saturday. I hope Members are aware of that and prepare their schedule accordingly. 
   Since we only have 3 weeks before we recess for the August period for the national conventions, I think it is safe to say we will be having votes throughout the day, and we will have votes on Monday and Fridays for the 3 weeks we have remaining. We have a lot of work to do. I appreciate the support and cooperation of all Senators. 
   I hope Members had a good Fourth of July recess period in the Nation's Capital or back home with constituents. We are prepared to work hard and get a lot of the people's business done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to Senator KENNEDY's question, first of all, I, too, would very much like to see us complete the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The committee did very good work on that legislation. The Senate spent a week, over a week perhaps, having amendments offered and voted on. 
   With regard to the underlying Elementary and Secondary Education Act and other nongermane amendments that were offered, that delayed our ability to complete that legislation. But I feel very strongly about getting it done. I am very pleased with the condition the bill is in. I think it might be a good idea that we workout an arrangement on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for next week, perhaps similar to what we have done with the DOD authorization bill, hoping to work on that bill tonight and having votes on amendments, if any are ordered, in the morning; the same thing tomorrow night with votes occurring the next morning. We could do the same thing on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   But there is a key thing here. On the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, some nongermane amendments were offered delaying our ability to complete our work on that, and some that were germane. But we reached a point where we needed to try to find an agreement to complete our work. 
   After being abused severely by both sides of the aisle, perhaps, depending on your point of view--the Defense authorization bill had all kinds of nongermane amendments offered to it--after a period of time, there was an agreement that we needed to see if we could complete action on this very important Department of Defense authorization bill; it provides very important changes in the law, things that cannot be done just with the Defense appropriations bill, including improvements in the health care benefits for our military men and women and their families, and our retirees. We have to do this bill to get it done. 
   Therefore, under the persistent leadership of the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan, the managers, we came to an agreement last week, a unanimous consent agreement, that nongermane amendments would not be offered any longer and all amendments had to be offered by the close of business Friday. 
   While they have a long list of amendments they have to work through, I am satisfied they can get it done now that they are focused on amendments related to the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
   I would be glad to pursue a similar type arrangement with the Democratic leadership, with Senator KENNEDY involved, where we could maybe get a list of amendments by the close of business Friday, work on the bill at night but limit it to germane amendments that could be debated and voted on and complete action, hopefully, in a relatively reasonable period of time.

   Mr. LOTT. As I say, we will work with the Democratic leadership and see if we can work out an agreement similar to the one we have on the Department of Defense authorization bill.  
   Let me make it clear. Being the son of a schoolteacher--in public schools, I might add--I know the importance of safety. I also know the importance of discipline because I have been the beneficiary of discipline from my mother, the schoolteacher. 
   I also know Americans all over this country, in every State, would like to have our schools be safe and drug free. So the idea that we would have metal detector devices where that is called for in certain schools, and where we would have other efforts to make sure the schools are safer, that is something, certainly, we should all work toward. Hopefully, we could do that when we take up the legislation. 
   I understand there was a suggestion earlier that there had been some delay in calling up the legislation referred to generally as H-1B legislation, that is, S. 2045, which would allow for certain high-tech workers to come into the country on a limited basis and for a limited period of time, and that, for some reason, had not been called up because of something that we had not been doing. 
   Let me emphasize that I want this legislation to be considered. I would like us to move it as quickly as possible. The problem we got into earlier when we were trying to work out an agreement was we were told there would have to be numerous amendments--I don't know, six or eight amendments, that were nongermane that would be in order for us to consider this very important legislation that I think has bipartisan support and that many people in this country, in business and industry and high tech, say addresses a major problem because the number that is allowed is now being reached and we need this legislation. I want to make it very clear we are not only willing to move it; we are anxious.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I did ask consent, as a matter of fact. That is what the reservation is on: that we go to this bill, and we pass this bill tonight. 
   I might also add, earlier I asked consent that we go to the bill and that there be five relevant amendments on each side of the aisle, that second-degree amendments be in order, which would have brought it to 20 amendments, and that was objected to on the Democratic side of the aisle. Even the idea of 10 amendments with second-degree amendments in order was objected to. 
   First of all, I assume this is not controversial. I assume it has broad support on both sides of the aisle. I assume it is something the Senate wants to get done. That is all I am trying to do. I heard today the Democratic leaders saying they want to do this bill; that we were holding it up. I am trying to find a way to move it. Let me emphasize this, too. 
   Some people say: Why don't you just call it up and let it go the way Senators would like to handle it, amendments and everything else. 
   Here is what we have to do this week alone: The Interior appropriations bill; we are going to be doing the Defense authorization bill at night; we are going to have a procedure to 
   finally eliminate the death tax; we are going to have a procedure to get a vote on eliminating the marriage penalty tax. That is all this week. 
   Also along the way, we are going to try to get an agreement to take up the Thompson nonproliferation language with regard to China so that we can find a time to go to the China PNTR bill. We also have to do the Agriculture appropriations bill, the energy and water appropriations bill, Housing and Urban Development and Veterans appropriations bill, the Commerce- State-Justice appropriations bill, and the DC appropriations bill. 
   We should do all of those before we recess for the August recess. We have done six so far, and that has been with a lot of cooperation on both sides and a lot of pushing and pleading because every time an appropriations bill is offered, 100 amendments appear. On the Defense authorization bill, I think there are 200 amendments. 
   As far as this job of trying to coordinate all these different interests being a problem, I do not view it that way. It is just we have to have some reasonable understanding of how we are going to proceed to get four major bills done this week, to get five more appropriations bills done before the August recess, to get the Thompson nonproliferation language considered, and to get the China PNTR legislation considered as soon as possible. 
   We would like to find a way to work in among that, maybe at night, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I would love to pass that legislation just as it is or even after some more amendments, but we have to find  a time. We can do that at night. We can work day and night for the next 3 weeks. 
   I would like to do the H-1B. I tried to offer an agreement that could have led to 20 amendments. That was objected to on the other side. I am trying to find a way to get all these good things done. I will continue to try and hopefully we will be able to work out an agreement to consider them all. These appropriations bills are high priority. That is the people's business. 
   If we do not get the appropriations bills done, Housing and Urban Development is going to have a problem with housing in which they are involved. The energy and water appropriations bill has a lot of very important energy-and-water-related issues. Certainly both sides of the aisle would like to see us get to the Agriculture appropriations bill at the earliest possible date, hopefully next Tuesday at the latest. Those are all the things we have to do. 
   I want to make sure--I am willing to go to H-1B right away, pass it or to get some agreement that will not take 3, 4 days on one bill in among all these other urgent bills we have to do.

   Mr. LOTT. So the record will be clear, I am trying hard to find a way to get this considered. I won't insist on my unanimous consent request, but since we are working night and day and looking for ways to get these things done, if you are down to seven, if you can get it down to five relevant amendments, and we can continue to work on this, maybe this would be a bill we could do at night the third week, 
   but we are willing to see if we can find a way to get it done.

Thursday night is not likely. So then you might have to look at next Monday night for the third night, if a third night in fact is used. 
   There is a possibility we will reach a moment of lull or we will see an hour or two coming sometime during the day, and we will call quickly and ask for the managers to come over and do some of their work.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have talked a great deal about the need to find a way to consider the China trade bill and also to consider the problem of China nuclear weapons proliferation. Senator THOMPSON has done a lot of work in this area, as have others. He has a bill that he would like to have considered and has agreed for it to be considered freestanding, separate from the China PNTR legislation, and that he would not feel a need--if I could speak for him just momentarily--to offer it as an amendment to the China bill, if we can get it considered freestanding. 
   So we have worked through that. I have discussed this with a number of interested parties, including Senator DASCHLE, and other members on both sides of the aisle. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, July 10, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the minority leader, that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 583, S. 2645, the China Nonproliferation Act. I further ask consent that the bill be limited to relevant amendments. I finally ask consent that not later than 12:30 on Tuesday, July 11, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate. 
   Before the Chair rules, I would like to announce that it is my intention, as I have reiterated to the Armed Services Committee, that I will give them the opportunity to consider and, hopefully, conclude the DOD authorization bill. In fact, I am going to try to do a unanimous consent request on that next. We will try to get that Department of Defense authorization bill done--a very important bill--before the August recess. 
   We are now working on a consent that was outlined last night by the chairman and ranking member. It is my hope that we could get an agreement on that time. If there is a problem with it, we will continue to work to find an agreement where we can remove the nongermane amendments, deal with the Defense amendments, and complete that very important legislation. 
   So that is my request that I propound at this time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will continue to work with both sides of the aisle to see if this matter can be dealt with in an acceptable way, aside from it being offered as an amendment to the China PNTR bill. I think that would be potentially a large problem because if it were adopted, certainly then that legislation would have to go back to the House, and there is a lot of concern about that. 
   As far as a time to consider the major bill, the China PNTR, this is an important part of the process in a move in that direction. And until we get this resolved, then it is going to be very hard to focus on exactly what date we could get a vote on the bill. 
   I must also add that it is true we have a lot of important work to do in July. We have to deal with the very unfair death penalty. We have to deal with eliminating the marriage penalty tax. We have to pass the agriculture appropriations bill. We have to pass the Interior appropriations bill. We have to pass the Housing and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. We have to pass the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. We have to pass the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. We have a lot of work to do, and none of it is insignificant. 
   The people's business needs to be taken care of. This is just a part of that process. But I understand the Senator's objection. We will keep working to see if we can find a time and a way to do it.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could turn to the military construction appropriations conference report, that is a very good bill that passed way back in May, I think it was May 18. This important military construction conference report passed the Senate under the leadership of Senator CONRAD BURNS, but from the very beginning, it was a bill that did have some emergency provisions attached to it. We did have the funds for the costs, the money that has been already spent for the defense for Kosovo, and some additional funds for costs associated with that. 
   Over a period now of almost 6 weeks, there has been a process underway between the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle to get an agreement on this conference report that included a title II that had the emergency funds for the Kosovo situation, for the Colombia drug war, and also for emergencies associated with Hurricane Floyd, the fires, and other issues. 
   During the process of the conference, other issues were added. Some issues that were in were taken out. That is the way a conference works. I must confess that I didn't get a look at the final product myself until this morning. I think we actually had access to it last night. We did get access to it. Senators had an opportunity to review that. If points of order need to be made, they can be made. But this is for military construction and for emergencies. We need to get this done. It is already late. There are a lot of people, there are a lot of different reasons for how that happened, but here we are. As majority leader, I have a responsibility to try to bring it to a conclusion and take whatever time that requires. 
   I will shortly ask unanimous consent that the military construction appropriations conference report come up. I need to inform all Members that if the agreement is not agreed to or a similar version to this that can--if we cannot come up with something that could be entered into by the full Senate, then it would be my intention to call up the conference report and Senators MCCAIN and GRAMM will ask, as I understand it, that it be read. If that is done, it would take some 6 hours, I am told by the staff, to read the conference report. I still hope we can avoid that. If there are problems with the conference report, let's talk about it. If points of order are going to be made, let's do them. We will have time to understand exactly what is in the bill. 
   I am sure we will hear from Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD and others who are familiar with the details. That is what it is all about. I realize it is Friday afternoon, but Members have been told for weeks that we would be in session on this Friday and would be having votes. 
   This is an important vote. All we can do is try to come up with a way that we can have a good debate, but if there is objection to proceeding and insistence that it be read, then we will have to do that. After that there could be a series of votes on points of order and hopefully on final passage. 
   I want to outline the situation as it now stands. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the conference report and it be considered as having been read. I further ask unanimous consent that following 10 minutes for debate between the two managers, and the chairman and ranking member, Senator GRAMM be recognized to raise a point of order. I further ask unanimous consent Senators STEVENS and BYRD be immediately recognized to make a motion to waive and, following 10 minutes equally divided on the motion to waive, the Senate proceed to a 
   vote on that motion with or without any intervening action or debate. By the way, if we need more time  for debate, I would be glad to accommodate that. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that if the motion to waive is agreed to, the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on the conference report without any intervening action, motion, or debate.

I am genuinely concerned about that. If we have to read this bill, I would like to urge the Senator to stay here; I will go see Mrs. GRAMM. That is the corner of First and C Streets, I believe? I will meet her, and I will provide her with a very lovely lunch in the Senate dining room.

   Mr. LOTT. I have two things. There is one clarification I wish to make on what Senator GRAMM said. If one of the points of order should be sustained, or if a major one was made and sustained, we would not necessarily have to continue this. This bill then would go back to the House when they return. They would have to take it up and consider it further. I realize there may be multiple points of order. If one were sustained, there might be others. 
   Look, I understand what Senator GRAMM is saying. I certainly feel very strongly that our budget process should be protected and, if it is violated, there should be an opportunity to address those points of order. I have no problem with that. All I say is I think to read the bill doesn't help anybody's cause. I think we would be better off if we get into a discussion and talk about what is in the bill. 
   So, again, I am sympathetic with all sides concerned, and I would like to get out from the middle of the crossfire of the ammunition being employed here. At this point, since there is objection, I have no----

   I, too, commend Senator BURNS from Montana, the chairman of the Appropriations Military Construction Subcommittee, and his ranking member, Senator MURRAY of Washington State, for their work on this legislation. It is important. It has a lot of projects that are very important for our defense and the underlying military construction appropriations bill. I also extended to them my sympathy and appreciation for the fact that their bill had to carry a title II which brought a lot of emergency legislation, but it needed to be done. Their bill became the catalyst to move this emergency legislation through. It was not easy for them to have to deal with all the conflicting problems not in their jurisdiction. I thank them for what they did on this legislation. 
   I thank Senator GRAMM, Senator MCCAIN, Senator STEVENS, and Senator BYRD for their usual brilliance and innovation. What looked like 6 hours of readings, multiple votes on points of order, and a contested final passage sometime tonight, Saturday, or Sunday, was resolved in a matter of minutes. It is a miracle. 
   I know there will be objections to various parts and a lot of speeches will be made. That is great. There will be time for that later. I appreciate the help of Senator DASCHLE and all involved. We needed this bill. We needed this emergency legislation. 
   Senator STEVENS did the right thing. I thank him. I wanted to express my appreciation to all.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator DASCHLE and I have been discussing this matter in the hope that we could work out an agreement as to how we could proceed. We had discussed the possibility of certainly a substitute being in order on the estate tax legislation. I 
    believe the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, had a substitute, or others, perhaps, joining with him would have a substitute, and other related or germane amendments to that issue. We even offered the possibility of having two nongermane amendments on each side. 
   Our problem gets to be when you go to five or six--I don't know how many were included in that list. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-3-20000630</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Plus, if you have a substitute and then you have, let's just say, one or two related germane amendments, then you have five amendments on each side--that is 10 amendments--and even if we got a time agreement, you are talking about 12, or more, or 14 hours, which would be a minimum of 2 days. 
   The problem we have in July is that we now have completed six appropriations bills, meaning there are still seven we have to get done. 
   I hope that, at a minimum, we get five or six more done in July because they are very important bills that need to get completed so they can get in conference with the House, so they can be sent to the President, so hopefully he can sign them. 
   We are talking about Agriculture; Interior; Housing and Urban Development; Treasury-Postal Service; Commerce-State-Justice--these are big, important appropriations bills. We have all those we have to do in July--a 3-week period--plus we have to do the marriage penalty tax elimination. 
   I think there is an overwhelming desire to get that done, on both sides of the aisle, although we still disagree on how to get it done. But the Finance Committee has reported that out in a reconciliation bill. And there is a desire to do the China PNTR. 
   I know we don't have the time to set aside 2 whole days in the midst of all that for the death tax. If we could just agree to a substitute and germane amendments--this is a bill that passed the House overwhelmingly. Sixty-five Democrats voted for it. Members in the House, regardless of region or race or sex, voted for it. Why does the Senate need to get into all these other nonrelated matters? 
   But I understand there are Senators on the Democratic side who wish to have a debate and votes on these other matters. I believe they will probably have an opportunity to come up on other bills before the session is out. But that is why I object at this time.

   After the good work that has been done, in a bipartisan way, this past week, and after having participated in the effort that was just made to complete action on the military construction appropriations conference report, it has restored my faith that anything is possible in the Senate. I hope we can continue to work to find a way to resolve this and get it considered other than through the cloture process. I am going to hold out hope until the very last minute that we can get that done. 
   So we will continue to work. Our staffs have been exchanging proposals, and we will continue to do that right up until the time we need to begin voting, which would be, I guess, Tuesday or Wednesday of the week we return. 
   Under my reservation, I yield to the Senator from Montana.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so nobody will get nervous, I want to talk about the schedule. I am working with Senator REID on a couple unanimous consent requests that we may offer later. But I wanted to talk about the progress being made and what our hopes are. 
   I realize this is a very big, very important bill--the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. It is important we get it done, and it is important we have a few minutes to think through critical amendments that are offered. We are in that process. I thank the managers for what they have been doing. I urge them to keep pushing forward. The number of amendments has been substantially reduced. The ones still pending are not easy amendments. But I think if we can keep focused, we can complete this very important appropriations bill at a reasonable hour today. 
   I urge my colleagues, when they have an amendment, when there is an amendment on both sides, that we find a way to accept them both or get a vote on both of them and let the Senate speak its will and then move on. I think that would be the best way to do it. 
   What I really want to comment on today about this bill, and others, is that there are Senators thinking we are going to finish tonight and there won't be votes tomorrow. Senator DASCHLE and I have been indicating for quite some time now that that is not going to happen. We have to complete this bill. I still would like to go to the Interior appropriations bill. But we also have a very important military construction appropriations bill with a title II that involves emergencies. That has to be completed and considered by the House Rules Committee, the House has to vote, and then it comes over here. That could be late this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow or later. If there are complications, it could take more time than that. 
   I assure everybody that we are going to be in session and voting tomorrow. I think that hoping we can wave a magic wand and miraculously complete this bill and the other measures by a reasonable time tonight is just not likely. 
   I wanted to say that now. Those who have planes booked for 10 o'clock tonight or 10 o'clock in the morning, you better start making other arrangements, unless you are willing to miss votes. Quite often, some Senators think that if enough of us leave, there won't be votes. That is not going to be the case this time. This work is too important. I urge my colleagues to help us get this very important work done in this critical week.

   Mr. LOTT. Obviously, the Senator from Nevada is correct. We do allow these votes to drag on too long, and we should be prepared to cut them off after the 15 minutes and the 5-minute overtime. On both sides we try to be understanding, but the more we are understanding, the more it is abused by our colleagues. So, for today, I will work with Democrats and Republicans and be prepared to cut these votes off. It could save us a lot of time. 
   Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, we would not be making the progress we have made on this and other bills without his diligence, his presence on the floor, and the hard work he does. I appreciate that. Last night, even though I was disturbed about the timing because of commitments that have been made, we worked that out and we got a lot of good work done last night. I thank those who were involved.

   Mr. LOTT. I have a unanimous consent request I would like to propound now. I believe the Senators involved in this are on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the consideration of the NCAA gambling bill, S. 2340, and following the reporting of the bill by the clerk, the committee amendments be immediately agreed to. 
   I further ask consent that there be 4 hours of debate on the bill, to be equally divided in the usual form, and only relevant amendments be in order during the pendency of the bill. 
   Finally, I ask consent that following the conclusion of the time and the disposition of any amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   I know Senator REID will want to make some comments. This is an issue that has been pending for some time. We have tried to find a way to have it as an amendment on other bills. I know Senator BROWNBACK has been diligent and also very much interested in this matter, as are other Senators, including Senator MCCAIN. 
   Senator REID has indicated he would like to work with us on it. But I will let him speak for himself. 
   Part of what I am doing here is this: I made a commitment to the sponsors to try to find a way to consider this on some bill, or freestanding at some  point. In order to complete work on the Department of Defense authorization bill, now that we have worked through the disclosure issue, this issue is one we also need to find a way to address. That is why I am asking for this consent. 
   Mr. President, I submit that unanimous consent request.

   These were the last two votes of the night. We want to complete the offering and debating of the remaining amendments that have been requested tonight, and then we will have those votes stacked beginning at 9:30 a.m., which is a little different from the time earlier mentioned.

   I renew the unanimous consent request regarding the Labor-HHS bill which now includes possible votes tomorrow, Friday morning, beginning at the amended time, 9:30 a.m., relative to the following issues: a Wellstone amendment regarding drug pricing; a Helms amendment regarding school facilities; a Harkin amendment regarding IDEA; a Baucus amendment regarding impact aid; any amendment that is not cleared within the managers' package; disposition of the point of order; and final passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond to the comments, first, I want to make very clear I feel strongly we should try to find a way to pass this very important Department of Defense authorization bill. It has a lot of provisions in it, changes in the law we have to get done. We need to do this for our national security and for our men and women who serve in our military. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I have talked about the fact we want to work together to move it forward. That is one of the many reasons we tried to find a way to conclude the disclosure requirements of the section 527 issue. We have achieved that. That is why I have been working with Senator BROWNBACK to find a way to deal with an issue that is very important to him, NCAA gaming. We want to get it done. 
   What I had in mind was for the managers to continue to work and clear as many amendments as they can, and the week we come back--again, I have not discussed the details of this with Senator DASCHLE, so I will not agree to anything without us both having a chance to check on both sides and clear it. But I was thinking in terms of asking the managers, who have done yeoman's work, to be prepared to work on Monday night, Tuesday night, or Wednesday night while we do other issues during the day. I am hoping one night will do the job but work a couple or three nights and complete this bill the week we come back. We are glad to work with them toward that goal. We want to get this bill in conference. I think Senator DASCHLE wants to help with that effort.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think it is only fair to say to the Members that we are going to try to enforce the more limited time on these votes. I know we try to accommodate Senators on both sides when they get delayed because of elevators or the subway or whatever. But it is also unfair to the managers and people trying to do the bill, when we are all here, if we can't do the votes in the prescribed time. We will push for that. 
   Secondly, I commend the managers for trying to begin to make some progress. We have had a whole series of votes here in this grouping--four, I guess. But we still have an awful lot of pending amendments. I don't want to mention a number because it is too scary. 
   I can't complain about the Democratic side because there are almost as many amendments on the Republican side. When Members are asked to come and either work out their amendments or offer them, they are too busy to get it done. We need to get this Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill done tonight. In order to do that, it is going to take an awful lot of work. The managers, or the whips, HARRY REID and DON NICKLES, can't do it by themselves. Some are beginning to say how about Thursday night. When we get Labor-HHS appropriations done, we are going to the Interior appropriations bill, plus we have the military construction conference report with the emergency provisions, providing funds that we have been wanting to get completed for defense and for disasters and  for Colombia. We may not get that until late Thursday night, so that we can't vote on it until 
   Friday. We will have other votes on Friday. So we have to complete this bill, the Interior appropriations bill, and the MILCON conference report. 
   I thank Senator DASCHLE for his work in that effort and for his support as we try to complete this work. I know it is a lot to do in 3 days, but I know we can do it if we really stick with it.

   We have an agreement that I believe will satisfy all the Senators involved. 
   The Smith amendment will be modified with changes that are at the desk. Then it will be in order for Senators HATCH and LEAHY to offer a second-degree amendment to the pending McCain amendment No. 3610. I believe Senator SPECTER will be prepared to do that on behalf of Senator HATCH. Then there will be 10 minutes equally divided for debate relative to the first- and second-degree amendments. I believe that will be McCain and Hatch. Then we will ask the amendments be laid aside, and the Santorum amendment will recur, with the time between that time, which will be about 6:30 p.m., I presume, and 7 o'clock to be equally divided between the Senators who are interested--Senator MCCAIN and Senator SANTORUM--and we will have two voice votes on the Smith issue and then two votes back to back on McCain and then Santorum. 
   That is the outline of what we will do. We will have two recorded votes then at 7 o'clock. I am prepared to offer that unanimous consent request at this time. 
   I will read the unanimous consent request. I believe Senator SMITH will be here in a moment.

I further ask unanimous consent that the amendments then be laid aside and that the Santorum amendment recur, with the time between then and 7 p.m. equally divided, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote in relation to that amendment. 
   I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Hatch-Leahy second-degree amendment at 7 p.m. this evening, and following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the McCain amendment, as amended, if amended, to be followed by a vote relative to the Santorum amendment, with 4 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this very important legislation, the foreign operations appropriations bill. It has a lot of important provisions in it, funds that are critical to our foreign policy. We did have two very significant votes with regard to the Colombian aid. I think probably some Members were surprised by the show of support, with 89 votes against cutting the funds in one instance and maybe 79 in the other instance. 
   This has been good work. It did take patience by the managers and some cooperation on both sides of the aisle. We were able to get it done in a very short period of time. I thank all concerned for their good work. I hope we can continue that and make real progress on the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill this week. After the work we have already done, I think we can show we are doing the people's business. 
   I commend Senator MCCONNELL and I commend Senator LEAHY for being willing to stay here last night and suggest we were going to have more votes last night. That helped get this done. I thank the Senators.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly understand that the Senator would want to consider the situation, where we are, and consult with a number of Senators. In fact, we need to do the same thing on our side. 
   I ask my colleagues on the Democratic side to see if we can't come to an agreement that is suitable on both sides of the aisle with regard to the amount of time and that we get a direct vote on this very important issue of ergonomics. It is germane to this Department of Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill. 
   We have had a good working relationship together over the past 2 weeks. There is no question we couldn't have made the progress on the appropriations bills if we hadn't had diligent work on the Republican side and a lot of cooperation on the Democratic side including, specifically, the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, and the whip and assistant leader, HARRY REID. All have done good work. 
   I worry now that we are into a situation where we have an amendment that Members feel very strongly about, that is going to have dramatic impact on business and industry in this country, which is germane, and that we are being told we can't give you a time agreement, we are not going to give you a direct vote. 
   We have had direct votes over the past couple of weeks on the Patients' Bill of Rights issue, on hate crimes, on gun violence, on the Cuba commission, on abortion issues, on education class size--even though on some of the issues we would have preferred not to have voted or voted not on them with regard to that particular bill. It would also include, of course, the disclosure issue, which we think is a good issue, which should get voted on, but it was a problem being offered on the Defense authorization bill. 
   We were able to work through that. We got a reasonable agreement. We got a direct vote, and we moved on. 
   I have already talked with Senator DASCHLE. We are looking for a reasonable way to get this done. I hope we can find it because this is one of the biggest and one of the most important bills the Senate will consider this year. It is the funds for education, for the National Institutes of Health, for the Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor. 
   I would hate for it to stop at this point. We can make progress this afternoon. We can make progress on Friday. We can make progress on Monday. We could be having votes. With a little focus, maybe we can even finish this bill by Tuesday night or Wednesday. That is what I want to see happen, but we need to get it done and then go on to the Interior appropriations bill, a bill that also is very important and a bill, by the way, Senator GORTON has worked very hard to keep off controversial issues. The so-called rule XVI points will be objected to. 
   I urge Senator REID and my friend, Senator DASCHLE, to think about this. This is not the end of the trail, but we can have a vote on this important germane amendment, and then we can move on to other amendments and get our work done. I know we will be working together in the next few hours to see what we can come up with. I yield the floor.

We are working on both sides of the aisle to make sure Senators are aware of what we are proposing. If we are able to get that agreement, there would be a couple of votes stacked in an hour or so. If we cannot get it agreed to, then there will be a vote here in the next 15 minutes. 
   I am sorry I cannot give a more certain answer right now. We hope to have some agreement in the next few minutes. We will then put in that unanimous consent request and proceed to have some debate agreed to and the two votes, or go straight to the point of order on the pending motion.

</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-5-20000621</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his explanation. 
   At this time, rather than just speaking against his amendment, I will speak for what is in the foreign operations appropriations bill for the Colombia aid package. As a matter of fact, the Senate version has over $900 million in this area. The House bill actually included around $1.7 billion because the House included not only funds for the drug war in Colombia--I believe they also provided more than what had been asked for by the administration--they also provided some aid for other countries in the area that are also having some difficulty in fighting the drug situation in that part of the world. 
   Let me emphasize that we have been very much involved, obviously, in being supportive of bringing about a peaceful solution in Kosovo. It has been, of course, debated what should be done there, if we should do what we have done there, and how much should be spent there. The administration has pursued the policy there and the Congress has gone along with it, for better or for worse, at a cost of billions of dollars. 
   I point out on this map the area we are talking about. Kosovo is in this area of the world. It is very important to Europe and to our allies in Europe. I have suggested to our allies--NATO, Germany, Britain and other countries--they should assume more of the responsibility there, not less. I have been very concerned they have not met their responsibilities. Until just very recently, they seemed to be doing a better job of providing the money and the people they committed. 
   My point is while this is important, it is not nearly as close and as directly involved in the U.S. national security as the situation in Colombia. This map depicts Colombia. This whole region is experiencing some transition now. Since we have turned over the Panama Canal and closed our bases there, we see evidence that already there has been an increase of drug trafficking through Panama. We are concerned about the narcotraffickers in Colombia; we are concerned about what is happening in Venezuela, and this whole region of the world. It is in our neighborhood. 
   For years, to our own detriment, in my opinion, we have not been as involved with Central America and South America as we should have been. Now we see democracy and economic opportunity beginning to make progress in Central America, in the Caribbean, and democracy at least blossoming in parts of South America, but we see a threat, and it is being driven by drugs. 
   In addition to being in our hemisphere and in close proximity, we are talking about activities by people who are undermining the Colombian Government, who are killing people, and who are killing our children. The drugs that come out of Colombia are coming right into the United States--cocaine and heroin. They are poisoning our children. 
   I take this not very well. I am very concerned about it. I think we ignore it to our own peril. Should we do more in our country to deal with the demand problem, education, and treatment? Sure. We ought to find ways to do that. But we shouldn't do it by taking away from the efforts that are underway in Colombia. 
   That is why I call this a close national security interest for our own country. There are those who are worried if we do 
   this, we are slipping toward being involved. Where better to be involved than to try to take action and provide support for people who are trying to move toward greater democracy and greater economic development and to control and stop the drug trafficking and the drug pushers in that part of the world? I think we should do this. I think we should have been doing more a year ago or 2 years ago. I worked in the Senate with Senators COVERDELL, DEWINE, and others in communication with our own drug czar in America that we were not doing enough in Colombia. 
   Finally, the administration has said, well, we need to do something more; we need to be involved. I commend them for that. We need to get it done. That is why we pulled this foreign operations appropriations bill up as early as possible. We think we should get this foreign operations bill done and we should get the Colombian aid package included. This is very important for us. 
   President Pastrana of Colombia has asked for our help--not to solve the problem for him. We are not advocating U.S. troops go in or that we have direct involvement in their efforts there but to help him without American troops. Give them the aid they need; give them the equipment they need to fight these massive narcotic drug cartels in Colombia and that part of the world. 
   President Clinton's plan is multifaceted: Economic, political, social, and military means to gain the upper hand in dealing with the narcoterrorists who control vast amounts of Colombian territory. That is an area where I have some concern. I think too much territory has been conceded to these narcoterrorists. 
   Make no mistake, the FARC and the ELN guerrillas are ruthless. They don't know anything or care anything about human rights. They only want power to turn Colombia into the first nation controlled by narcoterrorists. Think about that. That is a real possibility unless we act to get assistance there as soon as possible. 
   Will this aid package alone solve the problem overnight? No. I emphasize again we should have been doing more last year and the year before and over a period of years. But it will make a significant contribution by giving to  the Colombian Government the wherewithal to challenge these narcoterrorists. 
   We know one thing for certain: Without this package, these narcoterrorists will be emboldened and they will have no incentive to come to the peace table. The freely elected pro U.S. government of President Pastrana will be dealt a very serious blow. We cannot leave them unassisted when they have asked for our help. 
   This is a question of standing up for our children, of standing up and fighting these narcoterrorists in our part of the world, in our neighborhood, in our region. Colombia has a chance. They are tired of the bloodshed. They are tired of kidnappings. They are tired of human rights abuses on all sides. I don't for a minute mean to push aside the complaints about some of the human rights violations on the other side, but that shouldn't be a reason not to act. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, support the foreign operations bill as it is, with the Colombian aid. As a matter of fact, I think it is possible the aid may actually be increased somewhat in conference. We should not let this be pecked apart. We should step up to our responsibility and fulfill our commitment to Colombia, to President Pastrana for his efforts, but particularly for the children of our country. 
   Do not support amendments that will take away funds in this package and move them over into other areas. It is the minimum that we should do. 
   I thank Senator WELLSTONE for allowing me to go forward at this time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to welcome a delegation from the European Parliament to the U.S. Senate. The parliamentarians are in the United States for an important interparliamentary meeting. 
   Europe continues to move forward with economic integration and the European Parliament's role is increasingly important. As the European Union, like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization expands, the role of the European Parliament will become even more important. 
   The United States and the European Union have the world's largest commercial relationship, with trade and investment approaching $1 trillion. 
   I believe increased interaction between our legislature and the European Parliament will serve the interests of both sides. 
   I urge my colleagues to greet this delegation, led by Ms. Imelda Mary Read of the United Kingdom.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senators are anxious to get a feel for what the proceedings will be for the remainder of the evening and in the morning. I commend the managers for the work they have been doing and commend Members for the help we have been receiving from them on both sides in terms of disposing of amendments one way or another. 
   I believe we are very close to getting an agreement that would get the remaining amendments done tonight. Then, in the morning, we could turn to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill and have stacked votes at 2 o'clock, both on any amendments and final passage of the foreign operations appropriations bill and any amendments that might be ready to be voted on and put in that staked sequence at 2 o'clock tomorrow. 
   We do not quite have that agreement yet. But for all Senators who are still working on it, I hope they will work with us to get it completed momentarily. If that cannot be done, I will be calling up the Kyl amendment No. 3558, and getting a second so we can have a rollcall vote on that, and other amendments, tonight. 
   I think we can get this bill done without having to have that recorded vote. But if we can't get an agreement as to how we are going to complete our work, then we will be having more votes tonight. 
   So for the Senators who are waiting to get final information, just give us a few more minutes. I think we are about to the point where we can enter this agreement, and then we would have a feel for the remainder of the night.

I believe we have one worked out that is fair and acceptable to Senators on both sides of the aisle. If we can get this agreement entered into, then there would be no further votes tonight, nor in the morning. Then we would begin the final debate at 1:30, with the votes that are necessary stacked at 2 p.m., and final passage at that time. 
   In the morning, though, we would go to Labor-HHS Appropriations at 9:30. Any votes relative to that bill would also be put in a stacked sequence beginning at 2 p.m., if any are ready. We certainly hope good progress can be made on that bill tomorrow. We look forward to working with the managers of that legislation.

   I further ask consent that at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday, the Senate resume consideration of the pending bill, and Senator FEINGOLD be recognized to offer his filed amendment regarding Mozambique, and that amendment be voted on in the voting sequence under the same terms as outlined above.

   I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed to vote on that motion. I further ask consent that following that vote, the bill then be placed back on the calendar awaiting the House companion bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I have the pleasure to announce that Senator MIKE ENZI, of Wyoming, has earned his second Golden Gavel award. 
   Since the 1960's, the Senate has recognized those dedicated Members who preside over the Senate for 100 hours with the Golden Gavel. This award continues to represent our appreciation for the time these dedicated Senators contribute to presiding over the U.S. Senate--a privileged and important duty. 
   Senator ENZI is not only the first in his class to earn the Golden Gavel award, but has time and time again offered his services to preside during late night sessions, on short notice, or when a great understanding of parliamentary procedure is needed. 
   On behalf of the Senate, I extend our sincere appreciation to Senator ENZI for his efforts and commitment to presiding during the 106th Congress.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate has taken a momentous step in promoting and facilitating the growth of electronic commerce with the passage of the conference report to S. 761--the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. 
   It was a long and difficult road to get to this point, following the bill's introduction in the Senate last March by my colleague and champion of E-signatures, Senator ABRAHAM. Many roadblocks had to be overcome along the way. In the end, many compromises were agreed to. This bill could have been done months ago; however, some wanted to make this a partisan issue. I am personally very pleased though that the sustained efforts of Congress resulted in a conference report supported by a meaningful majority of conferees, and by a majority of the business world.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me make a very important correction. The gentleman I am going to speak about briefly is going to be moving to South Dakota, not South Carolina. He obviously likes cooler weather and not hot weather. He deserves to be able to go wherever he chooses after the great service he has provided to the Congress. 
   I want to take a moment to say goodbye on behalf of the Senate to a man we know quite well. I know Senator DASCHLE is going to join me in this and make some comments, either in a few minutes or later. I am talking about Jim Talbert, who is Superintendent of the Senate's Periodical Press Gallery and is retiring this week after 32 years of service. 
   Jim and I came to the House of Representatives in the same year, 1968. He was hired in the House Daily Press Gallery, and I was hired as an aide to then-Congressman Bill Colmer, chairman of the Rules Committee. Twenty-three years and five Speakers later, Jim crossed the DMZ in the Capitol to the Senate to be Superintendent of the Periodical Press Gallery. 
   Early on, Jim figured out what it took to get things done around here: know the rules. He knew them. That is why he became such a valuable resource. His expertise on congressional procedure is widely recognized and consulted by rookie reporters, veteran correspondents, and, yes, even by an occasional Senator or House Member who knows that he spent those many years in the House. His generosity in sharing his knowledge and time has brought him a great many friends on the second and third floors of this Capitol.

   Mr. LOTT. While Jim no longer will be toiling with us every day, he is keeping his favorite jobs: husband, father, and grandfather. I am a little envious, to tell the truth. He and his wife, Judy, whom he met while working in the Capitol, are moving to her native South Dakota. 
   It is typical of Jim that he didn't want a big bang, a big fuss over his departure. But we couldn't let him go without first wishing him well and saying, ``Thanks, Jim. You have earned it.''

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia be recognized to offer a series of cleared amendments to the pending DOD authorization bill, and following the disposition of the 41-plus cleared amendments, the DOD authorization bill be laid aside and that the Senate then turn to the House Transportation appropriations bill and the Senate bill be immediately offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also had intended to ask consent that when the Senate resumes the DOD bill, the Smith amendment be laid aside and Senator DODD be recognized to offer his amendment regarding a Cuba commission. I am informed that Senator MCCAIN would object to that, but I assure Senator DASCHLE and Senator DODD and Senator MACK and Senator LEVIN and Senator WARNER, everybody, we will keep working to see if we can get this done. I think that is what we should do. 
   We are going to go back to DOD authorization in the morning in some form. Everybody is wanting to get in line or get their position first, or they don't want us to allow that second-degree slot to be opened, I guess, to the Smith amendment. Others want it to be open. It is kind of complicated. A lot of Senators are invoking their rights. They have a right to do that. 
   I do plead with the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, to work with us to try to get our appropriations bills done. I am going to continue to try to keep my word. Senator DASCHLE is working with me, and Senators are cooperating on both sides to come back to make progress on the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
   We were prepared to go to the Murray amendment, which is germane to the Defense bill. It is a Defense amendment. But I believe Senator FEINGOLD or somebody objected to that. We will keep working here. I think we can work through this in a way that will allow us to come back to the Defense authorization bill and deal with Defense-related amendments, which is what I prefer. It is our national security we are talking about. But there are amendments that Senators on both sides of the aisle want to offer that are not germane. We will try to find an orderly way in which to do that. 
   At this point, I am advised that there will be objections on this side on one approach and on that side on another approach. Let's keep working to find a way to get this done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one of the reasons Senator DASCHLE and I decided to try to proceed on this dual track, trying to work on the Defense authorization bill in the morning and appropriations bills in the afternoon--it was Senator DASCHLE's suggestion that we do that for the very purpose we are achieving here. It keeps people focused. Out of sight, out of mind. If we were not trying to come back to DOD authorization, everybody would go off to committee hearings and other work and would not focus on trying to get an orderly way to do it. So while it is not agreed to yet, it is exactly what we had in mind--to make everybody understand we are going to keep trying to do the Transportation appropriations bill, and we are going to focus on amendments and try to get order and process to go back to the Department of Defense authorization.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor John and Sharon Roesser of Encino, California who celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on Saturday, June 20, 2000. 
   After serving in the First Marine Division in the Pacific and near the China/Manchuria border during and immediately after World War II, John attended Loyola University in Los Angeles. John met Sharon, who was attending Immaculate Heart College, at a dance in the fall of 1948. 
   A year and a half later on a blistering hot day, June 10, 1950, John and Sharon were married in the original Saint Mary's Church in El Centro, California by the Most Reverend Charles S. Buddy who was the first Bishop of the San Diego Diocese. Sharon's maid of honor was her sister Patricia, and John's best man was Paul Connor. After their honeymoon at the Hotel Del Coronado, John and Sharon lived in Santa Monica and then settled in Encino, California where they raised their six children: Regina, John Jr., Allison, Paul, Mary Carol, and Tom. At last count, John and Sharon have 16 grandchildren. 
   Today, I honor John and Sharon's 50 years of marriage and their commitment to raising their children in a loving and caring household. Since their marriage, they have always been there for each other and for each of their children through the best of times and the most difficult of times. They are an example of all that is good in America, and I wish them all the best in the years to come.

They have been an integral part of the everyday proceedings of the U.S. Senate and without their hard work and dedication this deliberative body would not be able to complete our work in a timely manner. Throughout the year young men and women come to Washington, D.C. from all parts of the nation to serve a vital role as Pages in the U.S. Senate. During the spring and fall these high school students attend the Page School in the early mornings and continue their day as U.S. Senate Pages often working long days and into the night. I must say, this group of Pages was of the highest caliber and are among the best youth our Nation has to offer. At this time, I would like to commend them for their service and enter their names in the RECORD.  
   Shannon Coe, Ashley Burnett, Kelly Morgan, Shannon Montague, Emily Schlect, Loki Gale Tobin, Kyle Brown, Misty Lebatard, Clinton Lee Johnson Jr., Chase Dubay, Benton Keatley, Anjel Jefferson, Nicole Tailleart, Rebecca Manning, Jean-Paul Isabelle, Andriea Aden, Seema Mittal, James Dolan, Nathaniel Haefs, Hannah Pierson-Compeau, Jay Oliphant, Allison Conley, Megan Gilbert.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know we are now prepared to go to the debate on the next amendment. But I do have a unanimous consent request to make and some brief comments. 
   For the information of all Senators, the two managers have previously exchanged amendment lists on each side of the aisle. Senator DASCHLE and I have talked about the need to get some finite list identified so that our whips and the managers can begin to work through the lists and see which can be accepted and which ones are a problem, or maybe will not be offered, and which ones will have to have debate or votes. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the list I now send to the desk be the only remaining first-degree amendments in order for the DOD authorization bill other than second-degree amendments which must be relevant to the first degree.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are almost 200 amendments, I think, on this list. A large number of them are not related to the national security of our country. They are not related to the Defense authorization bill. There are two amendments now pending that are not related to national security. 
   I am very concerned about how long this could go on and what these amendments are. They do run the usual range, from the HMO amendment, to campaign finance amendments, to minimum wage, and a whole long list of unrelated or nongermane amendments. 
   I knew when we moved to this legislation this would be possible. I wanted to see how we could do, see if progress could be made, see if a little steam perhaps could be let off here. This is important legislation, so we are going to have to work through these amendments and cut them down to a reasonable number. Senator DASCHLE and I have discussed the possibility, after we get these amendments and see how we are doing, that we set the bill aside and go to the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with the understanding that when that was completed, we would come back to the authorization bill, and then we would have some idea of what amendments we would have to take time on. 
   This is not part of the unanimous consent request. We are not locking in on that--neither I nor Senator DASCHLE. But we have to find some way to try to work through this list and, hopefully, be able to conclude this bill. I know Senator WARNER would like to do that. 
   I wanted to make those observations. I ask Senators on both sides to, if you can, withhold your amendment if it is not essential. Please do that, because there is no way we can do 200, or 100, or 50 amendments and complete this work. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call to my colleagues' attention the fact that the McCain amendment will be a killer amendment to this Defense authorization bill. It will be blue-slipped. I have discussed this with Chairman Archer. He assured me, after reviewing the way the amendment is written, that he will have no choice but to blue-slip it. I also discussed it with Senator MOYNIHAN from New York. He has concerns about the constitutionality of this revenue amendment being added to the Defense authorization bill. 
   I want to make that perfectly clear and add to that, this compounds our problem. We are dealing with a very important bill, the Defense authorization bill. We are talking about national security. We need to find a way to come to a conclusion. We have 11 appropriations bills remaining, and we have to find time to act on the China PNTR and other issues. 
   If we continue to work in good faith trying to find a way to get votes on amendments and complete the Defense authorization bill and then we face, on top of everything else, a blue-slip problem in the House, we have done ourselves damage. 
   I think full disclosure is the way to go. I have been quoted to that effect. I still think that is the way to go. There is a bill that has been drafted, I understand after talking with a number of Senators, including the chairman of the Finance Committee and others, that would achieve this goal and, in fact, would be a broader bill in its application. 
   As this is drawn, I understand it would not apply to a number of groups, including the trial lawyers, Sierra Club, and others. We ought to make sure it is broad and applies to everybody. We ought to have full disclosure, and do it so it is not a technical problem on a bill such as the Defense authorization bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to think about this very carefully and support the Warner point of order that will be made with regard to the blue-slip problem. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I move to proceed to the DOD appropriations bill, let me say that we have a problem now with this amendment, the way the language is written, in terms of a blue slip, if and when it gets to the House of Representatives. 
   I have discussed this with Senator DASCHLE and Senator MCCAIN and others who are concerned about the underlying Defense authorization bill and those who are concerned about the disclosure amendment. 
   During the period of time that we are going to be working on the DOD appropriations bill, we will work to see if we can come up with some sort of agreement or some sort of procedure that would get this amendment off of the Defense authorization bill and onto some other bill--perhaps some revenue bill that we will have before us; perhaps even the repeal of the telephone tax that the House has acted on; and also give us an opportunity to work with Senator MCCAIN and others to see if we can broaden the application. 
   But, for now, we need to go ahead and proceed with the DOD appropriations bill. We will work together to see if we can find a way to resolve this issue. 
   Does the Senator from Arizona have any comment?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional dedication, vision, and public service of  Colonel Teresa M. Peterson who is leaving the 14th Flying Training Wing (14 FTW) after two years of devoted service to become the Director of Transportation on the Air Force staff in the Pentagon. It is a privilege for me to recognize her many outstanding achievements at Columbus Air Force Base, and to commend her for the superb service she has provided the Air Force and our great Nation. 
   As Commander of the 14th Flying Training Wing, Colonel Peterson spearheaded the training and education of our Nation's next generation of Air Force pilots. The epitome of an Air Force officer and accomplished pilot, she provided our Nation's future warriors with inspirational leadership and an outstanding training environment. Her talents were showcased in every aspect of Columbus AFB operations and highlighted through outstanding performances on command inspections such as the 1998 Headquarters Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Operational Readiness Inspection. 
   Colonel Peterson's quality of life initiatives for Columbus AFB provided the installation with $56 million in improvements. Those initiatives included construction of a $6.3 million Unaccompanied Officer Quarters and a $25 million, 202 unit, highly sensitive family housing complex. She deftly negotiated resolution of several complex contracting challenges on the family housing project and ensured that contractor issues were handled quickly and efficiently. Her vision and oversight of numerous facilities construction and renovation projects significantly enhanced the training environment and living conditions of Columbus AFB personnel. 
   Under Colonel Peterson's leadership and guidance, Columbus AFB was a showcase for visitors which included the Secretary of the Air Force, members of Congress, foreign dignitaries, numerous flag officers, and friends and families of the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training Program. Her dedication to the Air Force and her people and the vision she established for Columbus AFB are her greatest assets, netting Columbus unprecedented recognition with AETC and the Air Force. 
   She aggressively met the increased Air Force pilot demand through activation of the first reserve associate squadron, seamlessly integrating reservists with active duty instructor pilots to mitigate force reduction problems. Colonel Peterson managed the second busiest military airfield east of the Mississippi River, with more than 200,000 aircraft operations annually. Her area of responsibility included 49,000 square miles of airspace in close coordination with 13 civilian satellite airports. Under her command, Columbus AFB has remained one of the safest flying operations in the AETC. 
   She astutely enhanced pilot training at its initial phase by establishing co-equal T-37 squadrons with an operating concept for synchronized training and operations under two distinct supervisors. She managed pilot training and support operations for USAF and international officers using a fleet of 247 T-37B, T-38A, T-1A and AT-38B aircraft and 14 instrument simulators. Her extraordinary aviation skills, coupled with her vast experience and boundless warrior spirit, ensured that Columbus AFB was aggressively able to meet the challenge of increased Air Force pilot demand. Her efforts produced 585 Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training and 481 Introduction to Fighter Fundamental student pilots who flew 146,795 sorties totaling 198,722 hours during her tenure. 
   As Colonel Teresa Peterson leaves Columbus Air Force Base, she leaves behind a legacy of excellence and ``firsts.'' She was the first woman in the Air Force to command a flying squadron; the first active duty woman to command an Air Force flying wing; and, the first woman pilot to make the rank of brigadier general. She is recognized as an honorary member of the Tuskegee Airmen (Alva N. Temple Chapter) and a member of the Mississippi University for Women's National Board of Distinguished Women. Colonel Peterson is an outstanding officer and a credit to the United States Air Force and our great Nation. I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to recognize her service to Columbus Air Force Base and wish her well in her next assignment.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my close friend, Robert Khayat. On March 9, 2000, Chancellor Khayat was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame. I want to recognize Chancellor Khayat not just because of his recent induction into this prestigious group, but also for his dedication to the State of Mississippi. 
   Robert Khayat played college baseball and football at our mutual alma mater, the University of Mississippi. Playing catcher for Ole Miss, he led the team to two consecutive SEC Baseball Championships. A two-time All SEC player, Bob Khayat earned three letters in his sophomore, junior, and senior years. 
   During Bob Khayat's college football career he demonstrated a definitive leadership role. At the position of place-kicker, ``Golden Toe,'' as he was called, led the Rebels' extraordinary football team to many a victory. His name is forever in the University of Mississippi's history books as one of the greatest place kickers to set foot on the Ole Miss campus. Coach John Vaught's team secured many victories because of Bob Khayat's athletic ability. He was selected as the place-kicker on the Ole Miss Team of the Century. 
   After graduating from Ole Miss, Bob Khayat played professional football for the Washington Redskins. In his time with the Redskins he scored 204 points, tied the all-time Redskins record for most field goals made in a single game, and was voted into the Pro Bowl. In recognition of his great achievements, the NFL presented Bob Khayat with the 1998 Career Achievement Award for his accomplishments on and off the field. 
   While performing in the NFL, Robert Khayat pursued his law degree at the University of Mississippi Law School. After graduating third in his class and earning his Juris Doctorate degree in 1966, Bob Khayat entered private practice in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In 1969 he became a law professor at Ole Miss. 
   From 1980 to 1981, Bob Khayat took a leave of absence to pursue a Masters of Law degree, which he received from Yale Law School. Returning to teach at Ole Miss Law School, he was promoted to Associate Dean before serving as Vice Chancellor for University Affairs in 1984. In 1994 he served as interim athletic director before becoming the University of Mississippi's 15th Chancellor. 
   Chancellor Robert Khayat plays an instrumental role for the State of Mississippi. He is known for his tireless leadership which he has exemplified as a student, an athlete, a professor and  finally as Chancellor of the University of Mississippi. Chancellor Khayat's character is a tremendous asset to Ole Miss. As a person, he is a role model for all who know him. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Mississippians, I would like to commend Chancellor Khayat for his leadership, his accomplishments, and his continued dedication to making our home state a better place. While I am recognizing Chancellor Khayat for his induction into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, his many talents and abilities distinguish him in countless other areas as well.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to remember an admirable person and a devoted educator, Dr. Walter Washington. Dr. Washington served as a classroom teacher, assistant principal, Dean of Utica Junior College, President of Utica Junior College for twelve years, and served as President of Alcorn State University from 1969 to 1994. Dr. Washington retired as President of Alcorn State University on June 30, 1994, and was subsequently named President Emeritus by the Mississippi Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning. 
   During his tenure as both an educator and administrator, Dr. Washington was a leader in the State of Mississippi and throughout the country. He was a mentor to all who met him, and he set a high standard for his successors. His impact on Mississippi was evident in his work as a representative of the state on several national commissions. 
   As a man of many talents, he served on the Advisory Council of the National Urban League's Black Executive Exchange Program and the U.S. President's Advisory Council on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In 1982, he was awarded the Outstanding Presidential Cluster Citation by President Ronald Reagan. 
   Dr. Washington was a member of several professional organizations, including Kappa Delta Phi, Phi Delta Kappa, and Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society. He served as president of the Mississippi Teachers Association and held membership in the Mississippi Association of Educators and the national Education Association. 
   Dr. Washington married his college sweetheart, the former Carolyn Carter, in 1949. In addition to his devotion to his wife, he was involved in many community organizations. Dr. Washington received the Silver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America, the Distinguished Service Award and Distinguished Alumni Award from Peabody College, and the Service to Humanity Award from Mississippi College. He was listed among Ebony's 100 Most Influential Black Americans in 1974, 1975, and 1976, and was selected Mississippi Man-of-the-Year in Education in 1981. 
   Dr. Washington passed away on December 1, 1999, but his legacy will live on as an eternal flame. I was deeply saddened to hear the news of his death. 
   Dr. Washington's reputation for hard work and academic excellence set an example which will continue to inspire greatness in the men and women of Mississippi. Such a reputation is the greatest tribute to a man's life. His insight on predicting the needs of future students helped to mold Alcorn State University into one of Mississippi's great universities. 
   Mr. President, Mississippians and Americans are grateful for Dr. Washington's public service, and I commend him for his leadership and accomplishments.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to a businessman who has witnessed the transformation of a company from a single plant operation into a multinational corporation. The businessman I am referring to is Pat Rooney, who is retiring on June 3rd after almost 45 years of service to Cooper Tire and Rubber Company. Mr. Rooney began his career with Cooper Tire in 1956 as a sales trainee. In 1994, Pat Rooney was elected CEO and Chairman of the Board of Cooper Tire. That hierarchical progression is astounding. In this day and time with the ever changing economy, it is almost hard to fathom someone working for one employer for four and a half decades. Pat Rooney saw Cooper Tire and Rubber grow from 1,000 total employees to now 25,000 worldwide. During his tenure at Cooper Tire, Mr. Rooney spent time working in Clarksdale, Mississippi at the rubber products operation in the Mississippi Delta. Cooper has built a significant presence in my state, employing numerous Mississippians at locations in Clarksdale and Tupelo. Pat Rooney lives in Findlay, Ohio and has been very active in the community. He is a Rotarian, active in the Findlay/Hancock County Chamber of Commerce, and the County Community Development Foundation and served on the advisory council of the Arts Partnership of Hancock County. Again, I want to commend Pat Rooney today for his service to his company and his community. Cooper Tire has been fortunate to have such a dedicated employee, leader, and visionary. Mr. Rooney I hope you will enjoy your well deserved retirement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we had talked over the period of, I guess, 2 or 3 weeks about trying to come to an agreement so we could go back to the very important bill, S. 2, the Education Opportunities Act of 2000. We still have pending on that bill, I believe, two amendments for debate, and I don't know if we have the time agreement for a final vote. We do not, but we have Senators JEFFORDS, STEVENS, DOMENICI, and others--and maybe Senator KENNEDY is on that amendment--plus a second Kennedy amendment. What we have been trying to do is agree to another grouping of amendments after that but preferably to go ahead and get agreement on a list of very important amendments on both sides of the aisle that are related to elementary and secondary education and have votes on those amendments and then come to a conclusion. 
   I wanted to see if we could make any progress in that regard and, hopefully, we can get agreement on this. If not, we will keep working to see if we can find a way to reach an agreement. 
   I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act of 2000, the Stevens amendment No. 3139 remain the pending amendment, and that the education-related amendments which follow be the only first-degree amendments in order to be offered; that they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that debate on all amendments, whether first or second degree, be limited to 1 hour equally divided; and following the conclusion of debate on or in relation to the first-degree amendments listed, the bill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on final passage. 
   I also ask consent that when the Senate receives the House companion measure, it proceed immediately to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill be inserted, the bill advanced to third reading and passed; that the Senate then insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, all without any intervening action or debate, and that S. 2 be indefinitely postponed. 
   The remaining first-degree amendments in order to be offered to S. 2--and I note again these will be 1 hour each equally divided--are: 
   An amendment by Senator JEFFORDS relating to high schools; an amendment by Senator STEVENS involving physical education programs; an amendment by Senator BINGAMAN regarding accountability; an amendment by Senator SANTORUM which calls for full funding for IDEA; the Kennedy amendment regarding teacher quality; a Hutchison amendment regarding single-sex schools; an amendment by Senator DODD involving 21st century schools; an amendment by Senator GREGG involving 21st century schools; an amendment by Senators HARKIN and BINGAMAN concerning school construction grant programs; an amendment by Senator VOINOVICH regarding IDEA funding options; an amendment by Senator WELLSTONE regarding fairness and accuracy in testing; 
   an amendment by Senator GRAMS involving alternative testing; an amendment by Senator REED involving parental involvement; an amendment by Senator KYL which would deal with parental opt-out for bilingual education; an amendment by Senator MIKULSKI involving community technology centers; an amendment by Senator ASHCROFT involving IDEA discipline--an amendment, I might add, he has been trying to get in the order for several weeks now, and we have not been able to get it agreed to in the order, and I must say that at one point he could have insisted on it but was agreeable to setting it aside with the understanding he would get a shot at it later on--a relevant amendment by Senator LOTT; a relevant amendment by Senator DASCHLE; a relevant managers' amendment by Senator JEFFORDS; and a relevant managers' amendment by Senator KENNEDY.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would object to the request at this time. But I am encouraged that we could get together and work to try to find a way to develop a list that would complete this very important education bill and bring it to final passage. 
   I think we should pursue this to see if we can develop the list. I don't know how long it would be.

   Mr. LOTT. I will in just a moment. 
   It sounded as if we had around 20 amendments, and it sounded as if the minority leader added three or four that were not on our list. We are talking about as many as 24 amendments. We have taken up six. That would put us at 30. I don't think that is necessarily an excessive list on something that is this important. 
   But the point is, if we could at least pursue some finite list that would get us to a conclusion, I would certainly like to do that. 
   I would be glad to yield to Senator KENNEDY.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond, this is about elementary and secondary education. Obviously, there is a lot we need to do to be of assistance to administrators, teachers, parents, and children at the elementary and secondary education level. Certainly, the local and State officials need to do more. We need to improve the quality of our schools, they need to be child centered, and they need to be safe and drug free. But I think it is about elementary and secondary education, and amendments should be germane to this area. 
   I think it is a far stretch to say that a Lautenberg amendment which has to do with gun shows relates to elementary and secondary education. I think we should be sensitive to that 
   area. We should do what we can to provide safety for children, and to make sure children don't get guns, have access to them, or make use of them. 
   But I also think one of the things we can do that I supported, and which is in the juvenile justice bill that we passed earlier, and was in the making for 3 years--that included assistance for schools and dealing with these safety problems--for instance, funds would be available for metal detectors. A lot of schools are now doing that. They have a greater need for assistance. That is why I wanted to get the juvenile justice bill through. While I still plan to urge the juvenile justice conference report be completed, and it be brought back to the Senate, that is the place where this issue or these issues should be dealt with. 
   The direct answer to the Senator's question is it is not germane, and I think it would be a major problem with elementary and secondary education legislation. Certainly, I would object to it.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, without knowing exactly which Gramm amendment the Senator is speaking of, the way he described it, I probably voted for it and was supportive of it. But one of the problems I have, as suggested earlier, is that I understand, for instance, it leaves out the Ashcroft amendment. He has been very cooperative, to use that famous word, in not insisting that he be included in the earlier groupings. He at one point actually could have, within his rights, actually forced us to vote on it, and he didn't do it. 
   I would want to talk to both sides about including the Ashcroft amendment. It doesn't include the two managers' amendments, or the two leaders' amendments, which I think surely we would be willing to do. And it doesn't bring the bill to third reading. I think we need to talk about those issues, and I hope we can do that. 
   Mr. President, if I could proceed, I had indicated earlier this year that we would go to the Defense authorization bill. I believe it was this week. For a variety of reasons, we weren't able to go to Defense authorization. Of course, the way we usually do these bills is we go to the Defense authorization and complete that, and then go to the Defense appropriations bill and complete both of them. 
   Earlier there were objections to taking up the Agriculture appropriations bill. I might say now that I understand why it has not been completed by the House. We thought the House would act on Agriculture appropriations this week. They did not do that. We have in  the past quite often gone to appropriations bills in the Senate and took them up to the third reading but without actually completing them and waiting for the House to act. 
   Senator DASCHLE has indicated there are some points within the Agriculture bill in the Senate with which they have problems, and they want to have, I guess, an option to remove provisions of the Agriculture appropriations bill using rule XVI. 
   It is obviously very important. Even though we took the emergency agriculture portion, $7.1 billion, out of the Agriculture appropriations bill and put it in the crop insurance bill that just passed, it still has some disaster money in it and some emergency moneys, I believe, for North Carolina and other areas. I hope we can find a way to get an agreement to go to that bill or to the DOD appropriations bill. 
   There we are. We have been unable to get an agreement to go to DOD authorization. We have not yet been able to work out something on Agriculture or Defense. However, hopefully during this recess we can look at the importance of these issues and see if we can get an agreement of how to proceed on one or two of these. 
   I think we are close to getting agreement on the e-commerce digital signature bill and also very close on bankruptcy, and therefore perhaps those two could be combined along with the satellite loan bill. That may be available early in the week we come back. I hope it will be because I think there are only two or three points outstanding on the three of them. 
   For now, I ask consent that the Senate turn to the DOD authorization bill, S. 2549, and only DOD-related amendments be in order during the pendency of the bill.

   Mr. LOTT. We had talked, Mr. President, about seeing if we could come to an agreement on how to proceed to the Defense appropriations bill, realizing that the authorizers want to get their bill done because, among other things, it does authorize and make some changes in law. It is not just about spending. It does have some very important language in it with regard to health benefits for our military personnel and their families and retirees. So there is a need to get the authorization bill done, and we need to find a way to get it done. 
   Another way to proceed would be to take up the Department of Defense appropriations bill. I know Senator STEVENS talked to Senator BYRD and Senator DASCHLE about going ahead to that, even though the House has not acted, on the assumption that the House will act on that the week we return and we would probably be able to take up that House bill or it would be here before we complete it. However, it is hard to say now if that will be 
   accomplished or not. We don't know that the House will have it done by Tuesday of next week or Wednesday of the week we come back. 
   I ask consent that we go to the Defense appropriations bill which was reported out of the Appropriations Committee on May 18 by unanimous vote of all the members of the Appropriations Committee.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly agree. I think we should take it up as soon as we can. It has come over from the House, but it has not been reported, I don't believe, from the subcommittee or the full committee here. 
   I asked the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SHELBY, why that is the case--and, by the way, immediately urged him to do it as quickly as he can--and I understand it was because Senator LAUTENBERG of New Jersey had wanted another hearing at the subcommittee level before they marked it up, and that they were going to need, in the next few days, to get it done. 
   Hopefully, they will report that bill out by Wednesday or Thursday of the week we return and we will be able to go to that; either if we got it Thursday, we could do it Thursday or Friday, or we could go do it the first thing next week. I am pushing the committee to act on it. I don't know what the outstanding issue is, but I understand they wanted to have one more committee hearing for some reason. 
   Let me provide a little incentive to all sides to work together on the Defense appropriations bill. I will not now move to proceed to it, but I will move to proceed to that bill when we reconvene after the recess, and have a vote, if necessary, on proceeding to the Defense appropriations bill. 
   But over the next 10 days, we have time to work between the authorizers and the appropriators and everybody who has a concern about that bill, and hopefully something can be worked out so we can proceed on the authorization bill, and then, of course, immediately go to the appropriations bill after that. 
   If we cannot get something worked out over the recess period or agree on some sort of schedule, I will have no alternative at that point but to move to proceed to the DOD appropriations bill. I prefer to have something we have worked out between the authorizers and the appropriators and the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership so we can make good use of our time. 
   We do have 4 weeks in the month of June when we come back. We have a lot of work we need to do. We need to move at least half a dozen appropriations bills during the month of June. We need to take a look at the House-passed China trade status bill, see how much time we would need on the floor, and try to get some idea of what amendments might be offered. 
   It would not be my intent to try to limit amendments on the China permanent trade status bill. I think we should say right from the beginning if we add any new material to it, any new amendments or language, it would have to go back to conference with the House and then vote again in the House and Senate. That may be OK, but I want to take a little time when we come back and see if we can work through the time that would be required, when would be the first time to take it up, and what amendments might be in the offing from both sides of the aisle. Our staffs will be working on that during the recess. Plus, we could have other issues. 
   I mentioned the conference report and other bills that are pending, so we are going to have to have a full month in June. I also remind my colleagues that in July--I was looking at the calendar last night and was really a little  bit chagrined to realize we only will have 3 weeks between the Fourth of July recess and the conventions in August. 
   I had really thought we would have four; if we could do five or six appropriations bills in that window. So we really are under pressure, with the 7 weeks we have in the summer, to move 11 appropriations bills. That is going to be a monumental task, and it is going to take work with each other on both sides of the aisle. I know that. We cannot move it without everybody giving it a shot. But it makes it awfully hard for us to be doing other issues, other than the China trade bill, which we hope to get worked in there at some point. 
   With that, I think we have talked enough about schedule. I hope we can come to some agreements over the next 10 days as to exactly how we will proceed the first week we are back. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business, with Senators GRAMS and DURBIN in control of the time until 11:30 a.m. Momentarily, I intend to propound a unanimous consent request that provides for debate on two FEC nominations, beginning at 11:30 a.m., and consuming the remainder of the day. There will also be debate time on several judicial nominations, with any votes ordered during today's session to occur on Wednesday. 
   For the information of all Senators, it is my intention to begin consideration of the legislative branch appropriations bill, as well as the Agriculture appropriations bill, later this week. It is hoped that the Senate can complete action on both of these very important spending bills prior to the Memorial Day recess. 
   Now, again, for the information of Senators, we will have this debate on the nominations throughout the day. Beginning tomorrow, in the morning, I presume, right after the opening activities, we will go to the legislative branch appropriations bill. We hope to be able to finish that in a reasonable period of time. But regardless of that, sometime in midafternoon--I presume, 3:30, 4:00, 4:30; we will have to look at the time and work out that exact time--we will begin a series of votes that will probably mean votes on either four or five or six--I hope it is five or four and not the full six, but we could still have as many as six votes in a row Wednesday afternoon. Then we hope to turn to the Agriculture appropriations bill.

   Mr. LOTT. In executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 a.m., Tuesday, May 23, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 436, the nomination of Bradley Smith to be a member of the FEC. I further ask consent that debate be limited on the nomination as follows: Senator MCCONNELL, 2 hours; Senator DODD, or his designee, 2 hours; Senator WELLSTONE, 2 hours; Senator MCCAIN, 2 hours; Senator FEINGOLD, 2 hours. 
   I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time, the nomination be laid aside, with a vote to occur on the confirmation of the nomination during Wednesday's session of the Senate at a time to be determined by the two leaders, with 20 minutes for closing remarks, equally divided, just prior to the vote. If we need a few more minutes than that, we will work with the interested parties to see if that can be achieved. 
   I also ask consent that immediately following that vote, the Senate proceed  to a confirmation vote on the nomination of Danny McDonald, Calendar No. 435. 
   I further ask consent that also on Tuesday, May 23, the Senate then proceed to the nomination of Timothy Dyk to be a U.S. circuit judge, Calendar No. 291, and the debate be limited to the following: Senator SESSIONS, 30 minutes; Senator HATCH, 15 minutes; and Senator LEAHY, 15 minutes. 
   I further ask consent that on Tuesday, the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 498, the nomination of Gerard Lynch, and there be 40 minutes of debate, equally divided, between the opponents and proponents. I also ask consent that all debate time on the nominations be consumed or considered yielded back during Tuesday's session of the Senate. 
   I further ask consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the Dyk nomination third in the voting sequence on Wednesday, to be followed by votes on Executive Calendar No. 498, No. 519, and No. 520. 
   I ask unanimous consent that immediately following those votes, the Senate immediately proceed to the consideration of the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: 
   Nos. 206, 334, 424, 433, 434, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 452, 453, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 472, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 496, 497, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 518, 521, 522, 523, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to the nominations be printed at the appropriate place in the RECORD, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will respond. I know that at least one appointment is waiting on a companion appointment from the administration, where you have a Democratic nominee for a commission or a board, and we usually try to move them together. That is one case. Then we have seven IRS members who can be cleared if--I understand there is opposition to at least one of those from the Democratic side. 
   But my goal in working to get this large package done is so we can continue to work to get companion nominations and move more nominations. I discussed this with Senator DASCHLE yesterday. It is not easy, but we hope to continue to work together to get the nominations in a position where they can be cleared, or where we have debate time and a vote and arrange for that to occur. We will keep working on it. It has been reduced by some 70 or more nominations if this entire package is completed, and if all of them--well, it will either be voted on and approved or defeated, leaving only 19. So that is a major step toward getting nominations confirmed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal action in Indiana Superior Court for the County of Marion. In the case of State of Indiana v. Amy Han, the county prosecutor has charged the defendant with two counts of criminal trespass on Senator LUGAR'S Indianapolis office. Pursuant to subpoenas issued on behalf of the county prosecutor, this resolution authorizes two employees in Senator LUGAR'S office who witnessed the events giving rise to the trespass charges, and any other employee in the Senator's office from whom testimony may be required, to testify and produce documents at trial, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a pro se plaintiff has commenced a civil action against Senator CLELAND and a state official in Georgia state court seeking an order removing them from office on the purported ground that their election by plurality vote, while expressly authorized by Georgia statutes, violates the Georgia Constitution. This suit is the plaintiff's second challenge to Georgia's current election laws. Having lost his first challenge against the State Board of Elections, the plaintiff now is bringing an identical challenge to the Georgia election laws through the use of the ancient writ of quo warranto. 
   Senator CLELAND, who was elected to the Senate almost four years ago, in 1996, in an election that was not the subject of any election contest brought before the Senate, is sued solely because of his official capacity as a sitting Senator. This quo warranto action in essence challenges his taking of the oath of office, as well as the Senate's action in seating him. As such, it falls appropriately within the Senate Legal Counsel's statutory responsibility to represent Members of the Senate in civil actions in which they are sued in their official capacity. 
   The writ of quo warranto can have no applicability to United States Senators or Representatives, as Article I, section 5 of the United States Constitution commits to each House of Congress the sole power to seat and remove its Members. This action is also barred by the speech or debate clause. 
   This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator CLELAND to seek his dismissal from this matter.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we do the closing remarks, we are waiting to see if Senator DASCHLE has any remarks he would like to make at this point. 
   Just so Senators will be aware of the likely schedule this week, of course this is the week before the Memorial Day recess. We have a number of conferences that are completed or nearing completion, so we could have votes on a number of conference reports this week, including but not necessarily limited to bankruptcy reform, crop insurance, the satellite loan conference report, and the e-commerce digital signature conference report. Not all of those have been wrapped up, but we are hopeful that one or all four of those will be available during the process of the week's schedule. 
   We also are expecting to receive from the House early in the week the Agriculture appropriations bill. We had hoped to go to that bill tomorrow and then, of course, as soon as it was received from the House we would go to the House-passed bill. If the House is not able to complete action on the Agriculture appropriations bill on Tuesday, then we will need to confer with the leadership on both sides of the aisle and decide exactly how we can go to that bill and have its consideration completed before the week is out. But I want to emphasize before we go home for Memorial Day, we must complete the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   We are still hoping that the House will be able to act on the legislative appropriations bill and we will be able to complete action on it also before we leave. 
   So we will be having votes possibly into the night on Tuesday. We could very likely have a late session Thursday. Members should expect a session on Friday. If we are not through with the Agriculture appropriations bill, then we will keep going until we complete it. 
   We could be in session Friday night or Saturday. This is work that has to be done. For reasons which I need not repeat at this point, we are behind schedule in getting that done. We need to complete it. 
   I am not going to propound a unanimous consent request at this time on nominations, but so everybody will know, we have now been discussing the possibility of an agreement to take up as many as 72 nominations. There may still be some objections to one, two, or three of those. Somewhere between 65 and 72 nominations have been offered by the majority that we could take up and consider. Most of them would be confirmed, without the need for debate, in wrapup or on a unanimous voice vote. In at least four or five cases, some time would be required, with regard to the FEC nominees and at least a couple judges, with recorded votes necessary on somewhere between four and six at the most. 
   We could complete up to as many as 72 nominations in the next 24 hours, including 16 new Federal judicial nominations. Again, three or four of those nominations for judgeships could require recorded votes, but I believe we could get them all done. 
   There has been objection from the minority. I discussed the situation with Senator DASCHLE this morning, and he is still working on it. We hope we can get this resolved shortly without having to spend the whole week just on nominations. This really should be done in 5 or 6 hours with five or six votes and the rest of them done without any objections. There are a variety of nominations: U.S. marshals, U.S. attorneys, IRS oversight board members; Administrator, drug enforcement; two National Transportation Safety Board members; one Nuclear Regulatory Commission member; eight various Department of State positions, including the special negotiator for chemical and biological arms control issues, and a number of other nominees. 
   I want it on the record that we are prepared to go to those at this point.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under my leader time. 
   Mr. President, I know Senators expect to vote at 2:30. I know there are meetings that are going to be occurring momentarily. I will not delay that, but I do just want to make three or four points. 
   No. 1, I want to say what an instructive and constructive debate I think this has been. I listened to a good bit of it last night. Some of it I came and sat on the floor and listened to; I engaged in some of that discussion; I watched some more of it later on on television; and I listened to various parts of it this morning. I think it has been a very healthy debate. I congratulate all who have been involved on both sides of the issue on both sides of the aisle. 
   I also want to pay a particular tribute to Senator BYRD--it is always an education when he speaks about the Constitution, about why he believes that Congress should step in to deal with an issue such as this--and, of course, Senator WARNER. They have both done an outstanding job. They have been convincing to me. 
   Also, I think it should be noted that as sponsors of the language that is in the bill, they have indicated a willingness to compromise in the conference, to make some changes if Members think that is necessary, on dates, or to see if the administration could work with them on language that could be acceptable. I think that is the way to approach it. 
   Those things have really made the difference for me. We have no long-term plan for Kosovo. We do not know how long we are going to be there. We do not know how much it is going to cost. We do know our allies have not been meeting their commitments. Progress is being made in that regard, but I give credit to Senator WARNER and Senator STEVENS and others, talking about this amendment and pointing out that those commitments were not being fulfilled in terms of people, troops, police--or in terms of money. That is unacceptable. But I think there is a little bit of an attitude: If we don't do it, the United States, the sole remaining world power, will take care of it. That is not right for the American people. It is not right for the taxpayers of America. So I think we need to have a better understanding about fulfillment of commitments and what is the long-term plan. How long are we going to be there? Under what conditions would we ever get out? 
   It should be noted, even with these amendments, the Byrd-Warner package being adopted, we would still be able to provide logistics support, intelligence--a number of other facets. We are dealing with war troops on the ground who would be affected by this. 
   Here is the most important point of all. For years we have been through this debate about constitutional requirements--what the Congresses do, the President's prerogatives. Clearly we have been abdicating ours. The language under the Warner provision says to our NATO allies No. 1: Fulfill your commitments. And, No. 2, we in the Congress should vote to authorize this action. 
   For those who say Congress would not authorize this involvement next year, the presence of combat troops in Kosovo, I do not believe that. I do not think we know yet. I certainly would listen to the debate. I voted to use U.S. combat troops 
   in various parts around the world, in Republican administrations and in Democrat administrations, and, quite frankly, against it sometimes in both of them. I do not think this is risky. I think there has been a lot of exaggeration as to the result. I am prepared to vote for keeping the language in the bill, and I think we can go forward from there. But whatever happens, Congress needs to fulfill its responsibility. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been discussing with our colleagues the procedure for the remainder of the day. 
   At this time, I am going to ask unanimous consent to go to the foreign ops appropriations bill. I understand there will be objection to that. If there is objection, then I would move to proceed to it. That, of course, would be debatable. I understand there is at least a couple of Senators who would want to be heard on this matter. 
   While that is being debated, we will be working to see if we can get a time agreement and the ability to complete action on legislation by Senator BROWNBACK, Senator WELLSTONE, and others dealing with sex trafficking. We also will be working to see what kind of agreement we might work out on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act while we are doing the sex trafficking bill, if we can get agreement on that. 
   After this series of three different things are worked through, then we will see if there is a possibility under that arrangement or even a likelihood that we could have a vote later on this afternoon. At this time, I couldn't say what time, but I presume 5:30 or 6:00. At that point, we could announce what would occur next. 
   With regard to next week, I might go ahead and say that we are still discussing the possibility of clearing some nominations and having some debate time on those on Monday, and going to Agriculture appropriations on Tuesday with an understanding that there is a need for the House to act on that before we complete it. The Senate doesn't want to give up any of its rights. It has emergency funds in it, in addition to the regular appropriations bill. 
   If we don't get started on the Agriculture appropriations bill early in the week on Tuesday, it is going to be very hard to finish that bill next week. But it would be our intent to stay on it until we complete it. That could be Thursday night, it could be Friday, or it could be Saturday. But it is emergency Agriculture as well as regular Agriculture appropriations items. 
   I think it is essential that we find a way to commit ourselves to get that legislation through before we leave.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, under that debate time, I would say again that I believe Senator GORTON wishes to make a statement at this time. I see Senator MCCONNELL is here, and I presume Senator LEAHY, who is also here,  may want to talk about the content of this legislation and discuss how we are going to find a way to get it completed. 
   I know we have a problem in that the House has not acted on this legislation. But we also need to go ahead and move forward on it. It has emergency funding in it for the counternarcotics program in Colombia. It has the Israeli peace process funds in it and debt relief dealing with Iraqi opposition, and a lot of other very important items. 
   I think we need to discuss that and decide how we are going to be able to proceed in an emergency way on this legislation. 
   Having said that, while that debate is taking place, we will be working to see if we can work out an agreement on the next bill that will be called up relatively shortly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my good friend, Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale. Last month marked the tenth anniversary of Judge Barksdale's investiture as a United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit. On April 1, 1990, Judge Barksdale was sworn into office by Justice Byron White, for whom Judge Barksdale clerked following his graduation from the University of Mississippi School of Law. Throughout the past ten years Judge Barksdale has faithfully fulfilled his sworn duty to enforce the Constitution and laws of the United States. Needless to say, his service to the Fifth Circuit has brought distinction to his family, our State, and the Nation. 
   I might add that this country is indebted to Judge Barksdale for more than his zealous commitment to justice. His service as a Circuit Judge continues a lifetime of dedication and sacrifice to protect the freedoms and liberties of all Americans, as exemplified by his valiant and decorated service to his country during the Vietnam War. Judge Barksdale served in combat in Vietnam as an officer in the United States Army, and he was awarded a number of medals, including the Silver Star, Purple Heart, Bronze Star for Valor, and Bronze Star for Meritorious Service. 
   Mr. President, Mississippians and Americans are grateful for Judge Barksdale's public service, and I congratulate and honor him on the tenth anniversary of his service on the bench.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues that I have just put in a phone call to Senator DASCHLE and advised him of how I wish to proceed. 
   What is at stake here is, can we go forward and make progress with the work we do in the Senate on our appropriations bills? Can we complete the military construction appropriations bill and have debate that we want to have on the Kosovo issue and include it as a provision? And it is not partisan. Can we go on to the foreign relations appropriations bill that has the emergency money for Colombia in it? Can  we go to the agriculture appropriations bill which has the emergency and disaster money in it or are we going to be faced every time we bring up appropriations bills with nongermane amendments? Under rule XVI, they can be ruled out of order only by the Chair. But if it is a sense of the Senate, the Chair has not ruled and has basically submitted it to the Senate for determination. 
   I am going to make a point of order that the Lott amendment--my amendment--violates rule XVI, that it is sense-of-the-Senate language on an appropriations bill, and that the Chair should rule on the germaneness question. If the Chair does not rule on that, then we will submit it to the Senate and we will have a vote on that question. Assuming a majority votes for that, then nongermane sense-of-the-Senate resolutions will be ruled out of order just as any other nongermane amendment. 
   I want to emphasize, germane amendments and germane sense-of-the-Senate resolutions would clearly be in order. But if we are going to deal with these emergencies, if we are going to get our work done and assist the appropriators in moving these very important, very difficult bills, we are going to have to get some clarity on this issue. 
   That is what I plan to do. We expect the Chair to rule, and then we will move to a vote on that. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending Lott amendment violates rule XVI; that it is sense-of-the-Senate language on an appropriations bill, and that the Chair should rule on the germaneness question.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have worked out a good agreement on how to proceed on the issues before us and the time that would be used this afternoon, tonight, and into tomorrow. Let me read that, and if there are any questions, I will respond. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the vote now occur on the appeal of the ruling of the Chair and, immediately following that vote, the point of order be withdrawn, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Lott amendment No. 3150, to be followed by a vote on the Daschle amendment No. 3148, all without intervening action or debate. 
   I further ask that following those votes, Senator LEVIN be recognized to offer a strike amendment relative to Kosovo and there be 10 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form, with 75 minutes of the opponent's time under the control of Senator BYRD, and no amendments in order prior to the vote. 
   I also ask consent that the vote occur in relation to the Levin amendment at 2:30 p.m., Thursday, and, following that vote, Senator BURNS be recognized to offer a series of cleared amendments on behalf of the managers, and, following those, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 4425, and all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 2521, as amended, be inserted, the bill be immediately advanced to third reading, and a vote occur on passage, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   I further ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendments and request a conference with the House and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees, which will be the subcommittee and the chairman and ranking member, if necessary, and, following the passage vote, the Senate bill be indefinitely postponed.

   Mr. LOTT. Well, we have a number of very important appropriations bills we want to move through the Senate, including appropriations bills with emergency provisions. In the case of the military construction bill, we have emergency funds, needed funds, for the Defense Department to reimburse accounts, such as operation maintenance, that have already been used to pay for the additional cost of fuel. In the case of foreign operations, we have language regarding the Colombian narcodrug war situation. In agriculture, of course, we have disaster funds included in that legislation. 
   The rule is very clear on germaneness when it is a substantive amendment, and the germaneness point also lies against budget resolutions and, under rule XXII, cloture votes and on reconciliation bills. 
   All this would say is, that germaneness point of order would be ruled on by the Chair, as it is in these other instances, in the future. Germane amendments would clearly still be in order. I assume they would be offered on many of these bills. It is a clarification of the rule XVI provision.

   Mr. LOTT. If it was raised 16 years ago, I guess that would be justification enough under the precedent of the Senate. Sense-of-the-Senate resolutions have been growing by leaps and bounds. You will recall that at the conclusion  of the budget resolution debate, Senator BYRD rose and objected to the proliferation of these sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, and something like 35 or 40 sense-of-the-Senate resolutions fell because of the concerns he raised. 
   We have a lot of important work to do. We have the people's business to deal with. We need to get appropriations for agriculture. I know the Senator feels strongly about that. We need to get transportation work done. There will be plenty of germane amendments, substantive amendments, to be offered. If we don't make it clear that rule XVI applies to the appropriations bills, both on substance and on sense of the Senates, a great deal of our time will be spent on both sides of the aisle--and this is not something just on one side or the other; unfortunately, we abuse it, too. 
   So that is the reason, to try to clarify that and facilitate doing the people's work. We should have completed this military construction bill last Thursday. 
   Here we are with a lot of issues really we should not be dealing with. You could argue about even some of the language that was included in the committee. But the fact is, we have got to get it done, and I am trying to find a way to help get that work done and still allow for appropriate germane amendments.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say that I certainly have shown my sympathy for what Senator BYRD has tried to do. I understand Senator LEVIN wanted to make sure he has thought through what is involved here. But I hope that we could go ahead and get this unanimous consent agreement and begin to make progress. Let's work with these two Senators to see if we can't find a way to accommodate each other's desires. I know that this is substantive. But I also know that the sponsors of the amendment to the language would have an opportunity to adjust it. I hope we can go ahead and get this agreement and proceed, and let's continue to work on that possibility.

   Mr. LOTT. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, there were a number of things said earlier today on which I just bit my lip and took it because I thought, for the greater good of the Chamber, we should get an agreement and move forward. There has been a lot of what I consider to be misinformation put out about this issue and why we were proceeding the way we were. Plus, I also feel personally maligned, and I do not appreciate it, I say to my colleagues. 
   I made the choice to leave the House and come to the Senate. I was on the Rules Committee. I could have stayed there. I could have been on the Rules Committee, but I chose to leave. I do not think we have any--I do not remember the term that was used earlier--God-given rights in this institution. 
   We all have certain rights, and I am going to work to protect those rights. When I believed Senator SCHUMER was not being treated properly, I spoke up. Last year, in a very critical moment when Senator BYRD was not being treated properly, I said: No, that is not right. 
   I am getting really tired of people questioning my commitment to the Senate and to the opportunity for debates and that I am trying to be a rules committee of one. 
   I tell you, what I am trying to do is find a way for the Senate to do its work. These charges that are leveled against me are nonsense. 
   One of the things I have done since I have been in the Senate and have been majority leader is I have studied the history of this institution. That is why I started the Leader's Lecture Series, because I wanted to know what previous majority leaders did. I read them on both sides. I can tell you what Senator Mansfield did. I can tell you what Senator Lyndon Johnson did. I can tell you what Senator BYRD, Senator Mitchell, Senator Dole, and Senator Baker did as majority leaders. 
   People talk about that civility has broken down, and there is acrimony. That is ridiculous. I think we have a very good relationship here. You may not get it the way you want it every time, but you do not have a guarantee that you get the results you want every time. 
   What it is really all about is getting the work of the Senate done, dealing with real bills and real issues, not playing games and saying: OK, we voted last year; we have not voted this year. OK, we voted last month; we have not voted this month. 
   Somebody has to be charged with the responsibility of trying to get the process to move forward. It falls to the responsibility of the majority and, therefore, the majority leader. 
   Am I the only guy here who thinks we ought to get the military construction appropriations bill done with the emergencies in it that the President asked for? 
   Am I the only guy here who thinks we ought to pass the foreign operations appropriations bill with the Colombian drug money in it, which we need to do, because there is a crisis developing down there? You talk about the situation in Kosovo. I think the situation in Colombia is a lot more dangerous for the long term. They are poisoning the minds of our children. Every day they are killing kids. 
   Am I the only one who thinks we ought to do the agriculture appropriations bill with the disaster money that is in it? Everybody says: We want it. We want it. When? When do you propose to do it? 
   The military construction appropriations bill should have been done last Thursday. It could have been done last Thursday. We could have had a debate on the Kosovo issue. I did not put that into this process. It was done at the subcommittee level. I might not have done it that way, but it is there. We have to deal with it. No, no, no, no, the word was we had to have talk about guns, driven by the Million Mom March. 
   You wanted debate. Yesterday at 4 o'clock, I said: OK, let's have debate. The rest of the night we will debate, tomorrow for 3 hours, and we will have a vote. No. We were told we have to have 12 hours for debate on this issue. And then, 4, 5 hours later, we wound up basically getting an agreement so people could talk for about the same time. Maybe you all were not aware I was trying to say, OK, let's have debate. 
   I want to go back to one other thing I said earlier. No, it is not a ``rules committee of one.'' It is a rules committee of the majority. There has to be fairness; there has to be understanding. You have to be able to make your speeches on both sides. We want that. But to have these 
   sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that make these great, profound statements but don't result in any substantive action, I think that is a very serious problem.

   Mr. LOTT. We had in our budget resolution provisions that stopped sense-of-the-Senate resolutions from being voted on repeatedly, over--well, 45 of them right at the end of the session. 
   Now, somebody said we are trying to shut down Senate debate. We had debate. We had 6 or more hours on this issue. We debated it 4. We had debate on it last week on the so-called gun issue. We had debate and votes on it last year. 
   As a matter of fact, we have bills in conference on a number of these issues on which we are going to act. I am working on them one by one. We have  the FAA authorization conference report. We have the African trade conference report. We are working, in a bipartisan way, to see if we can get the bankruptcy conference report. We are working on e-commerce. 
   Nobody is trying to shut the Senate down. We are trying to get the Senate to move forward and do its work. 
   As far as order and comity, I support that. I am going to do everything I can to continue to support that. But I think for us to have basically 1, 2, 3, 4 days tied up having debate on gun amendments instead of having debate on Kosovo and the military construction appropriations bill is not the way we should be operating. 
   We have this language in conference. We voted on it last year in the juvenile justice bill. Maybe you forgot. But last year I said, with advanced notice: OK, we are going to have the juvenile justice bill. It is going to be open for amendment. We were going to finish it; start on Monday and get through on Thursday. It took another whole week. My trying to be helpful and cooperative wound up causing all kinds of problems for us. 
   I think it is important that we put this in perspective. We had the two votes. What has been proven here? One of them--a resolution--we agreed to by a vote of 69-30, saying: Hey, we have laws on the books. Why don't we enforce the gun laws? Why don't we arrest people who are using guns in the commission of crimes? Why don't we stop people from taking guns into schools? Why don't we take actions instead of just talking about it? 
   More laws on the books. Oh, that's the solution: More laws. Let's take away people's rights instead of enforcing the laws that are on the books. 
   But we got an overwhelming vote on that. Then again, we got a vote of 50-49 telling the conference to act before Memorial Day. Well, great. The Senate is going to tell the conference to act before Memorial Day? Do you know how much weight that really carries? Zero. 
   They are going to get a juvenile justice bill. Will it be to the perfect liking of me or anybody else in this Chamber? I doubt it. But they are going to get a result. 
   So this is a lot of sound and fury that is not going to produce results in terms of the Justice Department enforcing the laws on the books or in terms of getting the conference to provide a final action. 
   I have been pushing to act on that conference report. In fact, I am pushing every conference report. But I have to go on the record saying I do believe I have been maligned unfairly. I have bent over backward to try to give notice when we were going 
   to call up a bill and to have cooperation with the Democratic leadership to make sure Senators had a chance to make their case. 
   But to come in here and think we have to have a right to offer nongermane amendments to every appropriations bill that comes through, and then criticize us for not getting our work done--oh, boy, that is really smart--really smart: Yes, we demand our rights to offer our issues. By the way, why aren't you guys getting these bills done? 
   I do not believe the American people are being fooled by all of this. 
   So I will end with this. I will not impugn other people's actions or integrity. I am going to try very hard to make sure we are civil in the way we act and that we have a relationship. But also I hope you will understand that I am trying to get bills done. 
   Some people say: You worry too much about running the railroad. Somebody has to do that. I guess it is my responsibility. Somebody has to try to see if we can get these appropriations bills done before the end of the year so we don't get to the end of the session and schools don't know what they are going to get, parks don't know what they are going to get, while we are wrangling around here to see who is going to get primacy over the other. 
   I am saying let's do these appropriations bills. I am going to give priority to the appropriations bills over everything else. I would like to do the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill next week, but we have people who want to offer nongermane, nonrelevant amendments that are going to tie that up probably for all week. So instead, we will go to the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   But before we leave next week, we are going to have to do the military construction appropriations bill, the foreign operations appropriations bill, and the agriculture appropriations bill. In the process, if we could have a little cooperation, I think we could get a lot of nominations done. Hopefully, we can come to an agreement on how to complete action on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   I am going to offer a unanimous consent request next week or tomorrow to have more amendments on education, but let's see if we can find a way to get to a conclusion on education. I presume the Democrats are going to object because they want to offer issues that do not relate to elementary and secondary education. 
   Let me say I suspect there might be objections on this side, too, because people want to offer amendments that are going to do nothing but cause problems and probably defeat the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I do not think that is good. I think we need to address this issue of education. 
   So I wanted to take advantage of some of this 15 minutes. I do not know how much time is left. But I had it on my chest, and I had to hold it earlier, so now I feel better. I hope maybe we all got some of this out of our system and we can move on to get our work done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. I yield myself time under my leader time and leave the remaining 4 minutes for others who might want to speak on the gun issue. 
   If that is the way it is going to be, then that is the way it is going to be. One of the things that shocked me in the last day in talking about things that you don't appreciate is, yesterday, I had no notice at all that this issue was going to come up. I found out when I came on the floor. I had not seen the amendment to be offered. I had no notice whatsoever. 
   Earlier this year, when there was an incident where I took an action and the Democrats had not been notified, it was called to my attention--because I thought they had been--so I apologized and said we would correct that, and we did. But if it is over, it is over. This can go all ways. We can just draw the line and not get any work done. We can just not have cooperation if that is the way they want it to be. But it extends across the board. I don't think that is the way to proceed. 
   I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the minority in trying to get our work done. If you want to go through this approach, if you want to shut down everything, then everybody loses in that process. We can cooperate and we can get these bills done. 
   As far as issues coming up where we don't like it--in fact, one of the Senators I have been concerned about--and one of the issues on this Elementary and Secondary Education Act is that we have a Senator who wants to offer something dealing with 
   NCAA gaming, and there is an objection on the Democratic side. I have gone to the colleague on this side and said this is not relevant to this issue, doesn't relate to elementary and secondary education, and we ought not to do that. After a lot of back and forth, he came back and said: OK, if we can get it up some other way, I will agree to back off of that for now. 
   But on both sides we have Senators who want to offer things that will cause mischief and delay or kill a bill. That happens. If you have an elementary and secondary education issue that comes up and somebody offers a killer amendment, we stall out right there. It might not be on this side. 
   So it takes a lot of cooperation around here on both sides. I think we have had that pretty much for 4 years. Both leaders have to look after their members. You have members who want to be heard. You have to try to get them in there. In fact, every one of these issues that I hear complaints about, we voted on all those issues. We voted on all of them over the last year. Maybe not this year or last month, but they have been voted on. So I hope it doesn't come to this. 
   I have tried to avoid having an acrimonious relationship. Maybe it is unavoidable in this election year, but I think that would be a shame for the American people because, after all, that is about whom we should be thinking. 
   Regarding these conference reports, I have never seen a more bipartisan effort than what we had on the Africa and CBI trade bill. I don't know whether it was some sort of legally constituted conference or not. Sometimes the House doesn't appoint conferees, but we have an obligation to keep trying to work. Senator MOYNIHAN was there, Senator ROTH was involved, as were Chairman ARCHER and Congressman RANGEL. It was totally bipartisan. 
   It was one way, one side, or one party or the other trying to get the upper hand on the other. 
   The reason we are doing what we are doing on bankruptcy is that we are trying to find a way to move bankruptcy so we can then extract the minimum wage issue. We have people on one side or the other objecting to it. What do you propose we do? What I propose we do is to get our work done right across the board. I am willing to try to do that. 
   But if we are going to hold our breath, turn red in the face and threaten, then that is the way it will be. But everybody needs to understand that in that kind of relationship nobody wins; everybody loses. More importantly, this body and the American people lose because we have a lot of work we need to do together. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope I have some time left because I do need to put some things in the RECORD. 
   With regard to cloture votes, I have studied the masters. 
   First of all, we now have to file cloture on the motion to proceed because we are told it is going to be filibustered. Even the motion to go to a bill is being filibustered, and there has been a tremendous increase in that. 
   We are not filibustering even the substance of the bill but the motion to proceed to the bill. 
   Let me give you some statistics. 
   When Senator BYRD was majority leader, he filed 87 cloture motions. There was one cloture vote on a conference report. 
   The average cloture votes per Congress: 289. 
   Senator Mitchell filed 166 cloture motions--26 cloture motions on conference reports, and then 35 motions that were withdrawn or vitiated. That is another thing. Quite often we have to file cloture; we get an agreement, and we vitiate it. 
   Senator Dole--so everybody understands this is not partisan--filed 91 cloture motions: 5 cloture motions on conference reports, and 21 of them were withdrawn. 
   These are some interesting statistics about how we proceed around here. When we are having a filibuster, either we have amendments or we debate. That is the only option the majority leader has. 
   I wanted to get that in the RECORD. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from West Virginia engage in a colloquy with me because I am very interested in his remarks. I have the highest respect for his efforts in this body, and I listened closely to what he had to say. 
   I believe there has been a lot of misunderstanding or misinterpretation or misinformation about what is in this legislation. Perhaps this was not the best place to put this language, but certainly the timing is propitious. This issue is upon us. 
   Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS, two of the most respected Senators in this body and senior members on the Appropriations Committee--Senator STEVENS is obviously very much interested in the condition of our military troops, what they are doing, and where they are, and the same is true with Senator BYRD. Maybe it is an oversimplification, but as I understand it, the Byrd-Warner language will really do two things: One, say the President should certify to the Congress by this summer--the exact day is July 15?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes to say that I thought a good bit about this issue--both Kosovo and the Byrd-Warner language. I have not been quick to make a final judgment or to make comments, but I have concluded that this is the right thing to do. I want to emphasize, again, I say that knowing full well that the President has problems with it. I  think they are overreacting to what is in this language.

   Mr. LOTT. Now our candidate for the nomination, our presumptive nominee, has said he is concerned about Presidential prerogatives. I understand. All Presidential candidates and Presidents worry about that. 
   But we have a responsibility here, too. What about the prerogatives, what about the responsibility of the Congress? I think the American people want to know what is going on. They are unaware, really, of what is going on and not asking about it. They are not really aware of the commitment we have there. They don't really know that perhaps our allies are not fulfilling their commitments. They have not done it in terms of personnel or money. And why is because they do not have to. They know Uncle Sam will take care of this problem. 
   I had occasion to meet with the President of one of our ally countries. I said: Why aren't you fulfilling your commitment? Why don't you do more? Why don't you do what you said you were going to do? Only after a brief silence, he said: You are the world leader. You are the only surviving power. It is your responsibility. 
   That is kind of the attitude, frankly, of some of our allies--yes, you are the big guy. You have to take care of it. Yes, it is in our backyard. This is supposed to be a 
   peacekeeping initiative. But you will handle it. We don't have to do that. 
   In their defense, to be honest, I think because of Senator WARNER's efforts, and others, because of complaints I made to some of our allies, they are beginning to do a better job. 
   I believe the President will be able to meet this certification. But I think it is important that our allies in NATO do what they say they were going to do. I am hesitant for us to even reduce the requirements of what they should have to do. 
   But I tell you what is really bothering me. We wonder, how long are we going to stay there? We have been in some parts of the world for 50 years. We have been sending troops now to every little place imaginable around the world. There is no end in sight in Bosnia; no end in sight in Kosovo; no plan, no end game. We do not know what is going to be the final outcome. We are just there. Then each year this administration, and the next administration--Democrat or Republican--will show up and say: Sorry, we had this problem. We had to spend the money. We spent $1 billion. We spent $1.5 billion in Kosovo, not to mention what we are spending in Bosnia. We had to take it out of other defense accounts, O&M, operation and maintenance--very important things--and now you have to give us the money, because if you don't give us the money, then we are not going to be supporting our troops. 
   Then we are in a bind, without any real accountability, without having input, without voting to authorize it, without knowing what the end game is--without anything. Then we just ante up the money. You are not talking chicken feed. You are talking a lot of money. We have to stop that. 
   I noted what Senator BYRD said. And I would say, for myself, when the vote comes to authorize it, I think we would be hard pressed not to authorize keeping troops there. Certainly we would be for the support of troops. 
   But if the case was made, if we knew what we were getting into, we knew how much it was going to cost, how long it was going to last, I think that a persuasive case would be made. And I have not made up my mind how I would vote. I want to see what it is. 
   But that is not where we are now. People are saying: You are taking action now. You are going to have these difficult problems on your hands next year. That is one of the reasons why I want to deal with it now. I want us to make sure everybody understands we have to have an accounting; we have to have a plan. 
   We cannot put our men, our women, our ships, our planes in every corner of this world indefinitely with no plan. We are still dealing with Iraq. We probably had sorties today. We probably bombed somebody, while we are counting on them to produce 700 million barrels of oil for us, I guess it is. The hypocrisy of it bothers me, too. 
   I know it is expected that the majority leader of the Senate would automatically just say: No, we can't have this out of the Appropriations Committee. We don't want to tie the hands of the next President. It could be a President from your party. 
   That really offends me. This is bigger than that. I believe some of the comments that have been made questions the integrity, the patriotism of the sponsors of this legislation. I think that is totally inappropriate. They would not do that. 
   So as for myself, unless there is something dramatic that changes, I plan to support this language. I urge my colleagues to take a look at what is really in it. Do not be misguided by incorrect information that is being put out there. Ask yourself: Are you satisfied with the situation in Kosovo? I think the answer is no. 
   So I thank the two sponsors of this legislation. I hope the language stays in the bill.

   Mr. LOTT. I certainly agree. I have found, as I have gone to my own State and other States, that when people find out what we are doing there--the commitment we have there in terms of the facilities and the troops involved, and how much it is costing; and the fact that we have never voted to authorize; we do not know where we are headed, how long it is going to take, how much it is going to cost, what the plan is--they are horrified. They basically look at me--and I can see it in their eyes-- and they are thinking: What are you going to do about it? 
   It is our responsibility.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure this morning to introduce and cosponsor, with the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, S. 2557, the Energy Security Act of 2000. 
   There is a dark cloud on the horizon for America's future and for our economy and for job creation. This cloud could cause serious problems in the future. That cloud is the fact that we don't have a national energy policy. Despite a lot of rhetoric that we do--there is nothing to worry about--there is plenty to worry about. 
   The American people remember the long lines we faced at the gasoline stations in the 1970s. At that time, we were dependent on foreign oil for much less than 50 percent, probably around 45 percent at the time. We passed legislation in an attempt to deal with that problem and, for a variety of reasons, the prices came back down. The problem was not resolved, and the problem is much worse today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. It says in this article that crude oil prices were back up to nearly $30 a barrel yesterday, and for the last month our dependency on foreign oil was in the range of 60 percent. This is going to have an effect on the price of fuel oil. It will have an effect on the price of gasoline. It will have an effect on the economy. While we saw some leveling off or some general slide back, we have done nothing to secure our country's energy future. 
   Earlier, I tried to put in place some reduction in the Federal gasoline tax, to stop until the end of the year the 4.3-cent Federal gasoline tax that was added back in the early 1990s and say if nationwide gas reached an average of $2 a gallon, we would suspend the entire Federal gasoline tax for the balance of the year. The Senate was not inclined to go along with that. 
   My purpose was a wakeup call--first, that gasoline prices are probably not going to go down; more than likely, they will go up. But the wakeup call was bigger than that, to try to make people realize that we don't have a national energy policy. 
   What are we going to do? I ask the American people: Do we feel safe with the idea we are dependent on foreign oil, OPEC oil, oil from Iraq, oil from Libya? I don't. What if they decide not only to turn down the spigots but to turn the spigots off? What would America do? Within 30 days we would be in serious trouble. 
   Now, we have a strategic oil reserve, and that was a very wise decision; it could be helpful in dealing with a national security emergency. It would help deal with a crisis created if the spigot should be cut off. However, I think to not have a plan to be less dependent on foreign oil is irresponsible. We can't tolerate it. 
   So what are we going to do? We know now we are dependent on the foreign oil imports to the tune of 56 percent of oil consumed, compared to 36 percent imported in 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo. Even the Department of Energy predicts America will import at least 65 percent of foreign oil for our energy needs by the year 2020. Secretary Richardson even admitted that the administration had been caught napping when energy prices began to rise a few weeks ago. 
   We appointed a task force to deal with this problem, to look at it, to see what we could do to address our energy needs for the future. It is a multifaceted proposal, not only aimed at gasoline or oil but across the spectrum. This task force has been working to find these reasonable solutions to give us more of our own energy supplies. Chairman MURKOWSKI has headed that task force. This task force has been a diverse group, including Senators from all over the country--Senator CRAIG from Idaho, who is on the floor; Senator NICKLES from Oklahoma; Senator HUTCHISON from Texas; also Senators from the Midwest and Northeast, including Senator COLLINS of Maine; Senator SNOWE; Senator ROTH of Delaware; Senator SANTORUM of Pennsylvania, Senator SMITH of New Hampshire. They have worked together and have come up with a proposal that I think will make a real difference. It will encourage alternative sources. It will try to enhance the use of renewable energy resources, including hydro, nuclear, coal, solar, and wind. 
   We need to increase our domestic supplies of nonrenewable 
   resources, including oil and natural gas. In my own State of Mississippi, and in the gulf off the coast, we have a tremendous supply of natural gas. Natural gas is relatively cheap and is a very clean source of energy. Yet there is no incentive to make greater use of natural gas. We have more oil deposits. We know it. Some of them are in marginal wells, some are in large areas such as off the coast of Alaska. We have to do something to take advantage of these resources, give incentives to take advantage of them. 
   I absolutely support the effort by the Alaskan Senators who advocate getting the oil off the coast of Alaska in  what is commonly referred to as ANWR. 
   We should also look at unique needs within the country, in the Northeast where they have extraordinarily cold weather, compared to my part of the country, where people are dependent on home heating fuel. We need to strengthen the Department of Energy weatherization program. We need to establish a State-led education program to encourage consumers to take actions to minimize seasonal price increases and fuel shortages. We should authorize the expensing of costs associated with building new home heating oil storage. We should authorize the Secretary to build a home heating oil reserve. If we don't do that, more than likely there will be a problem in the Northeast next year. We have a number of tax incentives that would encourage more production. We would provide relief for marginal wells. 
   By the way, these so-called marginal wells are responsible for 50 percent of U.S. production, so they may be marginal but they are significant. It allows for expensing of oil and gas exploration costs. It would delay rental payments. The 1999 Taxpayer Relief Act had a 5-year carryback provision, and that is included. 
   Finally, there is an expansion of tax credits for renewable energy to include wind and biomass facilities. Some people say we shouldn't be giving any kind of consideration or breaks to people who are out there trying to produce more oil and gas; they may not need it; it may not be good for the environment. 
   What do you mean? That is the most fallacious argument of all. It can be done safely and cleanly and we need that resource. The alternative is to go ahead and continue to be dependent on OPEC and other countries for our energy needs. It is irresponsible. 
   This is a broad package. It is a good package. I thank Senator MURKOWSKI and the task force for their work. We will talk more about it later. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a look at this. This is something that should not be partisan. It is not partisan. It should be bipartisan. It will help our country all across the Nation both in terms of energy needs and in terms of energy production. This is not something that is aimed only at this administration. I emphase this administration has no plan to deal with this problem, but this administration is going to be leaving shortly. What are we going to do about the future? We need to come together. We cannot continue down the path we are headed. If we do, I predict disaster looms on the horizon. I want to make sure that we make our best effort to do something about it so we can avert this disaster. 
   I yield the floor.

   Some Senators may wish to take some time to speak on that issue. I also encourage colleagues that we work toward getting a time agreement tomorrow afternoon on the Kosovo issue, have a reasonable time, but have a focused, good debate and vote on that issue so we can complete the military construction appropriations bill. We are getting far afield from getting our work done on the appropriations bills. We would then go to the foreign operations appropriations bill. I encourage Senators to stay and make speeches tonight on these subjects.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary young man who has persevered to overcome significant obstacles in his life and who, in spite of these obstacles, has excelled. Lampton O'Neal ``Trey'' Williams III, of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, exemplifies the qualities of courage, dedication, commitment, and self-discipline that harken back to the days of this great nation's founding fathers who likewise employed these values to overcome seemingly insurmountable adversity. With this graduation from the Presbyterian Christian School in Hattiesburg on Friday, May 19, 2000, I express my most heartfelt and warmest congratulations to Trey on this extraordinary accomplishment. 
   As a deaf student, Trey has been saddled in life with a hardship that many of us will never be forced to carry. Yet, from an early age, Trey refused to allow his disability to overcome him and, instead, set out to conquer his disability. As a young boy, Trey was enrolled in The University of Southern Mississippi DuBard School for Language Disorders where his eagerness, ability to learn, and refusal to yield to his disability quickly warmed him to the hearts of all around him. During his tenure at the DuBard School, Trey excelled in speech, lip reading, learning language and academic skills. However, Trey's passion for learning and his commitment to his education did not end there. 
   In 1992, having secured from the DuBard School the skills and abilities he would need to live a full and free life with his disability, Trey took the noble and daunting step of enrolling in regular education classes at the Presbyterian Christian School in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Throughout his years at the Presbyterian Christian School Trey has continuously challenged himself and has demanded only the best from himself. His motivation, self-discipline and character have earned Trey the highest praise from his teachers and the respect of all who know him. And while Trey's forthcoming graduation from the Presbyterian Christian School is a truly extraordinary achievement in and of itself, it is only part of the story. As the result of his academic excellence and exceptional accomplishments over the past several years, Trey has earned a college scholarship. I have no doubt that Trey's strength of character and commitment to his education will result in a college career marked with awards and honors only few can ever expect to achieve. 
   Mr. President, Trey's dedication, commitment and perseverance is unique and truly commendable. With his graduation on May 19, 2000, Trey will receive a concrete representation of his years of perseverance--his diploma. And while his accomplishments thus far deserve the highest praise and commendation, I have no doubt this young man's future will be marked by even greater accomplishments. Trey's refusal to yield to his disability and his determination to overcome it should serve as an inspiration and motivation to all of us. It is an example of what we can achieve when we demand the most from ourselves. I want to extend my highest congratulations to Trey on his graduation and wish only the best for him in the future.

In this case, we are actually trying to protect the ranking member, Senator MURRAY, from Washington State. We ought to be able to work through that. I hope Senators will be understanding of the managers' desire to make some progress on the MILCON bill today. But at their request, which I think is reasonable, we will strike the ``relative to the bill'' part of the request and I will renew it.

I assume that Senators who wish to speak on this subject will want to talk with the managers of that MILCON bill, including the Senator from Washington on the other side of the aisle, who has a time problem, and work something out. I assume you can get that worked out.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator DODD, and Senator GRASSLEY, for their comments. They are absolutely right. This is the way we can do things when we make up our minds that we are going to. Keep in mind that just a year ago, most people thought this had no chance. The House passed a bill that was only applicable to Africa. But then Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN said we should go forward on this. They made the point that we had not had a major trade bill in--I thought 5 years, but in fact it was 6 years. I yielded to the distinguished Senator from New York because he pays such close attention to this. The chairman and ranking member said we should go forward with this and we should add the CBI region and Central America to the package. We did that. 
   We worked together across the aisle between the two parties. The administration did express its interest in this legislation. The President personally called at least twice--maybe three times--and talked about his hope that we could get this done. But I remember a critical moment a month or so ago, late at night, and we were trying to make the last decision that would close the package up. Dave Hoppe, my chief of staff, was there, and Jim Hecht on my staff, who worked so hard on this legislation, who knew the substance better than I would ever know it. It is mind-boggling in its detail and all the pieces that were in this package. But when I had to basically help make the final decision, as a matter of fact, I was looking at Senator MOYNIHAN's staff and said, ``What do you think? Can we make this work?'' They said, ``Yes.'' 
   That is the way it was. It wasn't partisan at all. To reach this point now and have a vote in the House last week of 309-110, and then 77-19 in the Senate, in an area where we have acrimony, regional division, and one sector of the economy pulling against the other, I think this is something we should take a moment and relish and take credit for and be proud of. It represents a significant step forward in our trade policy and a victory for the cause of free trade. Like Senator DODD, I have been to Central America and met with the Presidents and Ambassadors from Central America and the Caribbean. They pleaded for this and said, ``Give us an opportunity.'' 
   This is the way to help. This is the way to help their people and give them an opportunity to get jobs. It will help you, and it will help us. 
   I suspect there will be a celebration today and tonight in Central America, in the Caribbean, and in Africa. 
   I want to make this point. While that is important, we want free trade and this is good for America. I worked a great deal with CHARLIE RANGEL, the Congressman from New York, who really wanted this. I remember a fateful meeting we had outside an elevator in the Cannon Office Building at which I said, basically, if you do Africa, we will do CBI, and we will get together. And we did. He said in some of our meetings: I don't want a bill that is going to cost America jobs. I believe we can have a bill that helps America, creates more American jobs and more opportunity for Americans, and that will be good for the sub-Sahara region and for Central America. I believe we achieved that. 
   This bill retains the basic structure and approach of the original Senate bill. I want to emphasize that because we made a commitment to Senators who had reservations about this bill that we would do everything possible to retain the basic structure of the Senate bill. We fought for it, and I think we were successful in that area. 
   The approach makes economic sense, allowing workers and businesses in this country and in our trading partners' to specialize in the activities to which they are most suited. The vast majority of the trade benefits under this bill will involve the use of U.S.-made components. They need it in those other regions. They need our yarn. They need our cotton. So we will benefit, and they will benefit. 
   I am acutely aware of the concerns and challenges facing our domestic textile industry. Faced with vast amounts of unfair trade and blatant cheating in past textile agreements, our industry has seen a flood of foreign imports that have caused job losses.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately proceed to a vote on the motion to proceed to the African trade and CBI enhancement conference report. If the motion to proceed is adopted, cloture will be filed, and debate will begin on the conference report immediately. Many Senators have expressed interest in making statements on this important legislation, and therefore the debate is expected to consume most of today's session. 
   By previous consent, the vote on cloture on the conference report will occur at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday morning. Following disposition of the African-Carribean Basin legislation, the Senate will begin consideration of appropriations bills as they become available for action. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   H.R. 434--CONFERENCE REPORT 
   I extend my congratulations to the Finance Committee for their efforts in the conference on this bill. Chairman ROTH was very much involved in the development of a very good conference report. I recognize the Senator from New York and his very effective staff for their involvement. 
   We have not had a major piece of trade legislation pass the Congress in 5 years. I think this is a tremendous accomplishment. I think it is going to be good for the American people, for American jobs, for consumers, for sub-Saharan Africa, for the Caribbean and Central American countries, and good for the industries that are connected in this trade area. 
   So I congratulate all those who were involved in this conference. I am very pleased to see we will take it up and I certainly plan to vote for it.

   Mr. LOTT. If I could get this unanimous consent request in, then we would understand what the procedure would be for today and tomorrow and even Thursday morning. So if my colleagues will bear with me one moment. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, the Senate proceed to the conference report to accompany the Africa trade bill, that the report be considered as having been read, and the vote occur on adoption of the motion to proceed immediately, and following the vote and the reporting by the clerk, I be immediately recognized to send a cloture motion to the desk. I also ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote occur on Thursday, May 11, at 10:30 a.m., with the mandatory quorum having been waived. 
   This has been discussed with the Democratic leadership.

   Mr. LOTT. Let me again emphasize, first, that this would provide for a vote at 9:30 in the morning on the motion to proceed to the Africa and CBI trade bill. If it is agreed to, then the cloture vote, by agreement, will be Thursday morning at 10:30. 
   With regard to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, our colleagues probably are aware we have already agreed that there are two more amendments that, by unanimous consent, we would go to next--the Stevens-Jeffords and others amendment; to be followed by a Kennedy amendment. So we have the next group of two amendments that would be in order. 
   I have discussed this with Senator DASCHLE. It is our intent, now that we have appropriations bills that are becoming available, that, for probably now on into the summer, we are going to be dual-tracking bills wherever it is necessary, so we can get an appropriations bill done or an urgent bill such as the conference report on Africa trade and CBI. There is a belief we should go ahead and get that done and move to appropriations bills when they are available, and then come back to the authorizations, whether it is the elementary and secondary education bill or trade bill or whatever it may be. 
   So it is our intent to come back to ESEA and proceed with the amendments that it is already been agreed we will consider next while we work to see if we can get another grouping of two or more amendments to be considered. 
   I agree, there has been good debate. The amendments have been focused on elementary and secondary education, and we have amendments still pending on both sides that relate to that. As long as there is that kind of cooperation and progress being made, I think we should continue to pursue it. 
   So it is my intent to come back to elementary and secondary education, if not later on this week, then next week, when we have a window.

   Mr. LOTT. That is my hope and intent. We should be able to do that and continue to move appropriations bills, also. 
   Again, it will take cooperation on the MILCON construction appropriations bill, which does have the military funding for Kosovo and for the fuel costs. We have the agriculture bill that is available that has, I believe, the disaster funding in it in addition to the regular agricultural appropriations programs. And the Foreign Operations bill has been reported. 
   But we will work with the leadership as to exactly when those will come up. We will try to move through those three as quickly as we can and try to move the Africa trade bill with the CBI provisions, and the ESEA. I think those three appropriations bills and these two--the conference report and this authorization bill--will take the remainder of the time probably for the next couple weeks. We are going to stay on it.

   Mr. LOTT. Therefore, a rollcall vote will occur at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and a vote is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Thursday. There may be additional votes after that. 
   I think Members should expect additional votes on Thursday, although we have not agreed to what they would be at this point. 
   I do want to note that I certainly believe the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is very important. That is why we have been on it the second week. We have given a lot of time to it. I think that is fine. This is a high priority in the minds of the American people and every State in the Nation, and with us. 
   However, the appropriations bills each have emergency provisions in them--an emergency for the Kosovo funding and the fuel costs for our military; the agriculture bill has the emergency disaster funding in it, though some of it for North Carolina, and expected disasters; and the Foreign Operations bill has funding in it for the very dangerous situation involving Colombian drugs. That is why we are going to be trying to move those as quickly as possible. 
   I thank my colleagues and announce there will be no further votes this evening.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the exemplary service and career of an outstanding naval officer, Captain William H. Lewis, upon his retirement from the Navy at the conclusion of more than 27 years of commissioned service. Throughout his distinguished career, Captain Lewis has truly epitomized the Navy core values of honor, courage, and commitment. It is my privilege to commend him for a superb career of service he has provided the Navy and our great Nation. 
   Captain Lewis is a native of Newburgh, New York. He studied civil engineering at the Ohio State University on a Naval Reserve Officer Training Command scholarship. He also received his Master's degree in Civil Engineering at Ohio State on an Environmental Protection Agency Fellowship before being commissioned as a Navy Civil Engineer Corps officer in 1973. Captain Lewis later attended L'Universita di Perugia, Italy, and the Executive Program at the University of Michigan. 
   His first tour of duty was at Naval Station Treasure Island as the Assistant Public Works Officer. He became Treasure Island's first Staff Civil Engineer with the commissioning of Public Works Center San Francisco Bay. He also had tours as an Assistant Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), ROICC San Francisco Bay Area, with Western Division (WESTDIV), Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), San Bruno, California; an instructor at the Civil Engineer Corps Officers School at Port Hueneme, California; and as the Flag Aide to the Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command and Chief of Civil Engineers. 
   In 1980, he served with the Seabees as the Alfa Company commander for U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) SIXTY-TWO homeported in my great State of Mississippi. The MINUTEMEN were deployed to Rota, Spain where they won the Battle E and Peltier Award as the best Seabee battalion in the Atlantic Fleet and entire fleet respectively. NMCB-62 also served in Roosevelt Roads where they redeployed to build a Cuban-Haitian refugee camp at Fort Allen and was the last full battalion deployed to Diego Garcia. In 1982, he returned to WESTDIV as the Assistant Head of the Acquisition Department. In that capacity, he served as the Air Force Program Coordinator for the Space Shuttle facilities for the military Space Transportation System program and the design of the $220 million David Grant 
   Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, Fairfield, California. In 1985, he was selected to be the Deputy Officer in Charge of Construction at Travis AFB on the largest firm fixed price construction contract awarded by NAVFAC that year. In 1986, he became the Staff Civil Engineer for Commander, Fleet Air Mediterranean in Naples, Italy responsible for the Navy's NATO Infrastructure Program and Project PRONTO. In 1989, he returned to Navy Public Works Center San Francisco Bay as the Production Officer and participated in the disaster recovery operations from the Loma Prieta earthquake. In 1992, he became Vice Commander at the Western Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, San Bruno, California. In 1994 he became the Commanding Officer, Engineering Field Activity, Mediterranean, Naples, Italy in support of the Fifth and Sixth Fleets and the Department of Defense's largest overseas construction program, including the Naples Improvement initiative, the bed down of the 31Tactical Fighter Wing at Aviano, Italy, and the force protection efforts at Bahrain. In 1997, he reported onboard as the Executive Officer, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southern Division (SOUTHDIV), Charleston, South Carolina. On May 14, 1998, he became the 27th Commanding Officer at SOUTHDIV. 
   Captain Lewis' awards include the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (third gold star), Navy Commendation Medal (second gold star), Air Force Commendation Medal and Navy Achievement Medal (gold star). He is a member of the Society of American Military Engineers and Tau Beta Pi and is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of California. Captain Lewis is Seabee Combat Warfare qualified, a member of the Acquisition Professional Community and holds a Level III (unlimited) NAVFAC Contracting warrant as well as a Level III (unlimited) Real Estate Contracting Warrant. 
   Captain Lewis' visionary leadership, exceptionally creative problem solving skills and uncommon dedication have created a legacy of achievement and excellence. The Great State of Mississippi has benefitted immensely from Captain Lewis' engineering leadership, both during his time as a junior officer serving with the Seabees in Gulfport, Mississippi and in his present capacity as commanding officer of SOUTHDIV. As Commander, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Captain Lewis was instrumental in completing projects throughout the Great State of Mississippi, to include critical waterfront projects at Naval Station Pascagoula; planning and design of a future Warfighting Center at Stennis, Mississippi, and a major Navy Family Housing complex in Gulfport. 
   Captain Lewis will retire on May 12, 2000 after 27 years of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Captain Lewis fair winds and following seas. Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.

   Mr. LOTT. Of course, as far as the timing, we have Senators that are very interested in speaking on the pending matter, in addition to the ones you have mentioned. 
   I must confess, I was a little surprised that there was a second-degree amendment offered to Abraham-Mack. I thought when we entered that earlier agreement we would have the four that were agreed to. While there was language in there that said that, I guess, relevant second degrees would be in order--or perfecting amendments--I had the impression we were kind of not going to do that. 
   So the fact that there is now an amendment to the Abraham-Mack amendment I think puts a different spin on things. Our people need to be able to review that and speak on the second-degree amendment. 
   In addition, I see Senator ABRAHAM, who is the sponsor of the underlying amendment. Basically, what I am saying is, I think it is going to take more time than we had earlier thought that it might take. And then we would want to look at, are we going to have a second-degree amendment or second-degree amendments on the Murray amendment? That would certainly change the mix once again. 
   We need to make sure we have enough time on both sides for people to speak on Lieberman and Gregg once we have seen those. Everybody is working in good faith, and it is a little complicated. We could have objections on either side about what might be offered as second-degree amendments. We have some people on both sides who are now saying they want to offer noneducation, nonrelevant amendments, and we have been trying to stay on the education issue. It has been a very healthy debate, and everybody has stayed in close touch. We would like to continue that. 
   I have to work with some people on our side who want to offer some amendments sort of out of line. I think people not even on the committee who want to offer amendments at this point would be pushing the envelope. We ought to at least give the chairman and ranking member and people with education amendments a chance to make their pitch. 
   So rather than take up a lot of time, I would like to talk with the Senator from Nevada about the amendments and the time that might be needed. We will try to get something worked out and come to the floor soon to get something agreed to. In the meantime, continue with the debate and we won't be losing time--valuable time, as a matter of fact.

We need to go forward with the way we have been trying to proceed and get our work done. But, no; the way it works around here is, if you can horn your way into a debate that is underway, then that is the way it is.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for allowing us to proceed with what I think is a fair agreement on how to proceed for the remainder of the afternoon. 
   We have had good debate this week on both sides of the aisle. There is a difference of opinion. When we get our unanimous consent agreement, or when we get it propounded and hopefully get an agreement, I do want to comment on some of the things I have heard over the past hour during debate and on the pending Abraham-Mack amendment. 
   But I think, first, it is important we get an understanding and agreement on how to proceed. Basically, the consent we would like to propound would be that the pending second-degree amendment be laid aside, and that Senator MURRAY be recognized to offer her amendment relative to class size, with no second-degree amendments in order, that we would ask consent for the votes to occur at 5 p.m. on the pending amendments, and the time between now and that hour be equally divided, and the votes would occur on or in relation to the amendments in the order they would be offered or have been offered. That sequence, of course, is the Kennedy second-degree amendment, the Abraham-Mack amendment, as amended, if amended, and then the Murray amendment. 
   Then we would ask consent that the next amendments in the sequence be basically in the following order: Lieberman, as an alternative; Gregg, with regard to Teachers' Bill of Rights; and McCain, regarding sports gambling. 
   We will see if we can get an agreement on that. If we cannot, then we will modify it in a way we hope we can get an agreement. 
   That is basically how we would like to proceed this afternoon. I think it is a fair way to proceed. We will be able to have another 2 1/2 hours, hopefully, of good debate. Then we can have some votes. 
   Then we will have things lined up for debate on Monday. I hope that we can get in several hours of debate on the amendments that would be pending at that point--the Lieberman amendment, the Gregg Teachers' Bill of Rights, and other education-related issues about which Senators may want to talk. Then we would move toward votes on Tuesday and/or Wednesday and Thursday, if necessary. That is basically the outline of how we would like to proceed. 
   As soon as I hear further from Senator DASCHLE, we will propound that UC. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, then, that the pending second-degree amendment be laid aside and that Senator MURRAY be recognized to offer her amendment relative to class size, and no second-degree amendments be in order. I further ask consent that votes occur at 5 p.m., with the time between now and then to be equally divided, and that the votes occur on or in relation to the amendments in the order in which they were offered, with no second-degree amendments in order.

But there was objection to that. He has agreed for us to proceed without an objection. 
   The same thing is true with Senator ASHCROFT. He has had a chance to review the situation. And our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to look at the substance of the amendment. There are a number of Senators who have amendments they want to have considered. We hope as we go forward they will be in the lineup at some point. 
   For now, we are just trying to get the rest of the afternoon agreed to and debate amendments that we will also be debating on Monday. Then we will take it from there. 
   Mr. President, let me propound the unanimous consent request again and see if we can get it cleared at this point. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the pending second-degree amendment be laid aside, that Senator MURRAY be recognized to offer her amendment relative to class size, and that no second-degree amendments be in order. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that votes occur at 5 p.m. with the time between now and then to be equally divided, and the votes occur on or in relation to the amendments in the order in which they were offered, with no second-degree amendments in order.

But let me just say I would like to amend the request beyond what we have already asked to the effect that I be recognized to speak for 5 minutes to be followed by 5 minutes by Senator LEAHY. I had been waiting to try to respond to some of the things that had been said on the debate before we reached this point. If I could just get 5 minutes followed by Senator LEAHY, then we would go on with the regular order, if that is all right with Senator DASCHLE.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, along the lines of what Senator REID just said, both sides have been working to try to keep our amendments and our debate on the underlying bill, the Elementary 
   and Secondary Education Act. This is a very important bill. Of course, its title is Educational Opportunities Act. 
   There is a lot that needs to be said. There is a lot that needs to be done to make sure our education and elementary and secondary schools are improved, that it is quality education, that it is safe and drug free. 
   We don't have to be out looking for amendments involving China, agriculture, or higher education, guns, prescription drugs, tax cuts, or anything of that nature, all of which may be or may not be meritorious. We have plenty to do and plenty we need to think about to improve, hopefully, elementary and secondary education. 
   I agree to an extent with what Senator REID was saying. I appreciate his cooperation and that of Senator MCCAIN, who agreed to go along with this request. 
   Let me respond in the broader sense to some of the things that have been said on this bill this afternoon. I have listened to the discussion by Senators. I think it is very important to note once and for all that this is education opportunity--not for 1965, not for 1985 or 1987, because I have heard that date used in some of the debate earlier, and  not even for 1995. This is about education in the new millennium. This is about how we improve the quality of education and how we improve the learning of our children for the remainder of this century. 
   We know there are many indicators that show our children's education is not safe, that it is not drug free, that it is not improving in many areas. In fact, many test scores are static or declining. 
   We have to do something different. We are not debating 1956, we are not debating what happened in 1985, and we certainly are not debating what happened in the early 1990s. 
   It has been alleged that all Republicans want to do is eliminate the Department of Education. Let me just make the RECORD clear why there are many of my colleagues who do not agree with me on this. 
   I am the son of a schoolteacher. I worked for a university, and I am not for, nor have I ever been for, eliminating that Department. I stood in the House of Representatives and voted for its creation. 
   The majority leader and the Republican leader in the Senate certainly do not have that position. Let's not talk about the past. It is prolog. There have been good efforts. Some of them helped. Some of them didn't work. 
   It is time we think a little differently. Education is in this box because there are certain groups in this country that say this is the way it is going to be, this is the way it has been, failed or succeeded, and it is going to stay. 
   I don't agree with that. We have to start using some innovative concepts. We have to have more flexibility. We must have more accountability. We must have results. It has to be child centered, as we have been saying. 
   Some people say we must have mandates from Washington, DC; We know best in Washington, DC, in the Senate and the bureaucrats at the Department of Education, many well-intentioned and good people. 
   I don't accept that. I have faith in the parents at the local level. I have faith in the teachers and the administrators, yes, in the State governments. So it happens that more Governors right now are Republican than Democrat, but in the past the reverse has been true and test scores were not any better then. We have to try to find some solutions. 
   By the way, many of the good solutions in America for creating jobs, improving education, charter schools, improving health care, are happening in the States because we have given them a little more flexibility from the Washington level. My own State of Mississippi, poor though it is, just voted 2 weeks ago, and the Governor signed into law, a 5-year teacher pay increase to bring Mississippi up to the southeastern average. That is monumental legislation. It is a big financial commitment from a small, poor State. But they are doing the job. They are trying to make some progress with teacher pay raises. I know certainly they deserve it. 
   It is time for a change in education. We have to do better. Our scores as parents and leaders are not what they should be for improving education. If you want the status quo, go ahead and vote for title I, title II, all the programs as they are. Leave them as they are. I don't believe they are working the way they can; we don't give enough discretion as to how best to use them at the local level. If our districts and States are using them for pools, Heaven forbid, we should make sure that does not happen. 
   We have thoughtful ideas and I think this Abraham-Mack amendment is a good amendment. First of all, this amendment is optional. Shouldn't we encourage good teachers? Shouldn't we have merit pay for the really good teachers? Shouldn't we encourage them? The alternative is, if the overall school does good and improves, give all teachers a pay raise. That means that the worst of the worst get the pay raise along with everybody else, in spite of the job that he or she has done. That is not the solution. 
   It is not a mandate. Again, it is a choice for the States and the local education agencies to pursue quality teaching, a very important component in learning. It is optional. 
   Let me reframe the debate a little bit. I think there is fundamental disagreement. However, I think the American people agree with the approach we are taking, an approach of more flexibility, more choice at the State and local levels, accountability, encouraging quality teachers so that they won't leave teaching as my mother did after 19 years. She didn't get rewarded when she did a good job or spent extra time. She couldn't make a decent wage in that job. 
   I believe we have a good package. I commend the work. Let's continue to have debate on the amendments. I certainly hope the Kennedy amendment is defeated and the Abraham-Mack amendment is passed. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope we can continue to work in a bipartisan way and agree to an orderly process. We have had good debate and good amendments. I hope we can continue to do that. 
   I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the next sequence of amendments in order to S. 2, the offering of the amendment by Senator LIEBERMAN be temporarily postponed and that I be recognized to offer the Lott-Gregg amendment on Monday beginning at 3 p.m. I further ask consent that the Lott-Gregg amendment be temporarily laid aside when the Senate reconvenes on Tuesday in order for Senator LIEBERMAN to offer his amendment. I finally ask unanimous consent that when the Senate conducts the votes with respect to the two first-degree amendments, the votes occur in the original order as outlined in the consent agreement.

   Mr. LOTT. If Senator KENNEDY will yield under his reservation so I may respond, Senator DASCHLE and I have been talking about this and other issues. We do not have votes scheduled on Monday because we have some Senators who have commitments they cannot change. That is the reason we rearranged the order. Plus, we do have some Senators who want to attend the services for Cardinal O'Connor in New York City on Monday. 
   Next week, we need to take up and consider, if possible, the Africa free trade and CBI enhancement conference report, which the House passed today by an overwhelming vote. We have to figure that into the mix during the day Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 
   Having said that, I believe we do have some additional amendments to which we can agree. I hope Monday during the day--I assume the managers will be here--Monday afternoon we can work on those amendments, and Monday morning, if we work toward having the vote or votes, if necessary, by noon on Tuesday, then we will have the next tranche of amendments worked out. 
   Let me say on Senator DASCHLE's behalf and mine, it is not easy because there are a lot of Senators on both sides who are anxious to participate, so we have to come up with some order. I got into that a little bit today with a couple of my 
   colleagues on this side, and I know the Senator from Massachusetts was doing it on his side. We need to work with those Senators and get the next two, four--whatever we can get--agreed to and look forward to doing some of those Tuesday afternoon, and then we may have to look at moving Tuesday afternoon, perhaps, to the Africa-CBI conference report. We are going to make a good-faith effort on both sides, I am sure, to get the next tranche of amendments and look to have a vote Tuesday morning if at all possible, and I think it will be.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to express my personal disappointment that today the Senate was unable to override the President's veto of S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000. 
   Twelve years have passed since Congress directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to take responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste created by commercial nuclear power plants and our nation's defense programs. Today, there are more than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel that must be dealt with. DOE is absolutely obligated under the NWPA of 1982 to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from utility sites. Today DOE is no closer in coming up with a solution. This is unacceptable. This is in fact wrong--so say the Federal Courts. The law is clear, and DOE has not met its obligation. 
   The President sent his message--once again he chose not to enact sound energy policy. Once again, he chose to ignore the growing energy demands of this nation. Therefore, it became Congress's duty to vote for sound science, fiscal responsibility, safety, and honoring a federal commitment to tens of millions of consumers across the nation who benefit from nuclear energy. 
   This should be a bipartisan effort for a safe, practical and workable solution for America's spent fuel storage needs. The proper storage of spent fuel should not be a partisan issue--it is a safety issue. This bill incorporates key concepts embraced by the Congress, the Administration, and the nuclear industry. 
   Where is the Administration? Where is DOE? Where is the solution? All of America's experience in waste management over the last 25 years of improving environmental protection has taught Congress that safe, effective waste handling practices entail using centralized, permitted, and controlled facilities to gather and manage accumulated waste. It is the goal of our nation's nuclear waste management policy to develop a specially designed disposal facility. The federal government is now 12 years behind schedule in managing nuclear waste from 140 sites in 40 states. The sites have spent fuel sitting in their ``backyard,'' and this fuel needs to be gathered and accumulated. This lack of a central storage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of several nuclear power plants. These affected plants produce nearly 20 percent of America's electricity. Closing these plants just does not make sense. 
   This bill would permit early receipt of fuel at Yucca Mountain following issuance of a repository construction authorization by federal regulators. In the meantime, improved environmental and public safety would be provided at the site and during transportation from the states to a federal repository. 
   The citizens, in some 100 communities where fuel is stored today, challenged the federal government to get this bill done. It is unfortunate that this goal has not yet been achieved. 
   The nuclear industry has already committed to the federal government $16 billion exclusively for the nuclear waste management program. The nuclear industry continues to pay $700 million annually with only one-third of that amount being spent on the program. The federal government needs to honor its commitment to the American people and the power community. The federal government needs to protect those 100 communities. This bill would ensure adequate funding for the lifecycle of this program and limit the use of these funds. 
   To ensure that the federal government meets its commitment to states and electricity consumers, it is vital that there be a mandate for completion of the nuclear waste management program--this program would give the federal government title to nuclear waste currently stored on-site at facilities across the nation, a site for permanent disposal, and a transportation infrastructure to safely move used fuel from plants to the storage facility. 
   Mr. President, nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future, and must remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to maintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity. We have realized this year more than ever that this Administration lacks a sound energy policy. The President's veto of the Nuclear Waste Storage Act is a prime example. 
   Mr. President, this federal foot dragging is unfortunate and unacceptable. It is in the best interest of this nation for Congress to override the President's veto. This is achievable, and I look forward to the opportunity to revisit this issue.

   Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield? Mr. President, I assure the Senators from Nevada that we have proceeded in good faith on both sides of the aisle on this issue from day one. I have always understood how important it is and how difficult it is for the Senators from Nevada. I also understand, on the other side, how important this issue is to Senators all across America who have nuclear waste in their respective States in cooling pools or in conditions of uncertainty where something needs to be done. 
   There will not be a surprise on this issue. If there is a decision made that we will need to reconsider, it will not be based on absentees or something of that nature. But I do think 
    it is such an important issue and it is so close now--really 1 vote--keeping that option open for a while longer is worthwhile, but I will certainly notify Senator REID and Senator BRYAN, as I have in the past, before we proceed on it.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as we get ready to resume general debate on this bill, let me say again how important this issue obviously is in America. People across this country in every State put the highest priority on the need to improve the quality of our education to have safe and drug-free schools, to have accountability, to have rewards for good teachers, and have a way of making sure our education system is based on learning and that it is child centered. This legislation does that. 
   I listened yesterday and participated in the debate. I thought there was excellent debate. A number of Senators came to the floor and made statements. I do not know how many, but probably 12 to 15 Senators spoke yesterday. There are a number of Senators on both sides who wish to speak further today. 
   There are some legitimate disagreements about how to proceed on improving the quality of education in America and the accessibility of education. There are those who say the current system is working fine and we ought to keep it the way it is. I do not agree with that. 
   There are people who say the Federal Government must have control and dictate or the right things will not be done by the States, the local school districts, the administrators, and the teachers. I do not agree with that. 
   It is legitimate to have debate because we have spent billions of dollars since 1965 trying to improve the quality of education in America, and the test scores show we are, at best, holding our own and slipping in a number of critical areas. We need to think outside the box. We need to think of different and innovative ways to provide learning opportunities for our children in America. 
   I think it calls for flexibility as to how the funds are used at the local level. I think it calls for rewards for good teachers, but accountability for all teachers and for students. I think we need some evidence, with the flexibility, that our children are actually making progress. 
   So this is an important debate as we go forward. I am glad we are having it. We have spent a lot of our time on education this year in the Senate. We passed the education savings account bill earlier this year to allow parents to be able to save for their children's needs, with their own money, for their children K through 12. Now we are going to have this continued debate and amendments of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Later on this year, when we get to the Labor-HHS and education appropriations bill, I am sure we are going to have some good discussion about the funding level for higher education--loans, grants, the work-study program. We need the whole package to improve education and to make our children capable of competing in the world market, to be trained to do the job they need to make a good living for their families. 
   So this is an important debate. I am glad we got an agreement to stay on general debate today. We are hoping to go forward tomorrow with the first four amendments on education, two on  each side, so that we can have some legitimate debate about how to best help education in America and help learning for our children in America. 
   But I am worried about a lot of what I am hearing. I am hearing there may be amendments to the education bill on everything from agriculture, to NCAA gambling, to campaign finance reform, to minimum wage, to guns. Where is the limit on all the subjects that could be raised on an issue that is No. 1 in the minds of the American people--education? 
   We are not starting off by saying we are not going to do this or not going to do that. We are starting. We are going forward. We are starting in kindergarten. We are going to go to the first grade. We are going to have general debate and education amendments and take stock of where we are. 
   If there is a center ground that must and should be found in America on any subject, it is education. What we have--the status quo--is not working well enough. The Federal Government has a role. We need for it to be a more positive role and a results-oriented role. 
   So let's have the debate. Let's have amendments on education. I hope my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--will not make this important legislation a piece of flypaper to attract every amendment that is flying around in this Chamber. It would be a terrible discredit to a vital issue in the minds and hearts of the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American, Ming Chen Hsu. Last December, Ms. Hsu retired from the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), where she served as a Commissioner for nine and one-half years. Ms. Hsu was first appointed to the Commission by President George Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 1990. She was reappointed and reconfirmed in October, 1991. 
   Many of my colleagues may not realize it, but the ocean shipping system is vital to international trade and is the underpinning for the international trade on which the vitality of our Nation's economy depends. A fair and open maritime transportation system creates business opportunities for U.S. shipping companies and provides more favorable transportation conditions for U.S. imports and exports. Ensuring a fair, open, competitive and efficient ocean transportation system is the mission of the FMC. The Commission has a number of important responsibilities under the shipping laws of the United States, including: the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable practices by the ocean common carriers, marine terminal operators, conferences, ports and ocean transportation intermediaries operating in the U.S. foreign commerce; monitor and address the laws and practices of foreign governments which could have a discriminatory or adverse impact on shipping conditions in the U.S. trades; and enforce special regulatory requirements applicable to carriers owned or controlled by foreign governments. 
   Mr. President, for almost a decade, Ms. Hsu played an active and important role in the life and decisions of the Commission. The Commission and the Nation have been fortunate in her service. During her tenure, Ms. Hsu's experience and judgment helped guide the Commission through a number of challenges and actions which will continue to shape the work of the Commission long after her retirement. 
   In 1998, the Congress passed and the President signed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act (OSRA), which amended the Shipping Act of 1984, the primary shipping statute administered by the FMC. As I have said before, the OSRA signaled a paradigm shift in the conduct of the ocean liner business and its regulation by the FMC. Where ocean carrier pricing and service options were diluted by the conference system and ``me too'' requirements, an unprecedented degree of flexibility and choice will result. Where agency oversight once focused on using rigid systems of tariff and contract filing to scrutinize individual transactions, the ``big picture'' of ensuring the existence of competitive liner service by a healthy ocean carrier industry to facilitate fair and open commerce among our trading partners will become the oversight priority. This week marks the one-year anniversary of the implementation of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. It is most fitting that we take the time to remember the career of Ming Chen Hsu this week. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Hsu clearly recognized the important change in the business and regulation by the FMC of ocean shipping brought about by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. During the Commission's consideration of regulations to implement OSRA, Ms. Hsu played a critical role in working with the other Commissioners and FMC staff to ensure that the regulations embodied the spirit of the new law. As she told a large gathering of shippers and industry representatives, ``This has been not only a long journey, but a long needed journey *.*.* With the passage of the 
   Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the FMC's new regulations, I believe the maritime industry will be far less shackled by burdensome and needless regulations *.*.* I believe we can now look forward to an environment which gives you the freedom and flexibility to develop innovative solutions to your ever-changing ocean transportation needs.'' 
   Ms. Hsu's wisdom and experience was also instrumental in helping the Commission navigate one the Commission's most difficult and highly-publicized actions in recent years. In 1998, the Commission took action against a series of restrictive port conditions in Japan. As a result of these conditions, both U.S. carriers and U.S. trade were burdened with unreasonably high costs and inefficiencies. Because of the Commission's action, steps were taken by Japan to initiate improvements to its port system. If ultimately realized, these improvements will substantially facilitate and benefit the ocean trade of both nations. 
   Mr. President, during her career at the Commission, Ms. Hsu led a number of Commission initiatives. Among others, in 1992 Ms. Hsu served at the request of then FMC Chairman Christopher Koch as Investigative Officer for the Commission's Fact Finding 20. Under her leadership, the Fact Finding held numerous hearings across the United States in an effort to examine and understand the experience of shippers associations and transportation intermediaries under the Shipping Act of 1984. Fact Finding 20 ultimately led to Commission efforts to ensure that shippers associations and transportation intermediaries received all of the benefits intended by Congress in enacting the 1984 Act. 
   Commissioner Hsu's service at the Federal Maritime Commission is just the most recent milestone in a remarkable life and career. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Ming Chen Hsu came as a student to the United States from her native Beijing, China. Prior to coming to the Commission, Ms. Hsu has had an extensive career in international trade and commerce in both the public and private sectors. She was a Vice President for International Trade for the RCA Corporation in New York, where she held a variety of executive positions in the areas of international marketing and planning. She played a pivotal role in gaining market access for RCA in China in the 1970's. She was appointed by former Governor Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey as Special Trade Representative and as Director of the State's Division of International Trade, a position she held from 1982 to 1990. In her positions with RCA and the  state of New Jersey, Ms. Hsu led over thirty trade missions to countries throughout the world. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Hsu has served on several U.S. Federal advisory committees, having been appointed by the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative. She is a recipient of numerous awards including the Medal of Freedom and the Eisenhower Award for Meritorious Service. She is listed in Who's Who of America. Ms. Hsu is a founding member and director of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese Americans and is a member of the National Committee on United States-China Relations. She also serves on the National Advisory Forum to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial. 
   Ms. Hsu is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of George Washington University and member of Phi Beta Kappa. At New York University, she was a Penfield Fellow for International Law. Ms. Hsu was the recipient of the George Washington Alumni Achievement Award in 1983 and holds several honorary degrees. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate Ming Chen Hsu on her exemplary career at the Federal Maritime Commission and salute her contributions to the ocean transportation industry. I add my voice to those who say ``thank you'' for her service to the Nation. And finally, I wish her smooth sailing in her future endeavors.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have asked the chairman and the ranking member to allow me to go forward briefly as we get started on this very important legislation. They have been gracious enough to allow me to do so. 
   I first emphasize a point I think everybody understands: Elementary and secondary education is very important in America. People all over this country, in every State nationwide, believe education is the area where we must concentrate; we have to show better results; we have to have accountability; we have to have some results that show our children are actually learning. 
   First, I will emphasize my personal background in this area. My mother was a schoolteacher for 19 years. As many schoolteachers, unfortunately, she reached a point where she needed to have more income. She wound up going into bookkeeping and radio broadcasting. I remember quite well her many years as a teacher in elementary schools in my own State. 
   I had the opportunity, in three different positions, to work for the University of Mississippi. I worked with placement and financial aid programs; I worked as a recruiter; I worked with a work-study program; and I worked with the alumni association. I know the importance of these programs. 
   I have always been supportive of financial aid programs from the Federal level so our children will have access to good work-study programs, to grants, to loans, so every American child has an opportunity to further their education, whether it is at a training school, community college, or a university. We have done good work in that area. I think we can truly tell students when they finish high school there will be an opportunity to get additional training or education. 
   In one area we are still falling behind. That is in the elementary and secondary levels, K through 12. The statistics show that in world competition we do quite well in higher education, but in K through 12 we are way behind international standards in reading, and particularly in math and science. We must do more in that area. I feel strongly about that. 
   I went to public schools all my life. My wife went to public schools. Both of our children went to public schools, from the first grade all the way through college. I want to make sure we have good, quality education in America. We have to do something about the reports such as the ones I have been reviewing this morning. 
   According to the National Assessment of Educational Programs, 77 percent of children in high-poverty urban schools are reading below basic levels. Test scores of 12th graders in math, reading, and writing have remained stagnant or declined over the last 30 years, and our 12th graders scored near dead last in international comparisons. 
   At the same time, we have spent billions of dollars--I think this statistic is $120 billion or more--over those past 30 years of Federal funds, not to mention what has been spent at the local and State level. Yet the scores are stagnant or have declined in critical areas including math, reading, and writing. 
   Fourth-grade students in high-poverty schools remain two grade levels behind peers in low-poverty schools in math. In reading, they are three or four grade levels behind. 
   Contrary to original projections, the ESEA was designed to address the achievement gap that actually is widening. There are other unacceptable statistics if we are going to have our children in a position to have learned enough to be able to compete in the world economy or whether they can even be trained to be able to get a good-paying job. 
   A couple of years ago, I had a request from the leaders of the Silicon Valley high-tech companies to meet with me. They didn't specify what the subject matter was going to be. Of course, I thought we would talk computers, talk Internet, what do we do about taxes on the Internet, what to do about their inability to get more workers to fill the jobs they had available--basically, just a computer or high-tech discussion. 
   Twelve of them sat around the table in my conference room. They didn't want to talk about any other subject but education. They said: We cannot get high school graduates who have the basics so we can train them in this critical high-tech industry. 
   That applies, of course, to Silicon Valley in California and to the high-tech jobs we have in Northern Virginia as well as all over the country. 
   In my home area of Jackson, MS, we have such companies as SkyTel, Bell South, MCI WorldCom. These companies have created a lot of jobs and great opportunities for our young people. If they don't have the basics to be trained to fill the jobs, the jobs will go unfilled or we will have to go with an H-1B program to bring in people from other countries to fill these jobs until we can improve our system of education. 
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education. We may have differences, and we will have differences, about how to improve the system, but let's have that debate, let's have votes, and let's not get distracted by other irrelevant, extraneous matter. I believe Americans want that. Whether it is in my State or nationwide, polls show that American people rate their concern about the quality of education No. 1. 
   This is a $15 billion reauthorization bill. Good work has been done by the committee. I commend Chairman JEFFORDS, who is on the floor, ready to proceed, and the ranking member, Senator KENNEDY. They had many amendments, many of which were voted down, and some of them were adopted. Now we have the bill ready for action. Many Members have done excellent work, and we will hear from a number of them later on. 
   I have always said that education is about learning. We need to remember that. Some people think it is about teaching, others think it is about freedom of expression, but in the end the question must be, Does the child learn? Is he or she getting what they need to do better on tests and be able to get and hold a job? 
   In order to learn, there are basic necessities in a schoolroom. First, you have to have discipline. That has become a problem in schools all across America. If kids are squirming around or if there is disruption in class, if they are talking, if they are not behaving, if there is not a system of discipline, there is a problem with the children being able to learn. 
   It does require good teachers. There are a lot of great teachers, a lot of teachers who should be rewarded for their good work. There are some teachers who have deficiencies, but we should not condemn them or complain about them. We should find a way to give them the opportunity to get the training they need to do a better job. 
   In my own State, the private sector has given computers to a lot of our schools and libraries. Many of the computers are sitting in the back of classrooms or in halls in the crates they came in because the teachers have not had a training program to teach the students how to use the computers. 
   So we need to do something about that and we are beginning to get programs developed that specifically train the teachers in what they need to know in  order to make use of these computers. That is the kind of program on which we need to focus locally and in the private sector. 
   We have one individual and his wife, natives of my State, who gave $100 million of their own personal money to, improve reading at the fourth grade level--not as a part of a Federal program, not as a part of a State program. In fact, they specifically said they didn't want to be tied to some sort of match. They wanted this money, every nickel of it, to be used for innovative efforts to train children in the fourth grade to be able to read. 
   Certainly that is commendable. We need more of that sort of thing. 
   We need to make sure our schools are safe. It is hard for me to believe the dangers that now go along with going to school. The juvenile justice bill had provisions that would allow assistance in dealing with alcohol abuse among our children, and drug programs. It would have authorized the use of funds to put metal detectors at schools where that might be needed. 
   We have to make sure our schools are safe and drug free. It is still horrifying to me to think that is a problem in many schools, not just at the high school level or the middle school level but even in elementary school. What have we come to in our society that our children in the sixth grade, fifth grade, fourth grade, are tempted or involved in using drugs? We have to make sure we have programs that are aimed at stopping that. 
   My colleague from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN, has been active in the area of trying to promote and provide assistance for drug-free schools. 
   We must have accountability. It is not good enough any longer to put more money into programs and hope for the best. We have to see the results. There has to be a connection between the money, the teaching, what is happening in the school, and how the children are doing. It is just not acceptable any longer that our children are not getting what they need in our educational system in America. So it has to be results oriented. There has to be some way to determine if the children are getting what they need in the third or fourth grade or in the tenth grade. There must be a system of identifying what is being achieved in our educational process. 
   There are several provisions in this particular bill on which I think we should focus and we should make sure are included in the final version. We should encourage our States to take full advantage of these. One is the so-called Teacher Empowerment Act. This gives flexibility to the States and to the local schools to use over $2 billion annually to develop high-quality professional programs to reduce class size or to fund innovative teacher programs such as teacher testing, merit-based teacher performance systems, or alternative routes to certification. 
   In different States you have different needs. In different areas within States you have different needs. In my own State, along the gulf coast, what is needed perhaps is a greater reward for excellent teachers, or more programs for the gifted and talented. In another part of the State better reading programs might be needed. In another part there might be a need to repair the roofs. That kind of flexibility is needed, though, where the administrators, the teachers, the parents, and the children can make those decisions without some nameless, 
   faceless bureaucrat in Washington, or Senators, saying it must be used the way they say it should be used. Give them some modicum of flexibility. That is what this teacher empowerment provision of the bill would do. 
   We have started moving in that area. A year ago, on a bipartisan basis, we passed the first Flexibility in Education Act. Now it has been expanded. I think it is showing good results. I think this bill would expand it to 15 States, and I would like that to very soon be applicable to every State. But under the Teacher Empowerment Act, States and school districts can choose to spend their money to increase the number of high-quality teachers. That seems to be such a good way to go. It is one of the provisions in this bill that I like the most. 
   Also, we have what is known as the Straight A's provision. This has been developed by a number of Senators, but Senator SLADE GORTON has worked in particular on it. Under this Straight A's provision, States or interested school districts have to establish a 5-year performance agreement with the Secretary of Education. This gets to the results-oriented and child-centered point I was making earlier. There has to be some way to say we are going to give flexibility, we are going to give additional money to use in different ways, but there have to be results. You have to show it has an impact on the children. So I think that is a very good part of this bill. 
   The child-centered funding allows interested States and schools to use their title I dollars to establish per-pupil amounts for supplemental services for each eligible child. After all, that gets back to what I said at the beginning-- education is about learning. If that is your goal, it has to be aimed at finding ways to help the child. Maybe the traditional way we have used title I funds is not the best way for it to be used nationwide. As I said earlier, test scores would indicate that. In spite of all this money, the scores are stagnant or declining in critical areas. So that is a very important provision. 
   Then, public school choice. Well over 5,000 title I schools have been identified as failing schools for over 2 years; over 1,000 for over 4 years, and over 100 for 10 years. What if a school is just not doing the job--it is getting the local money, getting the State money, and getting the Federal money, but it continues to fail. The child must have some choice. That is what public school choice is all about. Why should a child have to attend a school that doesn't meet his or her needs and there is a better public school right down the street in the same town? Why shouldn't parents and children be able to make that choice? 
   I think the money should go with the child; that is who we are really trying to help. It should not be aimed at the school. If a family, for good reason, decides they want to choose a school that produces results rather than a failing school in the public school system, clearly they should have that choice. 
   So these are just a few of the critical provisions in this legislation that I know will be discussed. There will be amendments offered. Hopefully, we will improve this bill. I understand--in fact I know--there is a bipartisan effort to try to come up with a bill that will have Republican and Democrat support. I will be very interested in developing a bipartisan bill. That is how we got the education flexibility legislation done last year. That is how we got the education 
   savings account bill done this year. This is part of our continuing effort to focus on ways to improve education. We have to do it. 
   In my State that has a lot of very poor schools, we have to do more. We have to do more locally, and our State legislature and our Governor just signed major education legislation making a 5-year commitment to education and to raising the salaries of our teachers to the Southeastern regional average. That is a major commitment of funds and a major commitment to education that has been expressed by my own State. I know that story is being replicated in States all across the Nation, whether it is Minnesota or Arizona, Massachusetts or Vermont, Alabama or Maine. That is as it should be. But we cannot do it with the status quo. 
   That is what many Democrats are saying: Look, we have this program. This is the way it has been done. We have been putting billions of dollars into it, but what we need is more billions of dollars to do the same thing. 
   I do not accept that. Education is about innovation. Technology is changing the face of the world, the face of business in America, and it will change the face of education if we will allow it to do so. So the status quo? Let's just go forward. The way it always has been in education is not the way to go. We should make genuine changes. We should give flexibility and innovation a chance in education. I believe in education we can improve our quality, and it will show results soon. We need it. We need it so more students will be able to get good-paying jobs, will be able to go into the high-tech area, or manufacturing, or the professional schools. This bill is going to be the third major step in that direction: education flexibility last year, education savings accounts earlier this year, and now basic, child-centered programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  
   I hope we will have a good debate. I hope we will stay focused on education. I look forward to hearing the opening remarks of the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. 
   Mr. President, I thank them for allowing me to go forward at this time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Judge Dan M. Russell, Jr., U.S. Senior District Court Judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, on the occasion of national Law Day and Judge Dan M. Russell Day in Hancock County, Mississippi. I wish I could be with Judge Russell and his family, colleagues and friends today as they gather to dedicate a portrait of him which will hang in the Hancock County Courthouse in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. I want to commend Judge Russell for his many years of service on the bench and praise him for his willingness to continue to serve the Gulf Coast community, the state, and the nation as a judge. I can think of no better way to mark Law Day than by recognizing Judge Russell's distinguished service in the law, and by commemorating this service with the dedication of a portrait of him. I have the deepest admiration for Judge Russell, and this commemoration indicates the high esteem that his colleagues in the Bar have for him as well.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena in a lawsuit brought by a resident of Connecticut who has sued the Postal Service alleging discrimination in the termination of his employment with the Postal Service. The plaintiff seeks to subpoena from Senator JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN's deputy state director for constitutent services copies of casework files concerning another constitutent of the Senator's who is not a party to this lawsuit.  
   Senator LIEBERMAN's deputy state director for constitutent services informed the plaintiff that, out of concern for protecting the confidentiality of communications with the Senator's constituents, the Senator's policy does not permit sharing constituent files with third parties without the constituents' consent, which has not been given in this case. The plaintiff has also been advised that a search of the Senator's achieved constituent files turned up no file like that sought. 
   Nevertheless, the plaintiff has moved to compel the production of the document he is seeking. This resolution would permit the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senator's deputy state director for constituent services to oppose the motion to compel, and permit the submission of an affidavit describing the Senator's constituent confidentiality policy and the search for records in this case.

Even though they are not relevant, some of them are meritorious. Our concern is, they have not been considered by the appropriate committee, whether it is Finance, or Agriculture. We are hesitant to have a vote on these and try to get Members to vote against them when, in fact, they may eventually want to be for them in a different forum. 
   I have an idea of how we might be able to work something out on this. I will have a suggestion on that before we come back a week from Tuesday.

I have now received a list of amendments from Senator DASCHLE, but we have had only a couple of minutes to review that. We need a little time. I understand several of the amendments actually have been filed. There may be one or two on which we don't actually have access to an amendment. For instance, Senator TORRICELLI may have an amendment  prepared and we would like to get a copy of the amendment. We would like to have a little time to review the list and the substance of these amendments. We have agreed we should go forward with general debate while we do that. 
   I ask consent the Senate resume the pending legislation for debate, equally divided, until the majority leader is recognized at 4:30 this afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I have been working to try to reach an agreement to consider the very important Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act. We started working on it yesterday afternoon sometime around 3:30 or 4. Senator DASCHLE indicated they had a number of amendments that they would like to have considered, and, of course, we asked for a chance to see what those amendments were. We, of course, urged that they be relevant amendments. 
   At about 3 o'clock today, we received a list of amendments that members of the minority wanted to offer to the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act. The list included nine amendments, five or six of which were clearly not related to the marriage tax penalty relief bill. And then about an hour or so later an additional amendment was added by Senator HARKIN. The list is now up to 10 amendments. 
   I indicated all along--like we worked it out earlier this year on the education savings account--that we could go with alternatives and relevant amendments. That is eventually what we did with the education savings account. Of course, I had hoped with the very overwhelmingly popular Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act that we could do something similar to what we did on the Social Security earnings test elimination. That was something that had been pending in this body and on Capitol Hill for 20 years. 
   Finally, we worked it out. We had a couple of relevant amendments to which we agreed. We had a good discussion. We voted, I think, on one of those amendments. It passed unanimously. The President signed it last week with great fanfare that we had achieved this worthwhile goal. 
   I think we can do the same thing with the marriage penalty 
   tax. But in order to do it, we need to keep our focus on what is the best way to provide this marriage penalty tax relief. Is it a phaseout? Should it apply to everybody? What can you do for those in the lower income brackets in how you deal with the EITC, earned-income tax credit, how you deal with the lowest and middle brackets? Is there a better way to do it or another way to do it? 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator BAUCUS, and others on the Finance Committee, had a different approach. I described it then, and publicly I think it is a credible approach. I don't think it is as good as the one we had in the basic bill, but it is one that is worthy of being talked about and thought about. I hope we can work it out so we can do that. 
   We could have debate on the bill and then go to a vote on the alternatives and relevant amendments and get this finished by the close of business on Thursday or Friday at the latest. But the list we have is not only not relevant, but, first of all, we haven't had a chance to really look at how they would work or the details of the proposals. 
   One of them by Senator ROBB has to do with prescription drugs. Senator WELLSTONE has one which is something similar to the Canadian system of prescription drugs. But it looks to be a pretty detailed proposal that I don't think the Finance Committee has had a chance to consider. 
   We have one by Senator GRAHAM dealing with Medicare and Social Security priorities. I think he offered something similar to this in the Finance Committee. This is not one of which we  were unaware. We could have a discussion on that, and I think have a vote, but it certainly doesn't relate to the marriage tax penalty. 
   We have one on the college tuition tax credit. There is one on the CRT income. This is an agriculture issue. We have one on changing how you deduct a natural disaster impact on your tax form. I don't even know. That may be something we would want to look at doing. Don't we want to consider that in the Finance Committee, see what the budgetary impact is, and see what people are doing now versus what they might do under this proposal? It is something I would like to talk to Senator TORRICELLI about to see exactly what he is trying achieve. 
   Then, at 3:45, we got the amendment from Senator HARKIN. Honestly, I can't even quite tell you what it did. I believe that one relates to the marriage tax penalty. It would probably be relevant. Three or four of these could probably be relevant, and we could get them done. 
   I hope the Democratic leader would try to reduce his list or, at a minimum, make them work with us in getting relevant amendments to the marriage tax relief bill. I think that is a reasonable request. 
   I emphasize again that is what we did on the education savings account and on the Social Security earnings limitation. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume the pending legislation and that there be 10 relevant amendments in order for the Democratic leader, or his designee, and 2 relevant amendments in order for the majority leader to the pending substitute, with no amendments in order to the language proposed to be stricken, or motions to commit or recommit. I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the listed amendments--certainly 10 would be an awful lot of amendments--and any relevant second degrees, the bill be advanced to third reading, and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on behalf of the Senate. 
   I finally ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled for Thursday of this week be vitiated, in view of this request, if it is agreed to.

   Mr. LOTT. For instance, the taxability of the CRP income--I don't know how anyone can stretch that to make it applicable to the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act. 
   Second, the request by the Democratic leader did not allow for second-degree amendments, or any alternatives, or any option--even side-by-side amendments by the majority. We certainly need to work through that. 
   I still think we can go forward and continue to work to try to find a list of, hopefully, relevant amendments that could be offered to get to a conclusion on the marriage penalty tax. 
   Since we are not able to reach an agreement at this time, I announce that the cloture vote will occur tomorrow unless we come to an agreement that allows a vitiation of that cloture vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I asked the Senator to yield because I very much agree with what he is saying and want to emphasize a couple points. 
   There is a Democrat alternative. I indicated even yesterday we would be glad to take up debate and vote on it. I note even the Washington Post yesterday said the problem, for instance, with the Democratic bill is it is backloaded and would actually cost more over a 10-year period and more of it would affect the upper end, the more wealthy people. That is the alternative that was offered in the Finance Committee. 
   I believe our bill is much more in line with what the average working American--a young couple and older couple, for that matter--would like to have. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. 
   I want to say something else for the record. A complaint was made a few weeks ago by the Democratic leader about the cost of this bill and whom it will affect. I will, once again, read briefly what this bill will do. 
   It will provide a $2,500 increase to the beginning and ending income level for the EIC phaseout for married filing 
   jointly; in other words, a $2,500 increase for the earned-income tax credit joint or married couples. That is the low-end, entry-level couples who need help. There is a specific provision that will cost, over a 10-year period, about $14 billion. 
   It also provides the standard deduction set at two times single for married filing jointly, and it doubles the brackets for the 15-percent and 28-percent. Then it provides for permanent extension of the alternative minimum tax treatment of refundable and nonrefundable personal credits. 
   What is it in these provisions to which the Democrats object? It is aimed at low-end married couples. It is aimed at correcting a problem that was never intended, where people in the middle income are paying higher taxes because of the alternative minimum tax, and it is aimed at the lowest and the middle brackets. It makes good sense. 
   Once again, what the Democrats are suggesting is a diversion. They want to get into agricultural policy. They want to get into Medicaid reform. They want to get into anything to distract from the issue at hand. 
   We are perfectly willing to go ahead with relevant amendments on the marriage tax penalty. In the end, the question is: Are you for eliminating the marriage tax penalty or not? If you are, this is the opportunity. We will have a chance to see tomorrow who is really for it and against it. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. It is an issue he has been talking about ever since he arrived in the Senate. Now we have a chance to get it done. We should not get off on side trails on issues that will complicate or maybe even defeat our entire effort. I thank the Senator. Keep up the good work.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will briefly explain what we have in mind, and then I believe Senator INHOFE has some comments he wants to make on another issue before we go to the actual debate on the marriage tax penalty. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I have been talking. As a result of the caucus luncheon, the Democrats have some amendments they want to have made in order. If they are relevant or if they are close to being relevant in a way we can have debate and votes on them, we would like to work out an agreement to do that. I have asked him to provide me a list of those amendments so we can make sure we understand what they are and have a chance to assess their relevancy. 
   It is preferable we do that rather than filing cloture and having a cloture vote. I believe the American people think it is time to quit talking about the marriage tax penalty and do something about it. I know Senator MOYNIHAN has a different approach as to how to deal with it. It is credible. We have looked at that and debated it in the Finance Committee. Certainly, that substitute or other substitutes should be offered. 
   Rather than just mark time and not accomplishing anything, this will put us into general debate on the marriage tax penalty until 4 p.m. Then in an hour, we will have a chance to get an agreement on how to proceed. I want us to debate this issue, fully understand the ramifications of what the Finance Committee reported out, have debate on the amendments and vote on those amendments and complete this legislation. The American people believe it is time we do this. 
   I cannot help remembering what we did on the Social Security earnings test. We made in order a couple of 
   amendments. We had a good debate, and we had a vote or two and passed it unanimously. I believe most Members of the Senate, if not all, realize there are inequities with the marriage tax penalty and we should do something about it. I want to facilitate getting to that point. 
   The House has acted overwhelmingly. We are going to see if we can work out an accommodation and obtain a UC agreement as to how to proceed. 
   If I need to, I will take leader time to make this brief comment on the bill on which we just voted. The Senate has spoken, although I note there were 43 Senators who thought there should be some sort of fuels tax holiday so that working Americans could have some relief. 
   I emphasize, this issue is not over. I fear gasoline prices are going to go up. The fact is, we are still dependent, and  going to be even more dependent, on foreign oil, mostly OPEC oil, for 55 percent or more of our needs. We need to do something. We do not have an adequate energy policy, if there is one at all. This issue will not go away. 
   My comment to those who voted against it on both sides is: if not this, what? And if not now, when are we going to do something about our energy dependence on foreign oil? There is a danger here, and we need to find a way to address it. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to try to be brief because I want Senator HUTCHISON and others to be able to speak. 
   I have been having some discussions with Senator DASCHLE trying to work out an agreement as to how to proceed on amendments. We are going to continue to do that. We had asked for a list, a description of the amendments they might have in mind. We don't have that yet. I assume it is just a physical problem for right now. We will continue to discuss that and see if there is a way we can come to an agreement that will allow us to vitiate cloture, but we need to go on with the debate. 
   We have Senators here ready to speak. We have the chairman of the committee here who would like to get on record on this issue. So we could go ahead and have cloture filed so, if necessary, we would have a vote on cloture on Thursday, but we could go ahead then with debate only. While we are doing that, we can continue to have discussions about how we can work out an agreement. 
   Let me emphasize again, I think we can work out an agreement that would allow for a substitute to be offered, or substitutes for that matter, that are relevant to the marriage tax penalty. I understand these amendments may relate to Medicaid. They may relate to prescription drugs. It may be a complete prescription drug proposal. I don't know how that would be relevant or how we would have time to evaluate that. I fear we are headed off down a trail that is not in line with what I had offered or hoped for. I repeat, substitutes or 
   relevant marriage penalty elimination amendments, we can work that out. I don't want to say what we won't do at this point. I will say we are going to go forward. We will continue to try to work to get a fair agreement. 
   In the end, this is the point: For 10 years we have talked about the unfairness of the marriage penalty tax. Ever since the Senator from Texas has been in the Senate--now for 6 years--she has been relentless on the subject. So we are going to have a vote on the marriage penalty tax, and we are going to see who is for eliminating it and who is not. 
   I hope we can do it without getting tangled up in procedural questions. If necessary, we will have a vote on cloture and we will know where we are. I hope we will have the votes on cloture to cut off the filibuster and then move on to the final vote. For now, I want us to make sure we get time this afternoon to have a good debate on this issue, and so I will go ahead and go through this process. 
   I am still hopeful we can reach agreement on the number of amendments. It could be as many as three or four, it could be six, all dealing with the marriage tax penalty or closely relevant issues. We will keep working on that.

It is, again, my hope that we can work out an agreement that would provide for full debate and discussion of amendments and swift passage of the bill itself. But while these negotiations are going on, I will stay in touch with the minority leader, and we will make sure all Members are notified as to how the proceedings are going.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, ordinarily when we file cloture, at the end of that proceeding we ask for the mandatory quorum under rule XXII to be waived and the bill be pending for debate only so that we make use of the time to begin debating the substance of the bill or the alternatives. That has been objected to. 
   As an alternative, so we can make use of the time we have this afternoon--surely we can spend another hour and a half or so allowing Senators to discuss their positions on the marriage penalty or any other issue--I proposed that we go into a period for the transaction of morning business. 
   I am told there may be objection to that, which kind of surprises me--that we will not even allow morning business to go forward so Senators can speak. 
   You talk about the Senate. The way the Senate works is Senators get to speak when they need to and want to on any subject certainly in morning business. 
   But it was suggested, since that apparently was going to be objected to, that maybe we were ready to go forward with debate on the bill and debate on the Moynihan substitute, or one of the Democratic substitutes, and that maybe you are ready to go with that. 
   In an effort to be fair and get the debate to go forward, and to address one of the issues that certainly is a legitimate one--Senator MOYNIHAN, and probably Senator BAUCUS, offered this in the Finance Committee, and we talked about it, had votes on it--so we can go ahead and engage the discussion about what is the best way to deal with the marriage penalty tax, this is a different way of doing it, and I think it merits being addressed by the Senators. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the bill be open for one amendment, the so-called Democratic alternative by Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator BAUCUS, or their designee, with no other amendments or motions to commit or recommit being in order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since objection is heard, I want to make sure people understand this didn't in any way foreclose any other agreement that might be involved with making other amendments in order and having amendments considered. I presume there will be other amendments that are relevant on the marriage tax penalty provision--I assume on the Democratic side and perhaps on this side, also. This doesn't foreclose any agreement. All I am trying to do is to facilitate the debate and discussion on this very important piece of legislation. 
   There was an indication from the Democratic side that you were interested in going forward with your  amendment or amendments, and the one that was clearly identifiable is the one that had been offered in the Finance Committee as an alternative on how to proceed. I certainly don't feel as if that is foreclosing any Senators the opportunity to be heard and to offer amendments. But objection has been heard.

   Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to yield, but let me finish this. 
   I offered to have a period for the transaction of morning business with Senators to talk about any subject they chose. It could be the gas tax bill. It could be the budget resolution. It could be stock options. It could be anything. That has been objected to, which I find highly unusual. 
   Then I offered, to try to accommodate what I thought may be a way to get the debate started and some progress to be made, to go with the Democratic alternative. 
   Again, in terms of one-man action here, all I am trying to do is to get debate on this very important issue, the marriage penalty tax. 
   Does the Senate want to have a debate and vote on that or not? We have been talking about it for years. Now we are up to the point where we would like to go forward. We haven't been able to get a list of amendments or enter into an agreement. But I am still hopeful we will be able to get a list of amendments and agree to proceed. But I was trying to go ahead and protect our rights to file cloture, if it is needed, on Thursday. That is being objected to. 
   Does Senator DORGAN wish me to yield?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senator DASCHLE wasn't on the floor. I was hoping we could maybe mark a little time until he got here. He may not be aware that we asked when we filed the cloture that the mandatory quorum under the rule be waived and the bill be pending for debate only. And there was objection to that. 
   Then I suggested a period for the transaction of morning business because there are Senators who may want to speak on this or any other subject. That was objected to. 
   Then I suggested we go to the Democratic substitute offered by Senator MOYNIHAN and others and begin debate on that, which I thought was a good usage of time; It didn't foreclose other amendments being offered or agreed to at a later point. 
   Perhaps others in his stead were trying to make a point. But my point is that I want us to have time for debate. I want us to use this afternoon and tomorrow. For those who may not be aware, when I file cloture, all I am doing is protecting our right to have a vote on ending the filibuster, which doesn't ripen for 2 days. We could and would be having debate this afternoon and all day Wednesday. If we work out an agreement on a list of amendments, we could vitiate that at any time. 
   I note we have already done that several times this year. In fact, in the first of the year we vitiated the cloture I had filed on the education savings account legislation, as I recall. Several times we have done it as a protection to make sure we get a vote before the week's end. But we wound up working something out and thought we didn't need to do it. I am hoping that is what will happen here. 
   But also, if I don't do it now this afternoon, since we haven't gotten a list of the amendments, this is not a surprise. 
   It has been around a long time. Everybody knew the marriage tax penalty would be coming up this week. The Finance Committee marked it up a couple weeks ago. 
   Any Member who had or has amendments probably had an idea of what they wanted to do. We have not asked to be given the final amendment, but to be given at least some descriptive paragraph as to what the amendments might do before we enter into an agreement. 
   If I didn't file cloture and we went out of session Thursday night, if we completed our business, completed the stock options bill and completed the budget resolution conference report and went out Thursday night, if I didn't file cloture now but waited until tomorrow, if we couldn't reach an agreement, then the marriage penalty issue would not have come up until after the recess. 
   I worked on my income tax last night and I am not in a happy mood about taxes. I know a lot of other people, coming up on April 15, would like to know the marriage tax penalty at last will be coming to an end in whatever form, either by a formula developed by the Finance Committee majority, Senator MOYNIHAN, or others. 
   I emphasize for those who may not be aware of all the Senate rules, we have to file cloture now to be assured to have a vote on that by Thursday. I will work with Senator DASCHLE. We have worked out some pretty thorny issues and some knots in the past that looked as if they were unsolvable and we were able to agree and move to a final conclusion. I hope we can do that. 
   We do not want to get far afield and start debating Medicaid issues, Medicaid reforms, which the Finance Committee has never considered--or somebody suggested a complete prescription drug package--without overall Medicare reform and without looking at the details of that package. I understand it may be a pretty detailed package, but the amendment may not be ready. How can we possibly agree to an amendment when we are not even sure of its structure, let alone what the details are. Maybe by tomorrow that amendment will be available and we can take a look at it and other amendments and maybe come to an agreement to get to a conclusion sometime tomorrow during the day, tomorrow night, or Thursday. 
   Senator HUTCHISON has been very patiently waiting. She has put a lot into this. I yield for a question or comment.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to Senator REID's comments and will yield further to Senator HUTCHISON, I believe just last week we had the budget resolution, and we had well over 100 amendments. Some of them were voted on, some of them were accepted, some of them were voted on in the vote-arama. A number of them didn't relate to the budget for the year. Everything imaginable was thrown in. I don't think Senators have felt as if they haven't had a chance to offer amendments on any kind of extraneous matter. 
   This issue of the marriage tax penalty is clear and understandable: Are Members for it or against it? 
   I fear my colleagues on the Democratic side are trying to change the subject. I cannot believe they don't want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Let's have a full debate, let's have amendments on the marriage penalty. But to get off into every other possible issue as a way to try to distract attention from doing what the American people support overwhelmingly, I don't understand that. 
   I think what we are trying to do makes good, common sense. Let's have a full debate on the issue. Let's have relevant amendments. There are a lot of amendments that could be construed as being relevant. 
   I remember the Democrats came up with a way to offer a gun amendment to the education savings account, as I recall. They went way around the corner to get it done, but we had a vote on it, and we moved on. 
   Senator HUTCHISON wants to comment or ask a question.

   Let me add, perhaps it is just that Senator DASCHLE and the Democrats need more time to work on amendments and to get to our side some description of the amendments. Maybe we can go ahead and go out tonight. That way, we have the rest of the evening and the night to work on amendments and pick up again tomorrow. 
   I am trying to find a way to keep the discussion going. We could use another hour or so to debate this or other issues. 
   If we can think of a way to do that, I am open to considering other options. 
   I indicated to Senator DORGAN I would yield to him.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to that particular point, it is a common practice around here, as I am sure the Senator knows, to give the courtesy of identifying what amendments we have and even the amendments. We are not asking to see the amendments. We are asking to have some idea of the general parameters of what is being proposed. 
   I do not believe that is asking too much. We do that for each other. Senator DASCHLE wants to see what we want to offer, and we want to see what you want to offer. That is a common practice around here.

Also, I am sure he can understand that, as the majority leader, I have to pay attention to the schedule, the time that is available,  and the fact that there are, I think, an overwhelming number of Americans--and Senators--who would like to get this marriage tax penalty removed from the Tax Code. 
   This is the week we can do it. When we come back, we will have other important issues to deal with: The agriculture sanctions issue; we have the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; we have appropriations bills; we have the China permanent trade status--we have a long list of things we need to try to do. We have not said it has to be three or six, but we are saying we would like to see what we are talking about.

   Mr. LOTT. Can we get agreement we can proceed on the bill and all relevant amendments to that bill? To the American people, and I think to most Senators, that makes good sense, to have the requirement that it be relevant to a marriage tax penalty. Again, I have not said we could not go with something that moves afield from that. All I am saying is we would like to see what we are talking about and know it is fair, we have thought it out, and the committee of jurisdiction has had an opportunity to review it. 
   So that is what I am trying to work out. Senator DASCHLE has been patiently waiting while we have exchanged pleasantries. I must say this. I, a little bit, kind of enjoy finding someone else getting frustrated trying to find a way to make this move forward. I know how you feel. 
   I yield.

   Let me say we are going to eliminate the marriage tax penalty this year. We are going to do it on this day, and this week, or we will do it later and we will do it with another procedure. We have talked about getting this done too long and haven't gotten it done. So we are going to come back to this one repeatedly this year. But it would be, I think, very helpful to the people involved and to all of us if we could find a way to go ahead and do it this way.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will talk a few minutes about the schedule for the week and then comment specifically on some of the issues we will be addressing during the schedule for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 
   We have several important issues before the Senate to take up and hopefully complete action on. One of them is the question of our national energy policy. That will be brought to the Senate during the day on Tuesday with a vote on the gas tax issue. 
   Following that, we will be discussing the marriage penalty tax. This past Saturday, I had occasion to be in a store and one of the other customers asked me: Are we finally going to get rid of the unfair marriage penalty tax? I said we would try to and hoped to do it this week. 
   I went on about my business and the customer went on about his. The customer came back later and said: Do you think you actually will begin to eliminate the very unfair tax? I said: That is what we are trying to do. 
   Then he came back a third time and said: You are going to have a vote next week? I said: Yes, we are. He asked if he could get the names of those voting against getting rid of the unfair tax. I said: Yes, it will be in the RECORD. Call my office; we will be glad to get it to you. 
   That is what we hear in the real world, off of Capitol Hill. People say this is a real problem. 
   We have been talking about eliminating the marriage penalty tax for years. It is time we get it done. We will have that debate on Wednesday and, I presume, a vote Wednesday or Thursday to see exactly where the Senate is: Do we want to eliminate the marriage penalty tax or 
   not? I think we should. I certainly will vote that way. 
   Before the week is out, we hope to take up a number of Executive Calendar nominations. We have a number of nominations that we should be able to clear. We will work with interested Senators and committees involved on both sides of the aisle to see if we can clear a number of these nominations. 
   Last and certainly not least is the fact we will also want to complete action on the conference on the budget. We completed action on the budget resolution of the Senate on Friday. I understand the conferees will be working together during the next 2 days, hopefully, to file the necessary report by Tuesday night. Then we will have the necessary debate, whatever time that might be. It could be up to as much as 10 hours. Then we will have a vote on that conference report Thursday evening or Friday morning. 
   That leads me to another point I want to be sure to make early in the week. As I have notified Senators in the past, during these weeks right before a recess--in this case the Easter recess--we will go home and be with our constituents and families. Senators should anticipate the possibility or even the likelihood of votes on Friday. If we can complete the work I have outlined by Thursday night then we will not be in session on Friday. But if for some reason we have not been able to complete at least the vote on the conference report on the budget, then we will be in session on Friday. We certainly hope to finish it by noon on Friday, but that will depend on how much time is needed and when the Senate wishes to get to a final vote. 
   I wanted to go over the schedule for the week so Senators know what to anticipate on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the possibility even of Friday votes on the budget resolution conference report. 
   Now let me go back and talk about some of these issues, to try to make clear what I am trying to do by moving  these bills, and explain what the situation is with regard to the gas tax, for instance. 
   There have been those who said the Senate voted last week during the debate on the budget resolution on a sense of the Senate that basically the Senate would not temporarily suspend or in any way remove the gas tax. 
   The Federal gasoline tax is 4.3 cents a gallon. That was added back in 1993. But the total amount of the Federal tax is 18.4 cents a gallon. I remind my colleagues, that does not count the State taxes and in many cases local taxes on gasoline. Where I am from, we even have, in addition to the State and Federal taxes, what is known as the seawall tax. 
   That is quite curious because quite often we do not see anything happening on the seawall, but the tax is being collected and spent on general improvement of roads. Most people do not gripe because we have a developing area and we want to have good roads. I think that is a very important thing. 
   But, as a matter of fact, the total tax on gasoline in most States is as much as a quarter or a third or more of the total cost of a gallon of gasoline. So the taxes on gasoline are significant. 
   With regard to this vote last week, the so-called Byrd sense-of-the-Senate resolution said it is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in this budget resolution do not assume the reduction of any Federal gasoline taxes on either a temporary or permanent basis. What we will be considering today and tomorrow morning in our gas tax bill is specifically designed to make certain that highway spending, and thus the functional totals, are not changed by our gas tax suspension. 
   Therefore, the spending assumptions in the budget resolution do not assume the reduction of any Federal gas taxes on either a temporary or permanent basis. The revenue levels in the budget resolution, however, do assume a temporary suspension of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon so-called Gore tax increase. 
   If the Byrd amendment had been drafted to read, ``it is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals and the revenue levels in this budget resolution do not assume .....'' then it would have had a very different impact. So I am trying to clarify the difference in what some people thought the resolution did last week and what we are actually doing. 
   Under the budget resolution, there is no question we could have this debate and have this vote on gas tax because this is what it would do. It says we would temporarily suspend, just for the remainder of this year, 4.3 cents a gallon--I will come back to that in a moment--and, if gasoline prices go to $2 a gallon national average, then the entire 18.4 cents a gallon would be suspended in a gas tax holiday just to the end of the year. 
   So when people say, How much would this cost? The first answer is it would depend on whether or not gasoline reached the national average of $2 a gallon and when that would occur, when that would take effect. 
   The amendment language is drafted so this will not affect the highway trust fund. I want to emphasize that: It will not reduce the funds in the highway trust fund. It would hold harmless the highway trust fund. If there is this gas tax holiday, it would come out of the surplus. 
   I remind my colleagues, we do at this point have a $23 billion on-budget surplus now; that is, surplus in addition to what we have as a result of the FICA, Social Security tax. So there is a surplus there. While we would like to protect that surplus as much as possible and not use it, or see it used to pay down the national debt, this is what I think to be a reasonable way to use some of it, if gasoline prices should actually go up to $2 a gallon. 
   What I am saying is, there is no difference between what we are trying to do and what the Byrd sense-of-the-Senate resolution said. He was trying, I believe, to make sure it did not come out of the highway trust fund. As a matter of fact, this amendment is drafted in such a way it does not. 
   Let me remind my colleagues how we got to this additional 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax. It was added in 1993. In the Senate, it passed on a tie vote with the Vice President, Vice President GORE, breaking that tie. There was a big debate about whether or not we should be increasing the price of gasoline by raising this tax in the first place. 
   But there was an even more important, very telling point, and that was, in this case the gas tax would not go into the highway trust fund but it was going to go into the General Treasury to be used for any number of purposes by the Federal Government, not to build highways and bridges and to improve urban mass transportation and rail service or anything of that nature, just to go into the big, deep, dark hole of the Federal Treasury. 
   By the way, I think about $21 billion of gas tax revenue went into the General Treasury. But then in 1997 Congress changed that and said no, this is a gasoline tax and it should go, like other gasoline taxes, into the highway trust fund. So it started going into the highway trust fund. 
   With regard to what we are trying to do here, the elite Washington position is: Oh, what difference does 4.3 cents a gallon make? We can afford that. 
   Yes, maybe, if you live and work on Capitol Hill or for the Federal Government. But if you are out there in the real world, and you are a working family, and you are driving 100 miles a day round trip to get to an industrial job, or to get to where your employment is, while it still will not add up to a lot of money, when you are a blue-collar worker, when you are a union worker, working at a shipyard or International Paper mill, a few dollars more a week in the price of gasoline does make a difference. It comes right out of that family budget. 
   So it is typically what you get here in Washington, the elite attitude: Well, it will not make that much difference. But it is not only the individual who is paying those higher gas taxes, it also affects smaller business men and women. It affects barge operators on our rivers and inland lakes across America. It affects the truck driver who, by the way, if he is an independent driver--he owns his own rig, he drives not a few hundred miles a week, he drives many hundreds of miles a week up and down this country and back and forth across this country--it is hitting him or her very hard because he is paying this extra cost to run those trucks. 
   Or, if you are in a business that involves a lot of trucks, a lot of heavy equipment, such as road construction or sand and gravel work, you have seen the cost of doing business go up considerably. It is not a few dollars, it is not hundreds of 
   dollars, it is thousands of dollars in cases such as that. 
   By the way, that comes right out of the bottom line because quite often you are carrying out a contract for which you have already submitted a bid, you have a price agreement, and now you see you are having to take this extra cost right out of getting this job done. So it is having a real impact. 
   The next argument against reducing the gasoline tax, or having a gas tax holiday, is that: Look, this is temporary. It was just a spike up in the price of gasoline. We did not see it coming. We were caught napping--according to the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Richardson--and the OPEC countries will open the spigot up a little bit and everything will be fine, prices will go back down. 
   Maybe they will. They have ticked down some in some areas, although I bought gasoline on Saturday and it cost $1.63 a gallon, and that was not the premium; premium was more than that. In some places it is more than that, in some places it is probably less than that. So maybe it will come down and maybe it will stay down, but I think maybe it might, as a matter of fact, tick back up because world demand is going to exceed supply. We are going to be drawing down reserves around the world. So I am concerned it could go back up, in addition to the fact it is still very high. 
   So this is an issue we should think about. We should be careful how we proceed. But we should have this debate. It is bigger than just gasoline price and the Federal gas tax, although, I repeat, to a lot of working people it has had an impact and it will continue to do so. 
   There is a broader question involved, and that is: What is our national energy plan? What are we going to do about the price of fuel, alternative fuels, conservation, environmental impact? All these questions are looming. 
   I do not think we have a true national energy plan for the future. Our dependence on foreign oil has gone  from 45 percent of our needs 10 years ago to around 55 or 56 percent now. I think it is going to go over 60. 
   What are we going to do? Are we comfortable with that? Are the American people comfortable with that? I do not think so. 
   In the early seventies, we had the higher prices. We had the gas lines. Nobody liked it. People really got mad. We put forth a lot of effort in Congress to develop a national energy plan and to make ourselves less dependent on oil. It has not worked. It has gone the other way. 
   We need to ask ourselves what we are going to do about this. What if the OPEC countries and other countries from whom we get our oil decide to cut the spigot down or cut it off? Economically, we would be in a real mess quickly. 
   We have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is something we did in the aftermath of the last price increase and the long lines. We have SPR filled up so if we have a national emergency, we can use it for about a month. 
   Is that enough? Should we do more? What are we going to do in the broader sense? I view this current upward spike as another knock on the door, another tap on the shoulder: Hey, America, you have a problem. You are dependent on Libya and 
   Qadhafi; you are dependent on Iraq for about 700,000 barrels of oil a day. Are you comfortable with that? 
   When I go home, I have people come up to me and say: Aren't these the same people we went to war for a few years ago? And now they are turning the spigot on and off, and the prices go way low or high. Is this what we want? I do not think so. It is very dangerous. 
   Then one may ask: What is going to be done? What can be done? We do need to look for more oil reserves of our own. We need to give incentives for our men and women, our independents, our wildcats, the small operators, and the big ones, to find more reserves, to make use of these oil wells that are capped right now. There are a few in my own State and certainly other places around the country. We ought to see if there are other places we can open up. 
   The Senate voted last week against an amendment that would have prevented using the reserves in ANWR in Alaska. I believe we can get at those oil reserves without causing environmental damage, and we should do that. 
   It is not just about more oil. The President said we should look at alternatives. I agree. What are the alternatives about which we are talking? One is natural gas. When I sit on my front porch in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS, looking off to the south and the east, I see a natural gas well. I believe natural gas is a good alternative. It is clean, and we can make a lot more use of it if we provide some incentives for making greater use of natural gas. We have tremendous reserves of natural gas. So much of it is in the ground; so much has been capped because it has not been worthwhile to get it out. That is an alternative that is environmentally safe, and we have lots of it. That is one option. 
   Also, in my part of the country we use coal to provide electricity to our people. It is cheap, and it also is clean-burning coal. Our companies have taken actions to deal with the emissions problems. Yet EPA today is putting genuine hard pressure on five companies in America, including Southern Company in our part of the United States, that will drive up the cost and will cause real problems using coal as their fuel supply in the future. 
   That is one alternative we ought to keep. We ought to find more oil; we ought to make use of natural gas; we ought to continue to find ways to burn coal with clean technology, with modern technology, but also that it is clean coal being burned. 
   The next thing is nuclear power. Nuclear power is clean. There is nuclear power already in Europe, China, and Japan. Yet we have been trying for years and have spent billions of dollars finding a repository for nuclear waste. The Senate passed a bill, I believe, two or three times, and the President is threatening to veto a very carefully thought out procedure of a repository for nuclear waste. 
   Sooner or later, if we cannot deal with that problem, our nuclear plants will be faced with the threat of shutting down. If we do not explore for more oil, if we do not make greater use of natural gas, if we put limits and make it difficult to use coal, if, as a matter of fact, we cannot use nuclear power because we cannot come up with a proper way with which to deal with nuclear waste disposal--talk about an environmental problem. Deciding how to deal with nuclear waste is the biggest environmental problem in America today. We have been batting that ball back and forth for 10 years or more, and we still have 
   not resolved it. 
   If not oil, not natural gas, not coal, and not nuclear, what? Solar and wind? That will help some, but the statistics I have seen show that will provide a very small percentage of our needs. Ethanol--I have supported ethanol. I just do not believe wind and solar, ethanol, and alternative sources beyond the ones I have been talking about will solve this problem. 
   I hope, as a result of the debate today and tomorrow, we will admit that we do not have a national energy policy, that we are dependent on foreign oil and are going to be for the foreseeable future unless we sit down, think this through, and come up with some ideas on how to proceed. 
   I have urged the committees of jurisdiction--the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and other committees--to have joint hearings or have hearings and ask questions about these long-term problems of how we are going to deal with these issues. I hope after we have this debate and votes tomorrow, we will have a broader, general energy package that will begin to address these long-term problems. I am concerned about it. I hope the Senate will step up to this issue and make a difference beyond what we have done in the past. 
   The second issue on which the Senate will be working this week is the marriage penalty tax. I believe most Americans have some idea by now of what it is. There have been different proposals on how to deal with it. Some of the arguments are: Yes, but if you are married, you get certain bonuses. I do not think that applies to what we are trying to deal with here. 
   The fact of the matter is, if you are a young couple or, as we realized last week, an older couple--couples married 25 years get hit with a marriage penalty tax, but for young couples it is particularly startling. 
   I found that to be the case with my own family. Our daughter got married last May. She has been hearing talk about the marriage penalty tax, so she decided to find out what that would mean for her. She and her husband both work. Together, they have a pretty good income, although they are certainly not wealthy, but they are in that middle bracket. She figured it would cost them about $500 more this year in taxes because they got married. 
   By the way, it is going to escalate over the next few years to about $1,400 a year. This is just basically wrong. We should encourage people to get married. We should not in any way discourage them by saying: Oh, by the way, if you do get married, you will pay more in taxes. 
   Some people will complain the package that came out of the Finance Committee is too big; that, as a matter of fact, not only did we deal with the low-income people by increasing what was in the House bill for the so-called earned-income tax credit, EITC, we also said we will double the 15-percent bracket and the 28-percent bracket because we do think if a marriage penalty tax is wrong, it should be wrong for everybody. 
   It should not be wrong just for the entry-level, lower income people; it ought to be also unfair for the upper lower income bracket and the middle-income bracket; as a matter of fact, right across the board. 
   But we at least broadened its application to the middle bracket to make sure, if you have a young couple who are both working--whether they are in blue-color jobs or whether they are in entry-level professional jobs--they should have this penalty eliminated. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN of New York, and others, have an alternative proposal. I think it is worth considering. In fact, if we could afford it, I would like to have what we are doing and what Senator MOYNIHAN is proposing in terms of--I guess it is the income splitting option. But I think we ought to have that offered and debated. 
   I think we can come up with a way that we can have a full debate where  there could be amendments with regard to the marriage penalty legislation. I hope we can reach an agreement on how that would come up. Then on Wednesday and Thursday, we would debate the alternatives and we would have a vote. But it is long overdue. 
   I hope we can do as we did on the Social Security earnings limitation. We passed it unanimously in the Senate. A lot of people said: Oh, gee, that was so easy. Why didn't you do it before? We have been talking about it for 20 years. We couldn't get it done. 
   They said it cost too much or that senior citizens didn't really need it or it was a part of a package. But for some reason or another--for years and years--it did not happen. Finally, we isolated it, passed it clean, and passed it overwhelmingly. 
   The President had a big signing ceremony last week saying: Finally, we have eliminated the Social Security earnings test. Good. The main thing is our seniors who are between 65 and 69, who want to continue working without being penalized in their Social Security benefits, are going to have that opportunity. 
   But I think the same is true here. It is clear now we have isolated it. The marriage penalty tax is not connected to incentives for people to adopt children. It is not connected to the death tax or the estate tax. It is not connected to anything else. We are just going to have a debate about the marriage penalty tax. Senator HUTCHISON of Texas and Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri, and a number of other Senators on both sides, are going to say: We ought to do this. This is the way to do it. 
   But in the end, this is the point: We are going to see this week if the Senate is for eliminating the marriage penalty tax or not. 
   The guy in the store where I was shopping is going to have a list of the names of those who vote against it. I hope the Senate will step up to this and that we will begin the process of totally eliminating the marriage penalty tax. 
   Then, finally, on the budget resolution, I hope we can get a final agreement on the conference report and that we will pass it before the end of the week so we can go forward with our appropriations bills. That is a very important part of what we need to do this year; that is, pass the 13 appropriations bills for Agriculture, for defense, for the Interior, and for all the various Agencies and Departments of the Government, and more importantly for the American people. 
   We ought to do it earlier than usual. There is no reason why we should wait until June or July to do the appropriations bills. Let's get started in May. Let's move them earlier. That is where we can include things that we think should be done. 
   For instance, on the foreign relations bill, I think we should provide aid for Colombia to fight the narcoguerrillas and try to get control of that drug war there. I think we ought to do it, and do it on the foreign relations bill. 
   With regard to Kosovo and defense, the first bill that comes along, whether it is MilCon--military construction--or the defense bill, I hope we will add that additional funding. This budget resolution conference report will get all of that started. 
   Then I think important, once again, is, we should give credit to the Budget Committee and to what we are doing in the Congress as a result of this budget resolution. No. 1, for the third year in a row, we have the ability to have a balanced budget--3 years running now. Before that, we had not had one since 1969. Yet this year we have the ability to do that for a third time, and to protect every cent of the Social Security trust fund income. Every cent that comes in from FICA taxes will be preserved and set aside and will not be spent on other Federal Government spending programs. 
   I do not know exactly what that amount would be for the coming year, but it would be significant. I think maybe the figure is approximately $160 billion, or something close to that. But over a 10-year period, it will be $1 trillion. By not spending it, that is good for the program, it is good for technology, and we can pay down the national debt. 
   Over a 3-year period now, I understand we may have reduced the national debt by somewhere more than $300 billion. A lot of people never thought they would see the day come when we would actually begin to pay down the national debt. 
   If we stay on the path we are on, if we stay on the trajectory we now see with technology--and a lot has to happen; we have to have good fiscal responsibility, monetary policy, stable energy prices, right across the board--but if those things will stay within the ranges we are looking for, we could reduce completely the national debt by the year 2013 or 2015. That has not been done since Andrew Jackson was President of the United States. That is really an amazing thing. 
   If we can continue to keep in place policies by congressional actions, and by monetary policy, and by the administration, and see economic growth year after year of around 4.5 percent--and in recent years it has been more than that; but just 4.5 percent--it would have a tremendous impact on the economy and the explosion of revenue coming into the Social Security trust fund. 
   When we come to the point, over the next 2 or 3 years, where we are going to have fundamental reform of Social Security, to make sure it is preserved, protected, and, as a matter of fact, it is there for our children and our grandchildren in a way that will be meaningful to them, just that growth in the economy of 4.5 percent will give us the options we need to have a very strong program that will go not just into the year 2040 but go throughout this century. 
   I think these are very important issues. This is going to be an interesting week to have debate. When we complete that budget resolution, it will be a very positive action and will set the course for not only this year but well into the rest of this decade. 
   Mr. President, I have been looking forward to this opportunity to have this debate and have these votes this week. I look forward to that process as we go forward. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   The sense-of-the-Senate resolutions are not binding at all. They may make a statement that makes you feel good, but many Senators are being asked to agree to these en bloc without knowing what the details are.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Northwest Airlines, one of the defendants in a civil antitrust action brought by the Department of Justice on behalf of the United States in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, has subpoenaed the General Accounting Office to produce documents that GAO collected or generated in the course of its preparation of testimony or reports for several Senate committees, including the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business Rights, and Competition. 
   GAO advised Northwest's counsel that the documents sought were unavailable because they are protected by  both the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, which is Congress's legislative privilege, and GAO's own deliberative process privilege. Northwest Airlines has chosen to contest GAO's assertion of privilege by moving in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to compel GAO to produce the documents. 
   The records that Northwest Airlines is seeking were records that GAO, which is an investigative agency of Congress, collected or created while preparing testimony or reports in response to requests from committees and subcommittees of the Senate. Northwest has not given GAO, the Senate, or the Court any explanation for why it may defeat the privileges inhering in GAO internal work product and deliberative documents, including drafts of proposed testimony, to defend itself in this antitrust action. None of these internal records at issue in this matter has been provided to Northwest's adversary, the Justice Department. Nor are the final reports issued by GAO or GAO's congressional testimony at issue in this matter, as all parties to the litigation, including Northwest Airlines, have been given full access to these materials. 
   GAO is opposing Northwest's motion to compel, invoking its deliberative process privilege. But the legislative privilege that is grounded on the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause belongs to the Congress. In order to ensure congressional independence from the other branches of the government, the Constitution affords Congress with an absolute privilege from compelled questioning through the courts about the performance of its legislative responsibilities, such as the gathering of information and preparation of hearings, the conduct of administrative oversight, and the consideration of legislation. 
   The Senate has a strong interest in the ability of its committees to receive testimony and analysis from GAO, which serves as its investigative arm, without fear that entities whose activities are the subject of that testimony and analysis will be allowed to root around in GAO's internal work papers, drafts, and deliberative documents seeking something of possible help to them in unrelated litigation. That kind of intrusion into the legislation process is precisely what the Speech or Debate Clause was intended to foreclose. 
   Because the Speech or Debate Clause privilege belongs to the Congress and because it is the committee of Congress that are the direct beneficiaries of GAO's contributions to their legislative work, it is appropriate that the court hear directly from those Senate committees for which GAO was providing analysis how Northwest's attempt to compel production of GAO's internal work product threatens their autonomous performance of legislative duties entrusted to them under the Constitution. Accordingly, this resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to intervene in this matter in the name of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Appropriations to assert the Speech or Debate Clause as protection against compelled questioning of GAO, through compelled production of GAO's internal work product when responding to requests from Congress.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the second anniversary of National Tartan Day. I will be assisting those who do not have on their plaids, their Tartans, during the day to make sure you have one for your lapel--if not around your neck. We welcome our special guest chaplain in the Senate, the Right Reverend John Cairns, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is my understanding that the office of Moderator is the highest honor that the Church of Scotland can bestow on a minister. The Moderator has had a distinguished career in the ministry, and we are truly privileged to have him as our guest for today's Tartan Day activities. 
   I remind my colleagues that the resolution which established National Tartan Day was Senate Resolution 155. It passed by unanimous consent on March 20th of 1998. As an American of Scottish descent, I appreciate the efforts of individuals, clan organizations, and other groups such as the Scottish Coalition, who were instrumental in generating support for the resolution. These groups have worked diligently to foster national awareness of the important role that Americans of Scottish descent have played in the progress of our country. 
   The purpose of National Tartan Day is to recognize the contributions that Americans of Scottish ancestry have made to our national heritage. It also recognizes the contributions that Americans of Scottish ancestry continue to make to our country. National Tartan Day is an opportunity to pause and reflect on the role Scottish Americans have played in advancing democracy and freedom. They have helped shape this Nation. Their contributions are innumerable. In fact, I myself was surprised to learn that three-fourths of all American Presidents can trace their roots to Scotland. 
   In addition to recognizing Americans of Scottish ancestry, National Tartan Day reminds us of the importance of freedom. It honors those who strived for freedom from an oppressive government on April 6, 1320. It was on that day that the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence, was signed. This important document served as the model for America's Declaration of Independence. 
   In demanding their independence from England, the men of Arbroath wrote, ``We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his life.'' These words are applicable today to the heroism of our American veterans and active duty forces who know the precious cost of fighting for liberty. 
   Senate Resolution 155 has served as a catalyst for the many States, cities, and counties that have passed similar resolutions recognizing the important contributions of Scottish Americans. 
   I hail originally from Carroll County, MS, where the neighborhood was made up of Watsons, my mother's family; McCains, Senator JOHN MCCAIN's family; McCalebs, McLeans, McKellys, and the list goes on and on. Most of them were ``Macs.'' I don't know how the Watsons got in there. 
   I thank all of my colleagues who supported this resolution in the past and who helped to remind the world of the  stand for liberty taken on April 6--almost 700 years ago--in Arbroath, Scotland. A call for liberty which still echoes through our history and the history of many nations across the globe. 
   It has been my hope that this annual event will grow in prominence each year, similar to St. Patrick's Day and Columbus Day, and the ceremonies and activities taking place today and over the next few days demonstrate that these goals are coming to fruition. I believe April 6 can also serve as a day to recognize those nations that have not achieved the principles of freedom which we hold dear. The example of the Scotsmen at Arbroath--their courage--their desire for freedom--serves as a beacon to countries still striving for liberty today.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 101, the budget resolution. By a previous order, there will be two back-to-back votes beginning at 10:30 a.m. The vote on the Byrd amendment will be the first, to be followed by a vote on the Roth amendment. Following the votes, the Durbin amendment regarding tax cuts will be the pending amendment. 
   For the information of all Senators, the so-called vote-arama--and I hope it will not rise to that level; maybe it will just be a few votes we will have to take one after the other--is expected to begin at some point this evening. I do want to emphasize, though, unless we are successful, on both sides of the aisle--let me say, Senator REID has been working very hard on the Democratic side of the aisle. They have a reasonably low number of amendments still pending. We hope to reduce the number on this side of the aisle, too. We should be able to determine by late this afternoon whether we can finish tonight or we will go over to tomorrow. I think we need to go ahead and tell our colleagues they should plan on being in and having votes in the morning because at this point, with some 60 amendments pending, I do not see how we can finish it tonight by any kind of reasonable hour. 
   I will stay in touch with Senator DOMENICI and Senator LAUTENBERG, the floor managers, and Senator REID and Senator NICKLES on our side, to assess the additional time that might be needed. Senators should adjust their schedules accordingly. 
   I know there is an event tonight, a dinner. But we can finish tonight or we can finish tomorrow, or whatever it takes. We have to complete our work. There are only about 8 1/2 hours remaining of time, so we should be able to finish that all right today. The remainder of the time will be determined by how many amendments we have remaining. 
   I will be glad to yield to Senator DOMENICI.

   Mr. LOTT. I have been urging Senators, and I know Senator DASCHLE has also, to prepare to be in session on this Friday, knowing the budget resolution was headed for this date for at least a couple of weeks. So we should proceed with that in mind. If we get a lot of cooperation and something could be worked out, that would be different, but I do not see how we can predict anything at this point but having votes on Friday morning. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that was a 35-minute vote. I apologize for letting it go on that long. You can see how hard it is going to be to get through a vote-arama if we do that. Our plan now is to have two more votes tonight. If Senators would stay in the Chamber or close to the Chamber, we could do those votes in no more than 15 or 20 minutes. Maybe we could cut the second one down to 10. That would certainly help. 
   We are now ready to go into the period for the votes on the number of amendments that are pending, the so-called vote-arama. 
   Having said that, any Senator who has timely filed their amendment at the desk can call it up for Senate consideration. However, there is no allotted time for debate. 
   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that, as we did last year, in a way that I think is the fairest to try to explain what the amendments are, in that brief period of time, there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote for explanation, and all votes in the vote-arama be limited to 10 minutes each after the first vote.

   Mr. LOTT. I think that is obviously a good suggestion. Let me add to this, if I could, Mr. President, that we are going to go forward with two more amendments tonight, one on each side--the Bond amendment on our side and the Reed amendment on their side. After that, we are going to stop for tonight because we still have a large number of amendments that have not been able to be worked through. I am going to ask the managers on both sides to get all these amendments lined up and to get the first five on each side ready for in the morning so we won't have to wait until we come in. Also, we will come in at 9 o'clock so we can get an early as possible start. Some would like to be able to go home or do commitments as early as possible. But as it now stands, because of the number of 
   amendments and the fact that we haven't had an opportunity to line up all the amendments in order, the managers requested we do it this way. 
   I emphasize that as soon as we finish the votes on amendments that are offered, and a vote is required, when we finish those, we will be through. So you may want to take that into consideration as to whether or not you insist on your amendment tomorrow. We can finish at 10 or 11 o'clock, or 12, but we need to go ahead and complete that. 
   Having said that, I am looking that way, but I could more easily be looking our way. A lot of amendments are still pending on both sides that really could be handled in some other way. I hope Senators will consider doing that. I thank the managers for the time they spent and the cooperation we have been getting from Senator DASCHLE and Senator REID doing his usual good job. But our managers need this time tonight and early in the morning to start getting amendments racked up so we can vote on the first five.

   Mr. LOTT. We can do that. It requires that Senators stay here and that we stay attentive and say ``turn it in.'' We are trying to be considerate of both sides. Obviously, we need to stop. If we get unanimous consent for it to be 10 minutes, we will stop it. I amend the UC so that we may have 2 minutes equally divided on each amendment and that this vote and the next vote be 10 minutes each.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been asked whether I intend to call up for consideration on the Senate floor legislation that has been introduced in the Senate with respect to asbestos. After conferring with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction of this issue, it is clear that a markup has not yet been scheduled, and that extensive work would be needed before the bill is ready for Senate floor action. I have also conferred with the sponsor of the bill who informs me that since the bill was introduced, the consensus regarding this legislation, S. 758, between industry, the plaintiffs, and other concerned parties, and among industry itself, appears to have deteriorated substantially. This bill is not ready for Senate floor action. The Senate will soon be occupied with budget, appropriations, tax and other legislation. For these reasons, and in all candor, the necessary floor time will not be available to act on the Senate asbestos bill this year.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary citizen and public servant who has dedicated his life to the noble endeavor of law enforcement and the edification of those committed to this distinguished profession. Tyler H. Fletcher of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, exemplifies the qualifies of honor, courage, dedication, and service that reflect the outstanding character of this former colonel in the United States Army Military Police. With the retirement of Colonel Fletcher on Friday, April 7, 2000, I express my highest gratitude to him for over 50 years of service and leadership to the United States of America. 
   As an officer in the United States Army Military Police, Colonel Fletcher was recognized with the Police Medal of Honor from the Republic of South Vietnam, three Legion of Merit awards, the Bronze Star, an Army Commendation, and four Meritorious Unit Citations. After retirement from the Military Police in 1971, Colonel Fletcher continued his exemplary service as associate professor and chairman of the department of criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi, garnering the distinction of Who's Who in American Law Enforcement in 1978 and the Excellence in Teaching Award in 1980. 
   Colonel Fletcher's extraordinary accomplishments in the professional arena are matched only by his dedication to the service of his fellow Americans. He has greatly contributed to the field of law enforcement by authoring numerous books and articles on the subjects of correctional administration, juvenile justice, and community policing. He is a pioneer in his research into areas of police education, crimes against the elderly, and victims of crime in Mississippi. He is a leader in his field as an active contributor to the National Society of Police and Criminal Psychology, the Mississippi Association of chiefs of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, the Disabled Americans Veterans, and the Mississippi Corrections Officers Association. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished career of Colonel Tyler H. Fletcher associates him with the best of the best in the United States, surpassing the accolades of personal accomplishments and awards only with the gift of inspiration to future leaders and former colleagues. Colonel Fletcher is a great American, and his service to his country, his profession, and his fellow man serves as the benchmark by which we all should hope to achieve.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business throughout the day with time under the control of Senator BOB SMITH, Senator BROWNBACK or his designee, Senator CRAIG or his designee, and Senator DURBIN or his designee. As previously announced, no votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. However, the Senate will begin consideration of the budget resolution at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday morning, and votes can be expected during each day and evening throughout the week. 
   The budget resolution is allowed up to 50 hours of debate, and quite often we have a series of votes at the end of that time. I hope we will not get into a long list of amendments that will require votes right at the very end. It is not a very good way to do business. Last year, after a lot of hard work by Senator REID and others, we were able to reduce that list to at least a reasonable number. But Senators should be on notice that we will have to spend a good bit of time in session on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, probably going into the night at least Wednesday and Thursday, and that there is a very good chance we will be in on Friday with votes. 
   If we can complete the budget resolution Thursday night, even if it means going late into the night, we will do that; otherwise, we will go into Friday. But we will complete the budget resolution this week so we can move forward with appropriations bills in the appropriations subcommittees beginning next week. 
   Members should also be aware there are a number of important committee markups that will be occurring this week. So we are going to have a very busy time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Air Force officer and former Marine, Brigadier General Ernest R. Webster, upon his retirement from the Air Force after more than thirty-two years of commissioned service. Throughout his career, Brigadier General Webster has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the Air Force and our Nation. 
   General Webster is a native of my home State, having been born in Anguilla, Mississippi. He entered the United States Marine Corps Officer Candidate School Quantico, Virginia in 1967. After successfully qualifying as a Marine aviator, he served as a pilot and intelligence officer for the Naval Special Landing Forces in the Caribbean region. He served his nation as an aviator in Southeast Asia while stationed with the 1st Marine Air Wing in the Republic of Vietnam. General Webster was an aircraft maintenance officer and test pilot at New River, North Carolina prior to his transfer into the United States Air Force in January 1972. After attending Maintenance Officer School at Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois, he was assigned to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, where he was chief of maintenance, flight examiner, chief of safety, and operations officer for the 301st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. 
   As a major, he was assigned to Sheppard and Little Rock Air Force Bases for flight training where he mastered the C-130 Hercules weapon system. His next assignment was chief of safety for the 920th Weather Reconnaissance Group at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. He then moved to March Air Force Base, California, serving as deputy commander for operations at the 303rd Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. He was promoted to colonel in 1985. 
   During that same year, Colonel Webster took command of the 907th Tactical Airlift Group, Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, in Ohio. He was promoted to deputy chief of staff for operations, Headquarters 14th Air Force, Dobbins Air Force Base, Headquarters Air Force Reserve, to serve as assistant deputy chief of staff for operations where he played a critical role in the call-up of thousands of Air Force reserve members to Southwest Asia during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He then moved to Duke Field, Florida, to assume command of the 919th Special Operations Wing where he directed critical tactical operations. In 1994 he assumed command of the 403rd Wing at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. Colonel Webster was promoted to Brigadier General in 1995. 
   General Webster's accomplishments are many. Units under his command received the Outstanding Unit Award in three of the five years he was in command. His ``Flying Jennies'' of the 815th Airlift Squadron accomplished Denton Amendment humanitarian missions in Honduras, Argentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Russia, and many other areas struck by disaster. His ``Hurricane Hunters'' of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron were world-famous for providing critical hurricane information to residents of coastal areas in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 
   During his stellar career, General Webster has served the United States Marine Corps, the United States Air Force, and our great Nation with excellence and distinction. He provided exemplary leadership to the best-trained, best-equipped, and best-prepared citizen-airmen force in the history of our Nation. General Webster is a model of leadership and is a living example of our military's dedication to the core values of service before self, integrity first, and excellence in all endeavors. 
   General Webster will retire from the United States Air Force on April 3, 2000 after thirty-two years and six months of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish General Webster blue skies and safe landings. Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today's fuel prices are a daily reminder that America is now at the mercy of foreign oil producing nations. However, before you blame your neighbor's SUV, your local fuel distributors, the oil companies, the automakers, or any of the other usual scapegoats, consider this fact--America is one of the leading energy producing countries in the world. This country has the technology, alternative resources and enough oil to be much more self-sufficient. America does not have to revert back to the practices of the 1970s. 
   This country is faced with a very serious problem. Our nation's farmers and truckers are being hit the hardest--simply because of this Administration's lack of energy policy. In fact, Secretary Richardson recently admitted that this Administration was caught napping when energy prices began to rise. As a result, U.S. crude oil production is down 17 percent since 1993, and consumption is up 14%. America now imports 56% of the oil consumed--compared to 36% imported at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. At this rate the DOE predicts America will be at least 65% dependent on foreign oil by 2020. 
   This Administration has close ties to radical environmentalists--environmentalists whose strong rhetoric and drastic actions appear more like a new-age religion than a clarion call for good stewardship. It appears that the White House has spent eight years trying to slowly kill our oil, coal, natural gas and even our hydroelectric industries. 
   The Administration began this process in 1993 with an effort to impose a $73 billion five-year energy tax to force the American people away from the use of automobiles and American industries away from their primary energy sources. The Clinton/Gore EPA is still attempting to shut down coal-fired electric generating plants in the South and Midwest. Meanwhile, the Administration is providing no offsets to this. In fact, they have done nothing to increase the availability of domestic natural gas, which is the clean alternative for coal in electric plants. Federal land out West is expected to contain as much as 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but the Administration refuses to allow drilling. Similarly, the Administration will not allow exploration on federal land in Alaska, which is estimated to contain 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oil. 
   None of these facts should be surprising. Vice President GORE has vowed to prohibit future exploration for oil or natural gas on our outer-continental-shelf. He has bluntly stated that the internal combustion engine--the very mechanism which drove America's industrial development and led to the creation of our middle class--is a threat. Maybe that's why he embraces the Kyoto Protocol which would impose staggering consumption restrictions on our economy, while exempting other countries. This treaty is so bad that my colleagues from GORE's own party joined the Senate leadership in voting against it 95 to zero. AL GORE may not depend on the internal combustion engine for his livelihood, but 
   a lot of folks beyond the Washington beltway do. 
   There has to be a solution to this problem. Even without tapping all of America's resources, this country still produces almost half of her fuel needs--far more than most industrial countries. In the long run, a national energy policy that looks at all realistic alternative sources of energy must be developed. Congress must also provide incentives for independent producers to keep their wells pumping. Tax credits for marginal wells will restore our link to existing oil resources, including many in Mississippi. These solutions will be needed someday soon. 
   In the short term, Congress can reduce or temporarily suspend federal fuel taxes, which, along with state excise taxes, account for an average of 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. This would include the ``Gore Fuel Tax'' ram-rodded by the President back in 1993 in a decision so close that AL GORE headed to Capitol Hill to cast the tie-breaking vote. Yes, the Vice-President is the very reason the 4.3 cent gas tax was implemented. Now, as the Administration continues to do nothing to remedy this crisis, the Congress can make a difference. Repealing the Gore Gas Tax immediately, and providing a complete federal fuels tax holiday if prices reach a nationwide average of $2.00, will provide real relief for American consumers at the pump. This can be done for the remainder of this year without touching one cent of the Highway Trust Fund, Social Security, or Medicare. This is a real solution to a very real problem. 
   This reflects the leadership of a number of our colleagues on this important issue. One provision to suspend the diesel fuel tax has been championed by the senior Senator from Colorado, BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL. A trucker himself, Senator CAMPBELL has led the way on ways to assist truckers and their families who are suffering from the rising price of diesel fuel. He has met with the truckers who have traveled great distances to Washington to make their voices heard. Senator CAMPBELL's unique insights and personal experiences have been helpful to the leadership in crafting this comprehensive gas tax bill. 
   This is not the 1970s. America has better technology, more efficient and cleaner automobiles as well as more energy options. The question is: how long will we hold these options and be held hostage to nations abroad or radical environmentalists at home? America can solve her energy problems but Congress must act in the interests of our entire nation, rather than a select few.

   Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I commend those who have been involved in the debate on this very important issue over the past 3 days. 
   It is occasions such as this when I think the Senate quite often rises to the greatest height, but it should, because we are debating very important issues here, symbols of our freedom and our democracy, the Constitution, the flag. 
   I am pleased we have had this discussion. I think the American people want the Senate to act in this area. Now we are prepared to vote. 
   I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 14, the constitutional amendment to protect the flag of the United  States. What we have before the Senate today is a very simple measure. I have had some discussion with some individuals from outside Washington who asked, how long and how complicated is it? It is not long. It is very simple. 
   It reads in full:  
   The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.  
   That is the entire amendment. 
   During most of the history of our Republic, the provision expressed in this amendment would have been noncontroversial. Indeed, prior to the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Texas v. Johnson in 1989, 48 States and the Federal Government had laws protecting our most basic national symbol, the flag. The Supreme Court's decision in 1989 reflected a fundamental misunderstanding, a misunderstanding of the law, of our history, and of basic common sense. 
   Those who oppose this amendment argue that defacing the flag somehow represents speech that must be protected under the first amendment of the Constitution. I think people have a pretty good understanding of what speech is--at least outside of Washington--and what type of activity is protected under our Constitution. I imagine there are some close situations where there is room for disagreement, obviously, but I don't think that is the case here. 
   We live in a free society where individuals are free to express their views. People can express dissatisfaction with their government, and they do; with the laws, and they do; and even with the flag. They can express those disagreements. While the speech in which some of our fellow citizens choose to engage can at times be repulsive and offensive or even dangerous, we do respect the fundamental right of individuals to express their ideas. No one is suggesting it should be otherwise. 
   In my opinion, burning the flag is not speech, it is conduct of the most offensive kind. Protecting the right of individuals to destroy property has no relation to the question of whether people are free to speak or to write or to campaign or to petition against the leaders of their government. I strongly reject the notion that those who support this amendment lack concern or respect for our traditions of free speech or for the notion that people should be free to criticize their government. This amendment simply will not hinder those basic freedoms. 
   Certainly, Senator HATCH, who has led the debate on this side, and many other Senators who will vote for this have great respect for our traditions of free speech and for the Constitution. But they think this is an issue that rises to the level of being considered as an amendment. 
   This measure does not change the first amendment nor does it alter our historical respect of free speech. It merely restores the original understanding of our Constitution, an 
   understanding that led nearly every State and the Federal Government to maintain for decades laws protecting the flag. 
   As we consider this amendment, it is essential to remind ourselves that our rights, our constitutional guarantees, do not exist in a vacuum. They exist for a reason--namely, to further our great experiment in self-government and a constitutional republic. They exist to help us thrive as individuals and as a nation. 
   The American flag is a sacred, basic, fundamental symbol of our Nation's ideals--the symbol of those goals and values for which we have asked our young men and women to fight and die. It is a symbol that causes citizens to rise in pride and to salute. It is a symbol men and women have followed. It is a symbol men have carried into battle. It does represent those basic tenets in which we believe in this country. 
   Some argue that allowing the desecration of this most vital symbol somehow shows our strength and self-assurance as a nation. I disagree. I think it reflects a perversion of liberty and a misunderstanding of our system of government. Allowing the desecration of our national symbol is not a sign of strength, it is a sign of self-indulgence, as we have in so many areas of our society today, of a nation that does not take seriously the obvious point that our rights coexist with responsibilities and limitations. 
   The flag is unique. When we went to the Moon, we didn't take some other sign of military might, some billboard, some expression of our great wealth. No, instead we planted the flag, the same flag that was raised over Iwo Jima, the same flag we lower to half mast at times of national tragedy, the same flag we drape over the coffin of our American heroes and our veterans. Surely protecting such a symbol is not only consistent with our deepest traditions but essential to preserve the society that has developed and fostered those traditions. 
   I sympathize with those who express concern that a constitutional amendment is an extraordinary event and should not be taken lightly. It never is. We have had some tremendous debates over the years on constitutional amendments. Most of them were defeated, but, on occasion, some have passed and they have proven to be good for the advancement of our country. 
   Had the Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution appropriately, we would not be forced to take this serious and unusual step. However, the Supreme Court's failure to act responsibly on this issue leaves us no other means to protect this symbol for which so many Americans have sacrificed their lives and to which they have pledged their sacred honor. 
   Some Members of this body claim that these goals can be accomplished through statute. I can say frankly that I wish it would be so but I don't believe it can be so. Make no mistake, the Supreme Court has stated over and over and over again that its interpretation of the first amendment trumps any statute Congress may pass. 
   If we truly wish to protect the flag--and I know an overwhelming number of Americans do--we have no choice but to vote for a constitutional amendment. 
   There are those who belittle this amendment and our effort to protect the flag. They claim it is too narrow an issue, too small a problem, and that this is an issue not worthy of Congress' attention. I believe this issue is more important than any appropriation or any new set of regulations for it goes to the heart of who we are as a people and what we are as a 
   nation. 
   The United States is different from almost every other nation on Earth. Those who come to America don't share the same language, the same religion, the same ethnicity, the same history, or the same geography. Instead of those tangible similarities, Americans are united by intangibles--by our commitment to certain ideals. One of those ideals is the principle of free speech. But another is the devotion to our country and a commitment to work for its success. By asking Americans to respect the flag, we simply ask them to demonstrate that any protest, criticism, or complaint they may have is made with the best interests of the Nation at heart. The measure before the Senate today furthers that basic and essential principle upon which our Nation was founded. 
   Once again, we are being told that the Senate should reject this, that we know better. Yet look at what has happened. The States have voted overwhelmingly to protect the flag. Forty-eight States had laws protecting it before the Supreme Court decision. 
   Many State legislatures have called upon the Congress to send this amendment to the States. In fact, I think every State legislature has done that. The House of Representatives has passed a flag amendment by a large, overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. Now it is up to the Senate to do what we should. Are we saying we know better than the American people? That we know better than every State legislature in the Nation? That we know better than the House of Representatives? We know better? Why not allow the people, through their State legislatures, to have the final say? Why not pass this amendment, send it to the people, and let them make the final determination? I think they will make the right decision. 
   I think we should work together today on both sides of the aisle to pass this amendment and send it to the people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request which I have communicated to Senator DASCHLE. He is here to respond. Before I propound it, I will say this does have to do with the issue of gasoline taxes, and it is an effort to get a process started so we can have a discussion and debate about votes on this issue. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to Calendar No. 473, S.  2285, regarding gas taxes, and that following the reporting of the bill, there be 4 hours equally divided for debate under control of the two leaders or their designees. I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments or motions be in order and, following the use or yielding back of time, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without intervening action or debate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret the objection from the minority leader, but I understand. This agreement would allow the Senate to pass and send a message to all Americans that we are trying to do what we can in the short term to alleviate the rising gas prices all Americans are paying at the pumps. 
   I would not suggest for a moment that this is the long-term solution, and I should emphasize, this legislation would allow for the suspension of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax for the remainder of the year, with a trigger device that says that if the average price nationwide reaches $2, then there will be a gas tax holiday for the remainder of the year for the full 18.4 cents a gallon. 
   It is pretty simple and straightforward. There would be time for debate, but I understand. 
   We will get the process started, and we will see how it develops in terms of the debate and what votes will occur in order for us to start this process, which looks like we will have to go through a motion to proceed to invoke cloture on the bill and then there will be subsequent votes. 
   In order for this to be considered in a timely fashion, which could take as long as a week or two, I thought we needed to get it started.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to comment at this time about one of the most effective and respected Senators in this Chamber. He can be ferocious in trying to get his work done, but he always winds up doing it with a smile on his face. He quite often acts as a typical trial lawyer making his case against the opposing counsel or pleading his case to the jury. Of course, we enjoy referring to him sometimes as the ``Tasmanian devil.'' When he comes to the Senate floor wearing his Tasmanian devil tie, look out; he is ready to do the people's business in quick order. 
   For more than 30 years, the Alaskan of the Year Committee has named an Alaskan of the year who has significantly affected the character and the development of the 49th State. Thus, it is no surprise that in 1974 Senator STEVENS, along with the newspaper publisher, was named ``Alaskan of the Year.'' Recently, the Alaskan of the Year Committee set out to name the Alaskan of the Century. 
   I inquired of the Senator from Alaska, which century? The past century for past favors or the present century for expected ones? With the usual sense of humor, he deferred to maybe the past century. 
   Mr. President, 88 names of great Alaskans appeared on the first ballot. The second ballot contained 12; the third ballot contained 3. On the final ballot, Alaska's senior Senator, who has served so well in this body, TED STEVENS, was named ``Alaskan of the Century.'' 
   What a great honor. On Saturday night, in Anchorage, AK, surrounded by family and friends, this great honor, Alaskan of the Century, will be conferred on Senator STEVENS. Senator 
   STEVENS has had a role in every significant event in Alaska for the last half century, whether it be as a youth working for Alaskan statehood or his mastery in crafting and shepherding through Congress the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, landmark legislation for which there is no other precedent. 
   It would take all day to list the great many things Senator STEVENS has accomplished during his 31 years serving in the Senate, and even longer to list all of his friends. Mr. President, not only is TED STEVENS a great Senator and a great Alaskan, he is, above all, a loyal friend to all who know him. Even in the heat of battle, when it gets tough around here, in the next minute or the next hour, he is lovingly trying to do something to help his previous opponent, whether it be in the leadership of his own party or across the aisle in the other party. 
   His 6 children and 10 grandchildren, and his wife, Catherine, who is special in her own way, know for sure that Senator TED STEVENS, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, senior Senator for the 49th State, is indeed worthy of the honor he will receive this week as Alaskan of the Century. 
   His service in the military, his service in that State, his service of bringing that State into the Union, his service as a Senator, and his service as chairman of the Appropriations Committee is truly unique. I offer my personal congratulations. I know I speak for all of my colleagues in applauding TED STEVENS. 
   I don't know how in the world we would even pick a Mississippian of the century. There have been so many great ones in this past century, but in Alaska, it is obvious: The man for that job and for that honor is TED STEVENS. Thank you, TED, for what you do for your country and for your State. We are proud. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of this weekend in my home State of Mississippi. On March 25th, Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) will rededicate and rename its football complex. Formerly known as Magnolia Stadium, the Rice-Totten Stadium will honor two of MVSU's great athletes and two ambassadors for the Itta Bena school. 
   Jerry Rice is a legend--not only in Mississippi, but throughout the world. After completing an extraordinary career at Valley, Jerry went on to become the greatest professional wide receiver ever. During his time with the San Francisco 49ers, Jerry dazzled fans with his ability to make the impossible look easy, broke numerous NFL reception records, and led his team to multiple Super Bowl Championships. 
   Willie Totten is one of collegiate athletics's greatest competitors. From 1983-1986 Willie led Valley to the top of Division I-AA football. He also raised the bar by which all college offenses are now judged. Today, almost every college football team utilizes a strong pass-oriented offense game plan, but that hasn't always been the case. Football fans have Willie to thank for showing us how exciting passing over 50 times a game can be. Following a solid career with the Buffalo Bills, Willie served the future of competitive athletics as a college and high school coach. 
   I believe it's only fitting that MVSU recognize and honor Jerry Rice and Willie Totten for their accomplishments and achievements by naming Magnolia Stadium after them. Although I will not be able to attend the rededication ceremony, I wish MVSU, Jerry Rice, Willie Totten, their families, and those associated with the University they celebrate this occasion.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent request. I have notified the Democratic leader that I intended to do that. I see there are Senators on the floor who will probably have some comments to make. But before I propound that request, let me outline what I would like to do and what has transpired. 
   Senators will recall that last year there was a major effort made to pass through the Senate bankruptcy reform legislation. That has been a bipartisan effort. The Judiciary Committee has done excellent work. Chairman HATCH has been cooperative. Senator GRASSLEY has been magnificent in working with both sides of the aisle. Democratic Senators had input. 
   After some starts and stops, we made real progress, but it did get held up at the end of the session. We did not get it completed. 
   When we came back in at the beginning of the year, we decided the best thing to do was to move forward and have some votes on amendments that were controversial on both sides, but we faced those votes. We got our work done, and we passed bankruptcy reform--basically, a good bill. The House also has acted in this area. 
   We need to go forward and get bankruptcy reform legislation into conference and completed so we can improve this area in the law, so the law will be clearer for all those interested, and so we can send it to the President for his signature. 
   In the process of the debate, and the amendments on this legislation, amendments were offered with regard to the minimum wage. In fact, a minimum wage increase was passed and attached to the bankruptcy reform legislation. Senator KENNEDY offered the first amendment. That was defeated. Then an alternative amendment was offered by Senator DOMENICI and others, and it did include small business tax relief to offset the impact of a minimum wage increase. That was adopted. It became a part of the bill. 
   The problem in going forward is, because of the minimum wage and tax provisions that were attached to the bill, it could be subject to, and would be subject to, the so-called blue slip rules in the House. It could be objected to, in effect, because it has the minimum wage and the revenue measures as a part of it. 
   So we had not gone forward to try to send this to the House because of the potential blue slip problem and also to wait to see if the House was going to go forward and act on minimum wage and the tax relief package. In fact, a couple weeks ago, I believe it was, they did do that. Now it is time we go to conference. 
   What I propose to do, even though I will do it in the Senate rules parlance--what it really says is split the two; send the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill to conference with the House-passed bill, have a conference,  and they act on it, and then to separate out the minimum wage and the tax provisions and send them to conference with the House on minimum wage and the tax provisions. 
   I think that is the way to do all three of the issues. It is a fair way to proceed. It is a simple way to proceed. It gets rid of the blue slip problem, and then we can count on the conference to act on both bankruptcy and the minimum wage increase and the small business tax provisions. 
   I just wanted to explain what was involved before I ask for unanimous consent. But I am prepared to do that. 
   I ask Senator DASCHLE, do you want to comment before I propound that request or would the Senator like to do it after I do the request?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may just comment one second more before I propound the UC request, with regard to Senator DASCHLE's comments, we do have a good, strong, bipartisan bankruptcy bill that we have passed. We also did have a debate and discussion on the minimum wage issue and the tax provisions. I didn't choose the debate and the amendments to occur on this bill, but I knew it was going to come up and it should come up at some point. So it was offered to the bankruptcy bill. We had a good debate. We had a vote. 
   The interesting thing about the minimum wage, I think the parameters are pretty clear. We have the Senate-passed version, the $1 increase over 3 years, and the House version, that increase over a shorter period of time, only maybe a year or so. Then in the Senate provision, we have some small business tax offsets, a relatively small package. The House has a bigger package on the tax offsets. I think the parameters of the discussion on minimum wage are all represented in the two bills that have been passed. We can get conferees from the appropriate committees, and they can look at the minimum wage increase, and over what period of time, and the small business tax offsets or other tax provisions, and have a good conference and be able to get a result. I hope we can do that without delay.

   I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that with respect to the bankruptcy bill, the Secretary of the Senate be directed to instruct the enrolling clerk to strike the Domenici amendment language just described above, all other parameters of the previous agreement be in order, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond to that, I want to make sure we have an opportunity to consider those small business men and women who create the bulk of the entry-level jobs in America, to make sure they do not wind up having to go out of business or, even worse, they don't hire the entry-level people who do deserve a basic minimum wage. 
   What I have been trying to do is to find the quickest and cleanest way, which is also not out of the ordinary, to separate these bills and go on to conference and get a result that would be the best way to help all concerned, both those who will be negatively impacted if we don't go forward with bankruptcy reform and those who are looking for a minimum wage increase, and those small business men and women who provide so many jobs in America. 
   I understand if we don't do it this way, there is the further complicating factor that the bankruptcy bill will have to basically be started over again. We will have to have a new bill filed, and it will be subject to amendment. There will be a very large amount of time and difficulty in having to do that all over again. The procedure that was suggested, I believe, is amendable and debatable. 
   We have had this debate. The question now is, Do we want to go on and go to conference based on the votes already taken in the Senate and in the House so that could get a result? That is why I asked consent to proceed in the way that I did. But we can talk about it further. I would like to, for instance, make sure I understand correctly what is being asked for with regard to the bankruptcy reform bill because I certainly hope that we would not have to completely rework that and have that subject to amendment. We spent 2 or 3 weeks on that bill. So what we are doing here, we are talking Washingtonese, in effect. We are talking about rules and procedures and how to do or not to do. I would like to find a way to move all three of these issues, actually, quickly to conference and see if we can get a result.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the exemplary service and career of an outstanding naval officer, Captain Louis V. Marchette, upon his retirement from the Navy at the conclusion of more than 24 years of commissioned service. Throughout his distinguished career, Captain Marchette has truly epitomized the Navy core values of honor, courage, and commitment. It is my privilege to commend him for a superb career of service he has provided the Navy and our great Nation. 
   Captain Marchette was born in Ogden, Utah and grew up in a Marine Corps family. After graduating from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering, he was commissioned an Ensign in the Navy in 1976. Captain Marchette began his career as a line officer but soon found his true calling and transferred to the staff corps as a Civil Engineer Corps officer. His first assignment was with the Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FORTY, homeported in Port Hueneme, California. In subsequent assignments, Captain Marchette was given some of the most challenging assignments the Navy Civil Engineer Corps had to offer. 
   As a junior officer, he served as Staff Civil Engineer, Naval Technical Training Center Corry Station, Pensacola, Florida; Assistant Public Works Officer, Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, and; Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. In recognition of his exemplary performance and construction engineering expertise, he was then assigned as Operations Officer, Naval Mobile Construction Battalion SEVENTY-FOUR, homeported in Gulfport, Mississippi. In this assignment, he directed contingency construction and military operations throughout Japan, Korea, the Caribbean, and Central America. He followed this tour with assignment as the Civil Engineer Corps Lieutenant Commander Assignment and Placement Officer, Bureau of Naval Personnel, his only tour within the ``Beltway.'' 
   At this juncture, Captain Marchette had developed a truly outstanding reputation as a naval officer and engineer and he was rewarded with a variety of leadership opportunities to include, Public Works Officer, Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; Commanding Officer, Naval Mobile Construction Battalion ONE, homeported in Gulfport, Mississippi, and; Chief Staff Officer, 20th Naval Construction Regiment, Gulfport, Mississippi. On October 30, 1997, Captain Marchette took command of Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi, assuming the dual responsibility of Commanding Officer, 20th Naval Construction Regiment, the pinnacle of a most outstanding career. 
   In this capacity, Captain Marchette has spearheaded development of a world class mobilization complex capable of mobilizing Seabees for deployment anywhere in the world within 48 hours. Selfless commitment, exceptional technical prowess, and extraordinary accomplishment have been the hallmarks of this most outstanding professional. Whether restoring order for the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the aftermath of hurricanes, responding to military contingencies throughout the world, or maneuvering through periods of severe budget constraints, he provided unparalleled leadership, innovative concepts, and overall brilliant managerial insight in accomplishment of the Navy and our Nation's objectives. Under his dynamic leadership the Naval Construction Force has experienced dramatic improvements in comprehensive readiness, training attainment, mobilization, and manpower/equipment resourcing. In short, Atlantic Fleet Seabees are now better trained and better equipped to accomplish the mission as a direct result of Captain Marchette's efforts. 
   Captain Marchette holds a Master of Science degree in engineering from the University of Florida. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Louisiana and a member of the Louisiana Society of Professional Engineers and the Society of American Military Engineers. He is a Seabee Combat Warfare Officer whose personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, five Meritorious Service medals, the Navy/Marine Corps Commendation medal, and Navy Humanitarian Service medal. 
   Captain Marchette's visionary leadership, exceptionally creative problem solving skills, and uncommon dedication have created a legacy of achievement and excellence. Having spent half his 24-year career in the great State of Mississippi, Captain Marchette and his lovely wife, Fran, are true Mississippians who have brought great honor and praise to our State. Captain Marchette will retire on July 1, 2000 after 24 years of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Captain Marchette fair winds and following seas. Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to a Mississippi native and distinguished Air Force officer, Major General William F. Moore, upon his retirement from the Air Force after more than thirty years of commissioned service. Major General Moore has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided to the Air Force and the Nation. 
   Major General Moore graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy and received his commission in 1969. Since then, Major General Moore's assignments have made untold contributions to national security. Upon graduation from the Air Force Academy, General Moore served with the Drone and Remotely Piloted Vehicles System Program Office, Aeronautical Systems Division, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. In his next assignment, General Moore served in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Development Plans, Headquarters Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. In 1976, General Moore was selected to attend and received a Master's Degree in Business Administration from the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. 
   General Moore's next assignments were as Executive Office and Project Officer with the Peacekeeper ICBM Engineering Directorate, Ballistic Missile  Office at Norton Air Force Base, California, and as Director of Program Control, Joint System Program Office for the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. In 1985 General Moore was selected for the prestigious Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Following completion of the Air War College, General Moore was the Director of Cost, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Comptroller, Headquarters Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and then the Small ICBM Deputy Program Director at Norton Air Force Base. 
   In 1989 General Moore attended the Program Manager's Course at the Defense Systems Management College, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. General Moore then returned to the Small ICBM Program as the Program Director. He then served as the Deputy Director of Strategic, Special Operation Forces and Airlift Programs, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. In 1992, General Moore was assigned as the Vice Commander of the San Antonio Air Logistics Center. In 1993 General Moore was promoted to Brigadier General. 
   In 1994, General Moore served as the Program Executive Officer for Bombers, Missiles and Trainers, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. In 1995, General Moore became the Director of Special Programs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, he was responsible for coordinating the planning, budgeting, and management of extremely sensitive Department of Defense special access classified programs. In 1997, General Moore received his second star, in 1998, was assigned as the Deputy Director for the newly formed Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). As the Deputy Director of DTRA, General Moore held and excelled in one of the most complex and challenging assignments in the Department of Defense--the creation of DTRA. DTRA was created, in the words of the Secretary of Defense: ``to fill a major void in the defense of the nation against weapons of mass destruction''. Established by a Defense Reform Initiative in November 1997, General Moore led the successful accomplishment of a vital and monumental strategic task--consolidation into one organization the bulk of DoD's arms control, cooperative threat reduction, and technology security regimes, as well as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) related research development test and evaluation (RDT&E) programs. DTRA also coordinates and prioritizes Chemical/Biological programs for the Joint Staff, and provides an integrated national architecture for response to WMD threats to civil and military populations; and is a full partner with the Departments of Energy, Justice and State to provide national deterrence for WMD. 
   General Moore is a fully certified acquisition professional whose awards include two Defense Distinguished Service Medals, the legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the National Defense Service Medal with service star, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal. 
   During his long and distinguished career, General Moore served the nation with excellence and distinction. He is a visionary leader, and a true warrior who has had a profound impact on the United States Air Force, and made significant contributions to the strategic defense of the United States and its allies. 
   General Moore will retire from the Air Force on May 1, 2000, after more than thirty years of exceptionally distinguished service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I would like to recognize General Moore's accomplishments and his service. Congratulations on the completion of a long and distinguished career.

   Mr. LOTT. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business throughout the day, and tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of H.R. 5, the Social Security earnings test legislation. Under a previous agreement, there will be approximately 4 hours of debate with three amendments in order to the bill. I expect votes will occur during Tuesday's session of the Senate on one or two of the amendments to the bill. However, I expect final passage will not occur until Wednesday morning at approximately 10 o'clock. I will need to consult further with the Democratic leadership as to the exact time for that vote. 
   During the remainder of the week, the Senate will also consider any of the following items: Crop insurance legislation that was reported out of the Agriculture Committee a couple of weeks ago, plus any nominations from the Executive Calendar that might be cleared. Therefore, votes should be expected throughout the remainder of the week, certainly Wednesday and Thursday. Also, Senators should be on notice that we expect to begin the budget resolution next week, the week of March 27, and Senators may expect votes likely will occur on Friday, March 31. 
   We had indicated earlier in the year that if we saw a Friday where there would very likely be some votes, we would let Senators know as soon as we could, in order to comply with the budget resolution rules, which is up to 50 hours of debate and amendments in order. Senators will recall that sometimes we have a number of amendments at the end of the process, so it could take us into Thursday night or over into that Friday, March 31. Of course, if there is a change in that, we will let Senators know, but we need to conclude that budget resolution as soon as possible so the Appropriations Committee can go forward with its bills.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes of my leader's time to talk about the Social Security earnings limitation. 
   I am very proud that the Senate is going to be taking up that issue this week and that we have a unanimous consent agreement which will limit us to only two or three amendments. One of those amendments is a technical correction, and then we have one by Senator KERREY of Nebraska and one by Senator GREGG of New Hampshire. 
   We have talked for years about the unfairness of Social Security recipients losing Social Security money if they need to continue working or want to continue working. At a time when we have a need for seniors who are 65, 66, 67 years old to meet the demands of our increased job availability market in America, it is the logical thing to do. Unfortunately, for many years we talked about it and did not do anything. 
   The House of Representatives deserves credit for taking the lead on this issue, and now we find it is developing bipartisan 
   support of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and an indication that the President will sign it. It is long overdue, and I think it is an important issue. I hope a number of Senators will comment on it today and that we will have debate on the two amendments tomorrow and conclude this no later than Wednesday morning. 
   So I am pleased we are able to proceed in this way, and I look forward to  completing action on this important legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what we do today with a vote on these nominations is important. It does matter. I am sure both of these two individuals, Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, are fine people and are well intentioned in the positions they take, but we are going to vote on them being confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for life. That is serious. 
   Yes, the President has a right to make nominations to the Federal bench of his choice. However, we have a role in that process. We should, and we do, take it very seriously. We should not give a man or a woman life tenure if there is some problem with his or her background, whether academically or ethically, or if there is a problem with a series of decisions or positions they have taken. 
   I certainly don't take this lightly. I would have preferred if these individuals had never been nominated, never been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, and that the situation would not have arisen in which there is this vote on the floor. But after a lot of consultation back and forth with my colleagues, a reasonable case could be made they should at least have a vote on their confirmation one way or the other. 
   As majority leader, I must make decisions as to the time and manner in which matters are considered. Sometimes my colleagues think it is the right way and the right time; sometimes that is not the case. Once I make a commitment for a vote, I am going to keep that commitment the best I can, keep my word, and go forward. 
   I have colleagues on my side of the aisle who don't like going forward with this vote. At this time, I think it is appropriate that we have a vote. I urge my colleagues to vote against these two nominees. However, it is time we have the vote, and we will do so today. 
   Let me discuss why I feel so strongly that these two nominees should not be confirmed. First, it is about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is clearly a circuit court of appeals that is out of sync with the mainstream and has been repeatedly reversed by the Supreme Court. 
   In recent days, I have seen references to the Ninth Circuit as containing ``California, Arizona, and a handful of other states.'' My state is in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but I would take umbrage if my circuit was referred to as ``the circuit that has Texas and other States.'' But there are only three States in our circuit, the Fifth Circuit. 
   The Ninth Circuit clearly has a problem. It is too large, it is too unwieldy, and it is not functioning effectively. It is not serving the people of the circuit well, and we must remember that it is not just the ``circuit of California, Arizona, and other States.'' How would someone like to be in the circuit that is referred to that way if one lives in Utah, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Guam, and Hawaii? 
   We need to do something about this. We have known we needed to do something about it for years, but we haven't done it. Millions of people who live in the States of the Ninth Circuit must submit their disputes to a court that has consistently flouted the statutes and the Constitution of the United States. 
   It covers 50 million people. Nearly 40 percent of the area of this country is in this one circuit. In the past 6 years, the Ninth Circuit has been reversed by the Supreme Court in 85 out of 99 cases considered, roughly a 90-percent reversal rate. In most classes, that would be rated as an abysmal failure. There is something not right here. 
   It was bad before the President Clinton appointees were added, and it has gotten worse. In the 1996-1997 term, the Ninth Circuit was reversed 27 out of 28 times, including 17 unanimous reversals. There is something wrong with this circuit. 
   Let me give some specific examples of the kind of decisions they are entering: 
   In Washington v. Glucksberg, the Ninth Circuit found a constitutional right to die, a decision reversed unanimously by the Supreme Court; 
   In Calderon v. Thompson, 1997, the Ninth Circuit blocked an execution based on a procedural device the Supreme Court called a ``grave abuse of discretion''; 
   In Mazurek v. Armstrong, 1996, the Ninth Circuit enjoined a Montana law allowing only doctors to perform abortions, only to be reversed once again by the Supreme Court. 
   I have a long list of decisions from the Ninth Circuit, and I ask unanimous consent I be able to have these lists and other material printed at the conclusion of my remarks.

   Mr. LOTT. There is a problem with this circuit. It is a circuit that has serious problems with its rulings. It is an extremely liberal circuit, and it will get worse with these two nominees. That is one of the reasons I have been hesitant to bring up the nominees. 
   Now, let me go to the next point. I hope it won't happen, but I suspect there is going to be somebody in this Chamber, or certainly in the media, who will suggest that the consideration of these nominees has something to do with their race or gender. 
   These charges are totally false. We don't have a place where we check race or gender when we consider these nominees. It is irrelevant. We had a nominee last year who was defeated in the Senate that turned out to be African American. I am confident at least half the Senators didn't even know that. We didn't talk about that. 
   In this case, the fact that Judge Paez is Hispanic is not a consideration at all. We need more minorities and women on the courts. Let me make this point so everybody will be aware of it now: Last year, 18 of the 34 judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate, or 53 percent, were women or minorities. By contrast, only 51 percent of President Clinton's nominees were women or minorities. However, I am not going to charge him with some sort of discrimination based on race or gender. 
   I will have printed for the RECORD a list of some of the statistics showing this Senate is more than willing and desirous of confirming women and minorities of all backgrounds to the courts. Over the past several years, we have confirmed a high percentage from minority groups or women, including a unanimous or near-unanimous confirmation of an Hispanic nominee to  the Third Circuit Court of Appeals earlier his week. 
   While some have expressed concern at the delay in bringing up the nominations we are considering today, it is important to keep in mind that each of these nominees was opposed by almost half of the Members of the Judiciary Committee. This is the committee charged with reviewing the background and qualifications of nominees. Any time so many Members of the Judiciary Committee express this level of concern, this body should proceed with caution. 
   The charges that race has somehow played a part in the Senate's consideration of these or other nominees is more than false. It demeans the Senate and those making the charges. If the charges are made in a cynical attempt to gain some political advantage, that is even worse. No real or perceived political advantage is worth debasing your own integrity by falsely impugning that of others. 
   Let me go to the specifics of Judge Paez. Some say: How long must he wait? What will happen? He is on the Federal district court now, so it is not as if he is waiting for employment. 
   He has a long record and philosophy that is very liberal. That is not disqualifying anymore than we should disqualify somebody because they are conservative. He has a record also of highly questionable rulings and political statements while sitting on the bench. When he was being considered as a judge, for instance, he was quoted as saying:  
   The courts must tackle political questions that ``perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process''.  
   That is the point. He believes the courts should be willing to do what is our job, not theirs. That is a fundamental problem. 
   When he was being nominated to the Federal district bench, no less an arbiter of liberalism than the American Civil Liberties Union considered him a ``welcome change after all the pro law enforcement people we have seen appointed.'' 
   I think the American people want pro law enforcement people appointed to the bench regardless of their background or any other consideration. 
   There have been some astounding cases: Judge Paez struck down a Los Angeles antipanhandling ordinance enacted after a panhandler killed a young man over a quarter; he ruled companies doing business overseas can be held liable for human rights abuses committed by foreign governments. 
   Excuse me? How in the world could he extrapolate anything in the laws of this country or the Constitution that would allow him to make such a decision? 
   Now we have the situation with John Huang. I do not know what happened there, but it seems to me there is a conflict of interest. The American people need to understand. He somehow or other was selected to be the judge in the John Huang case, and he agreed to a very light plea-bargained sentence at a time, I believe, when his confirmation was still pending, involving a matter where the President of the United States was clearly implicated. There is something not right about that. It does not pass the smell test. 
   Am I willing now to charge some illegality, or some totally unethical act? No. But we should have done more on this, on that point, before we came to this vote. 
   Last, but not least, when you are on the bench--I have kidded my friends who are Federal judges about how they ascend to someplace in the sky, never to be heard from again: Retirement to the Federal bench. They laugh. I laugh. But in a way, that is the way it is and that is as it should be. Because when you go on the bench, your political involvement, your personal preferences, should remain private. You should assume the bench and keep your mouth shut until you rule appropriately. 
   When you have a judge speak out, as Judge Paez did in 1995, for example, and attack two California ballot initiatives while they were still in litigation or potentially the subject of litigation, that is a big problem. The Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits judges, as it should, from comments that ``cast reasonable doubt on his capacity to decide impartially, any issue that may come before him,'' that is a fundamental point. 
   You cannot, as a Federal judge, make political statements on initiatives on the ballot that bring into question your impartiality in these cases in any way. It is highly inappropriate. 
   With regard to the nomination of Ms. Berzon, she does not have a record of judicial decisions, having served as a prominent labor lawyer for many years. Clearly, however, her positions are very questionable in terms of how she would rule when she got on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it would be a mistake. 
   I am particulary troubled by some of the extreme pro-labor positions she has advocated--positions that have been summarily rejected by the Supreme Court. 
   Some of the questionable positions she has advocated include arguing that new employees, or more junior employees that worked during a strike, must be layed off in favor of more senior employees when the strike is over. She also argued unsuccessfully that unions should be able to prevent members from resigning during a strike. 
   Finally, her statements on the use of union funds for political activities--or other activities not directly related to union negotiations and bargaining--raise serious questions about her willingness to live within the letter and spirit of the Beck decision. 
   It is no wonder that the proponents of these nominations ignore the record of the Ninth Circuit and the judicial approach of these nominees. We are told instead of their strong qualifications and personal attributes. I have no doubt that Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon are fine lawyers and are technically competent. My concern is with their judicial philosophies and their likely activism on the court. 
   Let me go back to my beginning point. This is very serious. We are going to be voting on putting these two individuals on the Ninth Circuit for life. I think the record is clear that they would be activists on the bench. 
   Judicial activism is a fundamental challenge to our system of government, and it represents a danger that requires constant vigilance. In our tradition and under our laws, we give power not to a specific group of trained experts, but rest our faith in the ability of all Americans, whatever their backgrounds, to participate in their government. Judicial activism robs the people of their role, and undermines the basis of our democracy. 
   Nowhere is this problem of judicial activism greater than in the Ninth Circuit. And nowhere is it more incumbent upon us as Senators to take seriously our responsibility to restore a proper respect for our system of representative government. 
   I believe these nominees should not be confirmed. Number 1, because there is a problem with this circuit; No. 2, because, in the case of Judge Paez, of the rulings he has been involved in, many of them of a highly questionable nature; No. 3, in his case, for remarks he has made in the political arena while sitting as a judge on issues that could come before him. 
   While her public record is not as extensive, the same questions exist for Ms. Berzon, particulary when you look at her positions with regard to the type of issues that may well be coming before the Ninth Circuit, and eventually, before the Supreme Court. There is great doubt about the basis for her confirmation. 
   While I have kept my word and we will vote on these judges today, I will vote against them both.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Massachusetts for raising this issue here today. And he is absolutely right. Aviation is not the only transportation account that may be impacted by this bill. And it was certainly not the intention of the conferees to in any way restrict funding for the Coast Guard or Amtrak. 
   The conference report includes a provision which reserves Airport and Airways Trust Fund revenue and interest spending for aviation programs with a majority point of order. Additionally, under another majority point of order, the provision requires the authorized levels of funding for the Airport Improvement Program and the Facilities and Equipment accounts to be fully funded before the Operations and Research and Development accounts are funded. While this latter provision is  not a statutory guarantee that general revenue will be spend on aviation programs, it is a significant incentive. The bill thus provides a reasonable assurance that aviation appropriations will reach authorized levels, which would result in an approximately $2 billion increase in aviation funding for fiscal year 2001. 
   My good friend from Massachusetts is concerned that spending for other transportation priorities may be decreased as the appropriations process increases aviation spending. Let me assure my good friend that I expect adequate funding for the Coast Guard and Amtrak, as these transportation priorities are important to the Nation and to my home State of Mississippi. I intend to work with the chairmen of the Budget and Appropriations Committees to ensure the Transportation Appropriations account is increased so that these aviation program increases do not come at the expense of other transportation programs.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to address the needs of the Coast Guard. In a typical day the Coast Guard will save 14 lives, seize 209 pounds of marijuana and 170 pounds of cocaine, and save $2.5 million in property. The Coast Guard's duties have also grown, as there are more commercial and recreational vessels in our waters today than ever before in our Nation's history. International trade has expanded greatly, and with it maritime traffic has increased in our Nation's ports and harbors. Tighter border patrols have forced drug traffickers to use the thousands of miles of our country's coastlines as the means to introduce illegal drugs into our Nation. The Coast Guard currently faces a number of readiness shortfalls as it struggles to keep up with the increasing demands placed upon this service. In order to continue this valuable service to our Nation, the Congress must provide the funding to address personnel shortages and to repair or replace the Coast Guard's aging ships and aircraft. I am confident that with an increase in the transportation budget, we can protect the Coast Guard and Amtrak, as well as make the improvements air travel so desperately needs.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of today's passage of H.R. 1000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. Today is a great day for rural America's air passengers. This legislation will bring much needed air service to under served communities throughout the Nation. It will also grant billions of dollars in federal funds to our Nation's airports for upgrades, through the Airport Improvements Program (AIP). 
   Senator SLADE GORTON, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Subcommittee on Aviation, is to be commended for his superb leadership on this complex and contentious measure. My friend and colleague from the State of Washington proved himself pivotal earlier during floor consideration of the Senate bill and during the conference with the other body on this bill. Together with Chairman DOMENICI, Chairman STEVENS, and Senator HOLLINGS, their joint efforts moved this bill to today's passage. 
   Rural Americans are the biggest winners with the passage of H.R. 1000. Citizens of small and under served communities can look forward to the day when they no longer have to travel hundreds of miles and several hours to board a plane. This legislation provides incentives to domestic air carriers and their affiliates to reach out to these people and serve them conveniently near their homes. Many Americans will be able to travel a reasonable distance to gain access to our Nation's skies and, from there, anywhere they wish to go. 
   Mr. President, I also applaud the hard work of Senator FRIST of Tennessee, Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan, and Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri, all members of the Senate Commerce Committee. Their dedication to the flying public helped move the FAA conference when agreements on contentious aviation issues were not met. They understand the delays, inconvenience, and headache their constituents must endure when flying--they get it. I firmly believe that without the engagement of these three gentlemen the Senate would not be voting on H.R. 1000  today. The people of Tennessee, Michigan, and Missouri should be extremely proud of their representation in Washington. 
   The major policy changes in H.R. 1000 led to hard fought, but honest disagreements. I have enormous respect for the efforts of Chairmen DOMENICI, STEVENS, and SHUSTER, as well as House Ranking Member OBERSTAR, as they diligently advocated for their committees' jurisdictions. One thing was abundantly clear during the FAA conference--my colleagues recognized our Nation's aviation needs and made significant commitments to increase aviation funding. This honest debate and willingness to work together to achieve common goals is what makes it exciting to serve in Washington. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely proud of my colleagues. Since 1995, the Republican majority has made infrastructure a top legislative priority. Two years ago, my friends in the House and Senate successfully led an effort to boost the amount of federal funding for highway construction and improvements. History will reflect that this Congress also deeply cared about our Nation's infrastructure. One of the main components of H.R. 1000 directs the expense of all Airports and Airways Trust Fund revenue and interest on aviation needs. Trust Fund revenue and interest means that America's airports will get the improvements they desperately need to take our aviation infrastructure into the 21st Century. 
   Mr. President, no legislative initiation is ever possible without the dedicated efforts of staff, and I want to take a moment to identify those who worked hard to get FAA legislation through conference and to the Senate for approval. 
   From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation: Marti Allbright; Lloyd Ator; Mark Buse; Ann Choiniere; Julia Kraus; Michael Reynolds; Scott Verstandig; and Sam Whitehorn. 
   From the Senate Committee on the Budget: Beth Felder; Bill Hoagland; Mary Naylor; Barry Strumpf; and Cheryle Tucker. 
   From the Senate Committee on Appropriations: Wally Burnett; Paul Doerrer; Peter Rogoff; and Mitch Warren. 
   The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senators: Chrystn Alston; Kerry Ates; Rich Bender; David Broome; Bob Carey; Steve Browning; Jeanne Bumpus; John Conrad; Margaret Cummisky; Brett Hale; Keith Hennessey; Ann Loomis; Randal Popelka; Mitch Rose; Lisa Rosenberg; Greg Rothchild; Jim Sartucci; Lori Sharpe; Brad Van Dam; and Andy Vermilye. 
   Mr. President, these individuals worked very hard on H.R. 1000, and the Senate owes them a debt of gratitude for their dedicated service to this country. 
   Mr. President, our Nation's small communities are a step closer to receiving long-sought air service. Also, America's airports will be enhanced. This is good for all Americans.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request and closing script. 
   As you know, cloture was just invoked on two Ninth Circuit judges. I still hope we have not set a precedent. I don't believe we have because it was such an overwhelming vote to invoke cloture and stop the filibuster. We should not be having filibusters on judicial nominations and having to move to cloture. But we had to, and it was an overwhelming vote of 86-13 on the first one, and I guess that was the vote on the second one, too. I intend to offer a time agreement between the proponents and opponents regarding postcloture debate. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator SMITH of New Hampshire be in control of up to 3 hours of total debate on both nominations, and that Senator LEAHY, or his designee, be in control of up to 1 hour 30 minutes of total debate on both nominations; that following the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate lay the nominations aside until 2 p.m., at which time the Senate would proceed to back-to-back votes on or in relation to the confirmations of Berzon and Paez. That would be at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

I don't know the precedents in terms of that actually having been used. I am certainly not advocating it. But under the rules of the Senate, I am under the impression that it would be in order. I thought maybe I could answer it succinctly without getting into the precedents. 
   Mr. President, has the request been----

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished Democratic whip, this is for conferees on this Millennium Digital Commerce Act. We have tried, over the past couple of weeks, to get clearance to appoint conferees. 
   The recommendation was that we have, I believe, 11 from the Commerce Committee, 3 from Banking--6 and 5 and 2 and 1. For some reason, there have been objections to that. There continue to be objections, but this is a bill that has broad support in the industry and on both sides of the aisle. So I am confused and perplexed about why we can't get these conferees appointed and move forward to this conference. So it has not been signed off on, as I understand it. But since I talked to the Democratic leader last week twice, I thought perhaps we had reached a point where this could be done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be heard on this issue at this time. 
   I don't understand, again, what the objection is to this procedural motion. The House appointed conferees to this bill 2 weeks ago, and they have been calling over saying, ``What is the deal?'' I understand that perhaps there are other Senators who would like to be conferees from other committees. There is some indication that maybe the problem is they don't like the fact there are some Banking conferees. The House bill has several provisions that are clearly in the Banking jurisdiction, and that is why we have recommended having three from Banking--two and one--so we can get this into conference and get it worked out. 
   There are a lot of us who realize there are Silicon Valley interests in this. We also have the Dulles corridor high-tech industry in Northern Virginia that really wants this legislation completed. I don't think it would be a long conference. So I want to highlight the fact that we are anxious to get to conference. 
   I have addressed concerns as best I could. I don't think we can take Banking members off the conference. Maybe there is another way to solve this problem. But since I was getting questions both from the high-tech industry and from the House as to why we weren't going on to conference, I had to point out or emphasize what the problem was. 
   I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Michigan, the author of this legislation. He probably knows more about it than any other Senator.

   Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield on that point, I also note at this time that I think the House only has perhaps five conferees. I don't believe I have ever been to a conference where the House has one-third as many conferees as the Senate. So we have already tried to include as many Senators as we possibly could.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I apologize to Senator DASCHLE for what led him to make his comments. 
   First of all, the Senator will recall that last week we discussed on a couple of occasions how we could work through getting the conferees' names agreed to and through the body. 
   This morning--I don't remember the exact hour--we decided to have a colloquy on this issue. I assumed he had been notified and that all of you were aware we were going to try to get the conferees appointed and have a colloquy. I first realized it had not been done when I saw the expression on one of our staff members' face when I stood up and made the unanimous consent request. I assumed he had been notified, as he is when we do this sort of thing. I don't shift the blame to staff; I accept the responsibility. I apologize to Senator DASCHLE because he should have been notified. I assure him we have done a lot of things already this year together and I always notify him. We should have done that.  
   Nevertheless, it doesn't diminish the need to get an agreement on conferees. I will be glad to work with him to get this done because this is a bill that really is important to a large segment of our society. 
   My own son is also harassing me about how he wants to do e-commerce. He is concerned about what he can do. He is doing business in Kentucky. We are not only hearing from House Democrats and Republicans, asking, Where are your conferees? This is also something my son is harassing me about. 
   We have to get this worked out some way and real quick. 
   I think the Senator is entitled to an apology because of the way this was handled. I would expect him to be notified.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note the House bill includes an entire title pertaining to the use of electronic signatures in securities transactions. That language falls under the jurisdiction of the House Commerce Committee, but in the Senate, the jurisdiction is in the Banking Committee. Clearly, there is Banking Committee jurisdiction in this legislation in the House bill. 
   Also, let me get specific about what and whom we are talking about. We are talking about three very thoughtful Members of the Senate who have a real interest in these electronic signatures and securities transactions. They are: Senator GRAMM, the chairman of the Banking Committee from Texas; Senator BENNETT from Utah, who had been very much involved in our efforts to pass the Y2K legislation last year and in a number of areas, including cyberterrorism--he is very knowledgeable in this whole area--and Senator SARBANES, the ranking member on the Banking Committee. 
   These are not three Senators who would be anything but instructive in sharing information in an area in which they have a greater knowledge than the Members of the Commerce Committee.

We ought to be able to find a way to get the conferees appointed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand there have been a couple of hours of spirited debate on the nominations of Judge Paez and Mrs. Berzon, which is certainly the right of the Senate. I am sure we will have some further spirited discussion about these nominees. 
   However, I have given my word that these two nominees should at least have the opportunity for a vote. We did work out an agreement last year, and I made a commitment that these two nominees would have a Senate vote on their confirmation. With that in mind, in order to accomplish this--while I had hoped it would not be necessary, again, I emphasize, as I did last year and earlier this year, I think it is a mistake to begin to have cloture votes on judicial nominations on the floor. We had one instance of that last year, and I said to my Democratic friends I thought that was a mistake, and pretty shortly thereafter we worked that out and moved that nomination. 
   I don't like to have to file cloture on these nominations either, but in order to fulfill the commitments that have been made and have a good debate but some limit on it where we would get a vote, I send a cloture motion to the desk on the nomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

I will not propound that request at this time but will put Members on notice that this is the fashion in which I see the Senate considering these nominations. 
   I have discussed that with Senator DASCHLE, and he understands that. Of course, there will be a need to have equal debate on both sides, if that is required by Senators. 
   I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. I look forward to further debate on these nominees during tomorrow's session prior to the 5 p.m. back-to-back cloture votes. In light of this agreement, we can announce that there will be no further votes this evening.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today we observe and celebrate a milestone in the life of one of our most respected colleagues. On Saturday, March 4, Senator ROBERT C. BYRD became the third longest-serving Senator in the history of this august body--surpassing the service of the venerable and beloved John Stennis of my State, who served 41 years and 2 months. 
   This November, Senator BYRD will surpass the service of Senator Carl Hayden which will mean that we will be novices working alongside two of the longest-serving Senators in history. Both of them are here with us now--STROM THURMOND and ROBERT BYRD. Just think about that. They will be the top two in history in tenure, and we will be serving with both of them. 
   It is more than about tenure, however, when you talk about STROM THURMOND or ROBERT C. BYRD. In the case of Senator BYRD, in his 41-plus years, colleagues have placed their trust in him to hold the highest offices in this institution. He was among those who were elected to the leadership positions but also at the committee level. He has been both the majority leader and the minority leader; he has been President pro tempore; and he has chaired our Committee on Appropriations. Today he is the ranking Democrat on that very important committee. 
   What he has brought to those positions has been more than hard work and high skills. He has brought a passion for procedures, an insistence upon order. On occasion, he has reminded me  what the rules are or what order requires. It is always intended to be helpful because he believes that the institution itself is more important than any one Senator. 
   On occasion, he has regaled the Senate with a discourse on antiquity and, more specifically, the history of Greece and Rome and, of course, the Roman Senate. Yet when Senator BYRD speaks, Senators actually come out of the Cloakroom and our offices and listen, enthralled, to the history that he knows and the quotes that he gives from memory. He has inspired us many times both in the antiquity that he talks about and also the very great personal stories that he tells and the quotations. I remember he had a quote when I had a grandson born a year and a half ago about the beauty of being a grandparent, and it was just one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard on the floor of the Senate, maybe not so much as to who had said it, or how he was saying it, but who he was saying it about. He did a beautiful job. 
   He speaks of great historic events and he quotes from the Bible. And yet he has spoken personally, humanly, about the wonders of life, and even to being the owner of a wonderful dog named Billy, in such a way that has brought tears to our eyes. Having seen ``My Dog, Skip'' just this past weekend, I know sometimes the beauty of an animal or dog in your family will bring tears quicker than anything perhaps. 
   In today's world, where anything older than a decade is considered ancient, his knowledge of the classical world is truly extraordinary, and his insistence that its somber lessons are relevant to our own times is truly sobering. 
   In seasons of turmoil, it is the Senate's role to give the Nation the reassurance of stability and endurance. That is what the framers of our Constitution intended when they devised an upper Chamber that would be a steady anchor against the wild winds of public passion and hasty action. 
   Senator BYRD's magnificent addresses on the history of the Senate chronicle the work of Senators--whether renowned or obscure--who have toiled in this body for causes larger than their own advancement, both here in this room and in the old Chamber where the Senate did its work until 1859. 
   Senator BYRD's personal heroes, such as Richard Russell of Georgia, have pursued duty rather than passing glory, and in the process won for themselves a lasting remembrance in the annals of representative democracy. 
   Because of my own southern background and because of Senator BYRD's comments over the years, things he has noted about Senator Russell, I have gone back and read some of the history of this great Senator. It was interesting to me to note that others indicated he surely could have been the majority leader. Clearly, he could have assumed any role he wanted in the Senate. But he chose not to do that. He chose instead to be chairman of the Armed Services Committee, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to be involved in everything that happened in the Senate. He was truly a unique Senator in many ways. 
   Today, we celebrate and stand in respectful witness to the history that ROBERT BYRD is making as the Senator from West Virginia who, for 41 years and 2 months, has pursued duty rather than passing glory for causes larger than his own advancement. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I noted late Thursday night that I was very much impressed and pleased with the way that legislation went through the Senate and that we were able to get to conclusion. I made a particular note of the fine work the Senator from Nevada did, helping keep Members focused on the issue at hand, the issue before us, and also reducing the number of amendments and helping make it possible for us to complete that bill on Thursday night. 
   I have to say the Senator, since he has been elected as the whip, assistant Democratic leader, has made a difference in our ability to complete important legislation. I think that was an example of how we can proceed. That was a good bill that had bipartisan support. I know a lot in the minority did not like it but several in the minority did vote for it because it wound up getting 61 votes, which means even if it got every Republican--and I didn't check to see if every one voted for it, but probably at least a half dozen Democrats also voted for it. 
   It is a good example of how we can proceed. Amendments were agreed to that were related to education, related to tax policy on education, and a couple of amendments such as the Wellstone amendment were not directly related, but Senators had something they wanted to offer. We were given an opportunity to take a look at the Wellstone amendment and basically said, sure, we can agree to that. But it did not become just flypaper to attach every amendment Senators could come up with. We did not get off into a lot of extraneous debate. Most of the week was spent focused on education and education tax policy, and that is the way we would like it to proceed. 
   It seemed to me the week before last that we were not going to be able to proceed, and we were going to have to go to cloture, which I always prefer not to do. I prefer to go forward without long debate and delay by amendments. But if I am given the impression, or told, in effect, we are going to offer all kinds of extraneous amendments, I have to look for some way to bring it to conclusion and get a final vote. That is why I filed cloture the end of the week, the previous week. 
   Then, on Monday morning, Senator DASCHLE called and said he thought that basically the parameters of the unanimous consent request we had offered were fair, but there were some Senators who still thought they had other issues they would like addressed. But he thought maybe we could work on it that morning--I believe it was Monday morning; it may have been Tuesday morning--but we could work through it and get a fair agreement. As a matter of fact, by noon that day we had done so. 
   So I hope this will be the procedure we can use in the future. We may have the opportunity to see if we can do that even this very week because I have been urging and pushing Senators to come to an agreement on how to proceed on the Export Administration Act. This is something we need to do. This is something people who are in the export business want to get clarified. We have not had an export law on the books since the one that was passed in 1979. My goodness, in this area of export of technology, for instance, it changes weekly, let alone annually. We clearly need to do this. I think the concept of this bill is something the administration generally supports. It came out of committee unanimously.  
   There are some legitimate concerns from members of the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Government Affairs Committee, and the Intelligence Committee about how do we deal with national security issues; how can we carve out national security issues; how can we make sure it is not a unilateral decision made by the Commerce Department; and how are the State Department and Defense Department going to be involved. 
   But a lot of work is being done on that. I am hoping we can go forward on that bill Tuesday or Wednesday of this week and find a way to complete it. But we will not be able to do it unless we find cooperation on both sides of the aisle, and I hope maybe the education bill can be an example we can follow. It may even be easier in this case because I think there is actually broader bipartisan support. 
   So I appreciate what Senator REID had to say. I agree with it. I hope that is the example we can use as we go forward this year. We have a lot of work. In spite of distractions, in spite of elections, we still have work to do for the American people. It is important we find a way to do that for the best interests of our country. 
   I thank Senator REID for his contribution in that effort.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Under my reservation, let me emphasize this, if I could. I believe after that we will be prepared to start voting. I know Senator REID has been working aggressively to try to reduce the number of amendments. I know the same is true with Senator COVERDELL. But as I now understand it, we still have eight amendments that could require votes. Hopefully, that can be reduced with some voice votes. Then there is final passage. So we could have as many as nine votes. 
   I emphasize to Senators, and to their staffs who are here or who are listening, we have already gotten an agreement that the first vote will be 15 minutes, and then there will be 2 minutes, a minute on each side, before each vote after that so people will have time to know what is in the amendments, and those will each be 10-minute votes. I am going to stay on the floor to enforce the time. We will end the first vote after 15 minutes, and we will end each vote after that after 10 minutes. 
   So staffs should notify Members to start coming to the floor and to be prepared to stay on the floor; don't go get something to eat. We can save as much as an hour of time if Members will cooperate. So I am going to enforce the voting time. I think Senator DASCHLE will support that and the 
   sponsors, too. 
   With that, I do not object.

   Mr. LOTT. Briefly, for the information of all Senators with regard to the schedule for the balance of the week and the first of next week, in just a moment we will have the final 2 minutes, equally divided, to make comments before final passage. That will be it for the night and for the week. I commend Senator REID, Senator COVERDELL, and others for the good work they have done in getting us to this point. 
   Because we have been able to finish all the amendments and go to final passage, we will not be in session tomorrow. We will be in session on Monday and Tuesday, but the next recorded vote will not occur until approximately 5 o'clock Tuesday afternoon because of the 13 primaries that are occurring across the country between the two parties. We will be in session Tuesday. We will be in session on Wednesday and Thursday with votes likely into the night, and we may have votes on Friday. So do not be scheduling departure on Thursday night. We have to finish a couple of very important issues next week and have some votes on the Executive Calendar. 
   I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that I have had some discussions this morning with Senator DASCHLE and I think we are making some progress on getting an agreement as to how we can proceed on the education savings account legislation. In our discussions this morning, we talked about the possibility of going forward with an agreement that education amendments and education tax-related amendments would be in order, plus one amendment by Senator WELLSTONE. I thought that was an excellent way to proceed. 
   I am about to enter that as a unanimous consent request. I understand there still may be need to have some further discussions, but I hope we can get this worked out. If we do, it will mean we can vitiate the cloture vote that is scheduled for tomorrow, now at 2:30. 
   So I renew my request of last Thursday and ask consent that all amendments be relevant to the subject matter of education or related to education taxes, with the exception of the Wellstone amendment regarding a report on a TANF program, and that time with respect to that amendment be limited to 2 hours equally divided and it be subject to relevant second-degree amendments.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then I hope we can come to an agreement on the bill. This is important education legislation that does have bipartisan support. I believe we are close to getting an agreement. I appreciate what Senator REID has been doing to try to bring about an agreement, including the amendment by Senator WELLSTONE that has basically already been agreed to. 
   However, if an agreement cannot be reached on the subject matter on which Members may offer amendments, then Senators are reminded there will be a cloture vote to occur tomorrow. 
   With that in mind, I now ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be scheduled for 3:30 instead of 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, if it is necessary to have that vote.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I realize we have at least one more Senator on the floor who wishes to speak, but I want to take a moment to speak on this legislation. This is legislation about which I feel very strongly. I believe the American people support it. 
   It is a bill we debated a couple of years ago. It did pass the House and Senate, but it was vetoed by the President. At that time, I had some discussions with the White House that indicated they understood this had a lot of appeal and, while it is opposed by some people--specifically, I guess, teachers' unions--that it has overwhelming appeal. And it does. 
   Let me explain to those who may be listening basically what this legislation will do. It is not just about tax relief, although tax relief is very important for parents who want to help their children. It also is very much about education, quality education. Under this legislation, parents would be able to save up to $2,000 a year per child for their educational needs, K-12. That is the gist of it. I cannot understand some of the comments I have heard about how this is bad educational policy, that it was bad education policy 2 years ago, and it is still bad educational policy. Excuse me. What is bad about this? To allow people to save for their own children's educational needs? 
   We are not talking about a massive amount of money. We are talking about a bill, also, that has offsets to pay for it. But you are talking about up to $2,000 a year, with the interest of course receiving special tax consideration, where that money can be used for children's educational needs at the fourth grade, if they need some remedial reading attention, or at the eighth grade, if they need a computer, or maybe it is even just 
   clothes, I guess. Whatever the educational needs of your children would be--and I am not sure it would be applicable to clothes but supplies, tutors--I can think of a lot of things that could be done for our children at a critical age. 
   We talk now about the need to have early intervention, that a lot of children by the time they start the first grade or kindergarten, they are already 2 years behind the curve. So we are looking now at what can we do for early intervention to help our children be ready to begin school. 
   We are also continuing to look at statistics that are not very encouraging when it comes to reading and arithmetic and basic education at the  elementary and secondary level: Fourth grade, eighth grade, tenth grade. What really is amazing to me is we do allow for tax considerations for parents to save for their children's educational needs in college. So it is OK for college, but it is not all right for elementary and secondary. Yet for higher education in America, there are scholarship programs, there are loan programs, there are grant programs, and there are supplemental grant programs. For any student in America who wants to get a college education, whether it is a community college or whether it is a special training program or higher education, there is financial assistance available but not for elementary and secondary. I do not understand that. A lot of the needs are at that level. 
   So we are saying yes to higher education but no to K-12. If we do not help our children, our own children, along the way when they have extra needs, then they are not going to be ready for college or, when they graduate from high school, they are not going to be ready to be trained. 
   I meet with corporate executives, people from the high-tech industries, and they say: We are really worried; the children now coming out of high school are not even ready to learn. They cannot be trained to work in Silicon Valley because they do not have the basics. 
   I am not saying this one bill will totally solve that, but I am saying it is one more option, it is one more part of improving education in America. So I think it is good educational policy. I think it is good for our parents. I think it also provides tax relief. 
   Some people will say that a lot of workers cannot save for their own children. Maybe that is true, although I think it would be a real incentive for people, even at a low income level, to be able to put aside just a little bit. It does not have to be $2,000; maybe it is only a couple of hundred. But it would be their money which they could use to help their children. Should not we provide that incentive? 
   By the way, what about middle-income parents? There are a lot of programs that will help low-income children. Of course, children of parents who have plenty of income, they do not need our assistance. But what about the family where the father works in a shipyard and makes $37,000 a year? Should he not be able to do a little something for his own children? 
   I urge my colleagues, as I know Members on both sides of the aisle already recognize this is important legislation, take a look at it. Tell me you can go back and tell your constituents you are against parents of children K-12 being able to save a little to help their children at that level. I do not believe you can do that. 
   This is not a costly bill. This is a bill that has offsets. This is a bill that is a plus all the way down the line. I believe before we are done, this legislation is going to pass and it is going to pass overwhelmingly when we get to the final vote, as it should. 
   I commend Senator COVERDELL and the bipartisan group that has worked on this legislation, brought it to the floor once before and back here now. But I felt compelled to say something because I had seen this quote saying this is bad educational policy. For the life of me, I cannot explain why that would be true. This is good policy across the board. 
   I urge my colleague to keep up the good work. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with the leadership to come up with a process that is fair, where education amendments can be offered, where education tax amendments can be offered, now where the Wellstone amendment can be offered. If we can work out a couple of other agreements, certainly I will be prepared to try to do that because I think this is important and the legislation is good. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. We will continue to work to get an agreement developed. Certainly amendments on education or education-related taxes would be something we would want to have and with which we would have no problem. We were hoping it would not run far afield to all kinds of unrelated issues that would delay a bill that has overwhelming support. 
   The support for this idea of being able to save a little for your own children's education--up to $2,000 per year per child, kindergarten through the 12th grade--has a lot of support, especially when you realize we can do it for our children's college education but not for our children's needs in the 4th grade. I hope we can work it out. I think maybe we can. We will keep working on that. 
   I now ask unanimous consent, after Senator LEAHY has spoken, the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with the first 8 minutes under the control of Senator THURMOND, the succeeding 30 minutes under the control of Senators TORRICELLI and SPECTER, the succeeding 10 minutes under the control of Senator CAMPBELL, the following hour under the control of Senators CLELAND and ROBERTS, and following that time the Senate resume consideration of the pending legislation and I be immediately recognized.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier today, I will attempt again now to see if we can work out an agreement as to how to proceed on the education savings account issue. I am prepared to continue working to try to work something out. I think it is perfectly legitimate--in fact, essential--that Senators be able to express themselves on education matters as a whole and specifically as it relates to this bill. 
   I think education amendments or education-related tax amendments that relate to this bill are very much in order. I support that all the way. But if it goes beyond that, then you get off into all kinds of other issues, and we will have an opportunity for that before this year is over. We have a long way to go. But I hope we can get serious consideration, good debate and amendments, on this education savings account bill and then move forward to other issues. 
   I am continuing to be hopeful that we can get an agreement to proceed on the Export Administration Act which does have bipartisan support. But we are working with the key members of the Armed Services Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Intelligence Committee to make sure legitimate concerns are addressed about national security, intelligence, and how the concurrence process works between Commerce and State and Defense. We still are hopeful we can get an agreement worked out for that. 
   For now, I renew my request and ask unanimous consent that all amendments be relevant to the subject matter of education or related to education taxes on the education savings account bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do truly regret this objection. But as I have indicated before, we will keep working to see if we can find a way to get an agreement to proceed. 
   I say to my colleagues, and to the American people, what is a more important issue than education? In most polls, the people indicate the issue they really are concerned about the most--or certainly in the top three--is education. Also, the indications across the board have been that people support the idea of having an opportunity to save for their children's education, not only for higher education but in some respects even more importantly K through the 12th grade. This would allow parents to set aside up to $2,000 per year per child of their own money for their own children's education needs. 
   I emphasize, what we are trying to work out does not restrict amendments on education, or education tax issues. Senators who have ideas about education--local control of education, or other ways we can help the children's education--boy, I can think of a lot of amendments that would be applicable here. 
   What I do not think we should do in an education debate is get into a whole raft of other important issues--maybe foreign trade issues, maybe just foreign policy issues, maybe trade amendments, maybe defense amendments, gun amendments--a whole myriad of amendments that Senators could come up with that they would want to put on this bill, perhaps because it is the first bill. 
   Under Senate rules, Senators will have the opportunity to offer whatever amendments they may be working on as we go through the year. It is just that I think sometimes we get into a position where we start offering the same amendments over and over again. What I am trying to do is get a process to get us to focus on education, have a good debate, have amendments, and when that is over, pass this legislation that, again, has bipartisan support. 
   There is broad support for the education savings account idea. But I will continue to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle. I think I am offering a reasonable request. I hope we can get something worked out between now and next Tuesday as to how to proceed.

I find it hard to believe that every Democrat is going to walk down and vote against going forward on education savings accounts--I think that is going to be hard to explain--because they want to offer an unrelated, nongermane amendment. But if the Democrats are prepared to do that, then we will just have to deal with that. The next rollcall vote, however, will occur then at 2:30 on Tuesday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support this morning of S. 2087, the Military Health Care Improvement Act of 2000. This is bipartisan legislation. It will begin to fulfill a promise of lifetime health care for our military men and women who sacrifice so much for our freedom. 
   This bill begins a multiyear process to identify and correct the broken promise of lifetime health care to our  military retirees and veterans. I want to emphasize that this is a reasonable and a prudent first step. It is not the end by any means. It is only the beginning of an effort to rejuvenate our defense health care system. 
   I met an hour or so ago with the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He confirmed that this is an important part of the triad of things that we must do to reinstate the morale and recruitment and retention that we need for our military. 
   Last year, with S. 4, we addressed two components of that triad: Pay and pension benefits. But this year defense health care is critical. The chiefs have stepped up to this issue and included in the budget what was submitted by the President significant improvements, particularly for health care for our active-duty personnel. But more needs to be done, both for the active-duty personnel, but especially for our retired military personnel. 
   I am pleased that the Commandant and the chiefs are trying to help us in this effort, and it is going to be one of the most important things we can do this year for the military. 
   It helps the men and women currently serving in the Armed Forces while also keeping promises to the heroes of America's storied yesterdays without which our prosperous and promising future would have never been possible. 
   Last year, I was proud to see our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol join in significantly improving two-thirds of the triad that I referred to. I was honored to join my distinguished colleagues on the defense authorization committee in passing the largest pay hike for our uniformed military personnel since 1981. 
   I remember very well in 1981 when President Reagan came in and said it is unconscionable that we are not paying our military personnel enough to live on. We had that period where they were having to go on food stamps and become qualified for welfare. The significant pay increase they received affected morale and helped us get our military into the position of great strength throughout the rest of the 1980s. But we have lost ground since then. 
   With the 4.8-percent raise for our men and women in uniform last year, we narrowed the pay differential between military and the private sector, making our All Voluntary Force more attractive to America's best young people and a more viable option for quality men and women who wish to remain in uniform. 
   Occasionally, I run across people who say, well, how is our All Volunteer Force working? Are they really able to do the jobs? We are getting the best? Sometimes I wonder. And then I have an occasion to go to a military installation to see men and women on Air Force bases--the Little Rock Air Force Base or Keesler Air Force Base, or Meridian Naval Air Station, or other military installations from South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and all across this country--to California. 
   I am invariably impressed with the caliber of young men and women I see, the knowledge they have, the sophistication of what they have to deal with in aircraft, ships, and in weapons systems. We are doing well, but morale has suffered because of the pay and retention problem, and now health care needs that they depend on for their families. They have this additional problem now of long assignments in areas such as Haiti, Kosovo, Bosnia, South Korea, and around the world. They are away from their families. 
   We run the risk of seeing our military begin to erode internally by losing these young men and women because of family needs and because of health care needs. We run the risk of not being able to retain our pilots and keep our chiefs, master sergeants, and the sergeant majors. Yes, these generals are fantastic, but who runs the Marine Corps? The sergeant major is the guy who does the work, or the woman who does the work that allows the Marines to do what they need to do. 
   This legislation is so important. It would substantially improve the health care benefits of our service personnel. 
   The military medical and dental care systems still do not provide benefits to all that have earned them. And it is possibly the single most important remaining item that addresses and affects the quality of life of our service members, their families, and our retirees. 
   Today there are the same number of potential beneficiaries, approximately 8 million, as when we began the downsizing almost 10 years ago. However, the resources allocated to military health care have decreased dramatically. We can no longer squeeze blood from this stone. It is empty. Our service men and women, their families, and our retirees deserve better. 
   The Military Health Care Improvement Act will complete the pay, benefits, and medical triad. The bill is composed of five primary components: 
   First, it extends existing demonstration programs for the over-65 retirees until the year 2005, including programs such as the Medicare Subvention and Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. 
   It also expands the Defense Department's national mail order pharmacy program to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, with $150 deductible. 
   It requires the expansion of the TriCare Remote program in the continental United States for active-duty family members in the Prime Remote program and eliminates copays for TriCare Prime for active-duty family members. It also improves the business practices used in administering the TriCare program. 
   Fourth, it expands the Department of Defense and Veterans' Administration cooperative programs, directing DOD and the VA to develop a common set of patient safety indicators for centralized tracking, and it will improve pharmaceutical safety. 
   Finally, it will initiate two studies to access the feasibility and desirability of financing the military health care program for retirees on an accrual basis. 
   This bill is only a start, but it is a very sure start. As with last year's efforts to improve the pay and retirement part of the quality of life triad for our military personnel, I am pleased this measure has such a broad bipartisan base of support in the Senate, particularly from my distinguished colleagues on the Senate's defense committees. 
   Unlike several other bills that are being touted on the Hill, this bill will be fully funded in the Senate's budget resolution of fiscal year 2001. Every year, thousands of bills that would spend millions, even billions, of dollars are introduced in the Congress--and for good purpose, I am sure, almost all of them. However, at the end of the year, few of the new massive programs are passed in view of all the other needs for defense, Medicare, Social Security, education, and transportation. 
   The key to success is ensuring that funding is included in the budget for the desired program. That is how the pay and retirement provisions of S. 4 were ultimately signed into law. That is how I hope to have the provisions of this bill signed into law. When S. 4 came up at the beginning of last year, some said: This costs too much; we will never get it done. But it was not a massive jump, it was achievable. Moving S. 4 aggressively with the authorization early in the year led to it ultimately being funded. 
   While I support the ultimate goal of the other bills, I don't know what their final cost may be. We have had estimate ranges of $8 billion to $20 billion per year. I believe our Nation should keep its promise of lifetime health care for our military personnel. But I also believe we owe it to all America's taxpayers to ensure we know how we can best meet this commitment, and if we can. As I said earlier, this process will take a year or two or more. 
   Many in Congress are committed to finding a way to fulfill our Nation's promise to our military members, their families, our military retirees, and veterans. What our military community doesn't need is more empty promises and unrealistic expectations; we need results. That is what this bill, S. 2087, is designed to do. It will give tangible and measurable results. 
   The broken promise of lifetime health care for our veterans has been a haunting specter in the Halls of Congress for a number of years, and rightly so. I have been hearing concerns about this 
   throughout my career in Congress, both the House and Senate. Of course, the problem goes back to the 1950s when changes were made that led to the problem we have now. It is time we  keep that promise. This calls for concrete, bipartisan legislation that takes a discernible step forward. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing less. They deserve health care, especially as so many World War II, Korea, and Vietnam era veterans depend on the promise of the Government of the people that they fought so hard to protect. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a look at this legislation. I thank Senator WARNER for the work he and his staff have done on this bill, as well as my staff who have worked on the Military Health Care Improvement Act of 2000. 
   I am thankful we have a bipartisan group of Senators who have cosponsored it. I think this is achievable legislation this year. It is the beginning of keeping our promise. 
   I commend this legislation to my colleagues. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. I inform our colleagues that the managers on this legislation, the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, will be available at 2 o'clock and we will begin the process to consider the education savings account bill. I certainly support this legislation. It has broad support across the country. We did pass it a couple of years ago. It was vetoed by the President. But it is a bill whose time has come. 
   People should be able to save for the education of their children, for their needs in education--whether kindergarten, 4th grade, 10th grade, or 12th grade. We need to allow parents who can and want to, to save for their needs, whether it is a computer for their child, whether tutoring, remedial assistance in reading, or whatever it may be. It is unconscionable that we can do that for a child's higher education but not for their education needs in the fourth grade. 
   Some say it will benefit middle-income people and upper-income people who can afford to save for their children's needs. That is fine. The important thing is to help our children, all of our children, at the lowest economic level, but also to encourage savings across the board for education in general. 
   I am glad we will have this full debate. I commend Senator COVERDELL for his pertinacious support for this legislation. He is dogged. He will not quit. I predict this bill will become law. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   In light of the agreement, there will be no votes during today's session. I remind Members that a rollcall vote is scheduled to occur tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. on the Iran Nonproliferation Act. There is a likelihood that there will be more votes Thursday afternoon, perhaps on Executive Calendar items. We will notify Members of any nominations that might be considered. If votes are required, then we will notify Members on both sides of the aisle exactly what time that would occur.

   Mr. LOTT. As a reminder to all Members, passage of this bill either by rollcall vote or voice vote is to occur in the 4 p.m. timeframe. We are trying to accommodate Senators who have a number of other meetings they need to attend, but it will be either at 4 or 4:30 at the very latest. Members will be notified, via hotline, as soon as the exact time has been determined. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this very important legislation, H.R. 1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 1999. 
   Let me say at the beginning, this legislation has always had strong bipartisan support. It passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives last year by a vote of 419-0, and it has always had strong support in the Senate from Senators LIEBERMAN, FEINSTEIN, and HELMS--a very broad, bipartisan group. 
   I also have to acknowledge the cooperation of Senator LEVIN, who has been working with me on the managers' amendment. I think it is important, we now go forward with this legislation.  
   I am pleased I have been joined in this effort by Senator LIEBERMAN, who he is on the floor to participate in the discussion of this legislation. Senator LIEBERMAN is a long-time expert in nonproliferation and Middle East matters, and he certainly deserves a lot of the credit for making this legislation possible. 
   The purpose of the bill is to express once again our deep concern regarding the transfer to Iran of dangerous technology, principally from Russia, China, and North Korea, as well as from other foreign entities, and to recommend additional steps to halt this deadly trade. 
   Again, let me go into a little history. This legislation passed the House and the Senate in 1998. The President vetoed it, but, at the request of the administration, efforts were ongoing to work with Russia. That veto was not overridden. We did not vote on it. But the hope that progress would be made has not paid off; we have not achieved the results we hoped for. You can say it was because they had changes in the leadership positions in Russia. They are trying to make progress, but the fact is, they are not making progress and this dangerous transfer of the technology that could lead to proliferation of nuclear weapons continues. 
   This bill requires the President to report to Congress when credible information exists of a transfer of dangerous technology to Iran. The President must also inform Congress whether he has imposed certain penalties on foreign persons as a result of such transfers. If such penalties are not imposed, the President must report the reasons why he decided against taking this step. 
   The bill will also create new incentives for the Russian aviation and space agency to cooperate with the United States in efforts to stem the proliferation of weapons technology to Iran by precluding certain payments to that agency if entities under its jurisdiction and control engage in such transfers. 
   Think about that. The United States is assisting the Russian aviation and space agency at a time when entities under its jurisdiction may, as a matter of fact, be involved in transferring this dangerous technology to Iran. It is absurd, and the American people would rightly be horrified to find that is the case. 
   As I noted, this bill passed the House last September by a unanimous vote, and that vote occurred despite an explicit veto threat by the President. The overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House and the strong bipartisan support the bill enjoys in the Senate underscores the seriousness with which the Congress views Iran's continued quest for long-range missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction. 
   I can think of few international developments that would be as damaging to U.S. national security and to stability and security in the Middle East as the acquisition by Iran of long-range, nuclear-tipped missiles. 
   We know already Iran has been the most notorious state sponsor of terrorism, including attacks on Americans, and we know Iran remains a steadfast opponent of peace between Israel and her neighbors, and Iran supports those whose violence is aimed at undermining prospects for a genuine lasting peace. 
   Some of our colleagues might observe that they had elections in Iran last week, and I believe those elections continue now. It appears reformers have been making some gains. That may be the situation in Iran, and the relations with Iran will change as a result of that. Let me assure my colleagues that the danger is still there. Those who are in charge of this nuclear proliferation in Iran have a very strong grip on what is being done, and there is very little likelihood they are going to let go of it anytime soon, in spite of what appears to be encouraging election returns. In fact, one can argue that to continue to send a strong signal against Iran's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction actually bolsters the reformers in their efforts to change the approach of Iran, both internally and externally. 
   While we are pleased to see what appears to be encouraging results--and I think the Senate should express itself on that, and I will suggest to the Democratic leadership we perhaps have a resolution acknowledging what has happened there and are hopeful about what that may mean--I do not think by any stretch of the imagination that should lead us to think everything is going to change immediately and we should not go forward with this very important legislation. 
   If my colleagues think about it, it is quite scary: Iran's leaders, now and in the future, will be in possession of nuclear-tipped ICBMs capable of reaching Washington or Los Angeles or New York. America's security and that of our friends and allies in the region will be unalterably affected by such a horrific development. 
   Yet that day of reckoning is coming and much sooner than we prefer, unless something is done to stop the transfer of this technology and other forms of assistance to Iran by Russia, in particular, but also by China and North Korea. 
   My colleagues will recall we have been working on this for 3 or 4 years. We have tried mightily to be of help to the administration in trying to put pressure on Russia in particular, but that strategy has failed to slow the flow of this dangerous technology. 
   Let me point out what CIA Director George Tenet said recently in a report to Congress on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction over the previous 6-month period. In that report, Director Tenet wrote:  
   Entities in Russia and China continued to supply a considerable amount and a wide variety of ballistic missile-related goods and technology to Iran.  
   The report also stated:  
   Iran's earlier success in gaining technology and materials from Russian companies accelerated Iranian [missile] development.  
   Director Tenet also noted:  
   Russian entities continued to interact with Iranian research centers on various [nuclear] activities. These projects will help Iran augment its nuclear technology infrastructure, which in turn would be useful in supporting nuclear weapons research and development.  
   The report also highlighted China's development in their programs. For example, the report stated:  
   Firms in China provided missile-related items, raw materials, and/or assistance to ..... Iran.  
   I had occasion to meet personally with Director Tenet recently because I wanted to hear what information he had that he could provide to me and other Senators who wished to have a private briefing about what is going on in this area, and also to discuss the recent U.S. counterterrorism activities. 
   Director Tenet reaffirmed that the flow of dangerous technology to Iran from Russia and China is, in fact, continuing and on a significant scale. It has not dropped. If anything, it has become worse. I urge those Senators who have not had a chance to review this classified record to go up to room S-407 to get this briefing. It is a sobering reminder that despite the end of the cold war, serious threats to U.S. security and our critical allies around the world remain. 
   I commend Director Tenet and the entire U.S. intelligence community for their heroic efforts to uncover the truth about these dangerous transfers. What makes the intelligence community's successes so much more astounding is that they come in spite of significant denial and deception by Russia, China, and others. 
   Director Tenet's report underscores the administration's current strategy for dealing with this growing problem. I know they worked at it. I discussed this with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. They have tried. They acknowledged it has been difficult. They have had to deal with changing people and the laws in Russia, of while their intentions, as they provide them to us verbally, appear to be in the right direction, the results are just not there. 
   The administration had hoped that by engaging Russia, China, and North Korea in a dialog, they could persuade those nations to cease and desist from their provocative behavior. The administration, I understand, did get the Russian Government to take some steps, such as adoption of export control law and regulations, but despite this fact, not a single Russian has been successfully prosecuted for transferring weapons of mass destruction or missile technology to Iran. Not one. I repeat, the intelligence we get is it is probably growing worse. So action against an individual, action against companies or academicians and professors, if there is anything in that nature going on, we do not see any results.  
   Thus, it appears the Russian Government either supports this clandestine transfer of dangerous technology to Iran or is unwilling to take strong necessary steps to halt it. 
   The same can be said for the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea; therefore, I join with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in believing that it is time to send a strong signal to the administration but, more importantly, to Russia, China, and North Korea, and to other countries that may be contemplating the transfer of this dangerous technology to Iran, or to Iraq, for that matter. 
   The message is simple: The Congress and the American people are not content with the status quo. We are not content with the dialog that produces even more promises on the one hand and scant or no real reduction in the flow of technology on the other. Some might say this bill is not strong enough, and I would be hard pressed to disagree with that. I would prefer it to be even stronger. After all, the bill provides the President with the authority to impose sanctions, but it does not require them. We may want to look at doing that if we do not see some changes. If we do not see some actions by the administration, if we do not see some actions being taken to impose sanctions, then we may want to go that next step. 
   I believe bolder action is going to be needed, that this will not be enough. It is a signal that is worth providing at this time. Because of its strong bipartisan support and because I believe it will become law, I am willing to go forward with it in this fashion at this time. 
   The bill before us now reflects a continuing commitment in both parties to take a tough stand in the fight against nuclear proliferation. 
   With this in mind, I urge the President not to veto this bipartisan bill but instead to sign it into law as soon as it lands on his desk. 
   Again, I thank Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator HELMS, and the many other Senators who are involved in the process of crafting this important legislation. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

We hope that is the case.

   Mr. LOTT. That is correct. The use of the term ``could'' is meant to convey an expectation that commodities should be controlled and monitored because of their potential for contributing to nuclear, chemical, or biological warfare programs, or to ballistic or cruise missile development. That is to say, this section covers commodities which should be controlled because of their physical or technological properties. This standard is consistent with current United States export control practice and with various statutory nonproliferation reporting requirements.

   Mr. LOTT. First of all, I appreciate sincerely the efforts of the Senator from Oklahoma to limit the recess appointment power of the Executive. Over a period of years, Executives of both parties have probably abused this authority. It is one that has been used by President Bush, President Reagan, as well as President Carter and President Clinton. I know in the past Senator BYRD, as a matter of fact, worked on this area of concern of the Senate and worked out an agreement, with the cooperation, as I recall, of Senator Dole and President Reagan, who was in the White House at that time. 
   Because of the Senator's concern and insistence about this matter, my colleagues will recall that last year, once again, we went through a process that led to a similar agreement in writing between the Senate and this President about how these recess appointments would be handled. It is important that we make every effort to live up to the letter of that agreement, as well as the spirit. 
   I emphasize that Senator INHOFE has already helped in bringing that about. There is no doubt in my mind that his efforts and his comments last year and this year had an impact on the number of recess appointments with which the administration did, in fact, go forward. 
   I know for sure--in fact, the President indicated as much to me--that they had wanted to do more, but they showed restraint and they realized that it could cause even more serious problems. So he has had an impact, there is no question about that. It is very helpful. 
   Indeed, Senator INHOFE did inform me of his intentions last November before he made his speech on the floor--I remember, I walked over to this area and talked with him. I admit, I was dealing with a lot of different issues at the time and perhaps should have paid a little bit more attention to exactly the exchange that was occurring and the lists that were being discussed--after I had shared with him the list of possible recess appointees provided by the White House on November 19 in compliance 
   with a similar Byrd-Reagan agreement. There is no question his memory of that discussion and his efforts did take place, and I appreciate that. 
   As majority leader, I must also say I worked with the White House to limit their use of these recess appointments through these negotiations both now and in the past. I am quick to say, on more than one occasion I thought they made a mistake and I told them so. I remember one ambassadorial appointment in particular. 
   On many occasions, we have been able to resolve differences. With regard to the appointment of a person during the recess, sometimes there were problems, but concerns were worked out after further consideration. I do acknowledge that they have worked on a regular basis with me as majority leader and with my staff when I have been absent and in my own State or in other States. 
   I have great sympathy for the Senator's plan to object to these judicial nominations. I have said before, I am not one who gets all weepy-eyed about having more Federal judges of any kind anywhere. However, as majority leader, I must take some other factors into account. 
   Using the Sarah Fox example, she had previously been confirmed to a position on the NLRB by a vote of the full Senate. I believe she would have been confirmed to a full term if her nomination were brought to the floor of the Senate again. It probably would have eventually because, in this case, it is not a judicial nomination. 
   If the Chair will excuse me and my colleagues a moment of partisanship, I hope to have a Republican in the White House next year to succeed President Clinton. 
   So, therefore, I hope this Republican will be able to name a majority of the members of boards and commissions as soon as possible. I did not want Sarah Fox serving a full NLRB term, which would have extended until 2004. I thought a 1-year appointment allowing, then, for her to be replaced by the next President--whichever party that President may be from--made some sense. 
   Maybe that contributed to a violation of the letter or the spirit of the agreement, but it was after a lot of discussion with colleagues on our side of the aisle. I thought it made sense to go ahead and do that. 
   I am also concerned very much about the Senate getting into the possibility of filibustering judicial nominations. It is a bad precedent. The Senate has generally not done that. Once again, I hope we will be having nominations suggested by the Senator from Kansas next year. I would be greatly concerned about the idea that a nomination would be filibustered. 
   As a matter of fact, you may recall last year when the Democrats did filibuster a nominee from Utah, I complained loudly that it was a mistake, should not be done. As you recall, the better part of judgment prevailed, and we backed away from that. We, in fact, confirmed that nominee. So that is another factor I have to inject. 
   I do not think we should or would be able to go all year without confirming any nominees. Some of these nominees are good men and women. Some of them have already waited a long time. Some of them are supported by Governors and Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and should not be held. 
   In some of these States there truly is a need for more judges, as bad as that may sound to some of us. Florida is a State with a growing docket of cases. Even hard-working Federal judges cannot cope with it. 
   So all of these are matters I have to consider as majority leader. It is one of those burdensome, delicate balances for which the majority leader has to assume the responsibility. 
   So based on that--my concern about how long these appointments would be for; my feeling that, in fact, the White House did try to work with us; my feeling that we should not start filibustering these nominations--these and other concerns lead me to the conclusion that I will honor a Senator's hold for a reasonable period of time and will certainly honor a hold by the Senator from Oklahoma and will inform him when nominations will be brought to the floor so that he can take whatever action he is compelled to take--and I will honor that also--but, nevertheless, I think we should move forward and bring these nominees to a vote on the floor. 
   I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could comment briefly on that, I meant it sincerely when I said there has been good, hard work done on both sides of the aisle: Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HATCH on the bankruptcy bill; Senator MURKOWSKI, obviously, and others on the nuclear waste bill. But Senator REID has done excellent work on his side of the aisle in helping us move this legislation through in a positive way. 
   The fact is, already this year we have passed bankruptcy reform; we have passed a bill that would provide for a minimum wage increase and tax relief for small business men and women, and for a nuclear waste repository. These  are important issues. They are complicated and difficult to deal with substantively and politically. I think the Senate can feel good. I hope we can continue to work our way through important issues and that we will be able to do it as much as possible in a bipartisan way. 
   I yield further to the Senator from Oklahoma.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Jack E. Harper, Jr., of Sunflower County, Mississippi. Mr. Harper recently retired as the Chancery Clerk of Sunflower County after serving tirelessly in this position for 44 years. This is an exemplary record of public service, and it is a privilege to honor this outstanding Mississippian for his unselfish dedication to Sunflower County government for so many years. 
   In addition to Mr. Harper's lengthy service as Chancery Clerk, I also commend him for his involvement in numerous civic activities and for his military service. Mr. Harper is a veteran of the United States Marines, having served 31 months in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1951, while he was a member of the Mississippi National Guard, he was ordered to active military duty for 2 years and served 1 year in Korea during 1951-1952. In conjunction with his military service, Mr. Harper is a member and past Commander of the Indianola American Legion and VFW posts. Additionally, Mr. Harper has been active in his community, as demonstrated by the fact that he served as President of the Indianola Lions Club and as the District Governor of the Mississippi Lions. 
   Jack Harper has always shown a commitment to education. He earned degrees from Indianola High School, Mississippi Delta Community College, and both Bachelor of Laws and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Mississippi School of Law, my alma mater. Additionally, he has served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Mississippi Delta Community College since January, 1961, and has served as Board Chairman since 1968. He is a past President of the Mississippi Junior College Inter-Alumni Association, and he is a member of the State Association of Community and Junior College Trustees. He currently serves as the Co-Chairman of the Education Committee for the Indianola Chamber of Commerce. 
   Although Jack Harper is retiring from official public office, I know that he will continue to serve his community and the State of Mississippi in the same devoted manner that he has for his entire life. I am envious of the time that he will now have to spend with his family, particularly his grandchildren. Once again, I congratulate and thank Mr. Harper for his service to Sunflower County and Mississippi.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, momentarily I will ask consent for the Senate to go to S. 1287, the nuclear waste bill. I know there have been negotiations underway in an effort to reach a comprehensive agreement on a manager's amendment to the nuclear waste bill. I thank Senator MURKOWSKI for the work  he has put into this important legislation now going back at least 2 years. 
   We have had a good amount of time spent on this legislation on the floor of the Senate, having passed it once before. A lot of work has gone into it this year. I believe we are within the realm of being able to get an agreement which would allow this legislation to move forward and be completed in a very fair way this week. 
   I also extend my appreciation to the Democratic whip, Senator REID, for his diligence and for his work. He has always made an extra effort to make sure we are communicating and there are not any surprises or dilatory actions taken as we try to come to an agreement that is acceptable to the largest number of people. Senator BRYAN of Nevada is here. This is very important to these two Senators and to their State. I understand that and I have always tried to be sensitive, understanding their need to offer amendments or to make statements, and to be very careful as we consider this legislation. I thank them. 
   I understand negotiations have been underway between Senator MURKOWSKI in discussions with Senator BINGAMAN and others, but I do think we need to go forward. This is important legislation. I believe we are very close to getting an agreement that is going to be acceptable to a large number of 
   Senators. We do need to have either this agreement worked out and understood so we can move forward without a cloture vote or go ahead and go to cloture because we have to set up a process that allows this to be considered, hopefully favorably, and completed this week. We have been working on it a long time and now is the time to begin to close the deliberations and pass this legislation. 
   I understand Senator REID has been attending a hearing and is on his way so we can proceed with this action. I do not wish to proceed without his presence because I know if any procedural action or any agreement is worked out, he wants to be here and be a part of what is done. I do say, though, I do have a commitment on the House side I am going to have to attend. I was supposed to speak at 11 o'clock, so I do need to go to the House to carry out my commitment as soon as possible. I will withhold any formal request at this time, but by making this comment now I hope maybe we can move expeditiously to call up this bill and to filing cloture. 
   I have one final comment. I say again, as I have said several times in the Senate last year and the year before and again this year, this is one of the most important environmental bills we will have in this Congress. Billions of dollars have been spent on this issue, and an inordinate amount of time in the Senate, trying to find a way to get it done. If we can come to an agreement and get this legislation completed, I believe history will look back on this action as one of the most important bills we will have done this year. If, at the end of this week, we will have already completed the final version of bankruptcy legislation, which included a minimum wage increase and tax relief for small businessmen and businesswomen, and address the question of health care costs, and then pass this important nuclear waste bill, we will be off on a very positive step. It will be done in a way I think is fair to both sides of the aisle. We can continue to make progress. As soon as Senator REID arrives, we will move forward on the nuclear waste legislation. 
   I observe the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to allow the body to move forward with regard to the nuclear waste storage bill. More than 15 years ago, Congress directed the Department of Energy to take responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste created by commercial nuclear powerplants and our Nation's defense programs. Today, there are more than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel that must be dealt with. 
   Quite some time has now passed since DOE was absolutely obligated under the NWPA Act of 1982 to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from utility sites. 
   All across this country, we have sites where nuclear waste products are in open pools, cooling pools. Many of those are filling up. A number of States have a major problem. 
   In my opinion, this is one of the most important environmental issues we have to face as a nation. We have to deal with this problem. There have been billions of dollars spent on it. There has been time put into thinking about the proper way to do it. States all across this country, from Vermont to Mississippi to Minnesota to Washington, believe very strongly that we need to address this issue. 
   Apparently today, DOE is no closer in coming up with a solution. This is totally unacceptable. This is, in fact, wrong, so say the Federal courts. The law is clear, and DOE has not met its obligation, so the Congress must act. 
   I am encouraged that Senator MURKOWSKI and his committee have addressed the issue and they have come up with a different bill than the one we considered the year before last. They have made concessions, they have made improvements, and I thought we had a bill that was going to be generally overwhelmingly accepted. 
   I do think when we get over procedural hurdles, when the final vote is taken on this nuclear waste disposal bill, the vote will probably be in the high seventies or eighties when it is actually voted on, and that is an important point. The Senate will vote by overwhelming numbers for this legislation, so we need to move through the process. 
   I know there is opposition from the Senators from Nevada, and they have to have an opportunity to make their case and offer amendments if they feel the need to do so, as well as other Senators. 
   But I think it is so important that we cannot allow it to languish any longer. It is a bipartisan effort that came out of the committee. It is safe, practical, and it is a workable solution for America's spent fuel storage needs. 
   This is the proper storage of spent fuel, and it is not being done in a partisan way. It is dealt with as a safety issue. Where is DOE? Well, about where it is always, I guess. What is their solution? If not this, what? 
   They have not given us any answers or any indications of how they would like to proceed with this. All of America's experience in waste management over the last 25 years of improving environmental protection has taught Congress that safe, effective waste handling practices entail using centralized, permitted, and controlled facilities to gather and manage accumulated waste. 
   I took the time to go to Sweden and France and to meet with officials from the private sector in Britain. I looked at how they have dealt with their waste problem. They have dealt with it. Sweden has; France has; Britain and Japan; but not the United States. Why? We are the most developed country in the world, yet we have not dealt with this very important issue. So after over 25 years of working with this problem, DOE has still not made specific plans. 
   The management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize on the knowledge and experience we have. Nearly 100 communities have this spent fuel sitting in their ``backyards,'' and it needs to be gathered, accumulated, and placed in a secure and safe place. This lack of a central storage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of several nuclear powerplants. 
   These affected plants produce nearly 20 percent of America's electricity. Closing these plants does not make sense. But if we do not do something with the waste, that could be the result. 
   Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future and must remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to maintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity. At the same time, nuclear power allows the Nation to directly and effectively address increasingly stringent air quality requirements. 
   I challenge my colleagues in the Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, to get this bill done. We spent a lot of time on it the year before last. We ran into the blue slip problem with the House. We will not have that problem with this bill. 
   The citizens in these communities are looking for us to act. The nuclear industry had already committed to the Federal Government about $15 billion toward building the facility by 1998. The industry has continued to pay between $40 and $80 billion in fees for storage of this spent fuel. 
   It is time for the Federal Government to honor its commitment to the American people and to the power community. It is time for the Federal Government to protect these 100 communities to ensure that the Federal Government meets its commitment to States and electricity consumers. The 106th Congress must mandate completion of this program--a program that gives the Federal Government title to waste currently stored on-site at facilities across the Nation, a site for permanent disposal, and a transportation infrastructure to safely move the used fuel from plants to the storage facility. 
   Again, I have had people express concerns to me about how this can be done safely. I actually took the time to look at the equipment that is used to move this spent fuel in other countries, particularly in France, and they have done it safely, without a single incident--no problem ever. Again, they are doing it in France. Can't we do it in America? 
   Our foot dragging is unfortunate. It is unacceptable. Clearly, we must move this legislation. The only remedy to stop the delays--and it is a timely action--is for the Senate to consider this in the 106th Congress. 
   Let's move forward and get this legislation done. 
   Madam President, I see Senator REID is here.

   Mr. LOTT. Let me say, while I believe very strongly that this legislation needs to be passed and is an issue that has tremendous environmental consequences and concerns we have to address, I think the Senator from Nevada would also acknowledge that we have always been sensitive to the need for him and his colleague from Nevada to know what is going on, to not be surprised, have a chance to make their statements, offer amendments, and resist in every way. I am very sympathetic to the need for them to have that opportunity. We will protect their rights as we go forward. We appreciate the way the Senator has approached it also. 
   I now withdraw the motion to proceed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The action against local authorities in Pittsburgh arises out of a premises search and civil commitment proceedings they initiated. The plaintiff sought casework assistance from Senator RICK SANTORUM's office at around the same time that the plaintiff came to the attention of local authorities as a potential threat to himself or others. This resolution would permit an employee on Senator SANTORUM's staff to testify at a deposition, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, about his communications with the parties to this matter.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I must say, once again, welcome to my colleagues and the Chaplain and a hardy band of brothers and sisters who serve as our staff. It is very tough today to be in the Nation's Capital with, I guess, 8 or 10 inches of snow on the ground and more on the way. 
   I note, of course, to the Senator from Montana, it is nothing unusual for him; he is used to this kind of snow, I guess. 
   To our Chaplain, I say thank you for being here this morning with your beautiful prayer, as always. 
   On our leadership team, I thank Senator NICKLES, Senator MACK, Senator CRAIG, and Senator MCCONNELL for being here today. We have already had a leadership meeting. I thank Senator REID for being here on behalf of the Democrats. 
   I had several conversations early this morning with officials, the police, and also with Senator DASCHLE, about how to deal with the weather. It is a massive snow and certainly there is a great deal of danger in the amount that has come down. With the difficulty in the ability to move around and with a lot of our staff and Senators living out in Virginia and Maryland, it made sense to join the rest of the Federal Government and be closed today. However, due to the Senate rules, we have to be here for a few minutes so that we can adjourn to reconvene tomorrow. We had already entered the order that we would be here today at the assigned hour of 11:30 a.m., and so we had to be here. But we will go on with business that we must do today, and then everyone will be able to go home safely before it gets even worse this afternoon.

   I thank the Senator for the work he has done on the bankruptcy bill. Without the work of the Senator last year, we would not be in the position of being able to finish the pending amendments and, hopefully, the entire bill by tomorrow. I know the Senator is still working on it. We did vitiate the cloture vote yesterday so that that will not occur, and we did lock in an agreement as to how to go forward, what amendments would be considered and voted on, to complete its consideration. I know the Senator has indicated he thinks we can do that. So has Senator DASCHLE. And we will work with the Senators to try to make that occur. 
   I thank the Senator for his effort. I hope he will continue to do that.

We did move the starting time from 9:30 to 11 a.m. to allow time for our staffs to be here and have time to prepare for the session, but we will go right into the business of consideration of the amendments that have been agreed to. Under the previous consent, time agreements have been made on most of the remaining amendments, and therefore it is hoped that a final vote would occur on Wednesday on the bankruptcy bill. That could occur late in the afternoon or even in the early evening, but I think it is important that we try to finish that legislation on Wednesday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senators have statements they would like to make or legislation they would like to introduce, we will have a time for doing that today. I have talked to a number of Senators this morning, including my counterpart on the Democratic side, Senator DASCHLE, and everybody seems to be in good spirits and ready to go to work. We do have a lot of legislation that is pending, that has been reported out of committees and we hope to move to very quickly. We have a number of bills in conference that we hope to have started right away to move toward getting a conference report. I believe the Federal Aviation Administration conferees will meet, in fact, on Thursday to begin to do some work there. This week we have scheduled action on the bankruptcy reform bill. We spent a lot of time at the end of the session last year on that bill--in fact, I think it was over a week. We went through over 100 amendments. We have narrowed the list down to a relatively small number. I visited with Senator DASCHLE about this legislation, and we will have some decision, some announcements we will make later on today about exactly how to proceed on bankruptcy reform. 
   In addition to that, we will have legislation that will be pending after today under rule XIV with regard to the situation of Elian Gonzalez, the young boy from Cuba. The legislation advocated by Senator MACK, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator GRAHAM, and others would grant citizenship to this young boy and therefore have the matter of his situation determined by a custody court proceeding rather than Immigration. When that would come up will depend on a number of other things, but it could be available as early as Wednesday or it could be acted on 
   instead next week. 
   I remind my colleagues that there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. I am sure many Senators will be in the Chamber to make statements and introduce bills. We will be taking legislative action on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the potential of a number of votes occurring Tuesday afternoon and/or Wednesday. On Thursday, we will have a conference retreat for Republicans at the Library of Congress so we will not be in session during the day. As a reminder, the State of the Union Address will be that night, Thursday, January 27, at 9 p.m., and therefore the Senate will convene at 8:40 p.m. in order to proceed to the  House of Representatives for that Address. 
   Finally, for the remainder of this week, I hope we will look at exactly when we will take up the nuclear waste legislation. I presume that some action will be taken either late this week or early next week which will guarantee a vote. 
   I appreciate my colleagues' attention and say again I look forward to working with Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   In order to confirm that the Senate is prepared to begin business in the second session of the 106th Congress, I now suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the Democratic leader will be here momentarily. Senator DASCHLE had started to make a speech earlier when we first started the quorum call. I believe he will be here momentarily to deliver his remarks. I call on other Senators who have been prepared to make remarks. I believe Senator MACK and perhaps several others would like to make remarks before the Senate concludes business today. I am glad we have established a quorum and are now ready to proceed. 
   I again remind Senators we will be in session on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. They should expect votes possibly during the day on Tuesday and possibly several votes on Wednesday. 
   It is our hope at this time that we can reach an agreement on how to proceed on the bankruptcy bill and we will be able to get an agreement on that and complete that bill which was carried over from the first session of this 106th Congress, and hopefully we could finish it by Wednesday night. There has been an indication, I believe on both sides of the aisle, we hope we could do that. So that would be our desire. 
   With regard to the matter of the young boy from Cuba, Elian Gonzalez, again what happens there will depend on events. Senator MACK will surely speak to that when he arrives in the Chamber. 
   Then at some point next week we will initiate proceedings on the nuclear waste bill also. 
   Those would be the first three issues we have pending before us. We will confer with the Democratic leadership and work on the bills that will be considered after that. 
   Mr. President, since Senator DASCHLE has not arrived just 
    yet, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am reminded each time I look to the sky of the reach Americans have made to the heavens. I am extremely proud that every manned spaceflight since the Apollo program has been powered by engines tested at a facility in my home State of Mississippi, the John C. Stennis Space Center. There, a dedicated group of professionals labors largely unheralded to ensure the performance and safety of the engines that propel our astronauts into space. Although I have known many of these outstanding Mississippians in my years in Congress, I only recently had the opportunity to work closely with one of these professionals. The leadership at NASA decided to offer a legislative fellowship to Congress to one of NASA Stennis' rising stars, Mr. Patrick Scheuermann. 
   Patrick arrived on Capitol Hill in January, 1999, at the beginning of a very busy opening session of the 106th Congress. Although many thought other proceedings that opened the 106th would supercede a legislative agenda, the Senate professional and personal staffs ensured that, in the background, the business of Congress stayed in motion. Patrick cut his teeth in the difficult staff preparations for the legislative cycle that would take place around the issues that dominated the Senate floor. An effort was underway at NASA to reinvigorate manned space flight and to reduce the cost of getting to space. Patrick was assigned to research and report on these initiatives and to keep my legislative staff briefed on their status through the Authorization and Appropriations process. 
   Patrick approached his assignment with the interest of someone who not only enjoys what he does, but with the infectious enthusiasm that brings others onboard as well. My staff quickly became knowledgeable of the many NASA programs that together form our Nation's efforts to reach space. I found more and more space related meetings on the calendar. As the Session progressed, the Senate led the charge to complete the first NASA Authorization Bill in many years. One hundred million dollars was added to the NASA budget to develop third generation reusable launch vehicle technology, a program known as Spaceliner 100. Patrick's ability to explain the facets of NASA's programs to legislative staffers and his vigilance as changes developed ensured the ultimate success of these endeavors. His detailed understanding of Stennis Space Center's capabilities and assets also proved to be of great value in assessing the facility's potential for commercial activities. 
   Patrick has a long history with the Space Program. After earning his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Orleans, he made his first foray into the world of Rocket Science as a contract test engineer, testing Space Shuttle Main Engines at the Stennis Space Center. This brought him across the ``Great Divide'' that is the Pearl River and firmly onto Mississippi soil where the NASA hierarchy recognized and recruited the talented young engineer. Although our neighbors across the Pearl claim Patrick as a native son, Mississippians have adopted him for his hard work and strength of character. He also made the grade through his success in attracting one of Greater Picayune's finest, Miss Sarah Melissa Lee to be his bride. Together they have added to Mississippi's fame through their beautiful children, Chandler and Christina. Although I am sorry to lose the talent and expertise that Patrick brought to my staff, I am pleased that his return to the Stennis Space Center foretells many more years of innovation and success at this vital national treasure.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Lieutenant Commander John Di Mento, upon his departure from my staff. Lieutenant Commander Di Mento was selected as a Navy Fellow to work in my office because of his professional reputation and his knowledge of the Navy Oceanography program and the military presence in my home state. Not a Mississippian by birth, he earned the respect of Mississippians during his long service in the state from 1990 through 1996, and through his impressive display of good judgement when he married the former Chenaey Bourgeois of Bay Saint Louis. Together they have added to Mississippi's fame through their beautiful daughter, Colby. 
   Lieutenant Commander Di Mento entered the United States Naval Academy in 1983 and was commissioned as an Ensign upon graduation in 1987. He earned a Master's Degree in Oceanography and began his career as a Naval Oceanographer as the Executive Officer of Oceanographic Unit Three, surveying over 100,000 miles of the ocean floor in a year deployed. He returned from sea and reported to the Naval Oceanographic Office in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi. He worked extensively in ocean modeling and remote sensing, and flew aerial oceanographic surveys with Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight, in the process earning his Naval Aviation Observer wings. Later assigned as Oceanographer on USS Kearsarge, Lieutenant Commander Di Mento qualified as a Surface Warfare Officer. He was commended for his performance during Operation Noble Obelisk, where he was responsible for the processing, care, and movement of over 2,500 refugees rescued by Kearsarge from the civil war in Sierra Leone from embarkation through debarkation. 
   Ashore, Lieutenant Commander Di Mento served briefly on the staff of the Oceanographer of the Navy at the U.S. Naval Observatory. He later served two years as Flag Aide and Executive Assistant for Rear Admiral Paul Gaffney, II, Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command following a year as Flag Aide to his predecessor, Rear Admiral John Chubb. His only other tour ashore found him navigating the sometimes treacherous waters here on Capitol Hill. 
   Lieutenant Commander Di Mento quickly became a valued member of my staff where he led several legislative initiatives that enormously benefitted the Department of Defense, the Navy, and the State of Mississippi. He provided a great deal of research and analysis while the Senate initiated broad reform of military pay and benefits. His work led to the most significant piece of legislation for service members since 1981. The leadership, integrity, and limitless energy that defined his naval career served him well in his term as a Legislative Fellow. 
   Lieutenant Commander Di Mento's many awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal, and various unit and service awards. Lieutenant Commander Di Mento will be missed on the staff, but his return to the Naval Service is a benefit to our great Nation. He has great things ahead of him. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Lieutenant Commander Di Mento, ``Fair Winds and Following Seas.''

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the significant efforts of Senator ABRAHAM to author and pass legislation aimed at facilitating the growth of electronic commerce. Commerce that everyone agrees is a significant driving force behind our nation's robust and expanding economy. 
   Today, the Senate passed by unanimous consent an Abraham substitute for S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This measure is important because it would ensure the legal certainty of electronic signatures in interstate commerce. 
   Mr. President, right now, there are over forty different state electronic authentication regimes in play. This patchwork of inconsistent and often conflicting state laws makes it difficult to conduct business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions over the Internet. Those involved in electronic transactions want assurance that their contractual arrangements are legally binding. 
   Senator ABRAHAM took the lead on this issue and crafted a bill to ensure that a national framework would govern the use of electronic signatures. It is a rational, coherent, and minimalist approach. An approach supported by America Online, American Bankers Association, American Council of Life Insurance, the American Electronics Association, American Financial Services Association, American Insurance Association, Apple, Business Software Alliance, Charles Schwab, the Coalition for Electronic Authentication, Consumer Mortgage Coalition, DLJ Direct, the Electronic Industry Alliance, FORD, Gateway2000, General Electric Company, GTE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Intuit, the Information Technology Association of America, the Information Technology Industry Council, Microsoft, NCR, the National Association of Manufacturers, National Retail Federation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others. 
   Mr. President, in drafting his legislation, Senator ABRAHAM included key concepts and provisions developed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL). A NCCUSL working group, which included legal scholars, experts on electronic commerce, state officials and other interested stakeholders, spent the better part of two years drafting the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). This model legislation was formally approved in August and is expected to be enacted on a state-by-state basis, much like the process followed in approving the Uniform Commercial Code, over the next three to five years. 
   Senator ABRAHAM's electronic signatures measure is timely in that it serves as an interim solution needed to fill the void until states approve the model UETA package. 
   I applaud the junior Senator from Michigan for his continuing leadership on technology issues and commend the Senate's action today. This is definitely a significant step in the right direction. 
   Mr. President, Senator ABRAHAM, my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I agree that the measure passed today, while a significant accomplishment, only gets consumers to the 50-yard line when it comes to e-commerce. In order to get to the end-zone, Congress still needs to address the issue of electronic records.  
   The Millennium Digital Commerce Act that was unanimously approved by the Senate Commerce Committee in July would have also provided legal certainty to electronic records. However, eleventh hour objections from the minority, some of which were completely unrelated to this bill, thwarted repeated efforts to bring this crucial measure to the floor. 
   Mr. President, I would point out that the reported bill, with its electronic records provisions, had bipartisan support and was strongly endorsed by the Administration, not once, but twice. In fact the Office of Management and Budget's Statement of Administration Policy noted ``the Administration supports the passage of S. 761 ..... [Its] provisions strike the appropriate balance between the needs of each State to develop its own laws in relation to commercial transactions and the needs of the Federal government to ensure that electronic commerce will not be impeded by the lack of consistency in the treatment of electronic authentication.'' 
   The Commerce Committee reported measure did not, as some contend, alter federal or state consumer protection laws. Instead, Senator ABRAHAM's bill simply held that records could not be denied legal effect solely, and the key word is ``solely,'' because such records were in electronic form. 
   Mr. President, consumers stand the most to gain from electronic records and the most to lose if such records are not clearly granted legal effect, validity, and enforceability. In order to further assuage concerns, Senator ABRAHAM, in earnest, offered a substitute version that largely incorporated key provisions of UETA, verbatim. Even so, and as perplexing as it would seem, his UETA substitute was opposed by the minority. Remember, these are the words developed and agreed to by an esteemed panel of national and state legal experts, and these are the same words that will go into effect as states adopt UETA during the next few years. 
   I would point out that the Department of Commerce, in its June 22, 1999 position letter supporting the Abraham substitute bill that passed the Commerce Committee, noted that ``In the view of the Administration, the current UETA draft adheres to the minimalist `enabling' framework advocated by the Administration, and we believe that UETA will provide an excellent domestic legal model for electronic transactions, as well as a strong model for the rest of the world.'' 
   With these glowing endorsements of both the Commerce Committee reported measure and UETA, both of which provide legal certainty to electronic records, I was surprised and dismayed that the Administration flip-flopped on the records issue at the last moment. One has to wonder what motivated this 180-degree change in position and why the Administration went to great lengths to stall and eventually oppose electronic transactions legislation that included digital records. 
   Consumers want and need electronic records, not only because digitized records are the equivalent of paper-notices, records, and disclosures, but also because such information is often easier to access, read, store and maintain. Electronic records will save consumers time, money, and the hassle of waiting for paper notices and disclosures. Used in conjunction with an electronic signature, electronic records, with appropriate and effective electronic disclosures, allow anyone, with a hook-up to the borderless World Wide Web, to transact business at any time and at any place. 
   Mr. President, it is the seamless nature of the Internet that makes it such a phenomenal communications and business medium. To ensure that no one is left out of this new millennium paradigm, the legal certainty of electronic records must be codified in federal statute--at least until UETA is adopted nationally. It is my sincere hope that Congress will address the legality of electronic records in the near term so consumers will experience the full benefits and to reap the rewards of the Internet. 
   Again, I want to applaud the efforts of the Senate in passing S. 761, Senator ABRAHAM's electronic signatures bill. This action is good for America's consumers, good for America's businesses, and good for our nation's economy and prosperity. 
   Mr. President, Senator ABRAHAM has once again proven that he is a champion of technology, a guardian of the consumer, and an extremely effective legislator.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action commenced by a pro se plaintiff in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Senator HATCH and a former member of the staff of the Judiciary Committee. The plaintiff is a federal prisoner serving a sentence for offenses related to a series of bombings in 1979. The complaint seeks damages from Senator HATCH and staff for their alleged role in the United States Parole Commission's 1997 revocation of the plaintiff's parole for failure to satisfy an outstanding civil judgment against him in favor of one of the victims of his bombings. 
   The plaintiff's claims of unfairness and political bias in his parole revocation hearing have already been rejected by the federal district court in Maryland in habeas corpus proceedings initiated by the plaintiff. 
   This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator HATCH in this action. The Senate Legal Counsel will seek dismissal of the suit for failure to state a claim for relief and for other reasons.

   Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement, there will be three back-to-back votes that will occur a few minutes before 5 o'clock this afternoon, the first being the cloture vote relative to the appropriations conference report, the second being passage of the appropriations conference report, and the third being passage of the Work Incentives conference report. 
   There are two very important colloquies we must have this afternoon before the votes, one with regard to understandings with regard to the Work Incentives bill and another colloquy we will have with the leadership on the Democratic side, and I will participate in, along with Senator LUGAR and others, to discuss the overall dairy situation. We will fulfill that commitment. 
   I thank Senator DASCHLE, Senator KOHL, Senator FEINGOLD, and everybody who has been involved. I know how emotional and how strongly held these feelings are. I also share those feelings, and I will make that clear in a colloquy here in a few minutes. 
   Senator DASCHLE, do you want to do that now or in a few minutes?

   This is a very important committee. It is a committee that operates in the best tradition of total bipartisanship, nonpartisanship. Chairman SHELBY has been doing an outstanding job. It really makes the leaders feel good when we see two Senators of two parties work together for our national interests and our intelligence community. Senator KERREY certainly has been just outstanding, the way he has handled that job. He has been cooperative, nonpartisan. 
   These two Senators, Senator SHELBY and Senator KERREY, have worked together the way it is supposed to be done. I hope your successors will only do as well. I thank you for your service.

   Mr. LOTT. We do need to have a colloquy now, before we begin the final debate on this very important work incentives legislation on the matter of dairy and the dairy language in the appropriations bill. There is no use at this point of me going back and recounting all that has gone on in us reaching the point where we are in the language in this bill. 
   There are a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle who believe that the Northeast Dairy Compact should have been included. There are Senators who think that portions of the bill H.R. 1402, known as the 1-A, should have been included. There are other Senators who believe equally as strongly that neither of those should have been included in this bill. I must say, I am in that group. 
   I do not think what we have come up with on dairy is where we should leave it. It was something that was laboriously worked out. I tried my very best to find some way that we could come up with something that was in the best interests of dairy, the consumers, something that was acceptable to Senator GRAMS, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator KOHL, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator FEINGOLD, but there was no way to find a solution with which all 
   sides could be content. Regardless of how this agreement was reached, we are here, and it will be in law. But I do not think we should leave it on this line. 
   I do not think compacts are the answer, personally. I believe it very strongly. I do not think that trying to expand it--more compacts--and have the kinds of controls you have now by the Government, or will have in this by the Government, is the answer. 
   So I find myself philosophically very sympathetic to Senator GRAMS and Senator KOHL and Senator DOMENICI and Senator FITZGERALD, but I also know of the position of the Senate on this issue, and Senator JEFFORDS and Senator LEAHY were able to produce a majority of the Senate, although neither side could produce a 60-vote margin to break a filibuster. 
   So all I want to say today is that while this legislation, I believe, is going to pass, we should not stop at this point. We should look for a better way to do this. We should look for a way to get away from compacts and a way to get away from the type of Government controls we now have. 
   Do I have a magic solution? Can I guarantee by the first week in February this will be resolved? No. I have been wrangling around with this for 20 years, as the Senator in the Chair, who was chairman of the Agriculture Committee, tried mightily and could not find the solution. 
   But I am committed here today to work with those who believe we should not be doing this to find a way to do it better. I know the Senators on the other side will fight tenaciously against that, but I want the RECORD to reflect my true feelings on this and reflect my commitment that we are not going to leave it on this line. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the language will delay the rule for 90 days. That is what is required and that was my intent, from the date of enactment of H.R..1180, in order to facilitate additional public review. It is not the intent of the legislation to cause any unreasonable delay in the formulation of necessary improvements in national organ transplant policies, but rather to permit constructive review of the information that 
    will be available and for the Congress to review it. 
   Furthermore, I make clear section 413 provides that the rule is not effective until the expiration of the 90-day rule beginning on the date of enactment of this act. During that 90-day period, the Secretary shall publish a notice eliciting public comments on the rule and shall conduct a full review of the comments. At the end of the period, section 413 allows, but does not require, the Secretary to make any revisions in the rule that she deems appropriate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. This bill makes many needed and timely reforms to the Satellite Home Viewer Act which originally passed almost 12 years ago. I have said for many months I believed this was a measure that Congress should enact before adjourning this year, and am pleased that we have been able to move forward on this important piece of legislation. 
   For a number of years, great strides have been made by providers of direct broadcast satellite to compete for customers with cable, the traditional provider of multichannel video services. Congress recognized this marketplace development and the necessity to update the rules of the road to advance such competition. 
   Satellite television providers have a unique product to offer, and more and more consumers are opting for television via satellite, including my own son Chet. During a visit in his home, I learned firsthand just what this debate is all about. So I disagree with those who say this is just a broadcaster bill or this is just a satellite bill. Clearly, both sides had to compromise, and the end result is one that is fair to the various industry segments. 
   As always, when dealing with such contentious issues in the legislative process as were confronted in this measure, the competing interests of several parties had to be balanced. A number of compromises were reached, and the bill considered by the full Senate today will be good for consumers and good for competition. 
   This bill allows, for the first time ever, satellite providers to offer local signals in local markets. Consumers value their local signals. They want to see their local news, their local weather, their local sports. Promoting localism was a goal of the conferees, while at the same time giving the satellite industry the tools it needed to grow its business. This provision will go a long way toward freeing satellite providers to compete head-on with cable for customers who want their local signals, or to provide service in many areas where cable is not even an available option. 
   This measure will not only boost competition in the multichannel video marketplace, but will also ensure that consumers are not stranded in a catch-22, without service. I know many of my colleagues, myself included, heard from literally hundreds of thousands of constituents across the country. Constituents who had, in good faith, subscribed to satellite television. Constituents who were about to lose, or had already lost, their distant network programming channels, through no fault of their own. S. 1948 includes a reasonable, balanced approach to restore eligibility for many of these subscribers, while preventing further pending shut-offs. 
   Other consumer friendly provisions were adopted. An improved model to more accurately predict eligibility to receive distant network signals from a satellite provider. Increased certainty in the waiver process when dealing with their local broadcasters. 
   I feel very strongly that consumers should not be put in a bind again by being sold a service, only to have it taken away. 
   The revised rules of the road will help level the playing field for the direct broadcast satellite industry as well. Copyright rates are slashed. Existing satellite copyright compulsory licenses are extended for 5 years. A 90-day waiting period to begin serving current cable customers who want to switch to satellite is eliminated. And the FCC will be required to review the distant signal eligibility standard and recommend improvements to Congress. The compromise also allows for a phase-in period for obtaining permission to bring local signals into markets, so that consumers and local stations benefit from local-into-local as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, the offering of local-into-local is an expensive undertaking. Many of my colleagues in Congress, particularly those who represent rural states, recognize that economics will drive local-into-local into larger, urban markets first. They wonder whether rural and small markets will receive this service. 
   While debating the merits of the overall bill, this legitimate concern was raised. A concern that I share as well. I want my constituents to be able to choose a satellite provider for television without having to sacrifice watching their local broadcast stations. The largest designated market area in my home state of Mississippi is Jackson, which ranks number 89 out of more than 200 designated market areas. Satellite providers have clearly indicated they are likely to offer this new service in the top 60 to 70 markets. This translates into a lack of comparable choices for my constituents, and for millions of other Americans across the country. So this is an important issue that deserves the attention of Congress. 
   From the beginning, Senator BURNS has been the champion of the idea of a loan guarantee program to foster the development of systems to deliver local-into-local in rural and small market areas. Although a number of Senators have stood up to talk about how important this program is for their respective states, it has been Senator BURNS who has stood firm and fought for this program. 
   It is Senator BURNS who is responsible for establishing the process for the full Senate to consider the loan guarantee proposal early next year. 
   I also want to thank Senator GRAMM, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate's Banking Committee, for his cooperation in moving this legislation forward. 
   Based on my conversations with him and other Members, I was pleased that a unanimous consent agreement was reached. This agreement requires that a loan guarantee bill be reported to the Senate by March 30, 2000. It is my intention to get this provision enacted into law soon thereafter. 
   Mr. President, I want to be clear. This unanimous consent agreement does not delay the implementation of the loan guarantee program. In fact, Senator BURNS' proposal, if passed today, would still be subject to Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations anyway. So the earliest this program could take effect under any scenario is in Fiscal Year 2001. The agreed upon schedule for consideration of the loan guarantee authorization is consistent with the appropriations timetable. 
   So, I believe the right incentives are in place to timely act on this matter when the Senate reconvenes next year. And I hope we can all work together, from both sides of the aisle. Without this kind of incentive, millions of Americans could be left behind. 
   Mr. President, the participation of Members was integral in bringing this bill to fruition. I want to commend Senator HATCH, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for his leadership and determination to complete the Senate and House negotiations on this legislation. He worked diligently for weeks, dealing with major competing interests to achieve a balanced policy. Senator HATCH, Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Congressman Bliley, Chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and Congressman Hyde, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, along with all of the other Members of the conference, contributed greatly to the process, and I am grateful to them for their service. 
   This bill would not have been completed without the dedicated efforts  and countless long hours of negotiation among staff. Their hard work is very much appreciated, and I want to take a moment to recognize who they are: Monica Azare, Ed Barron, Pete Belvin, Renee Bennett, Shawn Bentley, Benjamin Cline, Tony Coe, Manus Cooney, Colin Crowell, Troy Dow, Jon Dudas, Julian Epstein, Paula Ford, Doug Farry, Bob Foster, Mitch Glazier, Jim Hippe, Tim Kurth, Jon Leibowitz, Peter Levitas, Andy Levin, Justin Lilley, Garry Malphrus, Maureen McLaughlin, Mark Monson, Ann Morton, Al Mottur, Mitch Rose, Jim Sartucci, Jonathan Schwantes, and Alison Vinson. 
   Mr. President, this bill is an improvement over the current state of play in today's multichannel video marketplace. It is not perfect, but it is a positive step forward in advancing competition among industries and choice for consumers.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as we end this session of the 106th Congress, it is appropriate to reflect on what we have accomplished and what remains to be done. In particular, Mr. President, I would like to focus on our efforts to enact Superfund reform. 
   As my colleagues know, I have fought for many Congresses to free our nation's recyclers from needless Superfund liability. I could not be more pleased to finally accomplish this goal by including the text of mine and Senator DASCHLE's bill, S. 1528, in this year's final appropriations package. I know many of you, on both sides of the aisle, join me in celebrating this long-awaited reform of an unfair system. 
   However, our work is not done, Mr. President. Like the recyclers, thousands of small businesses are needlessly dragged into the Superfund web each year. Although Superfund is intended to clean up the nation's hazardous waste sites, small businesses are being sued for simply throwing out their trash. Certainly we can all agree that potato peels and cardboard boxes are far from toxic waste. 
   Yet, another year has gone by without reform for small business. In that year, 165 small businesses in Quincy, Illinois were forced to pay over $3 million for legally sending trash to the local landfill. In that year, Administrator Browner again publicly stated her desire to get small businesses out of Superfund. In that year, reform efforts were again stymied by those who want to hold incremental reforms hostage to comprehensive fixes. 
   Mr. President, we had the opportunity this year to enact targeted Superfund reform for small businesses, but we did not do so. Senators and Congressmen on both sides of the aisle, as well as the EPA, agree that we should provide the relief so desperately needed by the small business community. For nearly a decade, inaction has left thousands of small business owners with no choice but to mortgage their businesses, their employees and their future to pay for damage they did not do. Small businesses struggle to survive under the threat of thousands of dollars in penalties and lawsuits--all for legally disposing of their garbage. 
   That's why, Mr. President, I will continue to work to free innocent small businesses from Superfund liability. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in the continued fight for fair treatment of the small businesses that keep our nation's economy strong.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, S. 1528, is being sent to the President as part of H.R. 3194. This is a great day for environmental law--this is the day that the public policy restores recycling as a rewarded, rather than punished activity. 
   This is a great day because partisan feuding was set aside so that the Congress could find a realistic, incremental, and common sense environmental fix. The freestanding Superfund Recycling Equity Act has strong bipartisan support with 68 cosponsors--68 Senators who have worked together to advance a fix to a small piece of the Superfund debate. 
   In this controversial world of environmental legislation it is rare that the leaders of the two parties in either Congressional body would agree on a piece of legislation. Well, here in the Senate we do. I wish to thank Minority Leader DASCHLE who understood the merits of recycling and twice joined with me to sponsor this legislation. Without his leadership, this legislation would not have been possible. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to commend the Senators who originally joined Senator DASCHLE and me in introducing this legislation. Senators WARNER and LINCOLN, who sponsored this measure in a previous Congress, have long exhibited their enthusiasm for fixing recycling rules. They are true leaders--leaders who have fostered this reasonable, workable, environmental proposal. Senator BAUCUS, the Ranking Minority Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has also been an avid supporter of recycling by including a version of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act in his comprehensive Superfund reform bill in the 103rd Congress. His six years of leadership in trying to fix public policy for recyclers is appreciated.  
   Mr. President, this bill would not be where it is at today, on the cusp of becoming law, had it not been for the active support of the late Senator John Chafee--a dear friend to me and many of our colleagues. John Chafee was a respected leader of the Environment and Public Works Committee. His advice and counsel helped shape my bill and he was an original cosponsor. I am proud to have been associated with him on this bill and its legislative process. I consider it a tribute that this bipartisan bill, negotiated with the Administration, representatives of the national environmental community, and the recycling industry, was supported by John Chafee, a man for whom consensus was so important. I believe this is not a footnote to John Chafee's legacy; rather I believe that he made this kind of cooperation possible. 
   The former mayor of Warwick, Rhode Island, is now the newly appointed Senator from Rhode Island. I have already had an opportunity to hear our newest senator--Senator LINCOLN CHAFEE--tell me about what Warwick has done with regards to recycling. It is a proud record--a record that would be extended and enhanced by this bill. I find it a credit to John Chafee's legacy that his son would be working with me on this legislation. Less than a month in the Senate and already LINCOLN's voice is being heard in ways that will directly help Rhode Island. 
   Mr. President, I also must recognize the vision of trade associations like American Petroleum Institute and National Federation of Independent Businesses for supporting an incremental solution. It would have been easier for these groups to oppose the bill because it did not address all the fixes for which they have been advocating. However, AFI and NFIB recognized that this increment would not jeopardize their efforts; rather it exemplifies the efforts of various stakeholders to accomplish something positive for the environment albeit it incremental. 
   And finally, I must thank the various staff members who have diligently worked toward the passage of this legislation: Eric Washburn and Peter Hanson of Senator DASCHLE's staff, Tom Gibson and Barbara Rogers of the Environment and Public Works committee staff, Charles Barnett of Senator LINCOLN's staff, Ann Loomis of Senator WARNER's staff, and my former staffer, Kristy Simms, who set the stage for this years success. 
   While too often Senators have seen various interest groups tell Congress why we cannot achieve some worthy environmental goal, the history of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act is replete with evidence of people coming together to correct a problem. Everyone, including myself, realizes that comprehensive reform is necessary to fix the vast array of problems in many different sectors of the environmental community. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world, so Congress must do what is achievable whenever it is possible. This is good public policy --increments will show all parties there is a bridge for bipartisan environmental fixes. Recycling is the first of many necessary fixes, and I would bet my colleagues that it will not be the last fix. 
   This is a great day for many environmental groups who saw a change that they supported, not be taken hostage by the debate that has for so many years paralyzed reforms to Superfund. The original 
   negotiation that resulted in the basis of the bill was tough and long--but it was fair. Each of the negotiating partners left items on the table that they would have wanted in an otherwise perfect world. Their collective approach was always bipartisan--they never pitted one party against another by pledging one group of interests against another. They remained loyal to their agreement for an unheard of five years--an eternity in Washington. Though this legislation was a long time in coming, I am grateful for its passage. 
   Mr. President, this is a great day for my good friend and fellow Mississippian, Phillip Morris. It is also a great day for the thousands of mom-and-pop recycling firms across America, like the one owned by Phillip Morris. This legislation protects the legacy of these firms which in most cases have been handed down through generations--often started by new immigrants to America nearly a hundred years ago. This ends the long Superfund nightmare that our nation's recyclers have suffered. Each time they sold their recyclable products they were, unintentionally, exposing themselves to costly Superfund liability. Removing Superfund as an impediment to recycling is a predicate to higher recycling rates throughout the nation. 
   The Superfund Equity Act is not about special interests getting a fix. No, this bill is about representing constituent interests throughout America and promoting the public interest. That is why Senator DASCHLE and I have 68 cosponsors--cosponsors that range completely across the liberal and conservative political spectrum, and range across all regions of America. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act corrects a mistake nobody intended to make. When the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) was enacted in 1980, there was no suggestion that traditional recyclables--paper, plastic, glass, metal, textiles, and rubber were ever intended to be subject to Superfund liability. As a result of court interpretations, however, the sale of recyclables as manufacturing feedstock was considered to be arranging for the disposal of the material and, therefore, subject to Superfund's liability scheme. However, as we have all come to know as a matter of public policy, recycling is not disposal; it is the exact opposite of disposal. 
   Mr. President, let me say that again--recycling is not disposal, and a law is needed to remove this confusion. Sad, but true. 
   Enactment of this legislation clarifies this point and corrects the misinterpretations that have cost recyclers--primarily small family-owned businesses--millions and millions of dollars for problems they did not cause. With passage of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, the costs of cleanup at sites that utilize recyclable materials as feedstock will be borne, rightfully, by those persons who actually cause or contribute to the pollution. As a result, those facilities will be less likely to cause contamination because they will no longer have recyclers to help them pay for Superfund cleanup. That's a powerful market incentive and will cause the consuming facility to become more environmentally conscientious. 
   Let me be clear, this legislation will not alter the basic tenants of environmental law--polluters will still pay. This legislation does not relieve recyclers of Superfund liability where they have polluted their own facilities. It also does not protect these businesses when they have sent materials destined for disposal to landfills or other facilities where those materials contributed, in whole or in part, to the pollution of those facilities. Furthermore, the public can expect recyclers to continue to be environmentally vigilant because they must operate their businesses in an environmentally sound manner, in order to be relieved of Superfund liability. 
   Today is a victory for coalition building that avoids the attack strategies that are so often employed by trade associations in DC. I hope they see the wisdom in building coalitions around achievable increments. This is how Congress can move forward. This is how Congress shows that it not only hears from its constituents but it acts successfully. Hostage taking, distortion, and scorch the earth approaches are not productive legislative strategies or lobbying tactics. Trade associations need to seek achievable solutions, develop responsible legislative goals, and avoid Beltway attack politics. I am extremely pleased that Congress has been able to take this tiny but very important step forward in reforming the Superfund law. I hope this accomplishment will inspire others to work for sensible, incremental solutions that help both our environment and our nation's economy. 
   I am proud that today Congress leveled the playing field and created equity in the statutory treatment of recycled material and virgin materials. I am proud to have removed the disincentives to recycling without loosening any existing liability laws for polluters. I am proud to have represented the mom and pop recyclers across America. I'm especially proud of the fact that this was all done in a bipartisan manner.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today concludes a grueling debate on the state of the dairy industry. Though the process was long and often times quite confusing, I think the Senate has come to an agreement on a package that will prove to be beneficial to most interested parties at this time. 
   Mr. President, I must say this process would not have been possible without the diligent work of one of my former staffers, Congressman CHIP PICKERING. I have always said ``once a Lott staffer, always a Lott staffer.'' Although CHIP has moved on to represent the people of the third district of Mississippi, he continues to constantly be of great help to me, and to always keep the best interest of the entire state of Mississippi at heart. 
   CHIP believes that Option 1A is absolutely essential for allowing most dairies in Mississippi and outside the upper Midwest to remain in business, and he worked with me to see that this legislation was put into law. He organized House members from across the country to fight in order to see that the crucial dairy language we needed became law this year. 
   CHIP realizes Option 1A is the only way the interests of Mississippi's dairy farmers can be protected. Having grown up working on his family's dairy farm, meeting with dairy farmers across Mississippi, and working with Mississippi Farm Bureau, CHIP knows the importance of this legislation to the survival of dairy farms and to the continued fresh supply of milk for all Mississippians. I thank Congressman PICKERING for his relentless efforts on behalf of Mississippi dairy farmers.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate has been considering this bankruptcy bill as the main Senate business since November 4, 1999, after a failed cloture  vote in September. There have been dozen of votes conducted with respect to this issue, and yet there are still at least a dozen amendments pending to be offered, debated, and voted upon. It is with this in mind that I need to file this cloture motion on the bill in order to ensure we get a final vote, and that will be available when we come back after the first of the year. 
   A lot of good work has been done on this bill on both sides, by the managers of the legislation and a number of Senators who have worked on it--Senator GRASSLEY, Senator HATCH, Senator SESSIONS, on our side; Senator TORRICELLI, on the other side, has been involved; Senator LEAHY has worked on this. So there is a lot of work that has been done and a lot of relevant amendments that have been voted on. 
   I want to particularly note the good work of Senator REID because he began with, I don't know, probably over 100 amendments.

   Mr. LOTT. Three hundred amendments. I do not understand how the fertile minds of the Senate can be so productive to produce 300 amendments on a bill such as this that has been already marked up in committee. Then we got it down to 36, and it continued to be narrowed. 
   I hope when we come back after the first of the year something can be worked out where it will not be necessary to go forward with this. But I do believe there is a necessity to have this protection so that we will have this option of cloture so we can complete the bill, if there is no other way to do it when we come back after the first of the year.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me observe one of the problems we had in not being able to complete it even this week. While the sponsors of some of the amendments had indicated--or maybe all the amendments--indicated a willingness to have limited time agreements, we had, I know, at least a couple of Senators on this side who were not willing to agree to limit the time, therefore possibly tying up half a day or a day one a couple of these amendments. 
   We may still be able to work out something where we could have a short time agreed to on both sides and get a vote after the first of the year. But you reach a point, in the final days of a session, where motions are such that you just cannot get that kind of agreement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the second session of the 106th Congress will convene, then, at 12 noon on Monday, January 24. We do not yet have absolute certainty that there will be a State of the Union Address the next night, although it is preliminary indicated. I believe that is the date we would expect to have a State of the Union Address; that is, Tuesday, the 25th. That could be postponed upon a request from the White House, but we will need to be back and in business in order to be here for that date. 
   So there will be a need for a live quorum to establish the beginning of the second session on Monday. A period of morning business will commence for the remainder of that day. And this 12 noon cloture vote on Tuesday, January 25, would be the first vote of the second session of the 106th Congress. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for their continued cooperation and wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. 
   Let me say, too, we have a number of bills that are in conference now. I had an opportunity to discuss the schedule for next year, or some of the bills for next year, with the President. We have a number of bills that are in a position where we could get early agreement out of conference, including the trade bill on which we worked so hard. We spent 2 weeks getting that out for Africa and CBI. We could have maybe even done it this week but we had so many things we were working on we could not get that completed. 
   We have the FAA reauthorization bill that good work has been done on, and a series of bills, including the juvenile justice bill, which we hope we can get early in the session next year. So we will continue to work on that. 
   I understand we are about ready to do a series of energy bills. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize my Legislative Fellow, Steven Apicella, who will be leaving the LOTT staff, my team, at the end of this session. 
   I must admit, when Steven first joined us, I was not sure who he was or why he was lurking in my meetings. However, I quickly learned that thanks to the wisdom of my Chief of staff and then Legislative Director, the Department of Energy had lent me and Mississippi one of their best. 
   Over the past twenty months, Steven has become an indispensable part of my legislative shop. He has worked hard on a broad range of issues--each time jumping in feet first, soaking up knowledge, and moving legislation forward in this often complicated process. 
   Steven began his Capitol Hill experience during the lengthy and grueling TEA-21 negotiations. He quickly realized my transportation priorities for my home state of Mississippi, and was helpful in making sure these issues were not ignored. During these long hours spent hammering out the details of TEA-21, Steven earned the respect of staff, as well as mine. 
   Steven advised me on a variety of high-tech issues, and was an active participant of the team which formulated a focus for the Republican Technology Task Force. He worked with the staffs of several of my colleagues to reach a consensus--often not an easy task. 
   Steven has also been very diligent in advancing a meaningful and updated encryption policy--one that balances national security, law enforcement and trade interests. He continually made sure that all parties realized that these are not mutually exclusive priorities. Steven detected this significant issue and was responsible for bringing it to my attention and guiding me as the bill worked its way through the Commerce committee. 
   Digital signatures is another issue Steven has aggressively pursued. He played an active role in getting the government portion of the legislation enacted into law last Congress, and worked extensively toward today's Senate passage of this needed opportunity for the private sector. 
   An important service on behalf of the State of Mississippi has been Steven's diligence on national parks legislation. This year Steven was very helpful in preparing two bills that I introduced in this area--one to add the battlefield at Corinth as part of the Shiloh National Park, and another to begin the planning for the designation of the Vicksburg Campaign Trail. On each of these bills, Steven worked effectively with the Senate committee of jurisdiction and was responsible for getting the funds authorized before introduction. I am happy to say that today those bills passed the Senate by unanimous consent. 
   Finally, with Steven's help I again fought the uphill battle of Title Branding. Steven worked with and strengthened a large, bipartisan effort to draft and support legislation to brand the titles of severely damaged salvaged vehicles, so consumers will be able to identify potentially dangerous used cars before they are purchased. Steven searched for a compromise, and constantly pushed the envelope of consensus. Steven tirelessly championed this pro-consumer bill and his efforts brought it to the threshold of Senate passage. 
   Although Steven was assigned areas which were outside the realm of his ``parent'' employer, Department of Energy--he has been an excellent ambassador. He has helped the staff understand the intricacies of the agency and appreciate its problems. As Steven returns to his duties at DOE, I hope his experiences and the skills and contacts he has developed while serving as a part of my staff will serve him well. 
   Over the past several years, I have been privileged to have the services of legislative fellows, to provide stellar support for my efforts. Steven has been fantastic. I thank Steven for his dedication and determination, and I thank DOE for their patience--I'm sure they are ready to have him back, working his magic there. I wish Steven, and his son Jarrett, Godspeed in their future endeavors.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator DASCHLE for his work on this next group of bills. It involves a number of energy-related, water-related bills out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I also want to recognize Senator MURKOWSKI, the chairman of the committee. 
   These are quite often considered to be small bills, but to a number of areas or States or Senators, they are very big in importance. Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator BINGAMAN have worked feverishly to try to get through a number of problems. It is one of those classic cases where you have one problem that develops with a bill; then it affects other bills. Senator DASCHLE took the time and the lead in working through some of these problems. I want to recognize the work he did. 
   I also commit publicly on the record to proceed to S. 1051, the Northern Marianas bill, by February 15. We would have liked to have been able to go ahead and get a complete unanimous consent about the total arrangements for it being handled, but Senators who did have questions are now probably on airplanes headed halfway across the country. We will work together. I will make a commitment to bring this up by the 15th. 
   Does Senator DASCHLE want to make any comment on that?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on December 31, 1999, Steve Bale will retire as Keeper of the Stationery for the United States Senate. 
   Steve began his Senate career in November 1969 as a clerk in the Stationery Room. In July 1980, he was appointed Assistant Keeper of the Stationery, and in September 1987, assumed the responsibilities as the 16th Keeper of the Stationery. 
   In this capacity, Steve has directed a busy operation, successfully serving a client base that now spans over 240 offices and five buildings. His leadership of the recent renovations to the Stationery Room has ensured that the office will function efficiently, well into the 21st century. 
   In his 30 years of public service. Steve has set a standard among his associates for commitment to excellence and dedication to personal service. According to his staff, one of Steve's favorite expressions is, ``In this business, one `oops' can wipe out fifteen `attaboys'!'' The standard of excellence he set will benefit the Senate for years to come, as the associates he leaves behind continue in the tradition of the principles he espoused. 
   Steve Bale should enter his retirement with tremendous satisfaction for all he has accomplished. I am pleased to join so many others in thanking him for his long and faithful service and in wishing him health and happiness in the years to come.

   Mr. LOTT. I have not propounded a unanimous consent request other than to proceed to the short-term continuing resolution so that Senator BYRD may begin to discuss an issue of concern to a number of Senators. I intended to talk to the Senator from Montana and others about trying to enter into an agreement with regard to time. 
   On the issue to which he referred, I think it is very important that we do take action in this final bill we will be taking up in the next day or so, or today, that will make sure the satellite bill is passed so that people across this country will continue to receive service from the networks on their television sets in the future in order to have this so-called local-to-local service where you get your local station on your local satellite. We are going to have to have some process, some way to get that service into rural areas and smaller areas such as those in Montana, Alaska, and in Mississippi. I am committed to getting that done. So is the Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS. We are going to get that done. 
   We are going to have to have a very carefully thought out loan guarantee system that will get the satellites up, to get the towers that are necessary to make sure that that is done. The problem we have, as with so many other issues we have been dealing with in the last week, is getting all of that done in the last few hours to make sure we get it done right without the whole process being held up as we go forward. 
   I will talk to the Senator privately, but he has my assurances--Senator DASCHLE and I will put a colloquy in the RECORD--that we are going to get this done. We are going to get it done early next year. If there are dilatory tactics, we will have a bill that has been carefully massaged by all of the relevant committees, not just one. We will either get it done straight up or we will look for another vehicle. This is something to which we are committed, to which I am committed, and I know the Senator from Alaska is committed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are a number of issues we are working on, but we have one unanimous consent request with regard to the loan guarantee for the satellite local situation we have worked out. 
   I ask unanimous consent that no later than March 30, 2000, if no Senate committee has reported a bill limited to providing loan guarantees to establish local television service to rural areas by satellite and other means, the Republican leader, or his designee, or the Democratic leader, or his designee, be recognized to introduce a bill limited to sections 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 of the conference report accompanying H.R. 1554 providing such loan guarantees, and that the Senate immediately begin consideration of the bill with relevant first-degree amendments in order and second-degree amendments that are relevant to the first-degree amendment proposed to be amended. Further, that if legislation is reported that is limited to such loan guarantees, it be considered on or before March 30 and be open to relevant amendments as provided above. Further, that upon disposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time and passed, with no intervening action.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Senator reserves the right to object, I want to add my own personal comments rather than just the dry UC that I gave. 
   I, too, commend and thank the other Senator from Montana, Mr. BURNS, for his efforts in this area and for his tenacity. In fact, this very day, he ruined my lunch talking to me about this issue. I know Senator BAUCUS believes very strongly in it. 
   It is not just a Montana issue. This is important in South Dakota and this is important in Mississippi. This is important nationwide. If we are going to get this satellite local-to-local service in these smaller markets, we have to have this opportunity, but we want to make sure it is a loan guarantee that will work, that is actually going to do the job, that is not in some way going to improperly benefit any one individual or group of individuals, for that matter, and that it has been carefully thought through. 
   Again, I am absolutely determined to get this done. I will not only live up to this UC, which I have to, but I will do it with a great deal of vigor and activity. 
   I thank the Senator from Texas for his willingness to focus on this and get it done by a date certain and make sure he and other committees have added to it to make sure we do it right.

   Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that has been very  carefully worked out, and after it is agreed to, we have three colloquies that Senator DASCHLE, Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, and I would like to enter into. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to H.J. Res. 82, the continuing resolution, and following the reporting by the clerk, there be two first-degree amendments in order, and no second-degree amendments or motions to commit or recommit be in order. Those amendments are the following: 
   The Byrd-McConnell amendment regarding mining; 
   The Helms-Edwards amendment regarding disaster funds. 
   I further ask consent that following the disposition of the amendments, the joint resolution be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. 
   I further ask consent that when the Senate receives H.J. Res. 83, the joint resolution be deemed agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   Finally, I ask consent that when the Senate receives the conference report to accompany H.R. 3194, the reading of the conference report commence immediately following the motion to proceed made by the majority leader, to be followed by a vote on the motion to proceed.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we do have a colloquy we will enter into. I don't know how much debate time will be required since there was no time limitation. It is safe to say there will be a period of time for debate, so if Members want to take this time to get something to eat they will probably have the time to do so. However, I do expect after some reasonable period of time there will be a vote or votes, and, of course, we will proceed to the conference report that has been delivered to the Senate at an appropriate time so it can be read, and for a motion or votes on that. 
   One important thing I want to emphasize, the Senate can only do what the Senate can do, and then our action has to go to the House. The House must act. With regard to these continuing resolutions, they have a number of options. I personally am going to vote for the Byrd amendment. I think the Senator is entitled to make his case. I hope the House will accept that. If they don't, it will be back in another venue in another way. 
   The same thing with regard to the Helms-Edwards disaster funds. An oversight occurred, as I understand it, in the final hours last night with regard to disaster funds for North Carolina. There were about three tranches of money that had been requested for disaster assistance. Two of those were included, which come to a total of around $800 million. However, $81 million, an important tranche, was not included. Hopefully, the House will accept this and hopefully the House will see fit to accept them both. I will talk to the Speaker and encourage him to do that. 
   I want to also emphasize, as has been the case in the past when my State has been involved, when South Dakota or North Dakota has been involved, when any place is involved in a 
   disaster, they should get the assistance they need from a caring American people. That is the way we have been doing it for all the years I have been in the Congress. That is the way it is now and the way it should be. 
   If for whatever reason in this waning hour of the session this money is not made available, I am committed publicly, along with Senator DASCHLE and the chairman of the committee, that this money will be provided. It will be provided in the first available vehicle after the first of the year, and I presume that will be in a supplemental because there will be a supplemental available, and with the commitment of the chairman and the commitment of the leaders and also the commitment of the American people, those funds will be available. I want to make that part of the RECORD at this point. 
   I yield the floor for others to respond.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am proud to add the American Automobile Association (AAA) and the California DMV to the long list of organizations that support S. 655, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act that I introduced during this session to protect consumers from title fraud. 
   Other supporters of my title branding legislation include the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), state DMV directors around the country, the Michigan Secretary of State and other Secretaries of State, the International Union of Police Associations AFL-CIO, International Association of Auto Theft Investigators, National Odometer and Title Fraud Enforcement Association, American Automobile Manufacturers Association, Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, National Automobile Dealers Association, National Association of Minority Automobile Dealers, National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, Honda North America, Nissan North America, Carfax, CarMax, American Service Industry Association, American Automotive Leasing Association, American Car Rental Association, American Salvage Pool Association, Automotive Engine Rebuilders Association, Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association, National Association of Fleet Resale Dealers, National Auto Auction Association, and State Farm Insurance. 
   I also think it is worth recognizing 23 of our colleagues who have actively signaled their intention to protect motorists in their state and throughout the nation by formally supporting S. 655. Senators MCCAIN, BREAUX, STEVENS, CONRAD, BURNS, HUTCHISON, FRIST, ABRAHAM, MACK, WARNER, BENNETT, SESSIONS, MURKOWSKI, SHELBY, INHOFE, GRAMS, THOMAS, ROBERTS, HATCH, THOMPSON, ENZI, KYL, and HUTCHINSON are to be commended for cosponsoring this important consumer protection measure. 
   The American Automobile Association represents over 40 million drivers. It is a nonpartisan organization that champions the interests of the driving public in virtually every city, county, and state across this great land. AAA supports S. 655 because it shares my belief that national standards for titling salvage, rebuilt salvage, non-repairable and flood damaged vehicles will help prevent the fraudulent sale of damaged vehicles and protect consumers from unknowingly purchasing them. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print AAA's letter of support for S. 655 in the RECORD.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, my goal from the outset has been to protect used car buyers from title fraud. The solution I proposed was simple, straightforward, and modeled after the recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration, and Salvage Advisory Committee. S..655 merely establishes model uniform definitions and disclosure requirements for four basic terms: salvage; rebuilt salvage; flood; and nonrepairable vehicles. Under the legislation reported out by the Senate Commerce Committee, states would be free to utilize additional terms and to provide additional disclosures beyond those provided for in this bill. States that choose to adopt 
   the four uniform terms and related provisions would be eligible for incentive grants. No state  would be penalized for non-participation or for retaining different standards. 
   While there is substantial and broad support for this much needed legislation, there continues to be resistance to moving forward with this legislation in the Senate. Unfortunately, this resistance has the effect of allowing unsuspecting consumers to continue to purchase and drive potentially life-threatening vehicles. Delaying this legislation will cost used car buyers another $4 billion this year and place millions of structurally unsafe vehicles back on America's roads and highways. Roads that our family, friends, and neighbors share every day. 
   Even though S. 655 has wide-spread support and follows the recommendations of the Congressionally-chartered Salvage Advisory Committee, a few groups have attempted to undermine this measure at every stage of the process. Unfortunately, these groups seemed to have convinced some of my colleagues that it is better to delay the implementation of clearly needed consumer protections and continue to press for the imposition of untried, untested and in many cases anti-consumer requirements. Requirements that states have rejected time and again. Provisions that focus on post-purchase redress rather than pre-purchase disclosure. Definitions and standards that would perpetuate confusion rather than promote uniformity among the states, undermining the very purpose of this legislation. These groups claim to have the interests of consumers in mind, yet the best representative of car-buying consumers, the American Automobile Association, has rejected their approach and supports passage of S. 655. 
   As I am sure my colleagues will agree, advancing titling definitions and standards that states have rejected, and will continue to reject, will only exacerbate title fraud. Such an approach only benefits those who prey on unsuspecting car buyers and would jeopardize the minimum standards required to make the program work, unnecessarily harm many vehicle owners and buyers by needlessly reducing the value of their vehicles, create unreasonable or untested standards, foster unnecessary litigation, impinge on states rights, and promote a scheme that states will reject. 
   During the 104th and 105th Congresses, this was a bipartisan, better yet nonpartisan, initiative. My only interest has been to protect consumers by encouraging the use of minimal uniform disclosure standards for severely damaged vehicles--those involved in a serious accident, severely damaged by falling objects, or vehicles that have sustained significant and lingering water damage. Whether the used car buyer is in Mississippi, California, Nevada, Minnesota, or in any other state, he or she needs the pre-purchase disclosure information that S. 655 would provide. 
   I have made every effort to reach consensus on this legislation. In that vein, a number of changes were incorporated throughout the legislative process to address the concerns of State attorneys general, certain consumer groups, and many of my colleagues. The latest version of this legislation incorporates the full range of changes that DMV administrators, including California's Administrator, believe are practicable. The substitute makes it very clear that there is no preemption of state law. The substitute also mirrors much of the State of California's current titling requirements, ensuring that minimal change will be required by our largest state should it choose to apply for the bill's grant monies. 
   Mr. President, even though I have made numerous compromises on this legislation, the goal post continues to move further away. Instead of gaining acceptance, I was recently presented with yet another round of proposed modifications. AAMVA reviewed these proposed changes and determined they would eviscerate the purpose of this legislation. AAMVA opposes these additional changes because they could potentially harm the very people this legislation aims to protect, create a mountain of unnecessary paperwork, and would create a substantial amount of bureaucracy with no added value. 
   It makes no sense to adopt provisions that the experts on titling matters believe are harmful to used car consumers, the very people this balanced legislation aims to protect. AAMVA, Secretaries of State, local and state law enforcement, state legislators, and the automotive and insurance industries have repeatedly pronounced their support for S. 655. AAA and the California DMV also agree that my substitute bill is the right legislative solution. 
   Mr. President, if we do not pass this legislation, the real loser is the unfortunate used car buyer in these and other states who unknowingly purchases a wreck on wheels, perhaps a previously totaled government crash test vehicle. Every day that Congress fails to act on this prudent title branding legislation, thousands of individuals are harmed and millions of dollars are lost to the unscrupulous practice of title laundering. Let's pass this bill now.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, perhaps my colleagues have already noticed that the Senate seems to be extraordinarily well organized and effective today and there is a reason for that. With apologies from the Chaplain and the majority leader, I think we should note that a significant milestone in the 210-year course of the Senate's history is taking place. Never before has a team composed entirely of women Members and staff opened the day's proceedings. Today's remarkable occasion reminds Members how much the Senate's collective face has changed and improved in recent years. 
   The Senate has benefited from the service of 27 female Senators since the Honorable Rebecca Felton of Georgia first held that position on November 21, 1922, and particularly since 1932, when Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the Senate. While Senator Felton served only 2 days, Ms. Caraway's service continued until 1945, and she became the first woman to chair a Senate Committee. 
   Another pioneering woman Senator was Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, and the Presiding Officer today, Senator COLLINS, also hails from that State of Maine. Mrs. Smith joined the Senate in 1949 and served until 1973. During her distinguished career, she openly criticized the tactics of fellow Senator Joseph McCarthy in a 1950 speech entitled ``A Declaration of Conscience,'' and became a Presidential candidate in 1964--partially, I believe, because of that famous speech. 
   Following in these formidable steps was Nancy Landon Kassebaum, now the wife of former Senator and majority leader, Howard Baker of Tennessee. Her nearly 20-year career in the Senate became a model for many women to come. My first few months as majority leader involved a lot of issues but one of them is the now famous Kassebaum-Kennedy bill with regard to portable health issues. She was determined that before she left the Senate she was going to leave an indelible mark, and she did for many reasons but for that piece of legislation in particular. 
   In January 1993 as the Senators of the 103rd Congress took the oath of office, an unprecedented six women assumed their place on the floor. Since that time, the number of women Senators has grown to nine. 
   In recent years, the role of women officers has continued to grow, as well. In 1985, Jo-Anne Coe became the first woman to serve as Secretary of the Senate. In 1991, Martha Pope became the first female Sergeant at Arms. In 1995, Elizabeth Letchworth became the first Secretary of the majority for the Republicans and presently still holds that position. Currently, women serve as: Assistant Secretary (Sharon Zelaska), Deputy Sergeant at Arms (Loretta Symms), Assistant Parliamentarian (Elizabeth MacDonough), Assistant Journal Clerk (Myra Baran), Assistant Legislative Clerk (Kathie Alvarez), Bill Clerk (Mary Anne Clarkson), Assistant Secretary for the Minority (Lula Davis), and Republican Floor Assistant (Laura Martin). They all do a fantastic job, and we appreciate their service so much. They have been involved in a lot of activities in the last year, some of it they would just as soon have been able to miss, but they have done a great job every time they have been called upon. 
   Over the years, the Senate has changed as an ever-increasing number of women ran for and were elected to public office. Since the end of World War II, there has been a steady increase in the number of women serving this institution as legislative clerks and other appointed officials. This is a historic day and a long time in coming--too long. I am proud it happened under my watch. 
   To the women in the Chamber today and all of those who serve elsewhere in the Senate, let me take a moment to say thank you and extend my personal best wishes to all of our leaders, women officers of the Senate, and remind people just how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the bankruptcy reform legislation with up to 4 hours of debate on the Hatch amendment No. 2771 regarding drugs. I must say to my colleagues, this bill is moving very slowly. The Democratic leader and I, TOM DASCHLE, have agreed we would let the amendments go forward and let the Members have an opportunity to work their will, but we also want to get this important legislation passed; our intent is to get it done today. As with other bills, we are going to stick with this. If I have to file cloture to bring it to conclusion, I will do that. I have avoided doing that because I want to show good faith and trust that Senators will stick to the issue and find a way to complete the legislation. We cannot leave it on the sidetrack indefinitely or have it tie up the Senate's time much longer because we have a number of bills we need to pass today, tonight, Friday, or whenever we are going to wrap up this session. 
   Following the use or yielding back of that debate time on amendment No. 2771, the Senate will proceed to at least three stacked rollcall votes beginning with the Hatch amendment, to be followed with votes on the nominations of Carol Moseley-Braun and Linda Morgan. Those votes are expected to occur between 12 and 1 p.m. at the latest. I hope it can actually occur earlier because we do have some conflicts of which we are trying to be cognizant. 
   Senators who have amendments pending to the bill or amendments they expect to offer are encouraged to work with the bill's managers so those amendments can be disposed of in a timely manner. I hope a large number of them will be accepted or withdrawn. Senators can expect votes to occur  throughout today's session and into the evening. 
   For the information of all Senators, progress has been made on the appropriations bills. It is hoped the Senate can vote on the remaining appropriations today or early next week. I realize that doesn't please a lot of Senators, but while I think great progress has been made, and I did have occasion to talk to the President a few minutes ago, I think now our biggest problem is just the physical ability to get the paperwork done and the House vote, and then have it come to the Senate and complete action. 
   However, the Senate has been known to act with lightning speed when it makes up its mind. I hope we can do that this time. 
   Thanks again to the women officers of the Senate for the work they do and for being here today. I hope we can keep Members in place the rest of the day and we can wrap this up by sundown. 
   I yield the floor.

   I ask consent that following the continuing resolution, the pending Kohl amendment No. 2516 be modified to reflect the text of amendment No. 2518 and that it be in order for the majority manager of the bill to withdraw the second degree amendment No. 2518, and Senators HUTCHISON and BROWNBACK be recognized to offer a second degree amendment and there be 1 hour for debate, equally divided in the usual form, and no other second degree amendments be in order to amendment No. 2516. 
   I further ask consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the Hutchison amendment to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the first degree amendment, as amended, if amended, following the conclusion or yielding back of time. 
   I further ask consent that following the votes just described, Senator WELLSTONE be recognized to offer his amendment relative to agriculture. 
   Finally, I ask consent that following the votes relative to the Hutchison amendment, all amendments relative to homestead be withdrawn.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Minnesota. He has been waiting a long time to get this opportunity. We told him he would get it, and he has it. 
   For the information of all Senators, the Senate will now debate the pending Wellstone agriculture amendment. However, no further votes will occur this evening. I want to make that clear. We will hotline both sides so our Members will know there are no further votes this evening. 
   The Senate will not be in session on Veterans Day, and we will convene next on Tuesday, November 16. On Tuesday, I expect the Senate to debate and possibly complete action on any number of items arriving from the House of Representatives relative to the appropriations process and perhaps other conference reports. I will be discussing the specifics of what the schedule will be with Senator DASCHLE, and we will keep Members informed of the subject matter. 
   By a previous order, the Senate will conduct a vote relative to the Wellstone agriculture amendment on Wednesday of next week. I suspect additional votes will be required in order to finish the necessary items pending between the two Houses of Congress. The continuing resolution we passed will expire at midnight on Wednesday. I think that will give the Senate more than enough time for final negotiations to be completed, for the House to act, for the package to be received in the Senate, and complete action on Wednesday. However, that is a deadline I believe we can meet, and we should work to complete our work for the year by then. 
   We will let Senators know, of course, if there is to be a big package of votes during the day on Wednesday. We will notify Senators exactly what time that will be. Senators should be prepared for the voting to begin as early as 10 o'clock on Wednesday on the Wellstone amendment. 
   I urge all Senators to be patient and accommodating during the next few days of the session. I thank all Members in advance for their cooperation. 
   We have a number of nominations we have been working assiduously to clear on both sides of the aisle. These are judicial nominations and other nominations. We have a couple more issues we have to check on to confirm everything we agreed to has been worked out. Also, Senator DASCHLE and I have talked at great length about how to handle the judicial calendar. I think we have a fair arrangement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator COCHRAN and I are pleased to announce that the University of Mississippi, which we fondly refer to as Ole Miss, will be hosting the final broadcast of the Emmy-winning PBS program ``Firing Line.'' Senator COCHRAN and I want to join the University of Mississippi in congratulating all those affiliated with ``Firing Line,'' including its host, Mr. William F. Buckley, Jr., and its producer, Mr. Warren Steibel, for their outstanding accomplishments during 34 years of telecasts. Since 1966, Mr. Buckley and Mr. Steibel have given the American public an opportunity to make informed decisions on the important topics of the day by bringing all angles of an issue to the surface through their lively debates. No public affairs program in history has run longer with the same host. 
   Firing Line has brought a wide range of topics to the forefront since joining the PBS family on May 26, 1971, including ``Separation of Church and State,'' ``Is Socialism Dead,'' ``Health Risks in a Nuclear Environment,'' and its final topic, ``The Government Should Not Impose a Tax on Electronic Commerce.'' These and other topics have been debated by Presidents George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, and Richard Nixon; and prominent figures such as Margaret Thatcher, Muhammad Ali, Henry Kissinger, and Bob Dole. 
   Mr. President, the past decade has brought many references to the end of the millennium. It is a tribute to programs of its kind that ``Firing Line'' leaves the airways at this historic time. The guests, topics, and fervor with which the issues have been approached throughout the years on the program define the culture of the day. All attitudes and opinions have been expressed and analyzed, reflecting our society's nature to embrace conflict and discourse in the name of answers and truth. William F. Buckley and Warren Steibel created an educational art form that did as much teaching as any other television program in memory. 
   This final telecast also marks the fourth time that the University of Mississippi has hosted the ``Firing Line'' program. This relationship began with ``Firing Line's'' first visit to Oxford in 1989, and continued with its return in 1992, 1997, and now in 1999. Firing Line and Ole Miss have blended well over the years because of their commitment to furthering knowledge and challenging individuals to constantly expand their thinking. The University of Mississippi's growing impact across the world in the realms of politics, economics, social issues, technology and leadership make it a fitting backdrop for the closure of ``Firing Line's'' award-winning run.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Senate that today the senior Senator from Indiana cast his 9,000th vote as a Member of this body. 
   Throughout his career, Senator LUGAR has compiled a 98 percent voting attendance record. He did not miss a single vote during the entire 105th Congress. Along with our colleagues from Maryland, Senator SARBANES, and Utah, Senator HATCH, Senator LUGAR stands next in line to join the Senate's 10,000 vote club. A mark reached by only 21 Senators in history. 
   Many of you know of Senator LUGAR's passion for long-distance running. On occasion, a vote has been called while he was on one of his late afternoon runs on the Mall. Senators are not surprised when they encounter their colleague from Indiana in running shoes after double-timing back to the Senate Chamber for the vote. Casting 9,000 Senate votes is a fitting accomplishment for a long-distance runner who already stands as the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Indiana's history. 
   I am honored to have the opportunity to work with Senator LUGAR and pleased to recognize him on this historic milestone.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed much needed legislation to protect some of America's most threatened historic sites, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and the Corinth battlefield. S. 710, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail Battlefields Preservation Act of 1999, is a bipartisan measure that authorizes a feasibility study on the preservation of Civil War battlefields and related sites in the four states along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail. As my colleagues know, Vicksburg served as a gateway to the Mississippi River during the Civil War. The 18-month campaign for the ``Gibraltar of the Confederacy'' included over 100,000 soldiers and involved a number of skirmishes and major battles in Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee. The Mississippi Heritage Trust and the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the Vicksburg Campaign Trail as being among the most threatened sites in the State and the Nation. S. 710 would begin the process of preserving the important landmarks in the four State region that warrant further protection. I appreciate the cosponsorship of Chairman MURKOWSKI, Chairman Thomas, and Senators LANDRIEU, BREAUX, COCHRAN, HUTCHINSON, and CRAIG on this measure. 
   The Senate also approved S. 1117, the Corinth Battlefield Preservation Act of 1999, a measure that establishes the Corinth Unit of the Shiloh National Military Park. The battle of Shiloh was actually part of the Union Army's overall effort to seize Corinth. This small town was important to both the Confederacy and the Union. Corinth's railway was vitally important to both sides as it served as a gateway for moving troops and supplies north and south, east and west. The overall campaign led to some of the bloodiest battles in the Western theater. In an effort to protect the city, Southern forces built a series of earthworks and fortifications, many of which remain, at least for now, in pristine condition. Unfortunately, the National Park Service in its ``Profiles of America's Most Threatened Civil War Battlefields,'' concluded that many of the sites associated with the siege of Corinth are threatened.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just take a moment at this time, if the Senator would allow me. 
   When the history is written of this session of Congress, it will probably identify this piece of legislation as the single biggest achievement. I have heard this financial services modernization issue discussed for my entire career in the Congress, which is now up to 27 years. It has been tried by Republicans, by Democrats in the Congress, House and Senate, administrations of both parties. It never quite occurred. 
   I think it is appropriate we commend all of those who have been involved in this process for bringing us to this moment. This legislation is going to pass overwhelmingly. It is going to bring us into the modern era of financial services. It is going to allow us to be more equally competitive around the world. 
   I think we should properly note what has happened. If today's papers are any indication, we passed major trade legislation yesterday and it didn't even make the first section of one of the papers in this city; it wound up in the business section. It was hardly noted, the effort that was put into passing that major free trade legislation. I hope that will not be the case with this major legislation. 
   So for all those involved--I won't begin at the top and go to the bottom--obviously Secretary Rubin was involved in earlier discussions; Alan Greenspan was involved; Secretary Summers has been involved. The administration did stay engaged when they could have said we are not going to talk anymore. Leaders in both the House and the Senate, the elected leadership, Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol worked to make this happen. 
   Let me say for the record--I know, because I watched it very carefully and had some meetings which, I think, helped give it some momentum, some impetus--it would not be where it is today, it would not have been achieved, without the leadership 
   of the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM. He has done a masterful job. Many people said: It won't happen. Many people said: He will kill it. I kept saying: No; you wait. He will make this happen through thick or thin. It will get done. 
   It is being done. To take nothing away from all those involved--including the ranking member of the committee, Senator SARBANES of Maryland, who was actively involved--I have to note, with a lot of appreciation and gratitude, the tremendous leadership of the Senator from Texas. I don't think he can probably ever replicate this effort again. So I think that at this time we should express our appreciation because it is a monumental achievement. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate, then, has just passed the continuing resolution to the 10th of November. Progress is being made every hour on the appropriations process--some hours more than others. I hope Members will continue being patient while the final must-do legislation is completed. 
   I want to say again that I think the last 2 days have been phenomenal when you stop and look at all the difficulty that was involved--the fact that we passed major trade legislation by a vote of 75 or 76 to 23 last night, and today we passed the biggest reform of the banking and securities financial services industry in several decades with 90 votes. It is incredible. 
   We are going to continue to work to move vital legislation. We have other conferences that we hope to get agreed to. We need to get agreements. In fact, we must get an agreement on the FAA reauthorization bill. We are very close to getting an agreement on the satellite conference report. We are very close on the work incentives conference report. 
   There are three or four major conferences that are very close to being completed. When they are completed, we will take them up as soon as possible. 
   In addition, if agreements are reached on appropriations bills, of course, we would set everything aside for that. It seems to me that District of Columbia and perhaps the foreign relations conference reports could be ready as early as tomorrow. Certainly, if they are, we will vote on them. 
   The Senate hopefully also will reach, in just a very few minutes, an agreement on how to proceed on the bankruptcy bill. Senator DASCHLE and I have been working on this for weeks actually. I think we are very close to having an agreement. We are exchanging amendments so each side will know what is in our amendments both tonight and again tomorrow by noon. I hope Members who have relevant amendments on the underlying bankruptcy bill will come to the floor and offer them yet today. 
   We are in what I hope are the final days of the session. Members must be willing to work into the night in order to complete this legislation. I know there are some relevant amendments that are controversial and they will have second-degree amendments. Members should come to the floor and offer them. 
   Members could also expect votes during tomorrow's session. One could come with regard to appropriations. We could have votes on amendments with regard to the bankruptcy bill. 
   Members should expect that on Monday there will be recorded votes beginning at 5:30. 
   Also, votes will be ordered on the bankruptcy consent, calling for two votes with respect to minimum wage and business cost issues at 10:30 on Tuesday morning. 
   I am announcing that we may have to have votes tomorrow. We will have votes at 5:30 Monday. We will have votes at 10:30 on Tuesday. 
   We hope within the next few minutes to be able to enter the agreement on the bankruptcy bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from Louisiana, I apologize for not directing my attention to her question. I was visiting with the Senator from Maryland with respect to possible votes tomorrow. 
   The Interior appropriations conference report is being worked on while negotiations have been going forward on the foreign operations appropriations conference report. 
   I have information that real progress has been made today on the foreign operations appropriations report, but they will not get to the point of wrapping up Interior until the foreign operations bill is done. 
   I know the Senator from Louisiana has a real interest in that Interior bill, particularly provisions that could affect coastal areas such as hers and mine. Oil and gas revenues have been going in the Land and Water Conservation Fund for years and to lands out west, which is well and good. However, we take the risks in our area and we have not been getting any money. I don't think that is fair. We have beach erosion problems; we have estuary replenishment with which we need to deal. I am very sympathetic to the concerns of the Senator from Louisiana. 
   No final agreement has been reached on Interior. The Senator still has time to weigh in mightily with the Senators involved, and the administration, and needs to talk to them. I know the Senator has Senator DASCHLE working feverishly in her behalf.

   Mr. LOTT. I ran into that hornet's nest yesterday. There are a couple relevant amendments that are certainly worthwhile and actively supported, but they also are very much opposed by others who want to second degree them. Clearly, that will be in order. 
   I thank Senator DASCHLE for working with me on this, since the middle of October actually. I believe this bill can be considered and completed. Bankruptcy reform is something we certainly want to do. I know the minority leader has indicated his desire to have three nongermane amendments in order to the bill from Members of his side of the aisle. Those are relative to East Timor, agriculture, and minimum wage. 
   I hope all Members would allow us to adopt this agreement in order for the Senate to consider and approve this very important bankruptcy reform bill. 
   On our side, we will have three amendments, also, that relate to education, drugs, and business costs. I will specify that in a moment. 
   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to consideration of Calendar No. 109, S. 625, the bankruptcy bill, and following the reporting by the clerk, the committee amendments be immediately agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc. 
   I further ask consent that all first-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by 5 p.m. on the second day of the bill's consideration and that all first-degree amendments must be relevant to the issue of bankruptcy, and/or truth in lending/credit card agreements, with the exception of three amendments to be offered by the minority, or his designee, relative to agriculture, minimum wage/taxes, and East Timor, and three amendments to be offered by the majority leader, or his designee, regarding education, drugs, and business costs. 
   I further ask consent that the 5 p.m. filing requirement apply to each of these nonrelevant amendments and there be a time limit of 2 hours equally divided on each nonrelevant amendment, with the exception of the agriculture and drug amendments on which there will be 4 hours each for debate, with no second-degree amendments in order to these six issues and no motions to commit or recommit in order. 
   I further ask consent that at 3 p.m. on Monday, November 8, the minority leader, or his designee, be recognized to offer the amendment relative to the issue of minimum wage, and following the debate the amendment be laid aside, and the majority leader, or his designee, be recognized to offer the amendment relative to business costs, and that the votes occur in relation to the amendments at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, November 9, with 1 hour equally divided prior to the vote for concluding debate. I further ask consent that the first vote occur in relation to the minority amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the majority amendment, with 4 minutes prior to each vote for explanation. 
   I further ask consent that following the disposition of all of the above-described amendments, the bill be immediately advanced to third reading, that the Senate then proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 833, that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill as amended be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading, and a vote occur on passage of the bill, without any intervening action, motion or debate. 
   Further, I ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Senate bill be placed back on the calendar. 
   Finally, I ask consent that the exchange of the amendments by the two leaders on the two issues regarding minimum wage and business costs occur at noon on Friday. If by 3 p.m. either Member objects to the text of the amendments, this agreement be null and void and the bill be placed back on the calendar.

   Mr. LOTT. First, let me clarify one error I made. Staff informs me I did say: ``If by 3 p.m. any Member objects.'' It should say: ``If by 3 p.m. either leader objects to the text of the amendments, this agreement be null and void and the bill be placed back on the calendar.'' 
   Now, under the Senator's reservation, Mr. President, responding to his questions, obviously, on both sides--there may be minor changes that you would want to make on your agriculture amendment or East Timor, whatever; same thing on this side. I think we have to continue to work in good faith. If it goes to fundamental substance, and changes a major portion or the overall intent of the bill, I think that would be exceeding the bounds of reasonableness. But if it is some technical change or some minor change, we will have to continue to work with each other to get that done. I hope everybody will continue to be as flexible as they can be in that effort. But there is no intent to come back now and change the whole thrust of the bill. And that would not be fair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope now that Members will remain tonight to do their opening statements. I see the distinguished chairman is here, Senator GRASSLEY from Iowa, who has probably asked me about this bill over 100 times this year. I apologize to him now for not having gotten it on the calendar and up for consideration before now. But he has been dogged in his determination to address this very important area. 
   I say right up front we would not be having bankruptcy reform if it were not for the diligent efforts and the patience and the determination and the substantive involvement of the Senator from Iowa. So I think it is to his credit. 
   Now we need to move forward and get this bill completed, get it into conference, and hopefully act on it very quickly out of conference. 
   But since we do have this agreement now, and the manager is ready to go--and I presume the manager on the Democratic side is ready to go--I can announce now there will be no further votes this evening. The Senate will resume the bankruptcy bill at 9:30 a.m.  on Friday. All Senators should be aware that votes could occur with respect to the appropriations process or amendments to the bankruptcy bill on Friday. 
   Several Senators have been asking about exactly what we can 
   expect tomorrow. I cannot say. If we have an appropriations conference report that has been cleared that we are ready to move on, we will try to do it on a voice vote; but if we have to have a recorded voted, we just have to have a recorded vote. If we are ever going to get to the final days of the session, we have to be prepared to vote on Fridays and Mondays, if that is necessary. So we cannot give any assurance at this point that there will not be votes tomorrow. There very well may be. 
   Votes will occur at 5:30 Monday. And under this agreement, at least two votes will occur at 10:30 Tuesday. 
   Then, in conclusion, I wish to, again, thank all our colleagues for their cooperation this week. The fact that we did overwhelmingly pass this very important trade bill involving the Caribbean Basin area, Central America, and Africa, after a long period of time, is a significant and positive step for our country, I believe, not to mention the additional trading opportunities in other countries. And also to have completed the conference report on the financial services modernization--the second monumental achievement this week--I think the Senate, as a whole, can take a lot of pride. And now we are ready to begin a third one. I wish every week could be as productive. 
   With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration momentarily of the conference report to accompany the District of Columbia, Labor-HHS, and Education bill. By previous consent, at 10 a.m., the Senate will proceed to a vote on the conference report. That vote will be followed up by two cloture votes in relation to the Caribbean/African trade bill. Senators can expect then at least two stacked votes to begin at approximately 10 a.m. Cloture is expected to be invoked on the trade bill, and therefore the Senate will begin 30 hours of postcloture debate during today's session of the Senate. It is hoped this bill can be completed in the next day or so, certainly before the end of the week, because we do have some other very important issues we want to complete this week. We do want to take up the financial services modernization conference report, and we want to move to the bankruptcy bill that Senator DASCHLE and I have been trying to get an agreement on how to bring to the floor. We have had objection so far, but we are going to persist in getting this to the floor in a way that would be fair to both sides.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Walter Payton was the pride of Columbia, MS. He died all too early this past Monday at the age of 45 years--too young for a person of such integrity, ability, and generosity. 
   The Clarion Ledger newspaper of my home State this morning wrote a magnificent article about him. It said Walter Payton amazed his Mississippi teammates with his kindness almost as often as he dazzled them with his ability. They tell of a man who studied audiology in college after playing high school football with a deaf friend. That told a lot about the early life of this outstanding young man, and it is the kind of life he lived until his final day this past Monday. 
   Surprisingly, the man who would become a great football player did not even try out for football until his junior year in high school, choosing instead to play drums in the high school band. But he learned the game of football as fast as he could run, and long  before the Nation had heard of the Chicago Bear named ``Sweetness,'' Mississippians were cheering a Jefferson High superhero they called ``Spiderman'' and a Jackson State Tiger known as Walter. 
   His 3,563 yards rushing at Jackson State University was one of nine school records he set, and he scored a college career total of 66 touchdowns. At Jackson State, in 1973, he led the Nation in scoring with 160 points, and his 464 career points set an NCAA record. But Jackson State was a Division 1-AA school, and Walter did not get the same attention as players from some of the bigger, well-known colleges. Still, the Bears knew a caliber player when they saw one, and they knew about some of the other famous Mississippians who had preceded him, so they drafted him fourth in the overall draft in 1975. 
   In his first NFL game in 1975, he rushed eight times for a total of zero yards. But that did not tell the story of what was to come. The Bears did not give up on him, and Walter Payton didn't give up on himself. He worked as hard in Chicago as he had in Mississippi. By the end of his rookie year, he had started seven games and rushed for 679 yards and seven touchdowns. The next year he had the first of what would be 10 1,000-yard seasons, rushing for 1,390 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
   NFL coaches termed him the ``complete football player.'' Just last night, I saw Mike Ditka saying he was the best, most complete football player he had ever seen. He bested Jim Brown's longstanding rushing record of 12,312 yards in 1984. 
   But he also was more than just a football player. He worked to help mankind. He created the Halas/Payton Foundation to assist Chicago inner-city youth in completing their education. He believed in nurturing young people through education and inspiration, and he knew that the rewards of sports came in the challenges he set for himself, what he learned about himself, and what he accomplished as part of a team. 
   Walter Payton's light shown brighter earlier than many people his age. That is why his passing on Monday was even more difficult to take. At his induction in the NFL Football Hall of Fame in July 1993, he asked his son Jarrett to be the first son to present his father for induction into the Football Hall of Fame. His son said: 
   ``Not only is he a great athlete, he's a role model--he's my role model.'' 
   Drummer, NCAA champion, college Hall of Famer, Pro Football All Star, NFL Hall of Famer, ``Sweetness.'' 
   Role model to his son and millions of other Jarretts, that is the title Walter Payton would most cherish as his legacy.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, Senator DASCHLE and I have been working, really last week and early this week, to reach an agreement on the best way to have further consideration of the trade bill and also the bankruptcy bill. I want to say right up front that there has been a good faith effort on both sides. I certainly feel that way toward the Democratic leader. We are very close to reaching an agreement. I think it is basically a question of showing each other the actual amendments that would be involved. But I understand the Senator from South Carolina will not allow us to enter into any agreement with regard to the trade bill at this time. Having said that, we will continue to work to reach an agreement on the bankruptcy bill as well as trying to find a way to consider the pending trade bill.

We have been encouraging Members throughout this process to be prepared to offer their amendments. I have stated previously it has always been our willingness to have Senators offer these trade amendments. I believe it is time to move forward on this important legislation and complete this bill as early as possible this week. 
   So I ask consent it be in order for me to send to the desk a series of cleared amendments that I think are about equally divided on both sides. This will be the so-called managers' amendments to H.R. 434. I would say, we would offer these en bloc. There may be other amendments that may need to be offered that are not on this list. 
   I ask this so-called managers' amendment be considered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who touched the lives of each person he came into contact with throughout his teaching and coaching career. Coach Ralph Tasker was a respected person, and a perfect gentleman. He always looked for the good in people and had that rare ability to bring out the best in others. 
   Born and raised in Moundsville, West Virginia, Coach Tasker took up basketball when he was five years old. This was his common bond with most of his friends. In Moundsville, nearly everyone worked in coal mines except for Tasker's parents, who owned and operated a grocery store. He played basketball in high school, earning all-state honors in his junior and senior campaigns. From there he played four years at Alderson-Broaddus College, and this is where he met his wife, Margaret Elizabeth Marple. The two were married and devoted to each other for nearly fifty years until Margaret passed away in 1991. 
   Tasker began his coaching career straight out of college at Sulphur Springs High School in Sulphur Springs, Ohio, in 1941. He spent less than a year at Sulphur Springs, but even then made an impact on his students and players. Tasker went beyond the role of coach and teacher, as he was always a friend to his students and players. From his first year in coaching, his students considered Coach Tasker a father figure. Those who knew Coach Tasker describe him as dedicated, sincere, and loyal to his players and community. 
   After leaving Sulphur Springs, Coach Tasker served our country for three years in the U.S. Air Corps. He then accepted another coaching position in New Mexico at Lovington High School. After three years and one state championship with Lovington, Coach Tasker moved twenty miles south to Hobbs High School, where he would remain for the rest of his coaching career. Forty-nine years, eleven state championships, two perfect seasons, and two National High School Coach of the Year awards later, Coach Tasker decided to retire. In fifty-three years of coaching, Tasker had a remarkable collection of achievements. He finished with 1,122 wins and 291 losses, which ranks him as the third place coach in total number of wins in high school boys' basketball history. Among many honors, he was elected to four different halls of fame, won twelve state championships, and in 1991 was named the National Athletic Coach of the Year in the prestigious Walt Disney National Teacher Awards Program. 
   Coach Tasker was slow to take credit, but quick to praise. He often said, ``When you've got players like I've got, they make a great coach out of you.'' He was uncomfortable in the limelight, and even chose to put his awards away in drawers, preferring to display artwork by his grandchildren. Coach Tasker always sought to uplift his children, grandchildren, students, and players. 
   Mr. President, Coach Ralph Tasker passed away on Monday, July 19, 1999, after a brief bout with cancer. I trust the Senate will join me in honoring one of the greatest men in the sports history of New Mexico and this country. He will be missed by everyone. I believe my friend Senator DOMENICI put it best when he said, ``The passing of Ralph Tasker marks the loss of an institution in Hobbs and in New Mexico.''

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have some very important extenders in the Tax Code that need to be acted on before the end of this year or they will  expire. The Finance Committee, in a broad bipartisan way, reported out the bill. We have now cleared it on both sides. So this is very important to get it into conference with the House quickly so we can get this legislation completed before the year's legislative end. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 346, S. 1792, the so-called Finance Committee extenders bill, and there be 10 minutes for debate, with no amendments or motions in order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I agree with that. I might say that there are some permanent provisions in the House Ways and Means version of this bill. They would make permanent the extender with regard to the alternative minimum tax and how it affects the low- and middle-income people and others. Also, I have a bill at the desk to express my strong feeling on this subject that would make the R&D tax credit permanent. I think to come back every year, 2 years, or even every 5 years, causes concern and insecurity with regard to those tax credits. I hope we will make it either permanent, or as long as possible, in the conference. 
   I know there is at least one Senator who has provisions he hopes will be considered in the conference, and I think they should be. On our side, I have one Senator who feels very strongly that there are three parts of this bill that affect permanent law, which is not extenders. I agree. I think those permanent law issues should be dealt with by the regular committees. One has to do with brownfields, one with a rum provision, maybe in the Virgin Islands--not that you might want to be for them; I am just questioning whether or not they should be in a bill that is supposed to be tax credit extenders. We have other good provisions in here, a welfare-to-work tax credit, and others. So I am glad we are going to get this done before we leave. I thank Senators for the cooperation on both sides.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, having witnessed the vote earlier today, I am very concerned about our ability to complete action on the African and Caribbean Basin Initiative free trade legislation. This is important legislation. I believe it is good for the United States. It will be good for Central America, the Caribbean, and Africa. This bill is supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle and by the President. 
   I understand that maybe some Senator or Senators have gotten the idea, since we did not get cloture today, that was the end of it and this bill would just be set aside permanently. We are still very hopeful we can find a way to get this job done. We have a problem in that it takes a lot of time to get through the cloture motions and complete it, but I have not given up yet. 
   I am going to file cloture on the pending substitute, and if cloture is not invoked on Tuesday, we will have to move on to other issues. I emphasize I am filing two cloture motions, so we can hopefully get cloture on the substitute and on the bill itself and allow us to get to the substance, have amendments that are important, and bring it to a conclusion. 
   As a part of all this, I emphasize that Senator DASCHLE and I are working on an apparently unrelated issue but one that is related in fact, and that is an agreement as to how we can handle the bankruptcy bill and allow amendments, amendments that relate to bankruptcy, the credit cards issue, but also would have a number of agreed-to, nonrelevant amendments that would be in order. 
   I hope we can get that worked out. We are getting very close. That would relieve some of the pressure in opposition, and if we can get both bills done, it will be a monumental achievement, if we can go out this session having done the free trade bill for the Caribbean Basin Initiative and Africa and a bankruptcy bill that allows votes on which the Senate has indicated it wants to vote.

I see a couple of little problems that are really clerical in terms of how the three amendments would be handled. The way I read it, it looks as if there could be as many as 12 amendments, but really what we are talking about is 3 and 3, side by side. Once that is clarified, unless there is something else I see that is a problem, I think we can get this done.

   Mr. LOTT. It was my thinking that--I believe the way this is set up--we would complete trade and then we would go to bankruptcy when we complete the trade bill. 
   We are also hoping we can get some way to consider the nuclear waste bill, but it is my plan and my hope--we will have to get agreement, obviously, to do all these--to complete the trade bill and do bankruptcy and try to do the nuclear waste bill before we go out. Obviously, we have some hoops through which we have to jump in order to achieve that. 
   It is my thinking at this time we will complete the trade bill if we get the cloture. We can enter into a UC on bankruptcy before we do that. We will talk to you about that, exactly when  we need to do it, and we can go to bankruptcy before we go out. My intent would be to go to it next, after consultation with both sides.

   Mr. LOTT. In response to his question, I was in the hopes that if we could get agreement on the bankruptcy bill and the unrelated amendments that would be made in order under the agreement, that would help resolve the problem. 
   The difficulty is, in going through this process where we would in fact both vote to table, first of all, there is a lot of opportunity for mischief in terms of what amendments are offered, objections to time agreements, and how long would it take. That is one thing that worries me. If we do not get cloture and we go through a series of amendments where we have to vote to table them, I worry about the image of us voting to table, even if we could explain it procedurally. But if you vote to table fast track or vote to table agricultural sanctions or you vote to table some of these other things, I would prefer that the Senate not be recorded as having defeated or tabling some of these issues. 
   But the further problem is, if we go through and hold a number of these on this bill, how do we get it done in somewhat of a foreseeable period of time and then be able to get to bankruptcy? I am also worried about what in fact happens if we move to table or try to table or not table. I think the Senator has been right in saying that is where leadership has to weigh in and we have to make sure we get it done. 
   I think one of the issues that would have been the greatest problem would have been minimum wage, but I believe we are going to address the minimum wage on bankruptcy, therefore relieving the pressure, the need to put it on this particular bill. 
   So that is what we are up against. I have learned around here you never say never. I am just worried about being able to get this job done. Also, I have not been able to clear on our side an arrangement that would go through a repeated number of votes on trade. We have had this discussion privately. I think it is appropriate that we have it publicly, too.

   Mr. LOTT. Are you talking about doing it during the period of time when we may be discussing, as on Monday, the Labor-HHS bill? Are you talking about postcloture? Also, what do we do in terms of getting time agreements if the Senator from South Carolina objects to that? Maybe we will just have to--that is a lot of ifs--what if, what if. We will have to work through that. It would take a lot of delicacy in trying to get it to a conclusion. But that is my concern. 
   Are you talking about trying to do it Monday, or are you talking about trying to do it during the day Tuesday or Wednesday? And how do we, in terms of time--even postcloture, a lot of 
   amendments are in order.

   Mr. LOTT. Postcloture, for instance, there might be some amendments with regard to African trade. I wonder if there might be some way we could get an agreement. I worry about it getting agreed to, because I am not sure the Senator from South Carolina would agree to it, where some of those amendments, while they are not germane, would not be in order postcloture, they certainly relate to what we are trying to do. I would certainly like to have some way found for amendments such as that, if they exist. I could think of a couple I have heard of that ought to be offered. 
   I will be glad to work with the Senator to try to find a way to see if we can at least do that and get it cleared. But we do have a problem with objections. We can see if we can get it agreed to, and we can try to get it agreed to, if we can get something worked out that we can offer. Then if it is objected to, we just have to deal with that.

We need to request 1 hour of debate and a recorded vote. There are a total of 27 nominations here, including 2 that will have to have a recorded vote. It is a package. They all go or none go.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can be heard briefly on that. I want to emphasize this is a very large package of 27 nominations. Most of them are people who are supported by Democrats, I guess 23, 24, 25 of those. There are two or three that are Republican positions. One of them is for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which I presume is being objected to for an unrelated reason because, clearly, there is no problem with this nominee. 
   I will be back early next week with additional nominations that will run this package up to, I presume, between 34 and 40 nominations. All I can do is get them cleared and then offer them to the Democrats. If they object, then that is their problem. 
   I should also note that included in this group was not one, not two, but three judges, two of them women. One of the women is from California and one of them is from Texas. So for one 6-year appointment--I believe it is a 6-year term--to the Tennessee Valley Authority where there is a need for these two directors, they are willing to hold up 27 nominations, including two  women nominated to U.S. district courts. 
   That is not real smart. I do not quite understand it, and I hope the leadership and the President will speak to those who object in this way because I have heard all kinds of rhetoric today about how it is difficult if you are a woman or minority to get your nomination approved. In fact, I believe the record will show over the last 3 years this Congress and the previous Congress has confirmed a higher percentage of women and minorities than any Congress in history. 
   I do note it is pretty hard to go back and look at all the nominations and determine exactly how many minorities were approved because there is no record. We do not check whether you are a minority--African American or Hispanic or Asian. You are a person. All we can tell by your name is if you are a man or woman. Based on just the gender statistic, in fact, since I have been majority leader, I believe the record will show we have approved a lot more women than George Mitchell did when he was majority leader. 
   These accusations that were made today ring hollow. I hate to see the Senate stoop to that level. I met with White House officials today and told them we were going to try to clear these 27 nominations, and we will keep trying to move them all. I do not think it is reasonable to try to hold up one 6-year-term nominee to try to get two lifetime nominees to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a circuit that already has too many activist judges in it, a circuit that is the most liberal in this country, a circuit that is overruled more than any other circuit in the country by the Supreme Court, a circuit basically that is out of control. The nominees for these two positions have given rise to a great deal of controversy, to serious questions about whether they would be activists on the court, and to grave concerns about their records. 
   I understand the objection, and hopefully we can clear it up early tomorrow or next week. I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. I truly regret the objection to a reasonable consideration of this very important pending trade bill. This is obviously a vital piece of trade legislation. As I indicated last week on the floor, this is something in which the President has been very interested. He discussed it with me personally last week on, I think, Tuesday and twice since we have discussed it in telephone conversations. I am not doing it just because the President asked for it. I am doing it because I think it is the right thing to do. 
   I think it would be good for our country, help to create jobs. This is very carefully crafted legislation that the chairman of the committee and ranking member have worked on. I think it would be just vitally important to our friends in Central America and the Caribbean, as well as a major step symbolically and other ways to have African free trade. 
   I want to get this bill done. There are legitimate objections to it. The Senator from South Carolina is going to  use every rule in the book that he has access to, and there are lots of them. He has staff members who will make sure he knows them all. I understand that. But I am sure everybody can understand I have to take advantage of the rules available to me also because I do not want this to become a debate about farm policy, sanctions policy--one Senator just suggested we should offer fast track on this bill. I agree; I think fast track should be done. That is another very important trade policy. But it will completely bog down this bill. 
   I think we need to be serious about this bill. I plan now to fill up the tree and file cloture. The cloture vote will be Friday. We will see if the Senate wants this trade bill or not. If we do not get cloture, then it is clear what is going on and we will just have to move on to something else. 
   My consent would simply keep the Senate on the subject of the African trade and trade benefits for the Caribbean Basin countries. Obviously, with objection from the Democrats, they do not want this subject matter to be the pending issue. I think it is unfortunate, but I understand.

Let me emphasize he did not agree with this at all, but we did discuss our situation and our mutual concerns and our mutual desires to try to find a way to move this trade legislation forward. Filling up the tree is not a new practice. It is one I haven't used, I don't think, this year--maybe once. It is a practice that has been used in the past by majority leaders when it is necessary to try to get to a conclusion. 
   I do not know exactly when our adjournment for the year will come, but it is obvious we do not have a lot of time left. We do have some other issues we would like to have a chance to consider. Again, that is on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. LOTT. I am not sure when that might occur. I told the Democratic leader just a few minutes ago, if it were just an amendment by Senator WELLSTONE on agriculture, I would be prepared to have that discussion, that debate, and a vote. But 
   that is not the end of the string. We have a lot of innovative thinkers here on both sides of the aisle who are now working feverishly with their very competent staffs to develop other amendments. 
   If it were just an amendment by the Senator from Minnesota, I think probably that could be done. I think if we would open the door, there would be no end to it.

<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-21-19991027</DOCNO>

   Mr. LOTT. First of all, I will be willing to discuss that with the Senator. I would have to also discuss it with the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and its members. I could not just unilaterally reach an agreement. But, again, I personally would not have a problem with that. 
   I do not know what his amendment would be, but I am sure I would vote against it. But we could have a discussion. I would need to check with both sides and I will talk with the Senator to see if it is possible, to see if we can do that in some freestanding way. 
   Having said that, I want to be sure the record has been made at this point. Last Friday, the President of the United States signed the Agriculture appropriations bill--I believe last Friday. It provides funds for agricultural needs all across this great land, in my State and that of the Senators from Minnesota and New York. We have lots of agriculture in New York. I don't know if you are aware of that, but I have been very impressed when I have been up there, some of the areas outside of Long Island. I found there is a lot of agriculture up there and all across this country. 
   We did get the Agriculture bill. In that bill was a very significant amount of funds for disaster-related problems. Some of them have been caused because of the depressed prices, some because of drought, some because of floods--all the different problems we have. Others say it was not enough; it should have been more. Some others would say it was not targeted in the right way. We can debate that endlessly, I believe. 
   But the President, upon review--and I believe he took the full 10 days--decided the right thing to do was go ahead and get this bill signed and get that disaster money to the farmers, the men and women who live on the farms in this country, as quickly as possible. It is not as if this is an issue we have not addressed and we will not address next year.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I yield the floor for discussion of this amendment, let me reiterate to my colleagues my hope we can continue to consider trade-related amendments to this important African trade CBI legislation. 
   I know earlier Senator REID offered and debated a trade-related amendment. I think that was the right approach. I thank him for doing that. I encourage all Members who have amendments relating to the pending subject to work with the managers who are here, ready to work, have their amendments offered and disposed of. 
   Again, this amendment has, I believe, very broad support across the aisle. I think it is the right thing to do, and I am still anxious for us to find a way to get to cloture so we can have the final amending process and debate on this bill and pass it. 
   This would be a major step for the Senate. Of course, then we still have to go to conference with the House, which has a very different approach from ours to this legislation. It will be a tough conference. But this legislation is supported by the managers on both sides of the aisle, by myself, by Senator DASCHLE, I believe, and by the President. I hope we can continue to look to find a way to move this legislation to a conclusion. 
   We can get cloture on Friday, and then I believe by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, we could be completed with this legislation. We will continue to work to seek a way to achieve that. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond for a moment further, this is a trade bill. This is a bill the Senate would like to pass, I believe. We tried to do fast-track legislation. I believe that was last year or maybe the year before. We did not quite get that done. 
   This is a major opportunity for us to do something that will be good for America, good for our individual States and constituents, I believe, and good for the Central American countries, the Caribbean area, and Africa. 
   It is a trade bill. The idea that Senators on both sides of the aisle would bring up issues which would clearly deadlock the Senate and make it highly unlikely that we could get to a reasonable conclusion at a time when we are approaching the end of the session--I have already been told of Senators' desires to offer an amendment dealing with sanctions and their support for a sanctions bill on this side. I understand Senators on the other side said: If you don't offer it, we will offer it. 
   Clearly, that is an issue we do need to get into. The question of how we deal with sanctions, particularly agricultural sanctions, needs to be thought through carefully. The relevant committees would get into that, have hearings, give thought to it, and have a bill reported out which we could take up, in and of itself, separately in the next session of this Congress next year. 
   I had a Senator indicate he wants to offer fast track to this bill which, by the way, I support. At least it is a free trade amendment. It clearly is one that will cause a great deal of consternation on the Democratic side of the aisle, perhaps on both sides of the aisle. 
   Plus, I was told by Senator WELLSTONE he wanted an agricultural amendment. I have been told there is a gun amendment pending, even though we spent 2 weeks debating juvenile justice and gun amendments earlier this year. I was told three Senators might be looking at campaign finance reform again. 
   Basically to empty our out basket on issues we have already voted on this year causes tremendous problems and delays in completing this very important trade legislation. 
   I will be glad, once again, to enter a unanimous consent agreement that we go forward and consider first-degree amendments, relevant amendments, on the trade bill. There are a lot of amendments that Senators want to offer that relate to the bill before us. 
   To the American people, do you understand me? The complaint is: We cannot debate gun amendments, agricultural sanctions, and farm amendments on a trade bill, on a bill that has bipartisan support and Presidential urging. I realize it may be within the rules, but I do not think it is a way to get this bill done. 
   I hope we can keep looking for a way to move it forward. I do not want to be in a position of trying to give aid and comfort to the opposition to this legislation. Obviously, that is not my preference, but Senator HOLLINGS is going to avail himself of the rules and he will be very willing to help other Senators who want to offer extraneous amendments if that will be helpful to his cause. 
   He is smiling and I am smiling because I know exactly what he is up to. He is doing an excellent job in trying to stop this legislation he has made clear he is opposed to. That is the way the Senate works. If one feels strongly and one Senator is willing to spend the time and use the rules, he can cause problems and delay a bill. 
   As far as using the tree, I did not invent the process. I must confess, I was surprised it has been used as much as it has this year. It has been a longer year than I thought, perhaps, or maybe it is a better tool than I had remembered. 
   Still, I will work with the managers of the bill and Senator DASCHLE, and if there is a key to unlock this bill to get it to its conclusion, I am willing to look for it. I hope we will not, though, as I said, empty out our baskets on both sides of the aisle and come up with everything we have been harboring in our heart of hearts over the past weeks or months. 
   Let's keep our eye on the bill. This is a big, important bill. There are countries all over the world looking at us saying: Will they keep their word? The President has gone to Central America, I believe, twice--I know for sure once--and said he wants this; we want to help the Caribbean Basin countries and the Central American countries. 
   I know he wants to do that, and so do I. I have been there. I have met with the Presidents. I have met with the Ambassadors. They are desperate for help. The good thing about it is this is a way we can help them and help ourselves. 
   In my State, we are going to produce the cotton. We are going to put the fabric together and ship it to Central America through a port. They are going to finish off the product, send it back to the port, and it is going to be available to the American people at a reasonable price. 
   Everybody wins: American product, American workers, American dock workers, Central American jobs, then back to America where American consumers will get a fair price for this material. That is just one example. And there are many others. 
   So I certainly understand what Senator DASCHLE is saying. I know there is  a pent-up demand to offer these various and sundry amendments. I understand that, but I do not feel I have any particular obligation to go out of my way to accommodate that. 
   Sooner or later, the time will come when these things are going to come up, one way or the other. I indicated to Senator WELLSTONE, I would like to know the details of what his amendment is to see if maybe it could be brought up freestanding. I am not so sure we would not want to just say, OK, bring it up. Let's have some limited debate and vote on it. But if you open that door, where and when does it end? 
   To spend a week on this bill, I was prepared to do that. To spend 2 weeks on it, I am not sure we want to do that. We have to be able to bring an end to this by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. 
   That enables and strengthens the hand of the Senator from South Carolina. He knows that we are not willing to run this train endlessly. If we had 2 or 3 weeks, we could grind it down. But I hope that we would not have to do that because we do have some other issues that people on both sides of the aisle do want to do. We need to try to see if we can work out a way to do it. 
   Well, I am repeating myself. I understand what Senator DASCHLE is saying, and I understand the frustration. But the way to get this done is to continue to see if we can work out an agreement, and then get cloture Friday. Sixty votes; we are going to get probably 52, 53 Republicans who will vote for cloture to go on to the substance of the bill. If we can get 6 or 8 or 10 Democrats--just 6 or 8 or 10--that is all it would take, and we would be on this bill, and we would be done with it by next Wednesday. That is a worthy goal. I hope we can achieve it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, this morning I was actually in Lexington, KY, with my son and daughter and grandson. I think in a way that made me even more melancholy and mournful about this day and the loss of our good friend JOHN CHAFEE. 
   I started thinking about JOHN and his life. It made me realize that, day by day, in our regular duties, we go busily about our business and we do not stop, sometimes, to look at the beautiful surroundings, this historic building we are in. We don't stop, sometimes, to thank the staff member who has been particularly helpful to us. Also, sometimes we don't stop to think that we walk with men and women in this institution who have been giants in their lives. JOHN CHAFEE was one of those men. Sometimes we just forgot JOHN CHAFEE had done so much for his country, for his fellow man, for his State, and for his Nation. It was easy to do that because JOHN was not the kind of guy who demanded attention and demanded he be treated with reverence or any extraordinary respect. He was a soft-spoken gentleman, and he was truly a ``gentle'' man. The word fit him perfectly. 
   I was just talking to Senator WARNER, his good friend, his successor as the Secretary of the Navy. I never had quite thought about one other thing: JOHN CHAFEE was not one given to temper, not one given to profanity. He was just a dedicated, hard-working, good Senator for his State and for our country. So I believe we truly have lost one of the best servants we have had in the Senate in my time here, our friend JOHN CHAFEE, the senior Senator from Rhode Island. 
   I first got to know JOHN CHAFEE some 30 years ago; it is hard to believe, I say to Senator WARNER, who was his deputy over there at the Navy Department. JOHN was the Secretary of the Navy. I had the occasion to meet with him as a staff member because there was a little disagreement between his State and my State about a Seabee base. But he was always so fair in all his dealings; it impressed me then. I didn't realize at the time that he had already been Governor and he had such a distinguished military career. There he was, the Secretary of the Navy. 
   Then, of course, he went on to be elected to the Senate. Only after I came to the Senate did I realize he truly was a war hero, a marine. He was very proud of it. He defended his country, and he was a highly decorated combat veteran. He served his people so well as Governor of that State, and he also served the people of that State as a Senator since 1976. 
   I have given a lot of thought about Senator CHAFEE today; also, the fact the last time I saw him and spoke to him personally, last Thursday, he was not feeling particularly well. He wanted to know if there were going to be any more votes. But he was staying right back here, waiting to see if he was going to be needed anymore, attending to his duties, even on Thursday night of last week. 
   I think it is belated but appropriate that we say a few kind words about Senator CHAFEE and his service. We extend our best to his wife Ginny and to his family. 
   By the age of 39, JOHN CHAFEE was already a combat veteran in two wars. You will not find it in his official biography, but he earned at least two Purple Hearts, among many other service distinctions. He had left his undergraduate studies at Yale University to first enlist in the Marines. He served in the original invasion forces of the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. Following that, he resumed his studies at Yale and went on to earn his law degree at Harvard. 
   JOHN was recalled to active duty in 1951, and while in Korea he commanded Dog Company, a 200-man rifle unit in the 1st Marine Division. Perhaps Senator WARNER has already recounted all of that, but it is such an impressive part of the man he was. 
   After 6 years in the Rhode Island General Assembly, including 4 years as his party's leader in the House of Representatives, JOHN was elected Governor of Rhode Island in 1962 by 398 votes--not one to waste any votes, or anything else for that matter. He was reelected in 1964 and 1966 by the largest margins in Rhode Island's history. 
   The newly-inaugurated President Nixon appointed JOHN CHAFEE to be Secretary of the Navy in 1969, a post he held for 3 1/2 years. He was elected to his  fourth term in 1994 with 65 percent of the vote. He was the first Republican elected to the Senate from Rhode Island in 68 years. 
   In the Senate, he rose to become chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee where, once again, he worked very aggressively on issues about which he felt strongly. He was a Senator who really did care about the environment. But he tried to make it an issue where we reached across the aisle to each other. He wasn't interested just in making a statement or trying to drive up his ratings with one group or another. He wanted to get results. 
   I remember he came to me when I had first been elected majority leader in 1996. He said: I believe we can pass this safe drinking water bill. It had been stalled in the Senate and the House, and it was stalled in conference. 
   I said: John, it's too late. We can't do it. 
   He said: If we come to agreement, will we get it up for a vote? 
   I said: If you can get Dirk Kempthorne and the others involved and get Democrats involved, and we can get a bill that will be good for America, to have safe drinking water, why, surely we will do it. 
   I think it was the last day of the session, but right at the end we got it done because JOHN CHAFEE would not give it up. He wasn't interested in making a statement. He was interested in getting a good bill for his country--Safe Drinking Water--a worthy cause and one of which JOHN CHAFEE was very proud. 
   Even recently, he was working on efforts that are certainly worthwhile and have been very difficult to bring to closure. The day will come when we will get a new Superfund bill, and when we do, we ought to dedicate it to the memory of JOHN CHAFEE because he has charged that mountain as a good marine, time and time again. We never have quite made it. One of these days we will top the crest, and we will all think about JOHN CHAFEE when we do. 
   He was an important member of the Finance Committee. He chaired the Social Security and Family Policy Subcommittee. Again, just last week I arrived late at a Finance Committee meeting before we went out to mark up a bill providing assistance for hospitals, nursing homes, and home health care, a bill that would put back some Medicare money as a result of the balanced budget agreement. It was about to come apart. The wheels were coming off. Senators were disagreeing. It looked as if what was going to be a bipartisan package, easily passed out, that had been crafted by the chairman, Senator ROTH, and the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN of New York, was going to fall apart right there in that little anteroom before we went into the Finance Committee meeting. 
   One of the last people to speak was JOHN CHAFEE. He said: Good work has been done on this; it is not everything we would want--typical of JOHN CHAFEE to say that--but it is a good step. We ought to do it. We ought to go out here right now, take this bill up, and pass it out of the Finance Committee. 
   Thirty minutes later, by a voice vote, with only two dissenting audible nays, we passed that bill out. 
   He did his part on the Finance Committee, too. He served as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he had a real interest in making sure about the intelligence capabilities of our country, to make sure we did not drop our guard in that area, and we started rebuilding our intelligence community after years of problems, going back, I guess, to the 1970s. 
   He was chairman of the Senate Republican Conference for 6 years, the No. 3 leadership position in the Senate. 
   In the Senate, we knew JOHN as a genuinely independent New Englander, respected on both sides of the aisle, who worked to bring opposing sides together for the common good. All of us regretted his decision announced earlier this year to leave the Senate, but it was characteristic of JOHN to work to the very end. He leaves behind 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and a legacy of a lifetime of service to Rhode Island and to his Nation. 
   If the Biblical quote ever applied to any Senator, this quote should apply to JOHN CHAFEE: Well done, thy good and faithful servant. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, over the past three decades, concern for our environment and natural resources has grown--as has the desire to recycle and reuse. You may be surprised to learn that one major environmental statue actually creates an impediment to recycling. Superfund has created this impediment, although unintended by the law's authors. 
   Because of the harm that is being done to the recycling effort by the unintended consequence of law, the distinguished minority leader, Mr. DASCHLE, and I introduced the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, S. 1528. This bill removes Superfund's recycling impediments and increases America's recycling rates. 
   We had one and only one purpose in introducing the Superfund Recycling Equity Act--to remove from the liability loop those who collect and ship recyclables to a third party site. The bill is not intended to plow new Superfund ground, nor is it intended to revamp existing Superfund law. That task is appropriately left to comprehensive reform, a goal that I hope is achievable. 
   While the bill proposes to amend Superfund, Mr. President, it is really a recycling bill. Recycling is not disposal and shipping for recycling is not arranging for disposal--it is a relatively simple clarification, but one that is necessary to maintain a successful recycling effort nationwide. Without this clarification, America will continue to fall short of its recycling goal.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York, I will be brief. I have a cloture motion to file. 
   But I do also want to comment just briefly on the remarks of the Senator from Alabama. I thank him for his remarks. He is raising very important concerns--ones that I have discussed with the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and I have written to the Secretary of Defense expressing my concerns. As a result of the correspondence with the Secretary of Defense, and our worry about the Chinese involvement in the Panama Canal through a particular company having control of port facilities on both ends of the Panama Canal, our concern is about what is their relationship with the Chinese Government as well as other concerns as we move toward turning over the Panama Canal on December 31. 
   Narcoterrorism is of concern in the area, as well as corruption in the government. We do, at this very moment, have a hearing underway in the Senate Armed Services Committee. We have had Members of Congress testify about their concerns. We have a panel now that includes General Wilhelm, who has jurisdiction for our military over that region; Ambassador Gutierrez from the State Department, answering questions; as well as the Honorable Aleman Zubieta who is Deputy Administrator, I believe, of the Commission. That testimony is underway right now. Secretary Weinberger is there. I know they are looking forward to Senator SESSIONS returning to ask questions. 
   There may be no problem here, although there is clearly a problem with narcoterrorism and corruption in the government. But I think we have an absolute responsibility to ask questions and get into the law about how this is going to work. 
   There is a provision in Law No. 5, as it is described in Panama, that raises some questions about how U.S. military vessels would have access to the Panama Canal after December 31. To the extent they say they would have right of passage provided it didn't interfere with the operations of the Panama Canal, we need to make sure we know what is happening there. We are going to carry out our responsibilities in that effort. I thank Senator SESSIONS for his work in that also.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and ranking member for being here and being willing to proceed on this important legislation. I do think we have an opportunity with this CBI and African free trade legislation to be able to have better relations and trade with Central America, with the Caribbean, and with Africa. I believe it will be in the interests of all countries concerned. It is the right attitude. 
   There are a lot of terms being thrown around in recent weeks about isolationism. This is clearly a case where, by trading with countries in Central America, the Caribbean and Africa, we can open up not only trade but relationships and opportunities for peoples in all the countries involved, including the United States. So I am glad we have proceeded to this legislation.  
   The Senate has been debating the motion to proceed because there had been objection to going to the bill itself. That is as a result of the objection to its immediate consideration by Senator HOLLINGS. I wanted to see if maybe we could go ahead, get started, have some debate and amendments and then not have to debate the motion to proceed and then debate the bill itself, but it looks as if we are not able to at this time proceed in that way. Since there has been objection and this is an important trade bill, one with major implications, one I discussed with the President three times this week alone, about his interest and concern and support of this legislation, I think it is important we file cloture and try to find a way to stop a threatened filibuster and move to the substance of the bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand we are ready now to do a series of three votes back to back. 
   For the information of all Senators, these votes will be the last votes of the day. 
   It will be my intention to begin debate on the African trade bill, which includes, of course, the CBI enhancement provisions, immediately following these votes. It is my hope that the Senate will begin debating and amending the bill yet this evening because we do have some more time that we could keep working on this bill. 
   I had the opportunity this afternoon to talk to the President about this legislation. He is committed to being of assistance in any way he can to the Senate taking this bill up and passing it in its present form. 
   I have been working with the Democratic leader, the chairman and ranking member of the committee, all of whom support this legislation. 
   This is a free trade initiative that will be good for a America, good for the Caribbean Basin, and good for Africa. 
   Assuming the Senate begins debate on this bill, any votes relative to amendments would be postponed to occur at a time determined by the majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader. 
   On Monday, the Senate will be debating the African trade bill with the CBI provisions. 
   I will propose to confirm six nominations from the Executive Calendar. If debate is necessary on these nominations, that debate would also occur on Monday. 
   However, the votes, if necessary, would be postponed to occur on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. 
   I thank all Members, and will notify each Senator as the voting situation becomes clearer. 
   Based on what I said, I believe we will have only debate on Friday. It is not clear at this time what the situation would be with regard to Monday. We will have debate. We do have nominations we want to clear. But we will be in communication with both sides of the aisle and notify the Members as soon as further decisions can be made.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hate to see the minority leader's comments end. They were getting better and better as he got toward the end. 
   I also extend the congratulations of myself, all the Members of the Senate on this side, and on the Democratic side. It is certainly an enviable record: 10,000 votes, 25 years. We all know quite well Senator LEAHY's efforts on behalf of the environment, agriculture, judiciary, foreign policy. His efforts are legendary. He has done a great job. 
   Mr. President, today is a special day. In the history of our country, less than 1,300 Americans have served in the U.S. Senate. Being a Senator is a singular honor bestowed on a very few. Today, our friend from Vermont, PAT LEAHY has joined a unique club within this unique body. He has cast his 10,000th vote. 
   Think about what that means. When PAT LEAHY came to the Senate, as the youngest man ever sent to the Senate by the people of the United States, Gerald Ford was in the White House. Since then, Presidents and majority leaders have come and gone, the Iron Curtain has come crashing down, and PAT LEAHY has kept on casting votes. 
   PAT already had remarkable career before he came to the Senate. After leaving Georgetown Law School, he served for 8 years as a state's prosecutor in Vermont where he gained a national reputation as a crime fighter. In 1974, he was named as one of the three outstanding prosecuting attorneys in the United States. 
   Upon entering the Senate PAT became a leader on agriculture, foreign affairs, and the judiciary. His Leahy-Lugar bill in 1994 revolutionized the way the Department of Agriculture does its business and millions of farmers are better off for his efforts. 
   So I echo the sentiments of my friend, the minority leader. We send PAT and his wife Marcelle our very best wishes and our hopes for continued success in the days ahead.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in January of this year I reported on an important public-private partnership to protect our nation's underground infrastructure--electric power and fiber optic cables, telephone lines, water and sewer mains and pipelines. This partnership is based on S. 1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act, which I introduced in 1997 with the Minority Leader, Senator DASCHLE. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and became law as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA 21. 
   Among other things, the bill called on the Secretary of Transportation to convene a comprehensive study of best practices in underground damage prevention. This study was completed and released by Secretary Rodney Slater on June 30, 1999. The study has been a model for conducting a cooperative effort between the public and private sectors. All those with an interest in underground damage prevention--the excavation community, one-call notification center representatives, locating contractors, railroads and underground facility operators worked together to produce the 250-page ``Common Ground'' report. This report is a veritable gold mine of practical real-world advice for all those involved in protecting our underground infrastructure in government and in the private sector. 
   The study is so valuable because of the 160 people with hands-on experience in underground damage prevention who worked together to write it. Nine teams covered the key aspects of underground infrastructure protection: one-call center practices, excavation, mapping, locating and marketing, compliance, planning and design, reporting and evaluation, public education, and emerging technologies. The full study is available at the DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety web page http://ops.dot.gov. 
   Steps are underway to keep this valuable and cooperative spirit alive and make the Common Ground process a continuing one, but this time with private leadership. This year's Senate Appropriations Committee Report on  Transportation Appropriations (S. Rept. 106-55) including the following:  
   The Committee believes that the group effort, dubbed ``Common Ground'', has the potential to serve as a basis for a self-sustaining entity that can advance underground damage prevention by identifying and encouraging best practices, providing badly needed public education, and collecting and disseminating information on damage to underground facilities. The Committee directs OPS to use existing resources to support the formation and initial operation of a non-profit organization that will further the work of ``Common Ground'' and implement other innovative approaches to advance underground damage prevention.  
   On October 28, the Office of Pipeline Safety will respond to this direction by convening a public meeting of the Common Ground participants and an even wider group of interests to lay the foundation for the non-profit organization described in this Report language. This non-profit damage prevention organization could be the key to a far more robust and effective national effort to protect our underground infrastructure that would be led and funded by the private sector. 
   To Secretary Slater's credit, the Department understands the importance of letting the private participants take the lead. The Department of Transportation will provide the initial resources for startup, but will then step back, so the private participants can be responsible for defining the path forward for underground damage prevention. In order to succeed, the new non-profit organization cannot be federally run or federally controlled. To succeed it cannot be run or controlled by any one of the interests in underground damage prevention. It must be a cooperative, power sharing enterprise in which excavation community, one-call notification center representatives, locating contractors, railroads, underground facility operators and other important interests join together to make decisions democratically. 
   The potential for such an organization to get things done is simply enormous, because it can include all the important affected interests from the beginning. The private effort and resources devoted to underground damage prevention today are very significant, but fragmented. This non-profit damage prevention organization is the missing piece that can pull these efforts together in a constructive way to create a powerful national impact on the largest preventable threat to our underground infrastructure. I urge all those in attendance at the October 28 meeting to keep this big picture vision firmly in mind. This is a tremendous opportunity that should not be missed. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater for seizing the opportunity offered by the Common Ground initiative. It seems to me that Secretary Slater, Research and Special Programs Administrator Kelley Coyner and Office of Pipeline Safety head Richard Felder all have this exactly right. This effort will be most effective if it is privately led and privately funded. This is an instance, all too rare, where the Federal Government is seeking to return power to the private sector. I urge all the Common Ground private participants--the excavation community, one-call notification center representatives, locating contractors, railroads, insurance providers, equipment manufacturers and underground facility operators to take up the leadership responsibility the Secretary is offering. 
   I will continue to monitor developments in underground damage prevention and the efforts to set up the non-profit privately led organization envisioned in the Senate Appropriations Committee Report. I look forward to working with all involved to further improve protection of our vital underground infrastructure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Let me begin by saying the same thing Senator BYRD said at the beginning of his remarks. I respond without any sense of rancor. I know that sometimes in the Senate we get very intent and very passionate about issues. I know this issue is one we all are very concerned about, and passions do run high, as they should, because we have very strongly held opinions. Thank goodness, though, we still are able to do as we did last night, retire to another building and enjoy each other's friendship and company, and then we return to the issues at hand. We debate them mightily, with due respect and without rancor. 
   As far as the amount of time that has been spent on debate on this treaty, I went back and checked recent treaties. In fact, the only one that took as much time on the floor of the Senate as this treaty in recent history was the chemical weapons treaty, in which, I remind the Senator, I was also involved. Usually treaties are debated a day or two, 6 hours or 12 hours. I think this one is going to wind up being about 15 or 16 hours. I think we have had time to have the debate that was necessary on this issue. After all, it has been pending in various ways for at least 2 years, and the treaty was actually signed, I think, way back in 1995, if I recall correctly. 
   I understand what Senator BYRD is saying. I, too, have been around awhile. I know only Senator THURMOND can match your record. But I have been in Congress 27 years myself. I served in the House 16 years, where I was chairman of the Research Committee. I served 8 years as the whip of my party in the House. I have been in the Senate since 1989, where I served as secretary  of the conference, the whip, and leader. I understand the importance of the differences between the two bodies and the 
   precedents and the tradition and the comity and the respect for each other. I have a great deal of respect and love for this institution and, in fact, for the Senator from West Virginia. 
   Having said all of that, this was a motion, a request. I made a motion to go back to the Executive Calendar, a nondebatable motion. Then there was a request in effect to have debate. It wasn't as if there wouldn't be debate on the substance of the treaty. There are almost 3 hours of time remaining on the treaty. But in that extra effort to be fair, so the closing debate would be equal, we have already yielded back 54 minutes so there would be 2 hours approximately on each side. 
   I want to make sure Senators have a chance to be heard and that their voices are not muted. Yours will not be, under the time we have left. But in that case, I thought the time would have delayed getting to a conclusion on this very important matter. It was a nondebatable motion, and we had time left for debate. I believed it was the correct thing to do. I regret the Senator feels strongly to the contrary. 
   I recognize that he has been not only not an impediment to my trying to do my job but quite often has been helpful. I appreciate that. I am sorry he feels that way. 
   I knew he was going to make the motion. I knew there was going to be an effort to have extended debate on a nondebatable motion to go back to a treaty, which I had, frankly, made a mistake, probably, in interrupting it to go to the Agriculture appropriations conference report. I did it because we need to get to these appropriations bills, as the Senator knows. 
   Majority leaders have to balance time schedules and views of Senators and different bills, appropriations bills, the desire to get to campaign finance reform. I gave my word to more than one Senator that we would begin today on campaign finance reform. I am still determined to keep that commitment. But if it is 8 or 9, they will say: Well, you didn't keep your word. It is too late. All of that came into play. 
   I assure you, I would want Senator BYRD's voice to be heard, Senator DASCHLE's, on any nondebatable motion and on this treaty. I am sure the time will come when I will stand up. In fact, I remember one occasion--Senator DODD will remember this because he came to me and said: I appreciate your doing that--when there was an effort to cut you off. I stood up and said no. I asked unanimous consent that the Senator have that time. I stood up when I thought it was unfair. This time, on a nondebatable motion to go back to the Executive Calendar, I thought it was unfair, in fact, to have an extended debate on that. 
   I appreciate your giving me a chance to respond. I hope we can work through this. We will get to a final vote. Sometimes we come up with agreements that allow things to go to another day. 
   Sometimes we strive mightily and we can't reach that. And sometimes you just have to fulfill your constitutional responsibility and you just vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the United States Senate fulfilled its constitutional responsibility by voting on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty. Under the Constitution, the President and the Senate are co-equal partners when it comes to treaty-making powers. Positive action by both branches is required before a treaty can become the supreme law of the land. All Americans should know that I and my colleagues take this solemn responsibility with great pride, and we are very diligent in making sure that our advice and consent to treaties is treated with the utmost consideration and seriousness. 
   The Senate does not often refuse to ratify treaties, as borne out by the historical record. But the fact that the Senate has rejected several significant treaties this century underscores the important ``quality control'' function that was intended by the Framers of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers never envisioned the Senate would be a rubber stamp for flawed treaties. I and my colleagues would never allow this venerable institution to be perceived as--much less actually become--a mere rubber stamp for agreements negotiated by this or any other President. Instead, the Senate must dissect and debate every treaty to ensure that it adequately protects and promotes American security interests. The American people expect no less. 
   As has been pointed out by numerous experts before the Foreign Relations, Armed Services, and Intelligence Committees, and by many Senators in extended floor debate, this treaty does not meet even the minimal standards of previous arms control treaties. That is, it is ineffectual--even dangerous, in my judgment; it is unverifiable; and it is unenforceable. As one of my distinguished colleagues put it: ``the CTBT is not of the same caliber as the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in recent decades.'' 
   This treaty is ineffectual because it would not stop other nations from testing or developing nuclear weapons, but it could preclude the United States from taking appropriate steps to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. That it is not effectively verifiable is made clear by the intelligence community's inability to state unequivocally the purpose of activities underway for some number of months at the Russian nuclear test site. Just last week, it was clear that they could not assure us that low-level testing was not taking place. The CTBT simply has no teeth. 
   Had the President consulted with more Senators before making the decision in 1995 to pursue an unverifiable, unlimited-duration, zero-yield ban on testing, he would have known that such a treaty could not be ratified. If he had talked at that time to Senator WARNER, to Senator KYL, to Senator LUGAR, to any number of Senators, and to Senator HELMS, he could have been told that this was not a verifiable treaty and that it was not the safe thing to do for our country. 
   I know some will ask, so what happens next? The first thing that must be done is to begin a process to strengthen U.S. nuclear deterrence so that no one--whether potential adversary or ally--comes away from these deliberations with doubts about the credibility of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
   To this end, I have written to Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen asking that he initiate a comprehensive review of the state of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, infrastructure, management, personnel, training, delivery systems, and related matters. The review would encompass activities under the purview of the Department of Defense and the new, congressionally mandated National Nuclear Security Administration. The objective of this review would be to identify ways the administration and Congress jointly can strengthen our nuclear deterrent in the coming decades, for example, by providing additional resources to the Stockpile Stewardship Program on which Senator DOMENICI is so diligently working, and that exists at our nuclear weapons labs and production plants. I have offered to work with Secretary Cohen on the establishment and conduct of such a review, and I hope Secretary Cohen will promptly agree to my request. 
   Second, the Senate should undertake a major survey of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and associated means of delivery as we approach the new millennium. A key aspect of this review should be an assessment of whether or to what extent U.S. policies and actions (or inactions) contributed to the heightened proliferation that has occurred over the past 7 years. We know that from North Korea to Iran and Iraq, from China to Russia, and from India to Pakistan, the next President will be forced to confront a strategic landscape that in many ways is far more hostile and dangerous than that which President Clinton inherited in January, 1993. 
   I call upon the relevant committees of jurisdiction in the Senate to properly initiate such a survey and plan to complete action within the next 180 days. 
   Finally, I am aware that the administration claims that rejection of the CTBT could damage U.S. prestige and signal a blow to our leadership. American leadership is vital in the world today but with leadership comes responsibility. We have a responsibility to ensure that any arms control agreements presented to the Senate for advice and consent are both clearly in America's security interests and effectively verifiable. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty failed on both of these crucial tests. 
   Today, among many other telephone conversations I had, I talked to former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, a man for whom I have the highest regard, a man who gave real leadership when he was at the Department of Defense, a man who would never advocate a position not in the best national security interests of the United States or in support of our international reputation. He told me he was convinced the treaty was fatally flawed, that it should be defeated, and in fact it would send a clear message to our treaty negotiators and people around the world that treaties that are not verifiable, that are not properly concluded, will not be ratified by the Senate. We will take our responsibility seriously and we will defeat bad treaties when it is in the best interest of our country, our allies, and more importantly for me, our children and their future. 
   I think we have taken the right step today. I note that this vote turned out to be a rather significant vote: 51 Senators voted against this treaty. Not even a majority was for this treaty. To confirm a treaty or ratify a treaty takes, of course, a two-thirds vote, 67 votes. They were not here. They were never here. This treaty should not have been pushed for the past 2 years. It was not ready for consideration and it was unverifiable and therefore would not be ratified. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their participation. I  thought the debate was spirited. It was good on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate the advice and counsel I received on all sides as we have gone through this process. It has not been easy but it is part of the job. I take this job very seriously. I take this vote very seriously. For today, Mr. President, we did the right thing for America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. So I can respond to comments of both Senators, and particularly for questions I was asked by Senator MCCAIN, I had a fixation on trying to get started on this bill today because I had committed to do so. I realize it is late, but I am sure the Senator understands how difficult it is to juggle the schedule. 
   We had originally thought the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be voted on not today but last night or certainly earlier today. I am trying to juggle the appropriations conference reports, too. I was specifically asked by a couple of Senators to have the debate in the morning and then to have the vote at 
   4 o'clock. 
   Later this week, we have to have an interruption for the HUD-VA appropriations conference report. Next week, we will have to have interruptions for the Interior appropriations conference report. I have to keep bringing in the appropriations bills. I realize that it interrupts the flow of the debate. However, that is why I have learned around here the best thing to do is to get something going and just get started, get it up so it is the pending business, and we go about our business. 
   I took particular interest in the Senator's offer that maybe we even consider doing this on the weekend or maybe a Saturday. I think it would get a lot of attention. We are getting down to the end of the session and I have a lot of people pulling on me to do the Religious Persecution Act, the nuclear waste bill, bankruptcy, and trade bills. I need to try to take advantage even of a couple of hours on Wednesday night if we possibly can. 
   If both Senators are willing to at least get started, see if we can get an agreement, see if we can have opening statements, let's get started and we will be back on it at 10:30 in the morning. I will work with both or all sides to make sure this is fully debated and amendments are offered. Remember, we are going to have amendments and we are going to have a lot of discussion. We are going to have a lot of votes. I think it is time to go forward. I hope the Senator will cooperate with me as we try to get that done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will have a full statement on Tuesday. But I did want to get into the RECORD today some of the facts I think are very important for Senators to have access to, some views of a number of important experts. 
   I would entitle this statement with these words, a quote from Churchill: Facts are better than dreams. And the facts in this case argue against this treaty. The underlying premise of this treaty is flawed. The argument is, if we ratify this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, then the rest of the world will be nice and follow suit. 
   Do you really believe that is applicable to North Korea, Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, China, Russia? We are going to act on faith? There are those who will say we must lead, we must show the way, but that is a very dangerous thing to do when you are dealing with something of this importance. 
   Just in the last 2 days, in hearings before the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, it has become apparent that this treaty is flawed, should not be ratified now or in the foreseeable future. When you look at yesterday's testimony of the leaders of the country's three nuclear weapons laboratories, it makes it very clear that, as far as safety and reliability are concerned, without testing at this time we do not have the ability to make sure our weapons are safe and would be reliable if there were a need for them. 
   The headline, even in the New York Times, says, ``Experts Say Test Ban May Impair Nuclear Arms Safety.'' That is a fact. That is a scary fact. Do the American people want us to have nuclear arms that are not tested, that are not safe? I do not think so. So I think we need to be very careful about going forward with a treaty that has the problems this treaty has now, in terms of what it would do and the fact that we do not have the ability to detect or verify what other countries may be doing. Just this past week, the CIA said they could not guarantee they could detect low-level testing in Russia. Then you add to that the testimony of the labs experts. We should defeat this treaty. 
   Let me correct the record, or remind our colleagues and the country a little bit about why we are where we are. Why is this up? Why did we get a unanimous consent agreement to bring up this treaty, debate it, and have a vote? The President has been demanding it for 2 years. In his State of the Union Addresses and on other occasions, he has been saying: Call it up, have a debate, and vote. Quote after quote I have here with me. The President said in remarks on the 50th anniversary of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, August 9, 1999:  
   I ask the Senate ..... to vote for ratification as soon as possible.  
   He has said:  
   ..... give its advice and consent to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year.  
   In his State of the Union Address in 1998, he said:  
   ..... approve the CTBT this year.  
   That was last year.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of the time that has been spent discussing this very important issue, and also the fact there have been several attempts to find ways to limit the debate, and now in view of the vote on the motion to table which was unanimous against tabling it, putting the Senate back to exactly the position we were in before, I think the thing to do at this time is to withdraw this amendment and move forward. 
   I think that is a mistake. I want to say to one and all, this issue will be joined further, and we will find a way for the content of this amendment to be in some legislation and passed through the Congress this year.

   Mr. LOTT. It is my understanding that movement to the House level is not an increase in the NIH budget, is that correct? As I understand it, this would reallocate money within the NIH budget and that this would not be additional funding. This would set aside a portion of NIH research money for those states, Mississippi included, to more fully exploit the opportunities to develop a competitive biomedical research base.

   Mr. LOTT. I will be brief because I know we need to go to final passage. 
   I must say that, amazingly, in a moment we are going to be voting on final passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I think this is the first time in 3 years that we have done that. I know we did not have one last year. I cannot recall for sure about 1997. I know we did in 1996. Regardless, this is the 13th and last of the appropriations bills. We are going to get to final passage. I hope it will pass. 
   I have to extend my congratulations to the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the Senator from Iowa. A lot of people thought we could not get it done, but here we are. I want to say a special thanks to PAUL COVERDELL, who acted as one of my assistants on this matter, working with the whip on our side, and HARRY REID, who did a great job. In fact, I had asked Senator COVERDELL if he would do this every week, and he has respectfully declined. 
   Having said that, following this bill--the last appropriations bill--there will be no further votes this evening, and no votes will occur on Friday of this week. In addition, the Senate will not be in session on Monday, in light of the Columbus Day holiday. 
   On Friday, the Senate will begin consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at 9:30 a.m. Obviously, this is a very important treaty, a very important matter, so I urge my colleagues to participate in the debate tomorrow. I think we have somewhere between 10 and 20 speakers who are going to speak on this tomorrow. I hope the Senators will watch it from their offices or review the debate that occurs on Friday. 
   This evening, the Senate will shortly begin the Agriculture appropriations conference report. Additional debate on that issue will occur this evening. Several votes will occur on Tuesday, October 12, beginning at 5:30. There could be one vote or more. I think it is very possible there could be a couple votes at that time on Tuesday dealing with the Agriculture appropriations conference report and possibly with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  
   So I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. We have had a very successful week. We passed the FAA reauthorization, confirmed two judicial nominations, passed the foreign operations conference report. Now we are hopefully fixed to pass the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and we will file cloture tonight, since it seems it is necessary, on the Agriculture appropriations conference report. 
   The bottom line: No further votes tonight; the next vote, 5:30 on Tuesday. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

If that occurs the prospect of a multi-year aviation reauthorization may disappear and we may have to settle for a simple one-year extension of the Airport Improvement Program.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from South Dakota, the minority leader, in submitting for the RECORD and acknowledging the importance of a letter we received last week from 40 of our Nation's Governors. This letter is distinctly bipartisan and the signatories represent both coastal and inland states. It unequivocally demonstrates strong national support for reinvesting a substantial portion of federal outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas development revenues in coastal conservation and impact assistance; open space and farmland preservation; development and maintenance of federal, state and local parks and recreation areas; and wildlife conservation. The Governors also stressed the importance of recognizing the role of state and local governments in planning and implementing these conservation initiatives. 
   Although the signatories to this letter did not identify specific legislation to which they are lending support, I believe that S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999, of which I am a cosponsor along with 20 other Senators, most nearly achieves the objectives outlined by the Governors. S. 25 has strong bipartisan support and offers Congress the best opportunity to pass legislation this year. 
   I share the belief of these Governors that the 106th Congress has a historic opportunity to demonstrate our solid commitment to natural resource conservation for the benefit of future generations. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join hands in advancing this noble effort. 
   I thank the Governors for their letter. I invite the attention of my colleagues to this very important area which is a win-win-win for those who live in the coastal regions as I do, but also inland Governors who will help us with conservation and preservation.

   With regard to nominations, judicial or otherwise, I am sure the Senate would never use any basis for a vote other than the qualifications and the record of the nominee. And just so the record will be complete, as a matter of fact, of the 19 nominees who have been confirmed this year, 4 of them have been women, 1 of them African American, and 3 of them have been Hispanic. Their records and the kind of judges these men and women would make are the only things that have been a factor with the Senate and are the only things that should ever be a factor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of today's passage of S. 82, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill. Today is a great day for rural America's air passengers. This legislation, now known as the Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1999, will bring much needed air service to under served communities throughout the Nation. It will grant billions of dollars in federal funds to our Nation's small  airports for upgrades, through the Airport Improvements Program (AIP). 
   Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, is to be commended for his superb leadership on this complex and contentious measure. Together with Senator HOLLINGS, their joint efforts moved this bill through the committee, to the Senate floor, and to conference. 
   Also, Senator Slade GORTON's leadership role in this legislation was vital. My friend and Colleague from the State of Washington proved himself pivotal earlier during S. 82 floor consideration. His counterpart, Senator Jay ROCKEFELLER, should also be commended for his efforts to move this bill forward. 
   Rural Americans are the biggest winners with the passage of S. 82. Citizens of under served communities will no longer have to travel hundreds of miles and several hours to board a plane. This legislation gives incentives to domestic air carriers and its affiliates to reach out to these people and serve them conveniently near their homes. Many Americans will be able to travel a reasonable distance to gain access to our Nation's skies and, from there, anywhere they wish to go. 
   I also applaud the hard work of Senator FRIST of Tennessee. He added provisions to S. 82 to expand small community air service. His dedicated efforts ensured that under served cities like Knoxville, Chattanooga and Bristol/Johnson are now in a position to receive additional or expanded air service. Likewise, his efforts will ensure that several under served regions in my home state of Mississippi, such as Gulfport-Biloxi, Tupelo, or Jackson, will become eligible to compete for more flights. 
   The major policy changes in S. 82 led to hard fought, but honest disagreements. I have enormous respect for the efforts of Senators John WARNER and Charles GRASSLEY as they diligently advocated for their constituents and their respective states. This honest debate and willingness to work together to achieve common goals is what makes it exciting to serve in the United States Senate. 
   Throughout the last twelve months, my home state of Mississippi has received federal support from the AIP to make needed physical improvements. A portion of these funds went to the Meridian Airport Authority to rehabilitate the taxiway pavement. Other funds were allocated to the John C. Stennis International Airport in Hancock County to extend and light existing taxiways. These enhancements are needed. And this bill will ensure that the AIP will continue uninterrupted for the next three years. AIP's reauthorization within S. 82 will allow Mississippi to continue to receive funds for essential enhancements for the upcoming year. I look forward to working with the airport authorities in my home state to make sure that the right improvements are made at the right airports. This is essential to aviation safety and economic growth.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Democratic leader is still here. I know he had urgent meetings he had to go to. We needed to get that final recorded vote and pass that bill. I appreciate his patience on that. Also, I think he and I both agree that we want to advise Members on both sides of the aisle and all concerned that we are discussing how to proceed with the vote that is now in place on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   After we discussed our concerns about how and when to proceed on that, then there started to be a lot of speculation on both sides of the aisle and all around town. I think it is important for Members to just calm down and relax. We need to have the ability to communicate with each other and think about what is in the best interest of the Senate and our country and weigh all of the evidence that is now available to us. 
   We do have a unanimous consent agreement that we will proceed to this issue, and we will have a vote after the requisite number of hours, probably on the 12th, or perhaps the morning of the 13th before we get to final passage. Nothing more than that has been done. 
   We will have to work through this, and we will certainly have to work with our respective caucuses and the White House, 
   because this is a very important national security and foreign policy issue, and we will also have to be involved in the consideration in how we proceed on this issue. 
   I think that is what we need to say at this point. Nothing beyond that has been agreed to, suggested, or called for by the President, or by any Senator, and all we are trying to do is communicate and see if we are proceeding in the best interests of all concerned. 
   Would the Senator like to add to that?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield under his reservation to respond, let me say again, I appreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides of the aisle, from the Judiciary Committee, and other Senators who have interest in these nominations. It has been a very delicate balance to work through a process where we could get these nominations confirmed. 
   The nominations of Mr. Marrero from, I believe, New York, and Mr. Lorenz from California have not been controversial. They have been cleared for quite some time. We had the unfortunate situation with regard to the nomination of Ted Stewart where we had a cloture vote, which I think both sides would prefer not to have happened. There are reasons for it. But I think it is important we not start down that trail. Both sides have indicated we do not want to start having cloture votes to determine the confirmation of judges. Then also there is the nomination of Mr. Fisher for the Ninth Circuit. 
   So we have here a process where we can have a voice vote on two of them and some debate and votes on the other three: White, Stewart, and Fisher. That is a significant undertaking. That will get us into the process where judges--certainly judges who are not controversial--will not be held up because of controversial judges in other areas. So I just wanted to kind of go through that whole process. 
   With regard to the other two nominations Senator DASCHLE asks about, I will continue to work with the Democratic leader as well as other Members on his side of the aisle and on my side of the aisle in scheduling executive nominations. I have to go through a process where I have to notify Members that a judicial nomination may be called up and see if there are problems with it, see if that can be worked out, see if we are going to need an extended period of time of debate, see if there is a threatened filibuster. 
   So I will work, as I have in the past, to see if we can get these nominations cleared so we can move forward. I will continue to do that. I will do that on specifically the two that have been mentioned. I will try to find a way to have them considered. I cannot confirm at this point when or how that will be done, but I will continue to work on it. 
   That is one of the reasons that moving these other judges is important. Because it takes time to get the nominations cleared. When you have five that you are close to getting cleared, once you get those out of the way, then you can focus your attention on the remaining judges on the calendar. 
   By the way, I understand there are other basically noncontroversial judges on whom the Judiciary Committee will be meeting, maybe in the next week or two, and there will be more judges on the calendar. So we want to keep moving the ones that can be cleared because there are districts and circuits around the country that do need these judges to be confirmed. I think we can get this request agreed to. It will be positive, and we will be able to continue to work together. 
   I hope that is helpful in responding to Senator DASCHLE's question.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to offer this Senate resolution, expressing sympathy by the Congress for the victims of the devastating earthquake in Taiwan on September 21. A similar resolution was introduced in the House and passed yesterday as House Resolution 297. 
   I personally want to express my sadness and deepest sympathy for the many victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Taiwan so unexpectedly last week, causing much destruction and many deaths. I ask that the Senate convey to the people of Taiwan our most sincere sympathies about the tragic losses that they have suffered, in both lives and property. With this resolution we call upon the Clinton administration and other members of the international community to do everything possible to assist Taiwan in its time of need so that it may recover rapidly from its terrible losses due to this act of nature. 
   Accordingly, Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to join with me in expressing our sympathy and support to the people of Taiwan during this tragic and devastating time.

We have had to deal with droughts, ice storms, floods, and everything but the plague and locusts. I know how difficult it is for people who are faced with disasters such as the one with which North Carolina is now dealing. I know how tough it is for the people who are trying to dig out from under mud, with dead carcasses, and all that goes with disasters. 
   All of us extend our sympathy to the people of North Carolina and want to reassure them that the Federal Government will do its part, as we always do when people are hit by natural disaster.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want the Senate to know we are still working to get an agreement to take up consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We originally wanted to bring it up next week on October 6. That was objected to by the Democratic leadership. They indicated they thought more time was needed and they needed more time designated for debate. We have now offered to begin on October 8, next Friday, with debate. The debate would go up to 14 hours. We will conclude action on that treaty no later than the close of business on Tuesday, October 12. 
   We are willing to agree to more time on behalf of the leader's amendments if that is necessary. I believe the Democratic leader has indicated his willingness to go to the treaty debate on the 8th and be on it the 12th and conclude it by the 12th, but we are still working on details. 
   There were statements made by the President of the United States in 1998, I believe in his State of the Union Address, and again in 1999, that he wanted the Senate to take up the treaty. I have statements from a number of Democratic Members of the Congress calling for this to be done. 
   We have said to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle we don't think this is a good treaty; we think it puts safety in jeopardy; we think it puts us in a weakened condition internationally; and we think it is dangerous. However, since there have been calls and demands for a vote, we have offered to vote, and we have offered two different dates. We have offered time and more time. 
   I am a little bit puzzled why the Democrats now are saying: We don't want to vote. I presume they are saying it because it may fail. The Senate will have a debate, and the Senate will vote. If there is not a two-thirds vote, it is over; it is defeated. 
   It is hard for me to understand. Do they want it or not? Do they want to debate or not? Do they want to vote or not? I think it shows a little bit about what has been going on all along. 
   I want to assure the Senate, there will be some hearings in the Armed Services Committee with experts in this field. There will be plenty of information on the record. If they want a vote, let's vote; if they don't, let's move on. I don't want to hear more about it for a while. 
   Having said that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I further ask consent that on Monday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m. with Senators speaking for up to 10 minutes each, and the time equally divided between the two leaders, or their designees.

   Mr. LOTT. I remind Senators that on Monday, at 5:30 p.m., the Senate will proceed to the Transportation appropriations conference report, and a vote will occur immediately on adoption of that conference report, so there will be at least one recorded vote at 5:30 on Monday, and it is on the Transportation appropriations conference report. I think a lot of credit, once again,  goes to our Transportation appropriations subcommittee members. Senator SHELBY of Alabama has done a great job with a very important bill. 
   There may be other votes. There could be a vote on or in relation to relevant amendments on the FAA reauthorization bill, since that bill will be debated early in the day Monday. It could be that an amendment or amendments will be available for consideration at that time. But I wanted Senators to be on notice we do have the one vote for sure. 
   Also, all Senators should be aware we will convene at 12 noon and we will have a period for morning business until 12:30. We will take up the FAA reform bill the remainder of that day, then, on Monday, until 4:30, when we will go to, I believe it is, the judicial nominations discussion. We will very likely have recorded votes on Tuesday morning, and then we do have an agreement, I believe, to have recorded votes stacked on three nominations at 2:15 on Tuesday. 
   For the remainder of the week, the Senate will continue debate on the FAA reform bill and complete its action on Tuesday. Then we will return to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill and consider nominations and conference reports that are available. I understand that the Agriculture appropriations conference report will be available on Monday. We could have that vote Monday or Tuesday, if a recorded vote is necessary. We are hoping the Interior appropriations bill will be on the heels of that one, and I believe we are still waiting for the foreign operations conference report. We will interrupt or take as quick action as possible on the conference reports once they are received and we get notification that we intend to have a vote. 
   I do have one further unanimous consent request. I wanted the distinguished Senator from South Dakota to be here. We have continued to work to see if we can get an agreement to vote on the test ban treaty.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 6, the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of Treaty Document 105-28 and the document be placed on the Executive Calendar, if not previously reported by the committee. 
   I should note, that is something that was requested by the Democratic leadership, and we think it is a reasonable request. 
   I further ask consent that at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, October 8, the Senate begin consideration of Treaty Document 105-28 and the treaty be advanced through the various parliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification, and there be one relevant amendment in order to the resolution of ratification to be offered by each leader. 
   There was a request for additional time for that debate. Therefore, I ask consent that there be a total of 14 hours of debate on the treaty itself, to be equally divided in the usual form, and no other amendments, reservations, conditions, declarations, statements, understandings, or motions be in order, and that amendments be filed at the desk 24 hours before they are called up. 
   I think it is fair. If we are going to have an amendment on our side and the other side, we need some notification of its content. 
   There was a thought we might need additional time for discussion on those amendments. Therefore, I ask there be a time limitation of 4 hours equally divided on each amendment, in addition to the 14 hours, for a total of 18 hours over a 2-day period, but spread over a period of time that I believe will run about 6 days. 
   I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time and disposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on the adoption of the resolution of ratification, as amended, if amended, all without any intervening action or date.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Democratic leader has agreed to this request. We have worked back and forth now over 2 or 3 days. This is a fair approach, especially with the two leaders' amendments, if they are needed, and a guarantee we will file them in time to take a look at them. 
   It is serious. I take it very seriously. I do want to make the Senator aware that at least one chairman has notified me he intends to have three hearings before the final vote--Senator WARNER of the Armed Services Committee, which certainly has an interest in this because of what it does involve, weapons. 
   I believe--I cannot confirm the exactness of these dates or that they will be able to do them all--he is thinking in terms of hearings on the 6th, 9th, and 12th, and that is a committee which has a great deal of jurisdiction. I do not know yet if Senator HELMS plans additional hearings before the 12th, although certainly that is a possibility now that we have a time agreed to.

That will be helpful.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond on that. 
   I do think that a critical part of our decision involves the armed services aspect of it. The review of nuclear weapons--what their condition is, what it will be, what it means for the future--that is at the heart of the concerns that a lot of Senators have, including this Senator. I have enough background, having been on the Armed Services Committee in the House and the Senate, to be able to assess, as most Senators, 
   after reading the documentation, the ramifications around the world. 
   But if we cannot be assured of the safety and the reliability of these weapons, then that goes right to the heart of the whole issue. Before you get to discussion about what it means to Pakistan or India or North Korea, you need to know what is going to happen over a period of time in terms of safety, the risk to people in the areas, or the surety that we will have these weapons if, in fact, we do need them. 
   I say to Senator WARNER, you and I have discussed this already. I know that is the crux of what you are saying.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been working quite some time now to get a final agreement on how to bring up the FAA reauthorization bill. This is important legislation. We have tried to extend the time, and there has been resistance to that. We have tried to direct a conference; there has been resistance to that. 
   So it is important we have a couple days to have debate relevant amendments and deal with this issue. We are working on both sides of the aisle, and I think we have resolved most of the questions. If there is any one remaining problem, I would like to flesh it out so we can deal with it. 
   I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, October 4, it be in order for the majority leader to proceed to the consideration of S. 82, the FAA reauthorization bill, that the majority and minority managers of the bill be authorized to modify the committee amendments and, further, that only aviation-related amendments and relevant second-degree amendments be in order to the bill.

   The manager of the bill and the ranking member, Senator MCCAIN and Senator HOLLINGS, are really anxious to go forward with this. There is an understanding on both sides of the aisle that this is very important legislation we have to complete. 
   We have worked through problems that Senator ROBB had, Senator ABRAHAM, a number of Senators who have amendments, but they will be able to offer those relevant amendments under this agreement. 
   I hope later on today we can lock in this agreement and be on this bill then next Monday, and after a reasonable time for debate and amendments, surely we can finish it by the close of business on Tuesday. 
   Also, Mr. President, there had been an indication that some amendment might be offered on the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill on an unrelated matter but one with which, frankly, we are prepared to go forward.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, three responses: First, if additional time is needed to have a full debate, I think we can work that out. Second, with regard to the leader's objection, I 
   guess to the language in the last paragraph, we can talk about that and probably can work out an agreement to drop that. Third, there have been lots of hearings on this issue over a long period of time and a lot of individual briefings by Members on both sides of the aisle. I think the Senator would be surprised at the amount of knowledge Members have on this subject. 
   Finally, there is one sure way it will be defeated--that is, not to ever take it up. I would like us to get a time as soon as possible, within the very near future, and have that debate and have a vote.

   With regard to the question of the Senator from Virginia, I believe the issue that is so important to him is addressed in the bill the way he understands it to be. But if it is not or if there is any problem, under this unanimous consent request, relevant amendments on aviation would be in order and any amendment that he or the other Senator from Virginia wishes to offer with regard to this matter would be in order and would be protected.

   Mr. LOTT. I would like to bring up the nuclear waste bill. I think this is a major environmental issue. It is very important to a number of States, I believe, including the Senator's State of Minnesota. 
   There has been an indication there may be a desire for a filibuster and perhaps the Democrat leadership would not support cloture on this very important issue. If that is the case, then I would not be inclined to file cloture on it on Friday, giving us additional time to see if we can work out an agreement or accommodation as to how to bring up that very important issue. 
   I do not know how many States have nuclear waste sitting in open cooling pools or how many people have looked at the need to 
   address this problem. I believe a large number of Senators probably as many as two-thirds or more, believe we need to move this legislation. I want to find a way to do that.

   Mr. LOTT. We certainly know the Senator from Minnesota has views on that or amendments he wants to offer. One of the things we are planning on doing, I say to the Senator--and Senator DASCHLE may want to talk about it--is to bring up the sanctions bill. I do not know whether or not the Senator's amendments will be in order to that. It does relate to food and agriculture. He may have something to say or some amendment he wants to offer on that. 
   We have not agreed on a time. You may wind up objecting to it, but I think it is high time we have some debate around here and some thought about how we deal with these unilateral sanctions of countries, how we use food and medicine in that area. We had a vote on it in Agriculture. It is still very controversial. I have indicated it is my intent and it is my hope, if we can find a way, to bring that bill to the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. I have not had an opportunity to talk personally, directly, to the Senator from Arizona, but I am informed by his senior aide that he is committed to living with the language that the Senator from New York is familiar with, and that also the Senator from South Carolina, the ranking Democrat, has indicated he will comply with that. And based on the assurance I received, then I would work to make sure that understanding was lived up to. Whether you agree with the final result or not, I will make sure that what your understanding is on the part I have been involved in would be honored.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to pay special tribute to the passing of a 91-year-old Mississippian whose generosity, hard work, and commitment to education touched the hearts and consciences of many all across this Nation. It is the story of a smalltown laundress, Osceola McCarty of Hattiesburg, MS, who lived a quiet life in the Pine Belt region of my State until her $150,000 donation to the University of Southern Mississippi brought her national attention. McCarty's gift established a scholarship to be directed to African American students enrolling at the University of Southern Mississippi who clearly demonstrate financial need. 
   For a woman who rarely left her home, except for trips to the local market and, of course, church, the notoriety certainly brought a change to the lifestyle of Ms. McCarty. She was featured on a CBS television show as one of the ``10 Most Fascinating people of 1995.'' She received a Presidential Citizens Medal, an honorary doctoral degree from Harvard University, as well as numerous other outstanding citizen awards. She was invited to cities throughout the country to share her story of thriftiness and generosity. 
   Ms. McCarty received a sixth grade education and worked her entire life in Hattiesburg, MS, washing and ironing clothes. She has made it possible for others to have the education that she never had. In her book, ``Simple Wisdom for Rich Living,'' McCarty reflects on long, hard days of laboring over steaming kettles of clothes and standing over an ironing board. She stated that she loved her work and she only spent what she needed to. After all the years of hard work and dedication, Ms. McCarty managed to donate her significant gift to the University of Southern Mississippi. ``A smart person plans for the future,'' is what she said when she received numerous bits of recognition. Then she said, ``You never know what kind of emergency will come up, and you can't rely on the government to meet all of your needs. You have to take responsibility for yourself.'' 
   Osceola McCarty will be deeply missed. She was a humble, modest lady. I had the pleasure of bringing her into the majority leader's office. She never got over the fact that people were so surprised and impressed that she saved $150,000 and she gave it to the University of Southern Mississippi. She thought she was just doing the right thing. Her life was an exemplary one that touched us all. We are very proud of her. God rest her soul. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate was poised to take action on Senator ABRAHAM's Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This important measure is aimed at promoting the growth of the ``E-conomy''. Senator ABRAHAM has worked tirelessly over the last several months to get this bill through the Senate. 
   Unfortunately after gaining agreement to bring this bill to the floor today, our Democratic colleagues decided to muck up this legislation. They insisted on attaching non-germane amendments to this crucial ``e-commerce'' legislation. Measures that have absolutely nothing to do with Senator ABRAHAM's high-technology initiative. Once again, the ``do nothing Democrats'' are at work stopping at every point significant legislative momentum. 
   The Senate could easily pass Senator ABRAHAM's bill. It is simple and straight-forward. It promotes jobs, stimulates the economy, and creates savings and opportunities for America's consumers. Instead, in an effort to create yet another log-jam, the Minority Leader is looking for a vehicle to attach every Democratic proposal under the sun. 
   The other side of the aisle, which claims to promote electronic commerce, is doing everything it can to quash Senator ABRAHAM's electronic signatures bill--as well as other important legislation. It is a continuing pattern and practice of the Democrats to deny the American people any legislative progress. The Democrats claim that they want this bill and that they are pro-technology, yet they are doing everything they can to kill this bill. 
   Mr. President, S. 761 establishes the legal certainty of electronic signatures for interstate commercial transactions. It is an interim solution needed until states adopt the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). UETA was recently adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Over the next several years, it will undergo state-by-state consideration--similar to the process followed in implementing the Uniform Commercial Code. The states, high technology and other commercial sectors support Senator ABRAHAM's common sense legislation because it validates the use of electronic authentication technology. A tool that will help the electronic marketplace flourish in the 21st Century. 
   The Administration, not once but twice, formally noted its support for the electronic signatures measure reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee. Both the Commerce Department's letter of support and the Executive Office of the President's Statement of Administration Position were previously entered into the RECORD. Given the overwhelming support for S. 761, I am surprised and bewildered that the Administration has been working behind the scenes to weaken this measure instead of pushing harder to get the Commerce Committee-reported bill, which the White House supported--passed. 
   Every day, more and more businesses and consumers are conducting their important commercial transactions over the Internet. The World Wide Web, more than any other communications medium, allows users to promptly and efficiently locate vendors, evaluate goods and services, compare pricing, and complete purchases. S. 761 is good for business, good for consumers, and good for the overall economy. 
   I am dismayed and once again disappointed that our Democratic colleagues have thrown yet another monkey wrench into the legislative process. Let's stop playing games and get the people's business done. Let's pass Senator ABRAHAM's electronic signatures bill on its merits--without tacking on non-germane amendments that they know will kill the bill. 
   If my colleagues from the other side of the aisle are really for the New Economy, they will stop these shenanigans and let us pass a clean Millennium Digital Commerce Act.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today Chairman CHAFEE has introduced legislation providing for the reauthorization of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. I appreciate the leadership that the chairman has taken in sponsoring this bipartisan bill, and anticipate that it will move quickly through the legislative process. 
   I have been a strong supporter of the Foundation and the programs and activities it undertakes to further conservation and management of our nation's fish and wildlife resources from the beginning. Created by Congress in 1984, the Foundation has used its relationship with government, private, and corporate stakeholders to foster interagency cooperation and coordination. It has also brought private sector involvement, initiative, imagination, and technology to bear in solving conservation problems. 
   Mr. President, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act requires that all federal money appropriated to the Foundation be matched by contributions from non-federal sources, such as: corporations, State and local government agencies, foundations and individuals. The Foundation's operating policy is to raise a match of at least 2 to 1, to maximize leverage for our federal funds. The Foundation takes the appropriated money and places it directly into conservation projects. What does this mean? This means that for every federally appropriated dollar we give the Foundation, an average of $3.17 in on-the-ground conservation takes place. This is something we all should take credit for. 
   Mr. President, one of the things that distinguishes the Foundation from other conservation groups, is that its efforts yield results in the field, and that its projects include its trademark characteristics of partnership building, public-private coordination, community involvement, and sustainable economics. The Foundation has worked with over 700 agencies, universities, businesses and conservation groups, both large and small, over the last decade. These factors have helped the Foundation become one of the most effective conservation organizations in the nation. The Foundation's projects are all peer reviewed by agency staff, state resource officials, and other professionals in the natural resource field, and there is a process to solicit comments from members of Congress concerning grants in a member's district or state. 
   In Mississippi the Foundation has supported many local habitat restoration projects aimed specifically at helping private landowners restore wetlands and riparian areas to improve habitat for waterfowl and shorebirds. Further, the Foundation is an important partner in the work that local groups are going to market the conservation programs of the farm bill in Mississippi. With funds from the Foundation, local conservation groups are partnering with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to reach farmers who had not participated in conservation programs. Finally, the Foundation is playing a key role in restoring bottomland hardwood habitats critical to migrating neotropical songbirds and other water-dependent wildlife species by working with utility companies to support tree planting throughout the region. These efforts all help in regaining some the state's original wetlands habitats. 
   Mr. President, we are all aware of our deficit reduction challenges and the needs and concerns of our many constituencies. The Foundation provides us with a unique opportunity to meet these challenges and needs. 
   Mr. President, this bill should be acted upon quickly, and the chairman can count on my strong support for the bill's adoption.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I did speak at length on Friday afternoon on this issue of education. I will not repeat everything I said then. I do have a unanimous consent request I want to  make momentarily. First, I will make some opening remarks. 
   I am the son of a schoolteacher. I went to public schools all my life. So did my wife. So did my children. I care a great deal about quality education, public education, private and parochial education. I will take no backdoor approach to education. We have to have quality education in America. It also has to be safe and drug free. 
   There is a fundamental difference about how we do that. The Democrats think the answer is here in Washington, that nameless and faceless bureaucrats in Washington, DC, know better what should be done in education in Bangor, ME, or Pascagoula, MS. I reject that. I have faith in the students, the teachers, the parents, the administrators, the local officials, and the State officials to do what is right for education. 
   I may or may not have been right on some educational issues over the years. I voted for a separate Department of Education. I voted for it. I do not want too much revisionist history to be made this afternoon. When I was in the House of Representatives, I did that, and I took a pounding for it. My constituents did not agree with me. They did not think we needed a separate Department of Education. I argued at the time that it was being overrun and overwhelmed by the Department it was in, HEW--Health, Education, and Welfare. It was blocked by the other two issues and did not get the attention it should have. I did that. 
   I must say, I do not see where a separate Department of Education has done a whole lot of good for education in America. The education scores have continued to go down, although recently some of the test scores may have gone up. 
   When my children finished high school, I felt they did not have as good an education as I did when I finished high school in Pascagoula, MS. By the way, they went to two of the best high schools in America: Thomas Jefferson High School in Northern Virginia and Annandale High School in Northern Virginia. Yet when they got to the University of Mississippi, even though they had been to the public schools of Fairfax County, they did not have as good a background and preparation for college as some of the students in Biloxi, MS. 
   What is going on here? I have been through this education thing for a long time. I feel strongly about it. We must have a better education system in America. What we have is not working. What the Democrats are advocating is the same old thing in the same old box. It will not work. We have to come up with different ideas, new ideas. 
   I repeat one example I went through last Friday. Why is it that elementary and secondary education in America is way down the list of elementary and secondary education programs of the world? I have seen some statistics where we are 17th, and yet higher education is rated the best in the world. How can that be, that elementary and secondary education is not what it should be and higher education is excellent? 
   I have a couple suggestions for you. One, when you finish high school in America, you have a choice of where you go. You can go to work, if you have been in a vocational education program in high school; you can go to a community college or junior college, a technology training program or job training program; you can go to a college, a university, a State university; you can go to a parochial university; or you can go, Heaven forbid, to Harvard if that is what you choose. Every student in America, everyone who finishes high school, can get a college education--with scholarships and loans. 
   I was a beneficiary of what was then known as the NDEA loan. When my own family fell apart, I was trying to get a law degree. I held down two jobs and got an NDEA loan, thank the Lord. It helped me get an education. I am for loans. You also have grants and supplemental grants. With the combination of jobs and the Work-Study Program--jobs, grants, loans, scholarships--you can go to school. 
   Every student may not be able to go to Harvard. Some may have to go to local community college where, by the way, you can get a great education. The community college system in America is fantastic. You have a choice, but not if you are in high school. If you live in a middle school district in a neighborhood, you have to go to the middle school in that neighborhood. If it is no good it does not make any difference. It does not make any difference if it is drug infested. It does not make any difference if it is violence prone. You have to go there, even though there might be a good quality public school right down the street. 
   Right here in the District of Columbia, you have some good high schools. Yet, if the parents want their children to go or the students themselves want to go to a good high school, they are told: No, you can't do that. That does not seem fair. Some of the teachers union people say: Well, the bad schools might not make it. Right. If the school is not doing its job, then get out of the way. Choice is one of reasons we have much better higher education in America. 
   The other one is financial aid, because if you want to go to college, you get a loan. But you do not get a loan if you want to help your sixth-grade student get a computer or if you want to help them with some of their other needs. You cannot have a Coverdell A+ savings account for elementary and secondary education. Oh, no. No, we can't have that. They might choose to save their money and put their students in some other school. 
   So I think we need to think about those differences in how we can improve education overall. 
   Also, I want to make this point. There is talk about, oh, how Republicans are going to starve education. That is total baloney. In fact, in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill that will be on the floor this week, the Republicans have a half a billion dollars more for education than the President's budget--surprise, surprise. How could that be? As a matter of fact, in recent years--I will give the statistics here in a moment--Republicans have provided for a 27-percent increase for education. 
   We are not stingy on education. We want education to have the money it needs. We don't want it to be able to waste money on programs, but we want to do it differently. We don't want it to be eaten up here in Washington, DC, where the bureaucracy takes a bite out of it, and a little dribbles down to Atlanta, and a little dribbles down to Jackson, and eventually it gets 
   down to where the student is. No. 
   We say we have faith in the local and State governments and the teachers, the administrators at the local level. We would like it to go down to where the rubber meets the road. Let them make the choices. If they want to put that money into computers, great. If they want to put it into elementary education, or if they want to put it into remedial reading or remedial math, or if they want to fix a roof, great. 
   Of course, the answer again for the Democrats is, we should get into the school building business; the Federal Government should start being in charge of repairing local school building roofs, by the way, at a time when every State in the Nation--every one--has a surplus. 
   Every State has a surplus, and some people say: Well, it might be a few dollars--$34 billion. So how about local and State governments being in charge of building schools? If we start down that road, if we start being in charge of the roofs and building the buildings at the Federal level, we will have to build every one in America. I think once again it will bring more control to Washington, and we should be directing it the other way. 
   I would like to ask consent to add a modification to our resolution we have pending. I do now ask unanimous consent that the pending resolution be modified with changes I send to the desk. 
   Before the Chair rules, let me say to the Senate, these are modifications regarding the vetoed tax bill and all the education benefits that bill would have extended to the American people if it had been signed into law by the President.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the Senator for putting it in a reservation in that way. He would like to have a chance to read it over. 
   This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The Democrats are stating their sense of the Senate on education issues. We have our resolution, and we would like to do the same thing. So I hope they will review the language we have in this modification and agree that it could be added to our resolution. But in the meantime, let me state what is in this resolution. 
   So here is the untold story. This modification, that may be objected to, would simply spell out what was in the tax cut bill the Republicans passed--the Congress passed and sent to the President, and he vetoed it. What has not been told is that there were a lot of education benefits in that bill. 
   In fact, it was interesting to me that 1 day after the President vetoed that bill, providing considerable new incentives for education, the Democrats complained about this Congress' performance on education. But they raised not a single voice to protest the unwise veto when you take into consideration the tremendously enhanced education for millions of Americans that was included in that bill. 
   The President's veto denies 14 million American families 
   from participating in the education savings accounts--that is what I was referring to a while ago--to allow parents to save for their children's education needs at the elementary and secondary level, which they cannot do now. These accounts would have generated $12 billion for parents to provide tutors, pay for books, buy computers, send children to afterschool instruction, and pay for tuition at private schools if their public school failed to make the grade. Twenty million Americans children would have benefited, but the President said no to that. 
   The President's veto denies 1 million students savings to make college more affordable. Our bill would have provided 1 million students in-State prepaid tuition plans. And my State of Mississippi is one of those; I think the State of Maine may be one of those, and a number of other States. They are being denied this prepaid tuition plan which would provide significant tax relief to make college more affordable. 
   Why shouldn't parents be able to save in advance for their own children's college tuition? The financial crunch for college would be eased for 1 million students, but the President said no. 
   The President's veto denies 1 million workers receiving education assistance through their employers. This is something that I believe the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, has advocated for years. In today's competitive economy, education is the key to maintaining skilled workers. One million American workers would have had access to better education or more education, but the President said no. 
   The President has made college more expensive for millions of Americans. The Taxpayer Relief and Refund Act would have allowed recent college graduates to deduct the interest on their student loans. I would have liked to have had that when I graduated. For my own NDEA loan, the interest rate was not that high then, but it would have helped in paying that loan back. This provision is particularly critical for young people trying to hold down their first job and paying off their college debt at the same time. College would have been more affordable for millions of American students, but once again the President said no. 
   The American people would have benefited also by the help given in this bill to schoolteachers. Our bill allowed every elementary and secondary school teacher in America to receive tax relief for their professional development expenses. 
   My mother taught the first grade through the sixth grade but generally first grade. This is something that would have been helpful to her when she was teaching those 19 years. This bill would have made professional development less expensive, but the President said no; that, once again, the teachers should not have this benefit. 
   So I wanted to point out several educational features that are in this bill. All I am trying to add to our resolution is this information so people will be aware of it. 
   With regard to our commitment to education, in the bill that will be coming to the floor--and in bills that have come to the floor in recent years--we have raised the Pell grant funding for our Nation's poorest students to historically high levels. We have increased funding for our Nation's disadvantaged schoolchildren, thanks to the leadership of Senator GREGG of New Hampshire and others. And we have raised the funding by $2 billion over the last 3 years for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Our commitment to our Nation's disabled children certainly outstrips the President, who recommended funding levels this year that do not even keep pace with inflation. 
   Funding for education has increased by 27 percent since 1994. We will continue moving forward. We will continue to provide adequate funding for education. We will continue to work for innovative ways to improve education, and we will have a bill on the floor this very week that puts money where our mouths are. We are not interested just in saying what the President didn't do or what the Democrats didn't do. We are interested in getting the job done. That may mean doing some things differently from the way they have been done in the past. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

The education issue that was being discussed earlier by Senator DASCHLE, Senator GREGG, and Senator KENNEDY, and others who will be commenting in a few minutes, those two issues will be considered back-to-back on Monday. 
   There will, obviously, be no further votes today. The next votes will occur at 5:30 on Monday. As it now stands, there will be two votes at that time. 
   The Senate has done good work this week. In addition to completing action on the VA-HUD appropriations bill, after a lot of delay and unnecessary obstruction, in my opinion, we were able to complete the Interior appropriations bill, and we also passed, by an overwhelming vote, the defense authorization conference report for the year--a good bill. Senator WARNER and his Armed Services Committee members, Senator THURMOND, Senator LEVIN, did an excellent job on that bill. I certainly expect and hope the President will sign the defense authorization conference report and, hopefully, the Interior Committee conference will get underway on Monday, and the VA-HUD conference as well. 
   That leaves only one appropriations bill to be considered in the Senate before all 13 of them will be completed. I believe we are well ahead of where we have been in many years in getting that done. It is actually possible that we could get the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill up by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week and either complete it before the end of the fiscal year or within a day of that, and then, of course, go to conference. 
   Will it be easy? No. I am sure it is going to be an interesting debate, but that is as it should be. I look forward to completing that work and moving forward with the appropriations conference reports. I hope there will be one or two conference reports that might be available on Monday. Whenever they become available, we will consider them that day or the next day. Energy and water is close to being completed, I believe, and Agriculture is still in the mill. We hope to get those done. 
   I do want to emphasize that I think the way we worked out handling this education issue is much better than having it on the VA-HUD appropriations bill. It does not relate to the VA-HUD bill. I did not think it should have been offered on that appropriations bill, even though it was offered as a sense of the Senate. It is better to handle it the way we have agreed to do it. 
   Senator DASCHLE seemed to question whether we intended to go to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I have been saying for weeks we intend to do it. As soon as the committee reports it out, we will have it on the floor as soon as the rules allow. I have been saving next week for its consideration. Education amendments, I am sure, will be offered next week when this bill is considered in the Senate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to comment a bit about education. First, let me lay down a predicate about myself. I feel very strongly about the need for quality, safe, and drug-free education in America. We have lost our edge in education. Our kids are not getting as good an education as they should. In fact, I do not think they are getting as good an education as we were getting in the fifties and sixties. There has unfortunately been a steady decline in our schools. While some schools are doing a little better and some scores are, in many areas our schools are not what they should be. 
   I said three things: Quality, safe, drug-free schools. We have a lot of work to do in these areas. 
   I will not stand second to any Member of the Senate when it comes to feeling strongly about education and advocating on behalf of education, but it has to be done in the right way. 
   What has happened is the education establishment is firmly entrenched in the status quo. They believe that we should stay in this box, and we should not change it and, by the way, it should be run from Washington. That is not the answer, in my opinion. 
   I want to make this clear: While I think we should have choice in education, I am a product of public education from the first grade through the second, third, and fourth grades where I went to school at Duck Hill, MS, and I had better teachers in the second, third, and fourth grades in Duck Hill, MS, than I had the rest of my life. They were probably better than most people have had in these very fancy and better funded schools. Those teachers loved their students. They worked hard and taught us the basics. I have never forgotten them, and I appreciate what they did. 
   I went to public school all the way through college and law school. So did my wife, so did my son, and so did my daughter. So when some Senators get up and pontificate that we cannot allow students to have choice, that we have to save public education--let me be clear, I want public education. I want every student, regardless of religion, income level, race, sex, or anything else, to get a good education. But the tragedy is that that may not 
   always be in a particular school. If a public school in your neighborhood is not doing the job, you ought to be able to leave. 
   Some people say if that happens, the bad schools will fail. Right. It is called competition. Produce, give quality education, drug-free and safe, or get out of the business. 
   To tell students--intelligent students, needy students, poor students--they have to go to this school no matter what is wrong. Why is it in America that our elementary and secondary education is ranked 17th in the world and yet our higher education is No. 1 in the world? What is the difference? Why are we doing so poorly at the elementary and secondary level and doing so well in higher education? 
   There are a couple of simple answers. First of all, when you finish high school, rich or poor, whatever State you live in, you have a choice: You can go to work if you have had vocational education in high school, or you can go to additional training. You can go to a community college, you can go to a State university, you can go to a parochial college, you can go out of State, you can go to Harvard. You get to choose what fits your needs. But in elementary and secondary education, oh, no, you have to do it the way we tell you in this box. No choice. That is one problem. 
   The second problem is financial support. I am from a poor, blue-collar family. When I was in college, I worked and got a loan which, by the way, I paid back 1 year after I graduated. I could not have made it, though, if I had not been able to work for the university and get loans. 
   In America--and I hope every student in America and every parent hears me now--in America, when every child finishes high school, they can get a college education. No doubt about it. Some people say: I come from a family with no money. Hey, I was in a family with no money. At one point, I had no family. But I got a loan. Other students can get a grant or a supplemental grant or a State scholarship, a private scholarship. The financial aid is there. Every student can get an education in America. 
   There is financial aid when you go to college but not when you are in elementary and secondary school. Senator COVERDELL wants to remedy that. He wants to allow parents to save for their children's education so that the financial support will be there to choose a different school if you want to, to help you with the books, to help you get a computer, to help you get a uniform if that is what you need--choice and financial opportunity. 
   I want to add this: I am the son of a schoolteacher, and I still act like one sometimes. At times, my staff brings in a letter which has bad grammar. I feel a little guilty, but I start marking on it: This is surplus language; this is not correct grammar. 
   My mother taught for 19 years. So I care about education. I worked for 3 years of my life at the University of Mississippi. I worked in the placement office helping students get jobs when they graduated, and I worked in the financial aid office. I was the one who  added up the numbers to see if a student got a grant or a loan. I met with the students. I handled the scholarships. The best scholarship in the university was a Carrier scholarship. I interviewed the students who applied for it. 
   When I finished undergraduate school, I worked in the placement bureau of the law school to help law students find employment in law firms, and I was head of the law alumni association. So I have had experience in the academic sphere of the university. 
   One of the great things I did for 2 years is I went to every school in the State of Mississippi--every one. I met with the students, I talked with the teachers, I talked with the guidance counselors. I was a member of the State Guidance Counselors Association. I went into schools. I actually stood outside and looked at some buildings and said: I am not sure I want to go in there; this may fall down. 
   I remember the commitment of the teachers. I remember the efforts of the guidance counselors. I really believe education was better then than it is now, and that is sad. We have to do something about that. 
   When some people allege that Republicans do not care about education, they don't know what they are talking about. I will put my credentials, my background in public education, my feelings about education against anybody in this Chamber. Our party, the Republican Party in the Senate, has determined that education is our first priority. S. 1, the first bill I introduced, improves education. We want full funding for education. I want to fund education at the level the President asked for and more, if we can find a way to do it. 
   But there is a key difference: We want to do it differently. 
   I have no confidence whatsoever in this body or in any bureaucrat in Washington, DC, to make the right decisions on education--none. The teachers, the parents, the students, the communities in Wyoming and in Mississippi, know best what those students need. They know their students. They know their needs. They know the community. They know what they can afford. They know what they can spend. And they do not need some nameless, faceless bureaucrat or some Senator from some other State telling them: You are to spend it here or spend it there. 
   I trust the people; I trust the teachers at the local level. I do not trust the unions. I do not trust the Department of Education. I voted to make it a separate Department because I thought it was being undermined in the old Department it was in; it was gobbled up by other things. Maybe I made a mistake. I want to give education a high priority, but I do not think this Department up here, inside the Beltway, in this administration or in previous administrations, has helped education much. They are part of the problem. Let the local people make the decisions. 
   I want to make this point, too. There are those who say what we need is more money. Yes, everybody comes to Washington knocking on the door: I need more money. We need bigger Government. That is ridiculous. We are wasting too much of the people's money here in Washington, DC. We do not need more money in this Government. 
   When was the last time any Senator had somebody show up and say: Hey, we can do better with less? No. The American people say they want a balance. The American people say they want to make sure we do not spend the Social Security surplus. But yet then the professional lobbyists say: We want more. 
   It is all good. I am from an agricultural State. Agriculture wants more. I appreciate what the veterans have done for our country. Veterans want more. Armed services are important for the future security of our families. They need more. We would like to have the American dream of having a home available for everybody. Fine. I think it ought to be done in the private sector. I think the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as a whole, is a miserable failure. I could go down every Department, every agency; and I support a lot of them. 
   I do support ships being built in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS. But I do not see a hunk of steel. I see pipe fitters, boilermakers, laborers. I see men and women and Indians out there pulling those steel lines, running those cranes, and providing for the defense of our country. I wanted more money for NASA, but you cannot have it both ways. 
   One of the interesting things about the resolution that was introduced by Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE here today is --they talked about some of the problems in education and that funding should be increased in programs right across the board. They want the Federal Government to start hiring local teachers --Federal Government dictates: There have to be X number of students in a classroom. 
   We need more money for afterschool programs, more money for the Safe Schools Program, more money for elementary and secondary education--more money, more money, more money. 
   Then it says--this is what is really ingenious--more money for everything. And, by the way, ``the Senate should stay within the discretionary spending caps and avoid using the resources of the social security program by finding discretionary spending offsets that do not jeopardize''--great, great. 
   If somebody shows up and tells me how we can increase every program in the Federal Government and stay within spending limitations, I will give them a prize. 
   There are those who have a way to do it. It is called more taxes. Yes, let's increase taxes--somewhere, someday, user fees. Let's find more money to come to Washington. 
   We do not need more money in Washington. The people need to keep their money back home. The American people are overtaxed. 
   Their taxes are too high. They are unfair. They are complicated. When the people were told what we had in our tax cut package, they said: Yes, we support that. 
   But you can't have every nickel you want spent in Washington and have fiscal responsibility and have tax relief for working Americans, young families, such as my own daughter who just got married in May. She and her husband both work because they do not have a lot of money. By the way, they are going to pay more in taxes this next year than they did the previous year just because they got married. What a ridiculous set of circumstances. 
   We wonder why we have troubles having the traditional family survive. One reason is that you get taxed if you get married, for Heaven's sake. 
   In America, you get taxed if you die. When I get to the end of my road, after my life's work, I want two things, and that is all. I want my name to be decent and clean, and I want my kids to be able to have whatever I have earned. I do not want Uncle Sam showing up saying: Give me half of it. Nobody of any income level can defend the death tax. It is totally ridiculous. 
   We have a resolution that I believe is better than what was proposed by Senator DASCHLE and Senator KENNEDY. So I send this resolution to the desk and ask for it to be printed at this time. I will send it forward in a minute. 
   Let me just read this resolution into the RECORD because I think it is a good resolution. I want the American people to know what we think about education.  
   Whereas 
   The fiscal year 2000 Budget Resolution [that passed the Congress] increases--  
   Hear me now--  
   education funding by $28 billion over the next five years, and $82 billion over the next ten years.  
   We are not stingy when it comes to education. Our budget resolution says we are going to have more:  
   The Department of Education received a net increase of $2.4 billion in FY 2000 which doubles the President's request.  
   I do not understand what Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE are talking about.  
   Compared to the President's requested levels, the Democratically controlled Congress' appropriations for 1993-1995 reduced the President's funding requests by $3.0 billion.  
   The Democrat Congress reduced the President's request for education by $3 billion.  
   Since Republicans took control of Congress, federal education funding has increased by 27%.  
   Maybe 100 percent would be better, but we are doing the job. We need a little credit for what we have been doing.  
   In the past three years, the Congress has increased funding for Part B of [the IDEA program]--   
   Where we have made a commitment, fulfilled over a period of years--  
   by nearly 80%, while the Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget only requested a .07% increase which is less than an adjustment for inflation.  
   Remember what happens. Schools are being told by the Federal Government: You must comply with IDEA. You must provide the special education. The schools are saying: But if we spend that money and you do not do your share, it means we have to take from somewhere else. 
   The most difficult thing the schools across this country are having to deal with is complying with special education requirements and the Federal Government not doing its share. That is what our resolution focuses on. We should give schools the flexibility to use this money to comply with IDEA or use it in other areas.  
   Congress is not only providing the necessary funds, but is also reforming our current education programs. Congress recognizes that significant reforms are needed in light of the following troubling statistics: 
   40% of fourth graders cannot read at the most basic level. 
   In international comparisons, U.S. twelfth graders scored near the bottom in both math and science. 
   70% of children in high poverty schools score below even the most basic level of reading. 
   In math, 9 year olds in high poverty schools remain two grade levels behind students in low poverty schools. 
   Earlier this year, the 106th Congress took the first step toward improving our nation's schools by passing the Education, Flexibility and Partnership Act .....  
   Really simple: We just allow the schools at the local level to make the decisions where to spend all this Federal money that is going to be available to them. Really simple. It will work. And the teachers and the Governors and the parents say, yes, that makes sense.  
   This year's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will focus on increasing student achievement by empowering principals, local school boards, teachers, and parents. The focus should be on raising the achievement of all students.  
   In other words, we say: We are going to give you the flexibility, but we expect results. You are going to have to show some results. 
   Also:  
   Congress should reject a one-size-fits-all approach to education.  
   What is good in Boston, MA, just may not be good in Boise, ID, or in Laramie, WY, or certainly not good in Pascagoula, MS. We have different needs. We ought to have that flexibility to address the needs we do have.  
   Parents are the first and best educators of their children. We have to find ways for the Congress to support proposals which provide parents greater, not less, control and input into the unique educational opportunities we want for our children. 
   Every child should have an exceptional teacher in the classroom.  
   We have a program in Mississippi--I am trying to remember who did it--but a philanthropist gave every classroom in Mississippi, or at least every school, a computer. 
   I was talking to a local educator recently. He said: That's real nice, but in many of those schools, those computers are still sitting in the boxes in the hallways or in the backs of the rooms because the teachers don't know how to use the computers, let alone how to teach the use of the computers. 
   Technology is great. We have to make sure, though, that the teachers have the ability or at least can be trained or have access to training so they can use the modern technology. 
   Our whereas goes on. It just says that Congress will continue its efforts to improve the Nation's schools by reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, guided by the principles I have been referring to above; that is, more flexibility, more control by the teachers and the school boards, and more involvement by the parents. 
   We feel very strongly about this. The Democrats say: We will provide 100,000 teachers, hired by the Federal Government, and we want to start repairing roofs. 
   The quality of the buildings themselves and repairing roofs are a local issue. The Federal Government should not be doing that. While others will say, well, wait a minute, we need to help these schools and these States in repairing buildings, where does it end? If we proceed down the road where we start paying for building schools at the local level, we will have to build every school in America. That is where it will end. Sure, it is nice; people like it. 
   Let me tell my colleagues about the States. Every single State in the Nation has a surplus, more than they are going to spend. You say, well, maybe it is not much. It is almost $34 billion. If you have dilapidated schools in your State, I say: State, fix them. The Federal Government, Uncle Sop, is not going to pay for repairing roofs in Biloxi, MS. Let the people in Biloxi, in the State of Mississippi, do that. I am for it. I am for teacher pay raises, but the answer is not in this hallowed city that we stand. The answer is with the American people. I believe that. Give them the flexibility. When Senator KENNEDY said, basically, what we want is for Washington to run the schools, frankly, a bad situation could be worse. The Federal Government would mess it up. 
   So we have an alternative. We will be debating it again on Monday. I believe our alternative will pass. It should pass. But I am telling you right now, I am telling the President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, and I am telling everybody in this Senate, when it comes to education, TRENT LOTT is not going to yield to anybody, and the Republicans in Congress are not going to be run over by a bunch of additional Federal programs that will waste the money, should not be our responsibility, and will not get the job done. We are going to make it flexible. We are going to make it local. 
   This is going to be an interesting debate. I can tell you one thing: I am going to be at the debate because I am going to be involved in this. I care about it, and I know what will work, and I know what won't work. What we have is not working. We have to do it differently. 
   I beg the pardon of my colleagues for getting fired up and going on a little long, but I am not going to let those sorts of things be said on the floor of the Senate on education without an adequate response. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to pay a special tribute today to Brigadier General Terry L. Paul, the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps and trusted friend of the United States Senate. After almost thirty years of honorable and dedicated service in the Corps, Brigadier General Paul will retire from active duty October 1st, 1999. 
   The Members of Congress and their staffs have come to know General Paul as a person who possesses a deep and abiding passion for the institution which he has served so faithfully--the United States Marine Corps. It is difficult to comprehend a Corps absent the ranks of a Terry Paul. His absence will be especially felt in the Office of Legislative Affairs where he served nine years in the Senate Liaison and most recently as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant. He has set the standard by which all other Legislative Assistants will be measured. 
   The strength of the Marine Corps relationship with the Congress is in large measure due to the professional dedication of Brigadier General Paul. This relationship has been forged and nurtured over the years by his unrelenting resolve to establish a climate of mutual respect and understanding. The underpinning for this success was a rapport that was built on a credible and straightforward approach for dealing with issues, large or small. He possessed an innate ability to appreciate the environment in which he worked. It is through this understanding we can fully treasure the tenacity of Terry Paul to communicate the Commandant's message of ``making Marines and winning battles'' on Capitol Hill. 
   Brigadier General Paul's imprint will resonate through these hallowed halls and unto our Nation long after his departure. Through the foresight and oversight of the United States Congress, the Corps will have been provided the needed resources that will enable it to confront the challenges of the 21st century. Terry Paul was always there to foster and develop our knowledge of key resource needs. When all seemed lost with the pending cancellation of the V-22 program it was Brigadier General Paul that was assigned as ``point-man'' on the Hill--responsible for building support to resurrect, not merely a dying program, but to advocate a concept which would ultimately revolutionize warfare in the next century. General Paul ensured Congress was aptly informed as to the capabilities, technological advances, concept of operations, and funding requirements to bring this program to fruition. His vigilance and ability to communicate carried the day. The V-22 Osprey will enable commanders to accomplish the mission more efficiently, with far fewer casualties than otherwise would have been the case. Terry fought the hard fight and he should be extremely proud that his unrelenting efforts have borne the fruit of his labor. 
   General Paul carried the message to the Hill on a plethora of programs. Programs that represented innovation, ingenuity, and a willingness to adapt to changes on the emerging battlefields which will elevate the Marine Corps as the world's premier crisis response force in the 21st century. Programs such as the Advanced Assault Amphibious Vehicle, the KC-130J, Maritime Pre-positioned Force-Enhancement and LHD class ships. 
   General Paul is a leader of unquestionable loyalty and unswerving standards. His tenure as the Commandant's Legislative Assistant was the capstone performance of nearly thirty-year career in the infantry, Senate Liaison office, and as a Special Assistant to the Commandant. For his efforts the Marine Corps is a better institution today, one that has a bright and prosperous future. Terry, we the Members of the United States Senate and the 106th Congress want to convey our sincere appreciation for all you have done for our Nation. Your legacy will be the well-equipped Marines who will continue to provide for our country's defense. They will be better equipped, more capable, and better able to survive on the modern battlefield due to your dedication and selfless sacrifice to duty. You will be sorely missed, but surely not forgotten.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning it is hoped that the Senate will be able to resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. The oil royalties amendment is the only remaining issue to dispose of prior to completing action on the bill. However, in order to resume consideration of the oil royalties issue, it may be necessary to have several procedural votes this morning; therefore, Senators should anticipate votes beginning shortly. The Senate will also resume consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill with the hope of finishing that legislation today. Also, either later on today or tomorrow, it is hoped we can take up one, two, or more appropriations conference reports as they are completed.

   Mr. LOTT. As a result of this agreement, there will be no further votes this evening. The first vote tomorrow will be at approximately 9:35 a.m. It is anticipated further votes will occur tomorrow in an effort to conclude HUD-VA. I talked with Senator DASCHLE. We should and we will finish the HUD-VA appropriations bill tomorrow. We have good managers on this bill. They will push it forward. 
   The only amendments that we had on the list are the atomic veterans sense of the Senate by Senator WELLSTONE, sense of the Senate regarding education by Senator DASCHLE, an amendment by Senator KERRY regarding section 8 housing, another amendment by Senator KERRY regarding housing aids, one regarding NASA by Senator ROBB, one by Senator TORRICELLI regarding aircraft noise, a managers' package by Senator BOND, one by Senators BENNETT and DODD regarding Y2K, and relevants by Senators BOND and MIKULSKI.

   Mr. LOTT. One final thing, and then the managers can go forward. It is my understanding some of the debate today was not germane to the issue on oil royalties, the issue on which 60 Members voted to invoke cloture earlier today. 
   Rule XXII clearly states all debate must be germane. Senators THOMAS and Senator HUTCHISON of Texas raised a point of order to guide the debate back to the pending oil royalties subject. The Chair on first blush ruled the debate does not have to be germane. 
   To better clarify the position of the chairman, I now make a parliamentary inquiry. Is there a requirement under rule XXII that all debate postcloture must be germane to the issue on which cloture was invoked?

   Mr. LOTT. That is correct. It did say, of course, relevant second-degree amendments would be in order. I believe we only have a half dozen or so amendments we have to consider. I hope most of them can be handled without recorded votes. It does appear there would be a necessity for as many as two recorded votes, maybe three, tomorrow. If the Senators cooperate, I think we can be through with this bill  and all amendments before noon tomorrow.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, under the order, this vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Stewart nomination will occur immediately following the vote that is scheduled to begin momentarily. The first vote is on the bankruptcy reform cloture motion. The second vote would be on this cloture motion on the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Utah. 
   There could be one or two procedural motion votes that would follow after that, so Members should be on notice there could be up to four votes in succession here. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. It is always great to see our distinguished President pro tempore, Senator THURMOND, here and opening the Senate proceedings. We are thankful this morning that his State was spared the kind of devastation it seemed to be facing just a couple of days ago. It looks as if the hurricane has dropped in power and there has not been the damage and devastation that was expected from the hurricane, although certainly there are people this morning who are very uncomfortable without power and there have been some lives--I believe a couple--lost as a result of accidents. 
   I am from a hurricane-prone State, Mr. President. I have lived through three major ones, including one last September, so I know how difficult it can be for those who have had to endure this experience. So I don't take bad weather lightly. But we have been watching very closely the path of this hurricane and its strength and where it is headed. I spoke early this morning to the Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Ziglar, and to Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI. Typically, Senator MIKULSKI calls and says, ``I am coming, unless you say don't come.'' I told her to come. We believe that while we are going to have some wind and rain today, the brunt of the hurricane has been diminished and it will go east of this area. So the Senate will go forward.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this week we have some legislation we must complete because we do have a Jewish holiday Monday and Tuesday, with the first vote not occurring until next Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Then we have to do the HUD and Veterans appropriations bill next week, which I am sure will take at least the remainder of that week, 3 days. 
   So here is what we have to do today and tomorrow if necessary. We will vote at 10:10 on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations conference report. We hope to be able to stack at that time a second vote on the Transportation appropriations bill now pending before the Senate. Senator SHELBY is here and working on an amendment or amendments we may have to deal with. So we will just have to see how that is going to work out. But we want to complete all amendments and have final passage on the Transportation appropriations bill, and probably we need to have a recorded vote on that so we will not be faced with having to find  time for a recorded vote after it comes back from conference. 
   Then we will probably move to the Defense authorization conference report which was completed by the House just yesterday. The conferees did a great job. This is a good bill, and we need to get that vote established. 
   We also have pending the District of Columbia conference report. I understand some time may be needed to talk about it and a recorded vote will be required, but we will do that today or tomorrow if that is necessary. 
   In addition, we are working to clear three judges. One of them may require some time, but we can do that today and tonight 
   or tomorrow. 
   If the weather does become a concern later on in the day, midafternoon, and it is necessary for us to quit early because of the concern for safety, we will be back at 9:30 Friday to complete this list of items. I would like to be able to say let's take a rain day and go home, but we do not have the time to do that. I do not think it is really necessary. So we will begin immediate consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill, and when the amendments are worked out and a final vote can occur on final passage, we will notify the Members, but we will have a vote at 10:10. We do expect votes throughout the day. We will watch the weather. And we do have the option of being in from 9:30 until noon tomorrow. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I understand we have some morning business requests.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret the objection from my Democratic friends on this bankruptcy reform package. We had hoped to get it considered earlier, but because appropriations considerations and some other bills have taken longer than we thought they would, it has been delayed. I find now that there is a growing number of nongermane issues that are being planned to be offered to this very important and vital piece of legislation which has broad support and bipartisan support. 
   Hopefully, we can get something worked out as to how we could proceed that would allow us to complete the bill in a reasonable period of time. Maybe this action will help cause that to happen.

   Mr. LOTT. I know Senators are interested in the schedule for the remainder of the day. We believe we have worked out an agreement of a reasonable time for discussion on the District of Columbia appropriations conference report. Then that would be followed with a recorded vote. We would need to have a recorded vote under our arrangement where if we do not have a recorded vote on an appropriations bill when it goes through the Senate, then we do have a recorded vote on it when it comes back from conference. So we will need that recorded vote. 
   We hope to get the UC locked down, and hopefully, then, at around 2 or so we could get to final passage on the D.C. appropriations conference report. Therefore, then, there would not be the necessity, obviously, for there to be a vote on it at 10 o'clock on Friday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have one other block of remaining issues of consideration, and that is judicial nominations. We had planned to go forward with three judges--two that have been cleared and one that may require time for discussion, and a vote on that at some point. There may need to be, as I said, time for discussion. I hope we can get a reasonable agreement on that. 
   I would not want to have to file cloture on Federal judges. I think it would be a bad practice if we began to have filibusters on Federal judicial nominations, requiring only 41 votes to defeat a judicial nomination. I guess that has been done in the past but not recently, not since I have been majority leader, that I know of. 
   So I hope we can work out an agreement on time, as we have done on the nomination of Mr. White of Missouri. We have a time agreement. At some  point in the next 2 or 3 weeks that will be 
   called up, and it will have a discussion period and a vote. 
   I hope that would be the case with any of these three that we had hoped to bring up. If we can't get an agreement of how to deal with all three of them, then we will not be able to move any of the three. But we are still working on that, and we hope to get it worked out.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize again. I think the Senator is propounding a question. What I am trying to do is to move forward on judicial nominations. We have already cleared six, I believe, since we have been back. I believe we can move two more without any problem. That would be eight. Then it would be my intent to move in that block of three also the nomination of Mr. Stewart of Utah, Brian Theadore Stewart. It would be those three. If we could clear those three, that would be nine we have moved since we have been back from the August recess, leaving, I believe, only four on the calendar. 
   As I indicated, we have gotten tentative agreement on time on the nomination of White of Missouri, that we hope within the next week or so--at some point--when we find a window, in fact, we will call it up, and there will be a period of debate and a vote on that one, leaving only three judges on the calendar. 
   I understand the Judiciary Committee is moving toward reporting out other judges and will begin to move those right away who are not controversial and won't take time. If there is controversy, and we can get a time agreement, a limited time agreement and then a vote on some, then we would do that. 
   The three remaining on the calendar are Ninth Circuit judges, where there is considerable problem and concern about the size of the circuit, whether or not that circuit needs to be dealt with, whether it is split in two, and there are concerns about the judges themselves. So that is a complicated problem. I cannot give any indication of a time agreement at this point. 
   I call on the Senators on both sides of the aisle to allow me to continue to move forward. I have been showing good faith. Before the August recess, I tried to move some of these judges, and if I did not include certain judges, there was objection from that side. If I did not include certain other judges, there was objection on this side. 
   So what I said was: This is not reasonable. It does not make good sense. I am going to just start calling them up, one by one, and clearing them and getting them done. And by doing that, I have done six, and I am on the verge of doing three more. So I would hope we would get cooperation on that. 
   I think Judge Stewart of Utah is a qualified nominee. He is obviously supported by the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has been working in good faith. He was not particularly happy with my plan to just go forward and start calling up judges. 
   I assured him that after we had done several of them that had been cleared, his would be next. His is going to be next. He will be in this package of three. 
   I understand Senators may want to talk some more about this in the next few minutes. I don't want to file cloture on Judge Stewart. I will do that, and then we will start down this 41-vote trail, which I don't think is wise. Let's try to have some cooperation with each other and a modicum of good faith, and we will continue to work on them. 
   It takes a lot of time for the majority leader and the minority leader to clear these judges--a lot of time. I have to check with 54 other Senators before I can enter into any kind of agreement. Sometimes the objections are: I need time to think about it; I need to meet with this person or that person. Sometimes it is a legislative issue. Sometimes they say: Well, I have a problem; I am going to vote no. Sometimes they say: I need a lot of time. 
   I have to work through all that. I will withhold right now on these three, on either of the three. I urge Senator LEAHY, Senator HATCH, Senator FEINSTEIN, anybody else who is involved and interested, to talk this out. I will be back here in a couple of hours, and I will see if we can't work out a way we can move the two who have been cleared already and move Judge Stewart. I do think you will want to talk about it some and perhaps discuss it further with Senator DASCHLE. That would be fine, too.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from Nevada on his proposal. If he can get this agreement I have just propounded worked out, we will be able to move not only this nomination of Mr. Stewart, we will also be able to move tonight the nominees, M. James Lorenz, of California, for the Southern District of California, and Victor Marrero, of New York, for the Southern District of New York. 
   With regard to the nomination of Ronnie L. White, of Missouri, for the Eastern District of Missouri, we do have a time agreement we had worked out earlier. I think it was for only 35 minutes. It might require more time than that since a lot of time has lapsed, but I am satisfied we will get a time agreement on that, and we will have a vote on that one. 
   I think there is a possibility we could get some sort of a time agreement to consider also the nominee, Raymond C. Fisher, of California, for the Ninth Circuit, which is a very controversial circuit. But I have not had an opportunity to 
   check on the time on that one. 
   So I think if we could get an understanding, an agreement with regard to Mr. Stewart, we could, as a matter of fact, move as many as five judges--two in wrapup and three with time agreements and recorded votes. The other two--Berzon and Paez--I will have to go to all of my colleagues to check and see how we can handle those. I have not been able to get a time agreement as yet. I have to confess that I have not tried it lately because I have been trying to move the other judges where there was either not an objection or there were limited objections or we could get time agreements. 
   So I think this is a way to keep moving the process forward. I remind the Senate that we have moved six Federal judicial nominations over the last 2 weeks and that we have the opportunity tonight to move three more. We have the opportunity, within the next 2 weeks, to move three more. That is pretty good progress. I understand the Judiciary Committee is moving toward, reporting out a number of other nominations. 
   So I hope we will find a way to work through all this. Everybody knows that this nominee, Stewart, is important to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. If we get into a situation where we are not going to move him until we get agreement on all others, then we will wind up with an all stop. I have been through that before. I wish we wouldn't do that. I don't think it is good for the people who have been nominated. Why hold up those who can be cleared or voted on and probably approved because we want to get others who are a major problem and we haven't been able to get cleared? 
   I will have to object at this time because I haven't had a chance to do a hotline to see how we could handle Raymond Fisher--I would have to check on all three of those. Having said that, I will have to object to that change.

   Mr. LOTT. If I could reclaim my time, I agree with you on that. I don't want to do that. I have discouraged it ever since I have been the majority leader. I don't believe we have had cloture on a Federal judge since I have been majority leader. The idea that we would begin defeating Federal judicial nominations with 41 of the 100 Senators' votes, that is a bad thing to start. I hope we will not do it. 
   I have to try to find a way to force us to some agreements and to force us into some action. I would be inclined to file cloture today. I want to emphasize, I would prefer to vitiate and not do that. I will go ahead and put it in place tonight, but if Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY will come to me and say, we have something worked out here, or if we can work it out to move these five 
   judges, I will be delighted to move to vitiate that and not go forward with it. Then we can keep this process moving. 
   Remember, right before the August recess, I was the one who tried to move judges. I would get an objection from the Democratic side, if I didn't include certain judges. Then, if I did it a different way, I would get objections from the Republican side because certain judges weren't included. The net result was, none of them were included. 
   When I came back, I called Senator DASCHLE and I called Senator HATCH. I said: I am going to start at the beginning. I am going to start with the easiest ones to get done, and if people are going to object, then they will have to object to them one by one. As a result of that, everybody kind of relaxed and we moved six of them. We are now ready to move at least two more, and I thought we could move three more. If we keep this thing going, it has a lubricating effect. When you act, you tend to act. 
   Let me say this about the vacancies, the number of judges appointed. This Sunday, I am going to be in Cleveland, MS, to attend the investiture of my college roommate, one of the finest men I have ever known in my life. He was nominated by President Clinton to be a Federal judge. He is going to be the North Mississippi Federal judge. 
   I guess on paper he is a Democrat, but aside from that, he is a great guy and will make a wonderful, ethical judge. But when I attend this meeting, I am going to be basically saying: My good friend, Judge Pepper, goodbye. I hope to see you again some day. You are going to the Federal bench. 
   I am glad he is going there. He is going to be a credit. But let me tell you, out there, there are not a lot of people saying: Give us more Federal judges. They just are not. For us to be pontificating about this and gnashing, how unfair, this appointment of more Federal judges, it is just not there. 
   I am willing to do my job. I know they deal with a lot of important issues. I know there is a problem when we don't have a full complement. Some people might argue that we have plenty of Federal judges to do the job. I hope they will do that. I am saying to you, I am trying to help move this thing along, but getting more Federal judges is not what I came here to do.

I know Senators would like to make themselves heard, perhaps, on that nomination, or perhaps as it relates to other nominees. I have no desire to cut Senators off at will.

   Mr. LOTT. I have a couple of problems: One, Senator HATCH, I think, feels that I embarked upon a strategy that has disadvantaged him because I started moving judges--6 of them. And now 2 more are ready to go. Then when we got to the ninth one, his judge, we are told, no. Even though you have 8 judges nominated by Democrats, we have one now that is supported by Senator HATCH, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and you can't do that unless we get an agreement to move 5 other judges. 
   So I understand what you are saying. I really prefer not to do this. But the problem I have now is that I told Senators who have now left that I would do this, and I believe we have told Senators we will have two votes at 5:30 Tuesday. This is one of them. That is my problem. Another problem is time. We are getting to the end of the fiscal year. If we don't do this now and get closure on Judge Stewart, with next week being a four-day week--assuming we can get the Senators to work 4 days--and with five the next week, which are the last 2 weeks of the fiscal year, we are not going to be able to get through any of these judges until October. I hope that we can go ahead and resolve the Stewart matter. I could vitiate the request, and then we could move five judges, I hope.

I appreciate the way he has done his job since he has been the assistant Democratic leader and whip. So I weigh that carefully. 
   At this point, I think I will have to go forward with this. But I will be here tomorrow. I will be here all day Tuesday. Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY will be working together. I will not let this happen without personal conversation with Senator DASCHLE. I talked with him briefly about it this morning. He won't be here tomorrow, but he will be back next Tuesday. It is a high holy day for the Jewish community. I believe he will be around during the day. We will try to work this out. I want to work this out. ``I ain't got a dog in this fight,'' except I'm trying to do my job. So I want to do it in such a way that everybody is satisfied that we are being fair. I don't think it is fair that the nominees from California, New York, Utah, and Missouri all get balled up in this web. I hope we can avoid that.

   Mr. LOTT. Let me explain what it is. Then I will explain what it means. 
   First of all, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, it be in order for the majority leader to file a cloture motion on the pending nomination at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and if that motion is filed, that vote occur on Tuesday immediately following the 5:30 p.m. vote. Needless to say, this will give all Members until 5:30 on Tuesday to discuss the nomination. 
   What I am asking for is an opportunity to not file it, but by getting this agreement, it will be the same as if I had filed it. If we get an agreement, no problem. If we don't, then there will be a vote at 5:30.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there will be no further rollcall votes today. 
   The Senate will be in pro forma session on Friday, and there will be no session on Monday in recognition of the Jewish holy day. 
   The next rollcall votes will occur at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday in a back-to-back sequence, if there are two votes, with the first vote on cloture on the bankruptcy bill, and the second vote on the nomination of Ted Stewart, if one is required.  
   The Senate may also consider the Department of Defense authorization conference report under a 2-hour time limit. 
   Finally, the fiscal year is coming to an end. Therefore, Members should expect late sessions during next week, and they should anticipate being in session each day--Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday--so that we can complete action on the Department of Defense authorization conference report, the Interior appropriations bill, the HUD, and the Veterans' Administration appropriations bills, and any other actions that can be cleared. 
   I think we have made good progress today in spite of the rain and sometimes windy weather. I think we made the right decision to stay here. As a result of us staying and working today, we passed the Treasury and Postal Service appropriations conference report, the District of Columbia appropriations conference report, and the Transportation appropriations bill, and have put in place a process to move a number of Federal judicial nominations. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience, and for being here today as we have made that effort.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me explain where we are. Except for some wrap-up time and another vote on the Hutchison amendment, I believe we are about ready to conclude the Interior appropriations. It will take some time to do wrap-up. As I understand it, there could be as many as two more votes in addition to final passage. 
   After the presentation by the Senator from Wisconsin on East Timor, we are going to go to S.J. Res. 33 with regard to the Puerto Rican terrorists. There will be a vote on that resolution sometime this afternoon but not before 2:15 or 2:30. We will work on a specific time and advise the Members when that will be. 
   When that is complete, it is our intent to go to the Transportation appropriations bill. I have discussed this with the Democratic leader. We are in agreement on that. We will do this resolution and a vote, and then we will go to the Transportation appropriations bill and complete that as soon as we can. That could be tonight or tomorrow night but however long it takes. Then we will come back and wrap up the Interior appropriations bill. That will be determined at a time we will notify the Members of, after we have had further discussion with the Democrats and the manager of bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Chair lay before the Senate a message from the House to accompany S. 1437, the FAA reauthorization. I further ask consent the Senate disagree to the amendments of the House, agree to the request for a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate. 
   Before the question is put, I do want to say the FAA reauthorization is a very important piece of legislation, obviously. It never seems to be easy getting it through the Congress. I remember in 1996 it was the last bill that we  passed of the session, and it took an extra week of the session to get it through. Now we find, after a lot of work involving issues all the way from safety and improvements in airports and questions of slots at various airports--New York, Chicago, as well as what to do with Reagan National Airport--the Senate has developed what I think is a good bill. The House has passed a bill, but it has provisions in it that are of great concern to the chairman of the committee in the Senate and the chairman of the Budget Committee. So there are, once again, complications. 
   Because of the need to stay on the appropriations bills and fulfill our commitments, it is very difficult to schedule a lengthy debate on FAA reauthorization. I have spoken to Senator DASCHLE and said: Is there some way we can work out an agreement to perhaps bring it up in a short period of time so we get it done, even in the midst of all the appropriations bills? The other option is to go straight to conference with the bill the Senate Commerce Committee reported and the bill the House has reported. That is what this would attempt to do so we could move on with the process. 
   That effort was made during the latter part of July. We thought we had it cleared a couple of times, and then we ran into objections. I do have a list of proposed conferees who would come both from the Commerce Committee and from another committee that is interested in this, the Transportation Appropriations Committee, I believe, Senator SHELBY; and Budget, Senators DOMENICI and GRASSLEY, and of course their counterparts from the Democratic side. 
   I make that unanimous consent request at this time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would have to object at this time. However, I find some interest in the offer. But I would need to consult with the chairman and the ranking member and make sure all Senators are aware of that. I have a number of Senators who have put me on notice, on both sides of the aisle, that before we agree to a further, or some other, agreement or unanimous consent, they would want to be notified. I know Senator FITZGERALD of Illinois was one of those. I believe one of the New York Senators had notified me to that effect also. So we would need to clear it with a number of people. 
   I personally think the 60-day extension is the way to go and that is why I supported the 60-day extension before we went out. We had not been able to resolve the scheduling problems or resolve the substance of the issues, and while we were doing that, I thought the responsible thing to do was the 60-day extension, and I will continue to advance the need for that. Unfortunately, the House didn't agree with that and they took our 60-day extension and attached their bill to it and sent it back, which, in effect, meant 
   that we did not have the extension because this was the final couple of days of the July recess. 
   There are disagreements on how to resolve the FAA reauthorization. I noted we had a similar disagreement over a very narrow point back in 1996 and the whole session was delayed an extra week because Senator KENNEDY had a point that he was concerned about. But we got it done, and I am determined we are going to get it done this time. 
   I must say to the Senator, if I could create an extra 10 days in a month, I would probably do that because it is very hard to accommodate what we must do and accommodate agreements that are reached so we can have not 1 week but 2 weeks of debate on a juvenile justice bill. We find many of our bills are taking longer because Senators offer 100 amendments or a whole variety of things. 
   I am determined to get this done and I will continue to work with the chairmen and the ranking members on both sides of the aisle, in both Houses, and I will be pursuing the 60-day extension. I will get back to the Democratic leadership about how we proceed with that. 
   Again, I note I did talk to Senator DASCHLE about trying to come up with an agreement on a process where we could deal with this, even with the limited time we have before us.

   Mr. LOTT. Further reserving the right to object, if Senators will show up, we can have work on Mondays and Fridays. If we do not have objection to having a full day's work, such as this  coming Monday, we can get more done. But I should note also, transportation in general is important. Roads and ports and harbors, Amtrak, railroads, airlines--it is all important. 
   Yet, just yesterday, the Democrats insisted on blocking a maneuver to get to consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill. They threatened to filibuster because they did not like one provision in the Transportation appropriations bill that will benefit two States, that affects two States. Therefore, we could not invoke cloture on the Transportation appropriations bill. 
   I agree, air safety is important but so is road safety. My father was killed on an unsafe, narrow, two-lane highway. I get very excited and determined when it comes to transportation, whether it is an appropriations bill or transportation in general, and FAA reauthorization. I hope we can find a way to work together to move both these bills. I am committed to that. 
   I object. 
   I will move to the next request.

Even though I will proceed to file a cloture motion, if we can come up with some language that expresses the outrage of the American people and the feelings of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, we will withdraw that cloture motion and will go to the vote. 
   I note that just yesterday the House of Representatives debated a resolution on this issue. Over 300 voted for the resolution expressing criticism of this clemency; 41 or so voted no; 70 voted ``present,'' which I think is a very curious thing. I do not recall the last time I have seen as many as 70 vote ``present.'' The House has shown leadership in this area in a bipartisan way. I hope the Senate can do the same.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will note also this is an unusual procedure. Let me just explain. We are on the Interior appropriations bill. There is an amendment pending. Because the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, is concerned she may lose on a vote on the amendment, it is being filibustered, or there is the threat of a filibuster. I think that is unusual. 
   We do have disagreements sometimes on how to proceed to a bill or whether or not to even take up a bill, but it is a little unusual to have this occur on an individual amendment. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I quite often talk about how we prefer not to do this sort of thing to each other, at least on amendments. What we try to accommodate each other on is a debate, vote, somebody wins, somebody loses, and we move on. Sometimes individual Senators can exercise their right, and they have that right. 
   I hope we will not get into a pattern of doing this. It will make an already cumbersome process even more difficult to complete important work. The Interior appropriations bill, as all appropriations bills, is very important for our country. It has a lot of important provisions, all the way from parks to land management, that we need to get completed. We certainly will work to do that, and that is why I filed this cloture motion.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I emphasize, obviously this is a very important issue. I think it is an extremely dangerous issue in a dangerous time. We see now uncertainty with regard to Russia and their economic condition and what is happening with loans that have been made to them I guess through the IMF. We are concerned about their continuing nuclear capability. So it is an uncertain time. They have not ratified SALT II in the Duma of Russia. 
    And we have not determined what we are going to do about revisiting the ABM Treaty. 
   I talked to the President's National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, this past week about that event. I believe very strongly we are going to have to take another look at the ABM Treaty. 
   Then, in addition to that, you have the very dangerous situation with Iraq. In today's newspaper, we have an indication that Iran may have the capability to deliver nuclear weapons beyond what most people are aware. And there is the ``scary,'' I believe is the way it was described in the newspaper today, situation with regard to North Korea. 
   The countries that have signed that treaty, for the most part, are countries that do not have nuclear capability, so they are perfectly happy to sign it. But when you look at Russia, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, and India, the world is still very dangerous. 
   The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has indicated very strongly there are a number of treaties that are necessarily tied together; what is going to be the situation with regard to the ABM Treaty; what is the situation with regard to Kyoto, the global warming issue; and the third leg of this stool is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I think the chairman has indicated he is willing to get into these three areas. He will be taking a look at hearings. I have encouraged him to do so, but I think everybody needs to understand that it would involve all three of these issues. And they are going to be dealt with. 
   I commend for the reading of the Senate today's editorial page article by Charles Krauthammer. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that article be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. LOTT. It is a very good article. He basically says that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is disarmament, unilateral nuclear disarmament by the United States, because we would not be testing our aging nuclear weapons and saying to the rest of the world: We have been good guys, so we're going to have faith that you're going to be good. I am not prepared to put my grandson's future at risk in this way. 
   So that is how I wanted to respond. I do think hearings could be and should be scheduled in a variety of ways. I hope the chairman will be working on that. I will be talking to him about it, one. Two, I do think this is a dangerous time to rush to judgment on such an important issue. Three, I do think it is the wrong thing to do. And four, if it is called up preemptively, without appropriate consideration and thought, it could be defeated. 
   I think that the advocates need to weigh the ramifications and the implications of such an action. 
   So I know the interest of the Senator. I have already talked with him about it. I will be glad to work with him and to work with the chairman to see what an appropriate time is and what an appropriate process is for having hearings of these critical areas.

But I would be willing to guess that Dr. Krauthammer knows more about the subject than whoever at the White House wrote the article for the Washington Post editorial page.  
   If we want to compare capabilities and knowledge, I would be glad to get into that. I put my money with Krauthammer against anybody who writes an editorial in the Washington Post. 
   Having said that, I have done what I can do at this point in terms of suggesting that hearings be in order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I express my full support for Senator GORTON's section 329. It is the right thing to do because, without it there would be a new $8 billion mandate on the Forest Service. 
   This provision is needed because it affirms a position taken by three circuit courts and nine Federal courts. Senator GORTON's effort is necessary because it will ensure that the Forest Service and the Nation have a uniform public policy. 
   The opponents of section 329 want to ignore the position taken by three circuit courts and nine Federal courts because they got the decision they liked from the 11th Circuit Court. 
   There is a certain irony here. Here is an instance where environmentalists do not want a one-size-fits-all national policy. 
   Senator GORTON's provision helps the Forest Service. It properly eliminates very expensive and completely unnecessary work by the Forest Service. 
   Senator GORTON would allow the Forest Service to rely on sampling data regarding available habitats for the species. 
   Opponents want the Forest Service to count the actual populations of the species--not just once, but several times to determine population trends. In each case, the three circuit courts and nine Federal courts did not buy this argument. 
   Currently, the Forest Service has followed the Federal court decisions. It has correctly contained to inventory wildlife by habitat availability for almost two decades. 
   Now, the Senate is being asked to ignore 20 years of experience plus decisions from three circuit courts and nine Federal courts. 
   Mr. President, I do not want to ignore the experts at the Forest Service. 
   The Senate is also faced with a decision that will significantly increase the cost of operating the timbers sales program in the Forest Service. Eight billion dollars is real money and spending the taxpayer's hard earned money unwisely is criminal. 
   Let me put the Senator ROBB mandated spending into a context. Eight billion dollars is 2 1/2 times the entire annual budget of the whole Forest Service. 
   Mr. President, it is clear the 11th Circuit Court has ``overreached'' and Senator ROBB'S mandated spending is unjustified.  
   The current wildlife data requirements can be applied nationwide without threatening species habitats. But timber sales, an authorized and core mission of the Forest Service, would be placed in jeopardy. 
   In Mississippi, timber sales are the lifeblood of many counties. It funds children's education in some of Mississippi's and the Nation's poorest counties. 
   Congress must ensure that Forest Service timber sales continue in a timely fashion. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the efforts of Senator ROBB. His amendment would, quite frankly, destroy the fiscal viability of two counties in Mississippi. Wayne County and Perry County are currently listed by Federal Governments as two of the poorest in the Nation. They depend on Federal timber sales--remember, this is a legal and primary mission of the Forest Service. 
   Mr. President, Senator GORTON's section 329 is the right provision on the right appropriation bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of the urgent nature of the subject involved, since the subject will be dealt with on Friday of this week, tomorrow, I thought we needed to proceed to have some debate and hopefully even a vote with regard to the matter of the pardon of the Puerto Rican terrorists. 
   So I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S.J. Res. 33, a joint resolution deploring the actions of President Clinton with respect to clemency for FALN terrorists, and there be 2 hours for debate to be equally divided between the two leaders. I further ask consent that no amendments be in order to the resolution and that following the use or yielding back of the debate time, the joint resolution be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage with no intervening action or debate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think the Senator's point is well taken, that this has come up quickly. But there is a reason for that. This whole issue came out during the August recess period when Senators were back in their respective States. I think everybody was stunned and shocked and somewhat in disbelief that these 12 or so terrorists--I believe it was 16 total--were going to be offered this clemency and this pardon. 
   We just returned to the Senate for business on Wednesday of this week. There was no earlier opportunity to introduce this resolution, and I understand clemency takes effect tomorrow, on Friday. That is why it has been handled in this way. 
   Having said that, I inquire of Senator DASCHLE, with those amendments, any amendment that would be offered, would they be relevant to this subject, to the question of the clemency of these terrorists, or would it be his request that any amendment would be in order affecting any subject?

   I know there is a feeling of outrage in the country and on both sides of the political aisle about this happening. We are going to express ourselves either before or after the clemency actually takes place. I extend that invitation to work with us to see if we can develop language that can have the type of broad support that I believe there is in this country on the whole against this action. In view of the request, I have to object to that addition to the unanimous consent request.

I will ask consent to proceed to the joint resolution on Friday, and if an objection is heard, I will move to proceed and file a cloture motion, and that cloture vote will occur at 5 p.m. on Monday. I urge my colleagues to join us in trying to work out language that can be acceptable to Senators on both sides who feel strongly about this. 
   Also, I notify Senators there will be no further recorded votes today or this week, but there will be stacked votes, probably three or four, at 5 o'clock on Monday next. I have notified Senator DASCHLE of that intent. I ask Senators to be sure to be here. We will not have recorded votes tomorrow. We will probably do some business, but it will not involve votes. The next votes will occur at 5 p.m. on Monday, and all Senators will be expected to be present and accounted for.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I yield the floor to the distinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations subcommittee, I confirm again we are going back to the Interior appropriations bill. We hope to and plan to have debate on amendments beginning right away. We could have a recorded vote on one of the amendments within the next 15 to 30 minutes. We will continue working on the Interior appropriations bill until we get an agreement as to exactly when to proceed to the reconciliation conference report. 
   I will not propound a unanimous consent request at this time, but it is my hope we can get an agreement to begin at 1 o'clock on the consideration of a reconciliation conference report, and we debate it for 6 hours, of course, equally divided in the usual form, and the vote then would occur around 7 o'clock. 
   We do not have that worked out yet. If we require more time, if we have to be in later, then of course the vote would go later in the night, perhaps 8 o'clock or, if we cannot get that worked out, we will go however long we need to go tonight and we would vote on Friday morning sometime. But we hope to get an agreement where we could complete that and have a vote around 7 o'clock tonight.

   The agreement we had last week was that this week we would try to complete these two appropriations bills, Agriculture and Interior, complete the reconciliation conference report, and try to get as many nominations confirmed as we could get cleared on both sides. 
   We are still assiduously pursuing that goal.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tonight we are passing a fantastic piece of legislation. The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 will return $792 billion of tax overpayments to American taxpayers over the next 10 years. It will cut income tax rates for all Americans. It contains dramatic cuts in the marriage penalty. It cuts capital gains tax rates and indexes capital gains for inflation. It eliminates death taxes. It expands retirement opportunities, educational opportunities, and health care choices. This, Mr. President, is a superb bill, and I am proud to have been a part of the process that developed it. 
   I want to thank the following staff for their dedication, intelligence, long hours, and commitment to Republican principles. The most important of these are Chairman BILL ROTH'S staff. Chairman ROTH provided the leadership, and these people did all the hard work to back them up. From Senator ROTH's Committee on Finance, I want to thank Frank Polk, Joan Woodward, Mark Prater, Brig Pari, Tom Roesser, Bill Sweetnam, Jeff Kupfer, Ed McClellan, Tara Bradshaw, Ginny Flynn, Connie Foster, and Myrtle Agent. They are the tax counsels and policy experts who help us understand the intricacies of tax policy and legislation. We rely upon them every day for advice, and we have leaned on them for support during the past month. They are professional, patient, intelligent, and dedicated. I also want to thank John Duncan and Bill Nixon from Senator ROTH's staff for their leadership. 
   One person in particular deserves special mention. Mark Prater, Chairman BILL ROTH's chief tax counsel, was the principal Senate staff architect of this bill. Mark is an enormously valuable resource to the entire U.S. Senate. Mark's knowledge of tax policy and the tax code are unsurpassed. His dedication to good tax policy is unmatched. While we all worked hard to craft this legislation, Mark has given his days, nights, and weekends to this bill for several months. And his patience, professionalism, and easygoing demeanor make it a pleasure to work with him. I know that I speak for all of my colleagues, and for their staff, when I say thank you to Mark Prater for his work on this bill. 
   I want to thank all of the Joint Tax Committee staff for their excellent, professional staff work. Under the leadership of Lindy Paull, and two of her deputies, Rick Grafmeyer and Mary Schmitt, the Joint Tax staff did an incredible job turning around legislative language and scoring faster than we thought possible. They said we couldn't conference two $792 billion bills in less than a week. Thanks to the leadership of BILL ROTH and BILL ARCHER, and to the lightning speed of the Joint Tax staff, we proved them wrong. 
   The staff for the Republican members of the Finance Committee also deserve special recognition: Kathleen Black from Senator CHAFEE's staff, Kolan Davis from Senator GRASSLEY's staff, Judy Hill from Senator HATCH's staff, Alexander Polinsky from Senator MURKOWSKI's staff, Hazen Marshall from Senator NICKLES' staff, Ginger Gregory and Keith Hennessey from my staff, Dick Ribbentrop, Steve McMillin, and Mike Solon from Senator GRAMM's staff, Jeff Fox and Ken Connolly from Senator JEFFORDS' staff, Vic Wolski and Shelly Hymes from Senator MACK's staff, and Rachel Jones and Libby Wood from Senator THOMPSON's staff. 
   Much of this debate centered on questions that are normally considered in a budget resolution, rather than a reconciliation bill. So I also want to thank Senator DOMENICI's excellent Budget Committee staff, who, as always, did top-notch work. In particular, I want to highlight the efforts of Bill Hoagland, Cheri Reidy, Beth Felder, Jim Capretta, Amy Smith, Sandra Wiseman, and Andrew Siracuse. And we can't forget the Budget Committee ``masters of spin,'' Bob Stevenson and Amy Call. 
   I offer my profound thanks to all of these dedicated Senate staff. Without their hard work, we would not be enjoying today's success. 
   I believe then Senator SPECTER will be the final speaker.

The Senate will resume the Interior appropriations bill for consideration of amendments. However, no further votes will occur this evening. If votes are ordered, those votes will be postponed to occur on Wednesday, September 8. I hope Senators who have  amendments to the Interior appropriations bill will stay after the vote and further debate the amendments. I see that the manager of the bill is here. 
   Because of the agreement we reached and because of the good work that has been done, even though we haven't completed Interior, we are now going to have a finite list from which to work. In view of that, there will not be a session tomorrow. The next votes will be on Wednesday, September 8. I urge Senators to be here on the 8th because there will be votes, perhaps on the bankruptcy bill, or amendments to Interior. Members should expect votes on that Wednesday. In addition, there will be the cloture vote on Thursday. 
   I particularly thank the manager of the Tax Relief Act, Senator ROTH, who did an excellent job, and the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, and a lot of the dedicated staff who put in long hours to make it possible. I appreciate the cooperation of all of our Senators to get this work done so we can have this period to go home and work our States during August. I hope everybody has a very prosperous, healthy, and enjoyable State work period. I appreciate the cooperation.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and bid farewell to my loyal and trusted advisor, Carl Biersack. Carl is leaving my staff to enter into retirement after 27 years of Federal service, including more than 9 years of outstanding service on my staff. 
   It is difficult to pay adequate tribute to a man who has done so much for me, for my staff, and for the State of Mississippi and the Nation. Those of you who know Carl know that he gives 110 percent of himself every day, inspiring those around him to do the same. 
   He is the son of a career U.S. Army officer, Carl graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1971. He received his commission as a second lieutenant and served on active duty for over 7 years. So how did I get so lucky, you ask, to add this VMI alumnus to my staff? Yes, VMI is where Sigma Nu was founded, but no, this is not the reason! 
   Mr. President, in 1988, the U.S. Army made Carl the recipient of the prestigious Pace Award. This award, which was named after a former Secretary of the Army, is given out annually to one civilian and one member of the military who have demonstrated outstanding service on the Army staff to their nation. 
   As if receiving the coveted Pace Award was not tribute enough, the award included an opportunity to study at Harvard for a year. Because of family considerations, Carl decided to forgo a move to Boston and instead asked to spend a year as a Capitol Hill fellow. He thought he would learn more useful skills here than at Harvard. He was right. The Army agreed, and he was hired as a fellow in my personal office by my then-Chief of Staff, John Lundy; former Legislative Director Sam Adcock; and Susan Butler, now Chief of Staff for Congressman Chip Pickering. 
   That's right, Mr. President--I was Carl's second choice. Carl is quick to say he is an accidental staffer. Someone who did not aspire to work on the Hill. I believe this was one of his strengths. 
   He brought the honor and integrity he learned at VMI, the discipline and dedication of his Army service, and the work ethic of a DOD civil servant to my office. 
   After his first year, I asked Carl to stay as a permanent member of my staff. Fortunately for me and Mississippi, he did. Now, looking back at his nine years worth of accomplishments, I am amazed. In fact, I had grown so accustomed to his daily presence, when asked, I said Carl worked for me for 13 years. Even people downtown think his tenure was about 15 years. His presence and contributions cast a long shadow. 
   Carl has covered a broad range of issues during his tenure on the Hill ranging from telecommunications to energy, from environment to fish, from oceans and roads to bridges and aviation. While Carl has never sought the limelight, many of my colleagues recognize his vital role in enacting important legislation. He was a fearless negotiator who frequently found consensus through incremental changes. Often his work was ratified by unanimous consent actions. 
   During Carl's tenure, he successfully shepherded roughly 25 public laws through the legislative process: Many of these laws moved key industries to competition, such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. Some reformed the way the Government regulates and supports certain industries, such as the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the Maritime Security Act of 1996, and the Amtrak Reform Act of 1997. 
   Some will shape our Nation's high-tech economy, such as the Y2K Act and the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Others, such as the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, and the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, protect life, property, and the environment from harm. 
   Then there were bills, like TEA-21, which were vital to maintaining and improving our Nation's infrastructure. And let me not forget Carl's role in facilitating Congress' basic responsibility: authorizing and appropriating funds for Executive departments and agencies. 
   Carl was able to accomplish so much as a Senate staff member because of his willingness to work out inclusive solutions to problems. His success can also be attributed to his efforts to remain  an anonymous staffer who avoided the spotlight. He concentrated on results, not personal credit. 
   Staff on both sides of the aisle were comfortable working with him. He admitted his errors, said he didn't know when he was unsure, and was generous with his praise for others. He read the material provided by constituents and advocates, returned phone calls, and was accessible. He was the consummate staffer. 
   Both Senators and staff knew Carl would deal with their concerns fairly, honestly, and professionally. A deal was a deal. His word was respected. This was true both on the Hill and downtown. 
   Carl was determined to learn all there was to know about Mississippi. He made trips back to the state to visit our catfish farms, pulp and paper plants, national forests and universities. He saw small towns, courthouse squares, topnotch telecommunications headquarters and military bases. Carl knew that learning about the lives of Mississippians was important to effectively represent the state and its citizens. 
   Although Carl is from Virginia--often referring to himself as my token non-Mississippian--he was an ardent defender of Mississippi's interests and people. Mississippians have grown to trust and respect Carl's devotion to ensuring that Mississippi's issues and concerns were recognized and often included. His adamant support of my home state's interests has not gone unnoticed by its citizens. Carl was named an honorary citizen of Mississippi and he proudly displayed the certificate. 
   For years, Carl willingly and voluntarily assumed the role of mentor to new staff members who needed help navigating the complex legislative world. As Legislative Director, he challenged staff to achieve their fullest potential, take risks and learn from their mistakes. There is no doubt that his influence spurred the professional growth made by young, eager staffers, resulting in talented and enthusiastic team players. Carl was always willing to share the lessons he learned the hard way. 
   There is no overstating how Carl's selflessness has enhanced the professional and personal lives of the generations of staffers who were privileged enough to work with Carl. He lived by the motto on his VMI class ring--``honor above self.'' 
   I know that I am losing a brilliant and effective legislative director, but others tell me that I am losing the man who is teacher, parent and sometimes counselor to those around him. I am quite sure that the rest of my staff will miss him as much as I will. 
   Carl's memos and notes were always timely, informative, and accurate. They were frequently entertaining, and sometimes caustic, but his daily paper trail ensured I had the necessary information to deal with the issues and events surrounding legislation. He was not afraid to tell bad news, but he always proposed solutions. 
   Carl was the king of metaphors. He used them to make a point, to negotiate, and to educate. Still, he was eager to dig into issues and legislation. His knowledge of bills was his credibility. I do not think I ever saw him without reading material. 
   Mr. President, it saddens me to see a man of Carl's caliber depart my staff. He certainly leaves big shoes to fill. For Carl's talent, loyal service and dedication to me and the state of Mississippi, I am very grateful. 
   He is a man who was defined by his family. He always had his priorities straight and he never forgot his family as he fulfilled his commitments to the Senate and Mississippi. His wife, Ann, and his daughters, Katie, Sarah, Olivia, Allyson, and Rebecca, have reason to be proud. I wish Carl Biersack good luck in all of his future endeavors and pray that God may continue to richly bless him and his family.

   Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Michigan is correct. The New Millennium Classrooms Act was not included in the House-passed tax bill, and was later omitted from the final tax conference report at the request of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer. I would say that to the Senator from Michigan that your New Millennim Classrooms Act remains a top legislative priority for our Senate Republican High Tech Task Force. Accordingly, I will continue to work with you to find a way to secure final Congressional approval of this important pro-technology, pro-education initiative.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senate Minority Leader DASCHLE, and Senators WARNER, CHAFEE, BAUCUS, and LINCOLN, in introducing the Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999. 
   This legislation, similar to that which the distinguished minority leader and I introduced in the previous Congress, removes an unintended consequence of the Superfund statute that has inhibited the growth of recycling in our nation. I am certain that when the Congress passed the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Liability and Compensation Act (CERCLA), members of both bodies did not want, and did not suggest, that traditional recyclable materials--paper, glass, plastic, metals, textiles, and rubber--should be any more subject to Superfund liability than a competitive product made of virgin material. However, that is how the courts have interpreted Superfund. 
   Consequently, CERCLA has created a competitive disadvantage between virgin materials used as manufacturing feedstocks and recyclable materials used for precisely the same purpose. The courts have concluded that recyclables are materials that have been disposed of and are therefore subject to Superfund liability. Even most American schoolchildren know, recycling is good for the nation--that recycling is the exact opposite of disposal. Recycling serves important national goals by keeping materials from entering the waste stream. Through recycling we reclaim useful products and materials. We use recyclables as manufacturing feedstocks just as we do virgin raw materials, but using recyclables also helps to preserve the earth's scarce resources, reduces society's energy demand, lowers water and air pollution and reduces solid waste. 
   Mr. President, our bill corrects this unintended consequence of Superfund. It recognizes that recycling is not disposal. That recyclers are not subject to Superfund's liability scheme should the owners of mills, foundries or refineries, to which recyclers ship their material, contaminate their facilities. 
   Let me highlight an example of the unintended consequence that will continue to exist without this needed clarification. A recycler sends scrap metal as feedstock to be manufactured into a new product at a mill. The same mill also uses virgin metals to make the identical product. If the mill contaminates its facility with a hazardous substance, only the recyclable becomes subject to Superfund liability. Because recyclables are considered solid wastes, the recycler's actions are considered arranging for disposal, thus creating liability. However, the shipper of the virgin material is not liable under Superfund since it shipped a product and did not ``arrange for disposal.'' 
   The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 is essential to correct Superfund's unintended bias against recycling. It will provide the same relief from Superfund liability for legitimate recyclers as that enjoyed by those who sell virgin materials. It will also ensure that, sham recyclers will not benefit from the provisions of this bill. The Superfund Recycling Equity Act contains conditions that can only be met by legitimate recyclers of paper, glass, plastic, metals, textiles and rubber. And, to be free of liability, recyclers must act in an environmentally sound manner and sell their product to manufacturers with environmentally responsible business practices. 
   It is also important to note what this bill will not do. It will not relieve from liability any recycler who has contaminated his own facility. Nor will it assist recyclers who have disposed of waste at landfills or other places at which waste was the cause of a release of hazardous substances to a site that is addressed by the Superfund program. 
   Mr. President, the Senate Minority Leader and I previously stated our intention that, should a more comprehensive Superfund bill fail to move toward conclusion in the Senate, we would work in a bipartisan fashion, toward the goal of Superfund relief for legitimate recyclers in the 1999 session of this Congress. Members of the Environment and Public Works, led by Chairman CHAFEE, Subcommittee Chairman SMITH, and Ranking Minority Member BAUCUS, have worked extraordinarily hard to try to bring a common sense Superfund bill to the Senate floor that addresses a series of issues, including relief for recyclers. Unfortunately, once again, differences appear to have stymied that effort. I congratulate my colleagues for their efforts to address this issue. However, realizing the chances of passing a more comprehensive Superfund reform bill are now somewhat remote, it is time to address the Superfund recycling issue. 
   The language offered today is similar to the bipartisan measure we introduced last year. In the last Congress, the Minority Leader and I were joined by 63 of our colleagues across party and ideological lines in support of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act (S. 2180). It is now time to complete our work and provide relief--relief for recyclers that is long overdue.  
   There is one remaining issue regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in recycled paper which has been the subject of negotiations between various parties and the Administration. It is my understanding that these parties are negotiating in good faith, and that many, but not all issues, have been resolved. I have said in the past, I would be willing to modify the Superfund recycling language if the original negotiating partners agreed to a proposed language change. That remains my position. Should there be an agreement among the original negotiators on the paper PCB issue subsequent to today's introduction, I will at the earliest appropriate moment make the agreed upon change. 
   Mr. President, Americans have properly embraced the benefits of recycling. Americans know that increased recycling means more efficient use of natural resources and a meaningful reduction in solid waste. By removing the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, Congress will stimulate more recycling. I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this pro-environment bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, earlier this week, author Willie Morris, a native of Mississippi, passed away from an apparent heart attack at the young age of 64. Mr. Morris was a writer and editor who painted a vivid picture of the Southern way of life unlike any literary figure since William Faulkner. Mr. Morris had the heart of a good ole country boy who grew up in Yazoo City, and the intellect of a Rhodes Scholar. 
   Mr. Morris later went on to become a major literary leader, becoming editor and chief of Harper's Magazine at the age of 32. He attained national prominence in his career as a journalist, nonfiction writer, novelist, editor, and essayist by writing more than a dozen books on subjects ranging from his childhood English fox terrier in ``My Dog Skip'' to the intersection of football and race in ``The Courting of Marcus Dupree.'' Critics have characterized Mr. Morris's works as being ``exquisite and lyrical rendering.'' He was particularly well known for the books and articles in which he compared his experiences and southern heritage to America's own history. 
   Rather than attend the University of Mississippi, his father had him go to the distant and alien environs of the University of Texas in Austin, but in 1980 he returned to Ole Miss to be the writer in residence. His class room has been described like being at an Ole Miss v. LSU football game, because the students were always so excited. 
   Mr. President, Mr. Morris has been described as being ``a prolific author in his own life, defining moments of intimacy and compassion.'' 
   David Sansing, a retired University of Mississippi historian said this about Mr. Morris, ``Willie was such an honest voice, clear, vivid, never ambiguous. He had to leave the South to really confirm his own Southernness. But of course, he came back.'' 
   Willie Morris's writing undoubtedly had a grave impact on the lives of Mississippians and Southerners alike. He is survived by his wife, JoAnne Prichard of Jackson, and his son David Rae of New Orleans.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, an individual has filed two pro se civil actions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against two Senate Committees. In the first suit, against the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully denied a commission in the Navy and documentation of a prior honorable discharge from the Army Reserve. He has sued the Armed Services Committee because, in his view, the Committee failed to take sufficient steps to rectify these errors after he brought them to the Committee's attention. 
   The second complaint alleges that the Judiciary Committee failed to take appropriate action when the plaintiff, in correspondence with the Committee, accused a federal judge and state and federal law enforcement officers of malfeasance. 
   These resolutions authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Committees in these suits to move for their dismissal.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I want to honor a man of integrity, perseverance, intellect, and dedication. Dr. Gerald Walton recently retired from my alma mater, the University of Mississippi. Dr. Walton has served Ole Miss for nearly forty years in several capacities ranging from a part-time English instructor in 1959 to the position of Provost from which he is retiring. 
   Born and raised in Neshoba County, Mississippi, Dr. Walton has been a great servant of higher education in Mississippi. He graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1956 with a degree in English. He then attended Ole Miss, where he obtained his master's degree and then his doctorate. Dr. Walton's next step was a stint as a teaching assistant. Once he got his foot in the door, he quickly gained the respect of his colleagues and began to move up in the ranks. He has demonstrated exemplary commitment to public education. 
   In addition to managing the demands of a career in academia, Dr. Walton has been dedicated to his family. He has always put his wife and three daughters first. I am envious of all the free time he will have for his four grandchildren.  
   Mr. President, Dr. Walton has stood the test of time. He has adjusted to the many changes Ole Miss and our society have experienced. Dr. Walton has always stood by his principles of right and wrong, which were first professionally tested in 1962. He was one of only a handful of faculty who publicly supported James Meredith and the integration of Ole Miss. Several members of the faculty advised him not to sign a letter of support, but as Dr. Walton would say, ``I felt it was the right thing for me to do.'' His character was challenged early and he passed with flying colors. 
   Dr. Walton's abilities and personal demeanor have made him one of the favorite administrators on campus, a fact which is evidenced by his holding several leadership positions during his tenure at Ole Miss. He has been described as modest and deeply principled. Often, Dr. Walton has been the one who carried the responsibility and made crucial decisions, but he shies from the spotlight, and allows others to be recognized and applauded. Today, we applaud Gerald Walton. 
   Mr. President, at Ole Miss, Dr. Walton has proven himself to be multi-talented. He has served the University as a teaching assistant, Assistant Professor, the Director of Freshman English, the Associate Dean and Dean of Liberal Arts, Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Interim Chancellor, and finally in the position of Provost. In each of his positions, Dr. Walton has been the type of leader for whom every one of his students and colleagues would do most anything. Other contributions on his long list of accomplishments are the roles he played in organizing the first Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference and the Oxford Conference for the Book. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Walton is not one to brag on himself, but never thought twice about bragging on the University or his colleagues. I am pleased to have the opportunity to honor such a deserving individual. I trust that the Senate will join me in congratulating Dr. Gerald Walton on his retirement from a distinguished career at the University of Mississippi. My dear friend, Chancellor Robert C. Khayat, said it best when he was speaking of Dr. Walton. He said, ``Truly, Gerald Walton can move into the next phase of his life knowing that the words, `Well done, my faithful servant,' apply to him.''

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a great educator who has fought diligently on behalf of all Mississippi students. 
   Dr. Rudolph E. Waters has been employed at Alcorn State University, the nation's oldest historically black land-grant institution since 1957. Over the past 40 years, Dr. Waters has worked tirelessly to improve education standards. 
   While at Alcorn State, Dr. Waters has served as Dean of Students, Dean of Instruction, Coordinator of Title III Programs, Vice President, Interim President, and Executive Vice President. In 1964, while serving as Dean of Instruction, he was a participant in the Institute for Academic Deans at Harvard University. 
   Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, Waters received his B.S.C. from DePaul University in 1954. After studying for his master's degree at Boston University and doing a stint at Southern Illinois University, he received his Doctorate of Philosophy from Kansas State University in 1977. 
   His professional affiliations include the American Association for Higher Education, the National Association of Collegiate Deans and Registrars, Phi Delta Kappa, Delta Mu Delta, and the National Society for the Study of Education. 
   Dr. Waters has worked with youth of all ages. He has been a member of the Commission on School Accreditation; the Commission of Interinstitutional Cooperation for Alcorn State University and Mississippi State University; and a member of the board of directors for several organizations including the Andrew Jackson Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the University Press of Mississippi and the National Commission for Cooperative Education. 
   Dr. Waters's commitment to excellence has allowed him to serve on visitation teams for the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Council on Study and Accreditation. In his work, he has advised schools across the southeast including Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Alabama Lutheran Junior College in Selma, Morris College of Sumter, South Carolina; and Natchez College in Mississippi. 
   He has been awarded several special honors and commendations throughout his professional career including the Outstanding Educator Award from Rust College in 1976, the Alumni Fellow Award from Kansas State in 1988,  and the Kappan Of The Year from the Utica chapter of Phi Delta Kappa in 1993. 
   Dr. Waters's writings have focused on teaching and the shaping of young minds He authored ``Implications of Studies on Class and School Size for Programs in Business Education in the Public Secondary Schools'' and ``A Profile of Presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.'' He also co-authored ``Justice, Society, and the Individual: Improving the Human Condition'' which was published in the 1978 Yearbook of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. 
   Dr. Waters is not only a great educator, but a great rhetorician and historian. On numerous occasions, he has been called upon to represent the university at both state and national events. He has a great knowledge of history and a distinguished usage of rhetoric and philosophy. 
   On the campus, Dr. Waters is loved by administrators students and faculty. His kindness and gentle manner are always appreciated, and his upbeat spirit and attitude are an attribute is caught by all who come in contact with him. 
   I commend Dr. Waters for all he has accomplished and all that he has yet to achieve. Dr. Waters is truly a shining star for Alcorn State University and for all Mississippians.

   Mr. LOTT. Since objection has been heard, I have no alternative other than to offer a series of amendments. This is important because we do need to move forward with the Agriculture appropriations bill. We brought it up earlier, this past month. It became embroiled in an unrelated issue, and we had to set it aside. 
   The farmers in America and the consumers of America and the children of America are depending on this very important legislation going through the process. We are talking about $60.7 billion, probably more than that by the time it is completed, for agriculture in America. We need to get it completed. 
   I know there are some issues that cause a lot of concern: How do you deal with a disaster in America, when do you deal with it, and how would any assistance be apportioned among the farmers that have been impacted by disasters in a number of ways. And also, of course, we have this very important dairy issue. I have advised Senator COCHRAN, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator KOHL, and Senator DASCHLE to make sure everybody understands what I am doing here. I am doing it because I do think it is so important that we move forward on this bill.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators who may have missed a step or two there, a cloture motion was just filed on the dairy amendment. The vote on the cloture motion will occur Wednesday under Rule XXII, unless agreement can be reached to set a time certain for that vote. 
   I encourage Senators on all sides of this issue to communicate with each other and see if there is some accommodation that could be worked out so that both sides can find it acceptable. In the meantime, it is my hope that we can continue to debate the important disaster relief amendments. 
   I thank my colleagues. I am delighted to yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, or to Senator DASCHLE if he has any comment at this time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate is returning a very distinguished and qualified Commissioner back to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I am pleased that my good friend Curtis L. Hebert, Jr. of Pascagoula, Mississippi is that Commissioner. 
   As a former member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I appreciate the high standard that FERC nominees are held to during committee consideration. Throughout Curt's nearly two-year tenure as a FERC Commissioner, he demonstrated that he has not only the knowledge, but the determination and skills to get the job done. He has been a responsible and able federal steward of the utility industry across the United States. I expect that he will continue to serve the FERC and our nation with the same enthusiasm and foresight. 
   Before Curt came to Washington, he served the state of Mississippi as a member and a chair of the Public Service Commission for several years. During that time, he demonstrated the ability to balance the diverse utility interests in our state. This was no easy task. Mississippi is the home to both public and private power companies, PUHCAs and providers of all sizes. Curt was also my representative in the Mississippi legislature, where he did an excellent job. Curt has proven that he has the skills necessary to address the needs of each of these entities, while keeping the best interest of the consumer in mind. 
   Congress must recognize that national electric utility deregulation is on the horizon. How and when a new system will be created remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that the FERC will be instrumental in guiding Congress toward competition in the utility industry. I am confident that Curt has the experience and insight necessary to help us reach the right balance of interests. Most importantly, Curt understands what deregulation means at the state level. Already, Congress has witnessed deregulation of several states, but Congress will value the FERC's input concerning deregulation. 
   There is no industry as complex as the utility world--and none that impacts the lives of Americans more directly every hour of every day. The challenges ahead are great and must be tackled head on. There is no denying that the FERC Commissioners have their work cut out for them. 
   I have enjoyed working with Curt, and spending time with his wife, Virginia, and their two children, Lane and Ashley. They are an authentic, Mississippi family. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously confirmed Curt Hebert as a member of the FERC, thus ensuring that the future of the electric utility industry is in good hands. I congratulate him on this accomplishment and wish him the best of luck in the future.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have a unanimous consent agreement that I think will be constructive in getting our work completed. It has been discussed thoroughly with the Democratic leadership, and I know it is going to take some more time tonight and also an effort tomorrow, but I think that all things considered, it is the best way to proceed. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the vote with respect to the pending amendment No. 1462 occur tomorrow morning beginning at 9 a.m, with 15 minutes for concluding remarks to be equally divided beginning at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the vote with respect to the Hutchison amendment on the marriage penalty occur immediately following the above-described vote and there also be 15 minutes for concluding remarks to be equally divided beginning at 8:45. 
   I also ask consent that following the conclusion of debate this evening, no further debate time be in order other than the concluding time as outlined above. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the two described votes above, the Senate begin the voting sequence with debate on any amendment or motion properly filed in the consent agreement of July 29 limited to 2 minutes equally divided.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will be no further votes this evening. The first two votes of tomorrow will begin at 9 a.m. A number of votes will occur following those two votes. I hope Senators will work with the managers and work with the whips on both sides of the aisle. Senator NICKLES is here and prepared to work with Senators to discuss the seriousness of their amendments. The ``Tasmanian junior'' here, HARRY REID, is going to be working on the Democratic side. Talk with the whips. It is not a very seemly way to do business to have repeated votes in the so-called vote-arama. A reasonable number is understandable and can be explained sufficiently. Senators will be asked not to leave the Chamber in the morning because once we start on the series of votes, votes will occur every 10 to 15 minutes, so we can get at least four done in an hour.

As far as amendments that have not been thoroughly debated in committee, it is awfully hard to change the Tax Code in that way. We will try to accommodate Senators as best we can.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning as I came into the Senate Chamber, the words to a song came to mind, ``O Happy Day.'' I almost feel like singing. This is a happy day. This is when the American people finally get to have a little bit more control over their lives, their own lives, based on decisions made in Chester County, PA, or in Pascagoula, MS. This is a day when we are going to be talking about the people being able to keep just a little bit more of their own hard-earned money. Too often in the Senate we are arguing over details; we are trying to figure out how we from Washington can spend more of the people's money; we are thinking about how can we in Washington control more of people's lives. 
   Well, finally we are going to get to have some fun; the people are going to get to have some fun. They can keep their own money to look after their own children without the Government telling them how to do it, to put them in the school of their choice, to deal with their health needs, or maybe even to have a little fun. O Happy Day. They get to be with their family on their own money. 
   So I got up this morning feeling good because finally we are going to be doing something that I feel good about, the kind of thing that I came to Washington to do, and that was to try to control and reduce the size of Washington Government, to go with what Thomas Jefferson had in mind, and that was to put those decisions back closest to the people, with the people and the Government closest to the people. This is when we begin to do it. I think back during Jefferson's term after a war, a conflict that the country had been involved in. They terminated the death tax. Yes. Go back and look at history. The only time death taxes were put in place was during wars. When the wars were over, they were ended. But then mistakenly, because he was not in good health, President Wilson, after World War I, did not take it off and we have been stuck with it ever since. 
   So this is a happy day, and I look forward to having a discussion about the specifics of tax relief for working Americans.

   Mr. LOTT. Before we get started with that, under a previous order, the Senate will begin a cloture vote on the substitute amendment to the juvenile justice bill at 9:45. Following the vote, Senator SMITH is expected to make  some remarks regarding his concerns with the juvenile justice legislation. If cloture is invoked and following the remarks of Senator SMITH, it is hoped the Senate will proceed to the various motions to send the juvenile justice bill to conference. 
   I understand completely Senator SMITH's concerns. He has been determined, but he has been reasonable and cooperative within the limits of what he felt he had to do to the maximum degree. I thank him for his approach. I certainly share a lot of his concerns. But I believe, all things considered, this is the right thing to do for the Senate and for the country. 
   The Senate will then begin consideration of the tax relief bill under the reconciliation procedures. As a reminder, by statute, the reconciliation bill is limited to 20 hours of debate. I really would like to have more time for discussion on this bill so that we could cut out some of the discussion on all these other bills that come up. Therefore, it is hoped that Senators will have their amendments ready and will offer their amendments during the 20 hours. Debate time on amendments is included, but the actual vote time is not included in the 20 hours. 
   So we can expect to go well into the evening today and again on Thursday in order to finish. If we do not, we will go over until Friday. But we have enough time and we certainly should finish this bill no later than sometime during the day Friday. 
   We do expect opening statements this morning. It may be that there will be several hours needed for the opening statements, but I hope we can quickly turn to the amendment process and give Senators an opportunity to offer amendments about which they feel strongly. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Before I go to the next unanimous consent request, I again express my appreciation for the patience and for the cooperation of Senator SMITH in working through this process. 
   Personally, I believe very strongly that we need to have a good juvenile justice bill, which includes a lot of very important provisions with regard to how we try juveniles who commit crime, how we incarcerate them, how we deal with school security, including metal detectors. It also has programs included for alcohol and drug abuse, and it has some values provisions in it. 
   The House has passed a good bill which did not include the gun provisions. I hope this will be a juvenile justice bill when it comes back from conference. 
   I do think the right thing to do is to go to conference. I appreciate cooperation in making that happen.

   As a reminder to Members, a late session is expected Thursday, and votes are expected to occur on Friday, since it appears it may not be possible to finish Thursday night. 
   I reiterate my commitment that if we find a way to finish the votes on this issue Thursday night, we will not have a session on Friday. If that is not possible, we will go into session Friday and continue voting as is necessary in order to complete this reconciliation tax relief bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are about ready to make the unanimous consent agreement to proceed with the Interior appropriations bill. We had one further modification. I believe it is being cleared on both sides. 
   I expect there will be no problem, and hopefully we can go forward with that.  
   In that connection, I urge Senators to come to the floor if they have amendments to this Interior appropriations bill so we can make progress and not spend too much time on opening statements or in quorum calls. I am not encouraging amendments. But if a Senator has an amendment that he or she is very serious about, they should come onto the floor and offer it. If that is not done, we will have a vote before too long. So Members should understand that we will have the Interior appropriations bill available and that we are serious about going forward with it. We hope to make good progress on it tonight. Actually, I would like to see us complete the bill in view of the modifications that have already occurred concerning some of the provisions within this Interior appropriations bill. 
   It is a very important bill for our country. It involves, obviously, the parks and lands all over our country that are very important to people of all persuasions, as well as funding for various commissions. 
   I hope that it can be considered quickly. I commend in advance Senator SLADE GORTON for the work he has done on this bill, and his ranking Member, Senator BYRD, and Senator REID, who I know has been very interested in this bill and supports it. 
   When you have Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD prepared to work on an appropriations bill, I suspect that most of its problems have already been resolved, and the Senate should be able to act very quickly on that legislation.

   Mr. LOTT. That would be our intention. Of course, under the rules dealing with reconciliation, you have 20 hours for debate on the tax relief package. Included in that 20 hours would be debate on amendments, although the vote time on amendments would not count against the 20 hours. So it would be our intention to go through the day and into the night on Wednesday and all day Thursday on this subject and into the night. If we finish the bill Thursday night, then it would be our plan at this time for that to be the conclusion for the week. 
   I hope we would have already done the Interior appropriations bill. If we can't get it done because of problems that develop Thursday or, as you know, if amendments are still pending when all time has expired, we go through this very unseemly process on voting during what we call a ``votarama,'' with one vote after another and only a minute or two between the votes to explain what is in them. 
   I hope we won't have that problem this time. But if we can't get it done Thursday night, of course, we would have to go over into Friday. But under the rules, we should be able to finish it not later than Friday and, hopefully, even Thursday night. 
   We had indicated earlier a desire to go to the Agriculture appropriations bill early next week and, hopefully, complete the Agriculture appropriations bill. We then have the option to go back to the reconciliation conference report.

   Mr. LOTT. If the pattern continues on that bill as it has on other bills, I think that probably will happen. As I recall, last Thursday night at about 8 o'clock around 43 amendments were accepted en bloc on the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill. 
   It is a little tougher when you are talking about tax policy. But I am sure that some probably will be accepted to move forward. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the House Interior bill, and, immediately following the reporting by the clerk, Senator GORTON be recognized to offer the text of the Senate reported bill, as modified, to strike on page 116, lines 3 through 7; page 129, line 14, through page 132, line 20, as an amendment to the House bill. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, the bill, as thus amended, be considered original text for the purpose of further amendment, and that any legislative provision added thereby be subject nevertheless to a point of order under rule XVI.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1654, the NASA Authorization Act for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Many of my colleagues and their staff's have worked hard on this legislation. This is a good bill. It ensures NASA is authorized at the appropriate level to continue its role in Space Flight and Exploration, Earth and Space Science, assembly and operations on the International Space Station, and Aeronautical Research. 
   Over the last decade, the U.S. commercial space launch industry has lost its technological advantage and now holds only 30 percent of the worldwide space launch market. As a result, sensitive U.S. technology is often launched into space by either Chinese, Russian or French rockets, increasing the risk of unwarranted U.S. technology transfer to foreign nations. The delayed development of modern, less expensive launch systems in this country needs to be rectified. This high cost of space transportation has greatly curtailed U.S. efforts in space research, science and exploration. This bill includes important provisions to address this issue which I would like to highlight. 
   Mr. President, NASA is currently conducting research programs, such as the X-33, X-34 and X-37, that could result in important technological advancements applicable to future reusable launch vehicles and reductions in space transportation costs. In addition, there are existing hardware and engine systems, that if evaluated, could make an immediate contribution to reducing the cost of access to space by a factor of 10. The information gained from these evaluations can be incorporated into design plans for the Spaceliner 100 series of vehicles and ultimately reduce the cost of access to space by a factor of one hundred. In the Commerce Committee, I amended the Senate NASA bill to add $150M for Fiscal Year 2000 to accelerate these future space launch programs by one year. Accelerating the efforts that gain us cheaper access to space will help the U.S. recapture the space launch business and save on future launch costs. American companies would not have to look overseas for cheaper launches, thereby minimizing our technology exposure to foreign governments. 
   Also, I am pleased to see the portion of the Earth Science budget supporting NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing effort is sustained. These programs, managed by the NASA Stennis Space Center's Commercial Remote Sensing Program Office in Mississippi, are contributing to the birth and growth of a new international industry. Wall Street has predicted this industry will grow to the $10 billion level by 2010. NASA Stennis personnel working together with the private sector, university researchers and other Federal agencies are already producing viable commercial products. New efforts are underway to coordinate the potential impact of these commercial products with the Department of Transportation. I have been told by DOT officials that remote sensing technology infused in the right way to DOT's planning efforts could result in significant savings in highway planning and construction. That is a very good potential payback for a small investment in the commercialization of remote sensing technology. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill. I hope that the Senate's differences with the House can be resolved quickly so that the bill can be presented to the President for signature.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to my longtime staff member, Fielding Bradford Robinson, Jr., who is departing my personal office staff and returning to the State of Mississippi, after more than ten years of outstanding service here in Washington. Throughout his career, Brad Robinson has served with great distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided to me and to my home state of Mississippi. 
   A native of Jackson, Mississippi, Brad graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1982, with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Public Administration. At Ole Miss, Brad was an officer of the Associated Student Body and a member of the Delta Psi Fraternity, St. Anthony Hall. He began his association with politics as Page Captain in the Mississippi House of Representatives. After logging countless miles as a pollster associated with CBS News, Brad went to work as a staff assistant to the  legendary United States Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi. At that time, Senator Stennis was President Pro-Tempore of the Senate and Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Following the retirement of Senator Stennis, Brad signed on as a staff member for freshman Congressman Larkin Smith, my friend and successor in the U.S. House of Representatives. Tragically, Congressman Smith died in a plane crash only months after taking office. 
   In 1989, Brad returned to the United States Senate and began work as a member of my personal staff. On Thursday, August 5th, 1999, Brad will conclude over ten years of faithful service in my office. During these years, Brad has proven to be one of my most loyal and dedicated staff members. As a special legislative assistant and as my deputy director of projects, Brad has tirelessly worked for the best interests of our Nation and the State of Mississippi. Over the years, working on Mississippi project interests has brought Brad into contact with virtually every city, county, and state agency in Mississippi; every federal agency and department; and every committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. 
   Brad has pursued virtually every type of public infrastructure project conceivable, helping Mississippians build and improve utility systems, industrial parks, highways, bridges, railroads, airports and water ports. Using formal training from Ole Miss as a public planner, Brad labored closely with local engineers, and with the Army Corps of Engineers, to champion life saving flood control projects in the Mississippi Delta Region, the Jackson Metropolitan Area of Central Mississippi, and in the Forrest and Harrison County areas of South Mississippi. From the Director of the Mississippi Rural Water Association to water system operators throughout Mississippi, Brad is known as a dependable source of information and positive government action. Port directors along the Mississippi River, the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, have come to rely on Brad's expertise and network of contacts, on everything from dredging projects, to trade and empowerment zone designations. 
   Working behind the scenes to encourage top flight companies such as Southwest Airlines to expand into Mississippi, has also been a talent in which Brad has excelled. He is known by airport directors throughout our state as a man they know personally, who seemingly always is there to help with extending or repairing a runway, or improving navigation and weather instrument capability. Railroads, too, came to know Brad as an honest broker who stood for economic progress that also safeguarded and improved public safety. His multi-modal expertise, made Brad a natural asset to my staff during the legislative process that culminated in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), as well as later during the legislative development of the Transportation Efficiency Act of the Twenty-first Century (TEA-21). 
   Among his many successes, Brad played a key role in encouraging the establishment of an environmentally friendly power generating facility in our state, which will efficiently and cleanly make use of vast alternative fuel supplies of lignite or low-grade coal. Combining a broad general knowledge with a keen appreciation for business, science, and technical development, and a deep respect for conservation and history, Brad has become a favorite of both business and development concerns, as well as leaders in historic and natural preservation. Brad was instrumental in historic preservation efforts for the Natchez Trace and the Natchez National Historic Park, as well as efforts to establish a Campaign of Vicksburg National Historic Trail, and a new visitors center for the Corinth, Mississippi Battlefield and Cemetery. Working both with community activists and public officials, Brad helped further these causes as well as many other historic and environmental projects such as rebuilding the Fort Massachusetts lighthouse on Ship Island, and restoring natural levels of water flow along the Lower Pearl River. 
   Like many effective staff members on Capitol Hill, Brad is the kind of person who never meets a stranger. A true southern gentleman, his Christian values and honest work ethic have endeared Brad to his colleagues and constituents in addition to earning their respect and trust. His flexible yet focused demeanor enables him to handle numerous projects without losing sight of the people with whom he works. For all of the many public projects Brad assisted over the years, he always made time to help individual citizens with their problems. On one occasion, while assisting a constituent with her tax problem, Brad learned of an unintended result that affected similarly situated citizens across our Nation. Brad got to work, helped form a bipartisan coalition, and succeeded in helping amend the tax code to reflect the original intent of Congress. 
   Brad also has contributed to the quality of life here on Capitol Hill through volunteering his time and leadership for such non-profit organizations as the Mississippi Society, the Ole Miss Alumni Association, and the Taste of the South annual charity ball. He even met his lovely wife, Mary Ellen, while she served on the staff of Senator STROM THURMOND. Brad and Mary Ellen will make their new home in Gulfport, Mississippi, and are expecting their first child in October. 
   Upon leaving my staff, Brad will serve as Executive Director of the Southern Rapid Rail Transit Commission where he will play a significant role in helping to establish high speed rail passenger service from Houston, Texas, to Jacksonville, Florida, and from the Gulf Coast to Atlanta. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Brad all of the best in his new career. I wish for Brad, and his growing family, that they experience all of the opportunity, excitement and adventure of the American Dream as they enter this new chapter of their lives and in all of their future endeavors. Brad, my most sincere congratulations on a job well done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help state and local governments more effectively finance the cost of essential services such as schools, streets, and water and sewer systems. 
   By easing tax law restrictions on the refinancing of certain bonds, this proposal would allow local jurisdictions to take advantage of favorable market interest rates. Financing the essential projects of our communities is primarily a state and local government responsibility. Federal tax laws should make it easier--not more difficult--for them to lessen the burden of taxes and other governmental charges on our citizens. 
   The proposal would adjust tax law restrictions on the refinancing of certain bonds issued to provide services such as government-owned schools, hospitals, streets and water and sewer systems. 
   Under current tax rules, most state and local governments may undertake an advance refunding of bonded indebtedness only one time and are thus unable to take full advantage of periods when market interest rates are low.  This legislation would allow every state and local government an additional opportunity to refinance bonded indebtedness issued to finance essential governmental projects. 
   Furthermore, this legislation would give state and local governments flexibility skin to that of a homeowner who refinances a mortgage to reduce monthly payments and thereby increase income. The federal government should not expect state and local governments to shoulder the burden of financing local infrastructure, and then deny them the flexibility to handle their own affairs in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. The change will help continue shifting power and control to local government where it belongs.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will immediately begin debate on the resolution to reinstate rule XVI. By a previous order, there will be 6 hours of debate on the resolution with one amendment in order regarding scope in conference. 
   As a reminder, a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the House-passed juvenile justice bill was filed also on Thursday. That vote, then, will take place in a series of stacked votes this afternoon at 5:30, along with the rule XVI resolution and the amendment regarding scope in conference. 
   Further, it is the intention of the majority leader to begin debate on the Interior appropriations bill, and the reconciliation legislation will also come up this week, probably on Wednesday. Of course, under the rules, 20 hours of debate is permitted, and I am sure there will be a number of amendments, so we will have to begin on that promptly sometime early Wednesday morning. 
   Senators should be prepared to vote throughout each day and into the evenings, although we probably will not go late into the evening today other than the three stacked votes. But on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday late evenings should be anticipated in order to get this important work done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then I yield myself time out of this 54 minutes, realizing I also would have an opportunity to use my 15 minutes in closing. But there has been so much revisionist history espoused on the floor of the Senate today, I just did not want to let 1 hour 15 minutes go by without maybe correcting some of the record or putting an accurate history back into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   A famous quote comes to my mind, from what I have heard here today. I fear ``[thou] doth protest too much.'' In other words, there is an awful lot of protesting by the Democrats that has been going on that makes anybody who is a dispassionate, disinterested watcher just looking in, inquire why are they protesting so much? 
   I have to note the inconsistency that is involved, too. Basically what the minority is saying, the Democrats are saying: As a protest statement, we are going to vote against reinstating rule XVI but we want to turn right around and reinstate rule XXVIII. 
   This is Senate gibberish, I know, but it is inconsistent because they are saying we want to continue to offer legislation on appropriations bills but we do not want anything coming back out of conference between the House and Senate that exceeds the scope of what was in the bill. I think there is an inconsistency there. I think we ought to take a close look at the scope of the conferences question. We have time to do that. We have committees, a Rules Committee, and we have a Governmental Affairs Committee that have been considering rules changes. I think there are a number of rules in the Senate that should be reviewed. 
   I think budget rules should be reviewed. For instance, this very week on the reconciliation bill which would provide some tax relief, at the end of the 20 hours, if amendments are still pending, we still have this very poor procedure where we might have to have what is called a ``vote-arama,'' of one vote after the other, one right behind the other every 2 minutes; I guess it would be 12 minutes between the votes--a very poor way to do legislative business. I think we ought to take a look at that and see if we cannot find a way to improve it. So there are a number of things we can do that I think will help the way the Senate does business. 
   I would like to go back and remind Senators how this rule was changed, this rule XVI. Rule XVI was overturned by the Senate on March 16, 1995, on the Department of Defense supplemental appropriations bill. Senator HUTCHISON of Texas appealed the ruling of the Chair, in that the Chair ruled her amendment regarding a restriction on appropriations funds to make a final determination with respect to the endangered species list was legislation on an appropriations bill. In other words, this involved the Endangered Species Act. The Chair ruled this was legislating on an appropriations bill and therefore was out of order. 
   That ruling was appealed. Many Members on the Republican side of the aisle supported her appeal. As a result, the Parliamentarian can no longer entertain a point of order that extraneous language is legislation on an appropriations bill. Again, keep in mind that up until that point that point of order 
   would have been upheld by the Chair. That ruling was overturned and therefore a new precedent was set. 
   Interestingly, in that vote, No. 107, on March 16, 1995, 54 Republicans voted to overturn the Chair, 44 Democrats voted to sustain the Chair's ruling. 
   I am sure for the most part on both sides what was really being voted on was the substance of this endangered species list amendment. For instance, one interesting quote on that occasion came from our colleague, Senator REID, who has been on the floor a good deal today. I think he summed up what was going on with regard to this particular amendment because I think probably, without putting words in his mouth, he was at least sympathetic to what Senator HUTCHISON was trying to do. But this is what Senator REID said:  
   But this is not the way to treat a very important matter. I am very upset. I am going to do everything that I can to make sure the President, if in fact this bill passes, will veto it if we start conducting business in this way.  
   Basically he had indicated, I believe, that while he had some understanding and sympathy on the issue, he thought this was no way to be doing business. 
   As a result of the overturning of the Chair, the appropriations process has certainly lost some of its legitimacy and has been complicated by the number of amendments, and their variety--and I am going to cite some amendments that were offered. The appropriations process is a very important part of our constitutional duty to the Federal Government. Yet with each passing year since this vote in 1995, it gets more difficult to get our appropriations bills through because of all the legislating that occurs on the appropriations bills. 
   Let me emphasize, while I thought that most of the comments from the Democratic side today were very partisan, I don't view this as partisan. It should not be. The discussions we have had across the aisle over the past 4 years have been that this was a mistake; we ought to work together to change it. But let me give a recent example. This past week on the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill, I do not know how many amendments showed up on that bill, probably a hundred or so. I know of at least one specific example. I will not cite the specific bill because that Senator would know what I was talking about and would not feel that it would be appropriate that I cite his particular bill, but it was a whole bill that had not been introduced, had not been referred to committee, had not been reviewed by the committee, and would significantly change the way a process works in the Federal Government. That was going to be offered to the appropriations bill. That Senator was on my side of the aisle. 
   So I really question that that is the way Senators would want this body to work, where whole bills will be cut out of whole cloth and brought to the floor of the Senate in a Senator's hand and he or she will say: I want this bill added to the appropriations bill. 
   That is no way to legislate. We should not be doing that. But that is the kind of thing that has been happening since we had this ruling and then the appeal of the ruling of the Chair in 1995 that set this new precedent. 
   The Senator from California was here earlier today commenting on this. Yet when this vote took place, she said:   
   I think to come to this floor of the U.S. Senate and to add an amendment to the Defense emergency supplemental bill that deals with a very important and sensitive environmental issue is simply not the right way to legislate.  
   Holy smoke, she is absolutely right. She said that on March 16, 1995. That was not what I thought I heard her saying today. Maybe I misinterpreted what was being said today. But that is the point. Senators will have an opportunity to offer amendments on other bills. The point is made quite often in this body, unlike the House--and nobody wants to make the Senate the House--any Senator can come to the floor on a bill involving, let's just say bankruptcy, and he or she can offer an amendment to deal with health care or can offer something to do with the Forest Service. We do not have these strict germaneness rules. We do take up legislative issues. 
   But one of the reasons why the majority leader cannot bring more legislative bills to the floor is because, in many instances, it has taken so long to get through other issues such as juvenile justice or the Patients' Bill of Rights or other appropriations bills; therefore, making it very difficult to bring up other important legislative issues such as the Federal aviation reauthorization bill, the bankruptcy bill that I referred to, or the nuclear waste bill that has been reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It makes it more and more difficult for anything to be done other than appropriations and reconciliation. And the reconciliation procession is very important because it is the only way you can get a bill dealing with taxes, for instance, to the floor without it being threatened by a filibuster or all kinds of other Senate legislative maneuvers. 
   This is one where you bring it up, you have a specified period of time, you have an amendment process, you go through those amendments, and then you have a vote. That process moves quite easily through here. Right now we are in a period where appropriations bills and reconciliation are about all we can get done. 
   There are complaints about filling up the tree. I have not gone back and done the research, but this process of so-called ``filling up the tree'' again is Senate language that is used to describe that all the different opportunities to amend are filled with amendments. I didn't invent that procedure. Other Senators who have been majority leader certainly have used that. Senator Mitchell used it. Senator BYRD used it. That is a very legitimate tactic or process which can be used, one that should not be used all the time, and one that has been used relatively rarely, but it certainly is a legitimate thing the majority leader can do to focus debate and to get debate concluded in a reasonable period of time. 
   Let me give some examples of the kinds of things that have been tying up the Senate since we have been without the ability to strike them down by using rule XVI. First of all, it seems to me if you look at history, probably there has been an increasing number of amendments which have been offered on these appropriations bills. It seems now it is quite often within the range of 80 to 100 or 120 amendments on just about anything that comes along. Every Senator dumps his out basket on the floor of the Senate with every amendment he or she has ever dreamed of and some of the things with which we have to deal on appropriations bills, where it clearly would have been legislating on an appropriations bill, dealing with grasshopper 
   research, lettuce genetic breeding, peach tree short life, tomato wilting, the feasibility of using poultry litter as possible fuel. Other examples are: removing of computer games from Government computers, repainting of water towers, swimming pool construction, the study of green tree snakes. These may be legitimate agriculture issues, but with others, they certainly would be considered to be frivolous in nature in terms of being offered as amendments on appropriations bills. 
   While we have those examples, the ones that are the most startling and striking to me are the ones where whole bills or major amendments are offered on the floor of the Senate to appropriations bills that clearly is legislating on an appropriations bill, that do not apply in any way in terms of substance, where the committees have not been allowed to act, where the committee chairman has not had any input. It is time we bring this process under control. On more than one occasion, the exchanges between the Democratic leader and the majority leader have indicated that there has been a willingness or a desire on both sides to begin bringing this under control. 
   I urge my colleagues to look at how this happened. A lot of people on both sides of the aisle at the time it happened did not realize the significance of it and, secondly, said at the time: Yes, this is probably a mistake. 
   It has been a tool the Democrats have used over the past 4 years, and that is the way it works in the Senate. When you have a precedent, then Senators have a right to take advantage of it until a new one is set or until the Senate decides it is going in some other direction. There is nothing unusual about that at all. 
   We should reinstate this rule XVI. We should look at a number of rules and budget procedures we have. We have appropriators who have come to me and expressed concern about this. People with a long history of paying attention to the rules of the Senate and the budget procedures and the appropriations bills, such as Senator DOMENICI and Senator STEVENS and others, have said we need to get this back on track, we need to change the way we are doing business. 
   I hope we can get through the appropriations process this year as soon as possible, so we can do some of these other bills that are very important to our country, so Senators will have an opportunity to fully debate and discuss these issues and offer amendments to issues that are outside the appropriations process. 
   I hope we will have time to work with serious leaders in the Senate who are worried about the budget process, who are worried about the rules, and have some debate on the floor and make some changes. There is no desire at all to set up a Rules Committee in the House of Representatives sense, but there is a desire by this majority leader, as by every majority leader, to find a way to move the process and the legislation through the Senate. 
   We did a marvelous job last week, if you look at it. It did not look pretty at various times, but last week we did pass reorganization of the Department of Energy. After probably a month of resisting doing the fundamental reorganization we need at the Department of Energy to stop the leaks of our very important nuclear secrets to China or anybody else, we finally got it to a vote last Tuesday, and the vote was, I think, 96-1--overwhelmingly bipartisan. 
   One might ask: Why did it take you so long? That is the 
   way the Senate works sometimes. We have to think about it; we have to have debate; we work out some amendments. Also, it might be that nobody wanted to be on record as being against reorganization of the Department of Energy. Again, it was dragged out, and we had problems getting to the intelligence authorization bill. We even had to have a cloture vote to get to the intelligence authorization bill, the bill that provides for the intelligence information for our Federal Government, for the CIA. 
   I did not want to have to file a cloture motion on that, but I was told, in effect, that the Democrats were going to filibuster the motion to proceed. That meant the Democrats were going to filibuster even taking up the bill because they were not ready to debate the reorganization of the Department of Energy, I guess. I did not quite understand it. In order to get to a very important, very sensitive issue such as the intelligence authorization, the intelligence community of our Federal Government, which is such an important part of the defense of this country, the majority leader of the Senate had to file a cloture motion to even take up the bill for its consideration. If a change of heart had not happened, I would have had to file a second cloture motion to get to the substance of the bill. 
   The pontificating we do sometimes around here, the posturing about, oh, we are cut off--what is a leader supposed to do when told the motion to proceed to a bill is going to be filibustered? At that point, I have to take action to move a bill, such as the intelligence authorization, forward. When the smoke cleared, it passed. We got that bill done.  
   We got to the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill, a bill that quite often takes days, sometimes weeks, sometimes longer than weeks, with lots of amendments offered. As a matter of fact, with the cooperation of both sides of the aisle, on Thursday night at approximately 9:45 that legislation was passed. 
   Today I went over and shook the hand of Senator REID of Nevada and said: It would not have happened without your aggressive work in clearing amendments that could be accepted, in getting amendments withdrawn that really did not need to be offered. 
   We did it on both sides of the aisle. I went to Republicans and said: You do not want to do this here. And Senator DASCHLE did the same thing on the Democratic side of the aisle. That is how one works through the appropriations bills because many of these amendments had no business being offered at that hour on that bill and on those subjects with no consideration being given by the committees or by the chairmen. 
   If we can reinstate rule XVI today, we will see our appropriations bills able to go through without as much dilatory action or without as many amendments that really are strictly legislation on appropriations bills. I do believe that on both sides of the aisle Members know this precedent needs to be put back in place. 
   Will it cure all the problems? No. As a matter of fact, Senators may just use other dilatory tactics, and if they can find a way to do that or if they can appeal the ruling of the Chair, maybe the precedent will be reversed again. That will be the will of the body. I will have no great concern about that. Then we can move on from this to the next step. 
   Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD have proposed amendments that will go beyond what reinstating this particular rule XVI will do. 
   I hope we would take a look at that before this year is out. 
   So I may have to come back later on to respond in wrapup on some of these issues. But I do, again, refer you to the Shakespeare quote from Hamlet: I do think you ``protest too much'' as we work to reinstate a precedent that we all know will serve the institution quite well.

   Mr. LOTT. First of all, with regard to the partisanship, as a matter of fact, I  think I would have to disagree with the Senator from West Virginia. I have not been in the Senate nearly as long as he has, but I have been working with Congress for 30 years--30 years. I am 57. I came here when I was 26. I was a staff member for 4 years; 16 years in the House. I saw partisanship at its worst in the House when I was a Member and part of an oppressed minority in the House. 
   I have been in the Senate for going on 11 years. I really do not feel that much partisanship. I feel a real warmth toward a number of Democrats. And I thought it was just this year, just a short time ago, that we came through a historic impeachment trial in which we stood in these aisles--this center aisle here--together and said, this was a tough task; it was a constitutional requirement we had a duty to do. We performed our duty, and whether you agreed with the end result or not, most folks felt it was done fairly and not with shrill partisanship. 
   Even when we disagree on substantive issues, I think the Senate is almost the only place in this city where it does not get to be shrill partisanship. I see the distinguished ranking member from New York of the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is probably the most bipartisan, nonpartisan committee in the entire Congress. We do not always come out with a bipartisan bill, but usually we report a bill that has votes from both sides of the aisle. That was the case just last week on the tax bill; a couple Democrats voted with the Republicans. 
   I don't believe that is partisanship, No. 1. The reason I think it doesn't get that shrill is because we are sensitive to each other's needs to be heard, to our individual needs. We have tried to be a Senate that understands that Senators have families, and I think just that relationship helps because Members are not exhausted and mad at each other. I want to continue to further that. 
   In terms of giving the Democrats a chance, while there has been a lot of hollering about it, the fact is, you have been getting a pretty good chance. As a matter of fact, on the juvenile justice bill, I could have gone through all kinds of contortions and gyrations to try to block that, but I thought it was a bill that came out of the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis after 3 years of work, and we ought to take it up. 
   Did I like the way it went on a week more than I had been told it would take to get it done? No. As the Senator from West Virginia said, the Senate had to work its will, and there were more amendments cooking out there. I didn't run around out here trying to block them. Some of my colleagues said I should have done that. We worked our will. 
   We wrangled around on the Patients' Bill of Rights for almost a year. We could have done that bill last fall, but we couldn't come to agreement. We came to agreement. We took the bill up. We got it done. 
   Now, there were some speeches made the day before we completed that bill about how terrible the process was, but the night we got it done, Senators on both sides stood up and said: Well, I don't like all this and it wasn't perfect, but basically we got our fair shot, and we got our work done. 
   As far as giving people the chance, I have a list, two pages of bills that have been done this year that are not appropriations bills. We did the first concurrent budget resolution on time, only the second time in 25 years. We provided small business loan guarantees to small businesses that have year 2000 problems. We passed a national missile defense bill, which the President signed just the other day. And by the way, in his statement with his signing it, he misstated what the bill did. We passed a soldiers' and sailors' pay raise bill. We passed education flexibility. We had some Democrats who worked on that all the way. The President was saying all the way: I will veto it; I will veto it. Finally we got it done and he signed it. We passed the water resources bill. This is an area where we haven't passed an authorization bill, I think, in 5 years. We have passed it. The House has passed it, and after a lot of work, we actually got it into conference. Juvenile justice, we passed that through. The majority leader is trying to get to conference on that. We are going to have to have a bipartisan effort to get to conference. 
   Defense authorization; energy bill package; financial modernization, a bill that has been coming for 10 years-- people didn't think the Senate would have any chance to pass a financial modernization bill. We got it through the Senate. Hopefully, we will get it through. The list goes on in terms of Senators being able to have amendments on authorizations bills and getting important authorization bills through. 
   While the majority leader has to sometimes say we ought to be doing more, the fact of the matter is, we have been doing pretty good this year. I invite my colleagues and the public to take a look at this two-page list of bills. As a matter of fact, we have already passed eight appropriations bills. We are probably a week or maybe a bill or two behind where we ought to be on appropriations, but in recent history, that is pretty good progress. I would like to keep that going. 
   In terms of filling up the tree, again, I didn't invent this idea. In fact, I think I first saw it when Senator Mitchell used it. But Senator Dole used it on the 1985 budget resolution. Senator BYRD used it in 1977 on the energy deregulation bill. In fact, to study the brilliant use of the rules of the Senate, I have gone back and read and reread that particular bill and how Senator BYRD handled it. Of course, as I recall, I think Senator Baker was probably working with you on that issue, but I know it was tough. You had to have vote after vote after vote after vote to break basically an amendment filibuster.

   Mr. LOTT. The energy deregulation bill, of 1977, during the Carter years. As I recall Senator Metzenbaum and others were resisting in every way possible. Senator BYRD filled up the tree on the Grove City bill in 1984, and the campaign finance bill in 1988, Senator BYRD filled up the tree there--there were eight cloture votes on that particular bill--and then on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill in 1993. 
   Sometimes I thought it was a brilliant move. Sometimes I thought it was the right thing; sometimes I didn't. 
   But the Senator is right, the majority leader has a job to do. Sometimes it is not easy. Sometimes it is quite difficult. But I think it is important that he continues to try to encourage the Senate forward and do it in such a way that when he leaves at the close of business on Monday, the 26th, he will 
   be able to come back the 27th and work with every Senator the next day. 
   I wanted to respond on some of those comments.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to that, I think what is involved here is Democrats want to dictate the schedule around here. The Democrats want to dictate what the schedule is. When you say yes, juvenile justice and the Patients' Bill of Rights are examples of the way it can be done around here, it is because those were bills on which there was pressure to bring them up, not in the order that had been planned. But is the Senator saying, for instance, that the Democrats didn't also support or were not involved in these other bills that actually had bipartisan support, such as the national missile defense, which Senator INOUYE was a cosponsor of; the soldiers and sailors pay raise bill, which had bipartisan support; education flexibility, which had bipartisan support; water resources, which passed unanimously, and defense authorization? These are not bills that I bring up because they are bills Republicans want; these are bills that are in the interest of the country.

<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-23-19990726</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. That is partially because of the amount of time that has been taken up with other bills that were not scheduled. Bankruptcy, for instance, has been bumped several times because it took longer. The will of the Senate was to take longer in the debate of other bills. There is the case of the nuclear waste legislation, which the Senate passed a couple years ago. Now the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has come up with a bill that is very different. I think maybe it could have even broader support than the previous bill, which I think got about 63, 64, or 65 votes, or was going to have that many. 
   So the point is, the majority has to try to bring up bills in which there is broad interest and that have support--things such as the State Department and Defense Department authorizations. My goodness, if we don't authorize the legislation for the Department of Defense, we can't get the appropriations bill, or it causes all kinds of problems. A lot of what I bring up is dictated by, frankly, what the Constitution requires, or what has to be done to keep the Government operating in an appropriate way. 
   Here is a bill, the Workforce Incentives Improvement Act, which had problems when it came out of committee. They were worked on and this bill passed, I think, probably overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. It is one that was a high Democratic priority, but also had the support of the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member. The Y2K bill was a bill that had bipartisan support out of Judiciary and also out of a second committee, where you had Democrats involved in both instances. Yet it took us weeks to get that bill done. I think we had to go through three cloture votes to get that bill done, which the President signed into law. 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-24-19990726</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Because if you take 3 weeks on a bill like Y2K liability limits, which should have gone through here relatively quickly, that makes it more difficult to call up other bills that Senators would also like to consider. 
   I think maybe the Senator and I are involved in a discussion of scheduled events and rules which is important to us and important to the way the body works. I think the main thing we need to be saying to the American people is that we are going to work together to try to get our business done. By the way, the length of speech doesn't necessarily mean that the merit is all that great. 
   In terms of bipartisanship, I think I have proven several times, including  working with the administration in 1996 and 1997 to get Medicare reform, tax cuts for working Americans, budget restraint, welfare reform, illegal immigration reform, health care portability--we have worked in a lot of areas in a bipartisan way across the aisle and across the Capitol and with the administration. I would like for us to continue doing that. I am one of the few Members--to show just how nonpartisan or 
   bipartisan I am, I came to the city thinking I was a Democrat, but I was elected as a Republican. So I served on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, when the Senator was talking about the rights of the minority, I thought it was I speaking. I remembered my saying the same thing. In fact, I was sitting right over there. I think there were only three desks there. I remember pleading with Senator Mitchell, who was standing right there, the majority leader. I believed I was being oppressed and that the minority rights were not being honored. 
   I remember also sitting right over there pleading with the Senator from Texas, who was chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bentsen, to offer an amendment. As I recall, it had something to do with university loans or scholarships. I remember being prohibited from offering that amendment. 
   I know when you are in the minority you are not always happy with the way you are treated. But I think we need to work together to try to not have that be the all-consuming viewpoint around here, and I don't think it has. 
   I remember how rough it was being in the minority. I was there for 21 years. I didn't like it at all. I like the majority much better. But I think you have to try to be reasonable on both sides of the aisle. That is why I have been a little bit shocked today by the tone of the debate which I was watching. Although I was not participating in it, I thought I had to come out here and, in effect, explain what happened--explain what this really means, and a little bit to defend my honor. 
   But I appreciate what the Senator has said. I know he has been helpful since I have been the majority leader. I am sure he will help us try to get our work done in the future as he has done in the past. 
   If I could, let me ask unanimous consent.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize one of the finest officers in the United States Air Force, Major General Paul V. Hester. On July 30th, General Hester will leave his current job as Director of the Air Force Office of Legislative Liaison to take over the important posts of Commander, United States Forces, Japan; Commander, 5th Air Force; and Commander, United States Air Forces, Japan. During his time here in Washington--particularly with regard to his work on Capitol Hill--General Hester personified the Air Force core values of integrity, selfless service and excellence in all things. Many Senators and Staff enjoyed the opportunity to interact with him on a variety of important issues and came to appreciate his many talents. Today it is my privilege to recognize some of Paul's many accomplishments since he entered the military 27 years ago, and to commend the superb service he provided the Air Force, the Congress and our Nation. 
   Paul Hester entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officer Training Corps from my alma mater, the University of Mississippi. While at ``Ole Miss'', he completed both bachelor's and master's degrees in Business Administration. He earned his pilot wings in December of 1971 at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi and was then assigned to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, where he flew the A-7D Corsair. A short time later, he was deployed to Southeast Asia where he distinguished himself flying combat missions and earned five Air Medals for outstanding airmanship and courage. Over his career, General Hester demonstrated his skill in other fighter aircraft, including the F-4, F-15 and F-16, and logged more than 2,600 hours of flying time. 
   General Hester's exceptional leadership skills were always evident to his superiors and he repeatedly proved himself in numerous select command positions. While stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, he served as the commander of the 94th Fighter Squadron, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker's famed ``Hat in the Ring Gang.'' He was also the first Commander of the 18th Operations Group, Kadena Air Base, Japan; Commander of the 35th Fighter Wing at Misawa Air Base, Japan, and prior to his assignment here in Washington, Commander of the 53rd Wing, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. At each and every one of these important posts, Paul Hester inspired the airmen under his command to achieve their best, and ensured our forces were sharpened and ready to undertake our warfighting commitments. 
   Paul Hester also excelled in a variety of key staff billets. He served in the Air Force Directorate of Plans at the Pentagon, and he was a member of the Commanders' Action Group, Headquarters Tactical Air Command, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. He experienced joint duty as both the J-5 Division Chief to the Joint Staff and as the Joint Chiefs of Staff representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Vienna, Austria. As a Lieutenant Colonel, he was selected as the Chief of the Air Force's Legislative Liaison Office to the U.S. House of Representatives. His performance in that important position is the reason he was brought back as a Major General to lead the entire legislative directorate for the Secretary of the Air Force. 
   During his service to the 105th and 106th Congresses, General Hester has been the liaison to the Air Force on a variety of readiness issues and most recently, ALLIED FORCE operations in Kosovo. His clear, concise, and timely information was instrumental in supporting our deliberations of National Security matters. He was a crucial voice for the Air Force in representing its many programs on the Hill. General Hester's leadership, professional abilities and expertise enabled him to foster excellent working relationships that benefitted both the Air Force and the Senate. Throughout the time I have known Paul, I have been impressed with his skill in working with the Congress to address Air Force priorities. 
   We were all pleased to see that Paul was recently nominated by the President for his third star, which will be pinned on by the Air Force Chief of Staff this Friday. I offer my congratulations to him, to his wife Lynda, and three children Leslie, Doug and Shelby. The Congress and the country applaud the selfless commitment his family has made to the Nation in supporting his military career. 
   I know I speak for all my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt appreciation to General Hester. He is a credit to both the Air Force and our great Nation. We wish our friend the best of luck and are confident of his continued success in his new command.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal action brought by the State of New Mexico against a resident of Bernalillo County. The State charges that, during an attempt by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department and juvenile probation office to execute a bench warrant for the arrest of a juvenile, as part of a law enforcement program called ``Operation Night Light,'' the defendant created a public disturbance and obstructed the Sheriff's deputies. 
   An employee on Senator BINGAMAN's staff, Kristen Ludecke, was accompanying the Senator the night of this incident on a ride-along with the Sheriff's Department to observe the Operation Night Light program. The Sheriff's Department is requesting that Ms. Ludecke testify at the hearing in this case, scheduled for August 2, about what she observed during the ride-along. 
   This resolution would accordingly authorize Ms. Ludecke to testify in this matter.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in order to explain what is not happening now, I will use some leader time to advise Senators what our hopes are and why we are having a quorum at this time. 
   First of all, we are respecting the request of the Democratic leader to not go forward to the conclusion of the statements and any action or votes on the pending resolution so they can have a conference to discuss how to proceed. 
   What is involved here is my continuing effort to have the Senate correct a mistake that was made a few years ago with regard to rule XVI. Rule XVI prohibited legislation on an appropriations bill. A precedent was set, and I confess I helped set that precedent. I mistakenly voted to overrule the ruling of the Chair, and so did others, because we were so committed to the issue. It has certainly been a problem for the Senate ever since. 
   Both sides of the aisle use appropriations bills for every legislative amendment or bill that they might be sponsoring or something they may be harboring to get a vote on. It has really gotten to be a problem in moving appropriations bills forward. The right thing to do for the institution, the right thing to do in terms of legislative sanity, and the right thing to do for the people of this country is to have that precedent established again which would say that Senators cannot offer legislation on appropriations bills without a point of order being in order. Keep in mind, if you get 51 votes, that could be overturned, but I think it will add additional pressure on Senators not to abuse that process. 
   The matter pending is the Commerce, State and Justice appropriations bill, a very important bill. It provides the 
   funds, obviously, for the Departments of Commerce, State, and Justice. A major portion of law enforcement money is in this appropriations bill. We need to move it forward. 
   The Senate does not always move with dispatch, but sometimes we do. On an appropriations bill, obviously, involving billions of dollars, Senators want to have a chance to review it carefully and amendments will be in order. Amendments would be in order after the vote that we are about to have or could have reestablishing rule XVI. Senators could offer amendments that relate to the bill, that take money out or put money in, or strike out sections. All of that would still be in order. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I have basically agreed--in fact, we have exchanged pleasantries on this rule XVI issue several times over the past few years--that this is a precedent we need to go back and correct. We had a colloquy a month or so ago in which we said, yes, this needs to be done, and we need to work together to get it done. 
   There is concern that the way this was done, the minority had not been given notice. But earlier this summer, the minority was aware we were going to try to reverse this precedent, and 2 or 3 days were spent trying to block us from getting an opportunity. 
   I don't necessarily feel we have to do it this way or do it on this bill or do it right now, but my question is, if not now, when? If not in this way, in what way?

   Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield, when I complete the point. I am willing to work with both sides to try to find a way we can get this done. If there are suggestions by the Senator from South Carolina or the leader, I certainly am very interested in that. 
   I am not interested in any kind of a surprise action, but I am interested in trying to get some results on this which would help Senators on both sides of the aisle get the appropriations bills done. That is my only intent. 
   I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.

   Mr. LOTT. If I could reclaim my time, I don't know exactly what was said between the two Members, but I know there is no desire on either side to mislead. I want to make it clear that I have suggested to the chairmen of our subcommittees that we need to find a time and have a way to address this rule XVI issue. It is in the interest of the Senate. It is in the interest of both parties. But I am told that you have to get a time agreement to set up this process. 
   If we don't do it here, then, unless we get cooperation on both sides, we may never get an opportunity to reinstate rule XVI. I will bet the Senator from South Carolina would like to see us do that. I will bet he would like to have the appropriations bills be appropriations bills. If we are going to do all of our legislating on appropriations bills, let's just get rid of the legislative committees. Let's just all get on appropriations. I would like to be on the Senator's committee. He is on Commerce, and I would enjoy serving there. I would like to be on the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill. That would work nicely. 
   I don't think we need to do that, though. We don't want to do it. 
   I want to make it clear, my instructions to our chairmen have been: Find a way, find a time for us to get this rule XVI reconsidered and corrected. A mistake was made. 
   I say to the Senator from South Dakota, who is here now, the distinguished Democratic leader, I am using leader time. I was trying to explain why we haven't been having votes, what is going on. I was reviewing the bidding of why we need to make this change, and I had not attributed any quotes or impugned anybody's integrity in their absence. I was trying to get this process going forward. 
   That is what is involved. I have been trying to find a way to get this done. I believe the Democratic leader wants to join me in getting this done. We have talked about it privately and publicly. If this is not the time, this is not the way to do it, then I am open to other times or other ways to do it. 
   But this needs to be done so we can get our  work done and not have everything in the world offered to every appropriations bill, whether it is Commerce, Transportation, Interior, or Defense. It is not something that is abused just on the Democratic side. As long as this mistake is not corrected, Senators will come in, as they are entitled to, from both sides and offer amendments involving who knows what on transportation--it could be an energy issue on transportation or on energy it could be a defense issue. We need to correct that. 
   So that is my intent, my goal. And where we have other issues, I know my colleagues on both sides are interested in other issues. I want to say publicly what I said to Senator DASCHLE last night. I am going through the process to appoint conferees to juvenile justice. I am going to ask consent. If it is objected to, I will file cloture today, and we will come back and vote Monday on that issue. 
   With regard to an amendment--or amendments, I think--with regard to agriculture and the pending problems across the Nation for our farmers, we need to address that. I will work with all Senators to find a way to do that. I think we ought to do it on the agriculture bill. I don't think we ought to do it on Commerce-State-Justice. It will mess up the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. It will delay it. Let's do it on agriculture. 
   I am willing to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to call up the agriculture appropriations bill and have this issue addressed. If there is a problem with it procedurally, we will work to overcome that. I don't think we ought to duck that issue; it is too important. It is important to South Dakota, it is important to Mississippi, and to people all over America. 
   I am not interested at all in trying to duck issues. I think we ought to do them in the proper way. I have made those commitments to Senator DASCHLE, and I plan to keep them. It will take cooperation on both sides because we never know, as leaders, when one of our worthy Members will come swooping in with an objection. We had a unanimous consent agreement locked up and ready to sign off; in fact, it was done actually on the campaign finance issue. A Senator had not had a chance to look at it and he objected. That is his right. Basically, we had it all done. 
   So we have to work with Senators on both sides who have particular problems. If we have one Senator who objects that we had not anticipated, that presents a problem. If we work together, we can get it done. That is what I am trying to do. I would like to get the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill done. The chairman and ranking member overcame a lot of things and got agreements on a lot of problems in that bill. But their problem is all the extraneous, nongermane legislative stuff we are going to see drift in here to be thrown up on their bill. Every appropriations bill has somewhere between 40 and 100 amendments, and half of them are legislating on an appropriations bill. Let's correct this problem. 
   Senator DASCHLE has been kind enough to wait while I went through those things. I think it answers some of the questions he and his Members have. I thought it would be better to go ahead and address them. 
   Mr. President, parliamentarily, how can we proceed at this time? I have a limit on my leader time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Or, Mr. President, I will reclaim any leader time I might have so that I can respond and pick up on what the Senator said. 
   We are somewhat on the horns of a dilemma. If we take extended time to  debate those issues, then it further delays our ability to get appropriations bills done. Conversely, if we don't do it soon, all of the appropriations bills will hopefully be done, and we still will not have addressed this issue. 
   So I would like to pick up on what Senator DASCHLE said. 
   The suggestion was made that we not do this here but that we do it early next week. 
   I would like to discuss the possibility of having this debate on Monday or Tuesday morning and having a vote on this issue. 
   Is that something that would be acceptable to the Senator from South Dakota?

   Mr. LOTT. If I could respond to that and make an observation, if we don't do it Monday or Tuesday, we will be under the rule that we passed for the budget reconciliation provisions. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will be on the reconciliation-tax cut bill. If we don't do it Monday or Tuesday, then it is not done next week. 
   We agreed that we wanted to get this done, but we have not had the time to get together and decide how we were going to get it done. 
   So I am in the position that if I give the Democratic leader notice that we want to get this done, he blocks it, or if we set it up to get it done without advance notice, the Democratic leader says, well, that is not fair. 
   We need to get it done. Everybody knows we need to get it done. 
   I would propose publicly that we do this Monday and vote Tuesday, and I will work with the Democratic leader on the specifics of getting that done early next week so that we will not go through this on the agriculture bill, on the transportation bill, on the Interior bill, on the HUD, and the Veterans Administration bill, and bill after bill. 
   I think that would be timely. I would be willing to go 
   forward with the CJS without forcing the vote on overruling the Chair at this point but with the understanding that we are going to find the time so we can get this done. 
   Can I get that commitment from the Democratic leader?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't think we need 6 hours, 3 hours equally divided on each side, to discuss this. 
   What that guarantees is that we wipe out another day next week and we further delay doing the people's business on the appropriations bills. 
   But if that is what is insisted on, if this is an effort--again, that appears to me to be eating up time so we don't get our work done, but if that is what it takes, I am prepared to consider that. 
   Let me go back to a couple of things. 
   No. 1, every Senator in this body knows I am very meticulous about trying to be sympathetic to Senators' needs when they have family problems or deaths or religious holidays. Nobody can take that away from me. I would never do anything to take away any Senator's rights while he is attending to a very sad, personal family problem. 
   Having said that, I don't view this as having taken something away from Senator KENNEDY or anybody else. I think this is giving something back to the Senate, and that is the ability to get our work done. 
   But if that is what is taking place here, if you believe you don't want to do this while he is involved obviously in a very necessary family responsibility, I will honor that. 
   Also, I must say everybody in this Chamber knows I work very hard to keep my word. It is used against me sometimes on both sides. I try to get Senators to vote on Mondays and Fridays. You wouldn't believe the effort that is put underway by Senators on both sides for that not to happen. 
   If we don't get our work done, you are going to say, well, why didn't we get our work done? While I am trying to get the work done, sometimes with the Democratic leader's help, Senators try to find a way not to vote on Mondays and Fridays. 
   I don't know how in the world you get your work done if you do not do anything on Mondays and Fridays, and you have people show up and say: Gosh, I want to vote in the middle of the day Wednesday. How do you get this thing done? 
   In terms of keeping my word and how it has been used against me, for instance, being able to offer amendments, I said, yes, we will go to juvenile justice. And I said we are doing it on a particular date with the clear impression that we would get it done 
   within that week in 4 days. It took 2 weeks. After a lot of going back and forth, we worked out an agreement on Patients' Bill of Rights, but we kept our word. We got it done. We had the debate, and it worked out fine, I thought. 
   But those 2 weeks took away 2 weeks that should have been spent on appropriations bills. But I kept my word. I really believe my word was used against me. 
   I have to try to force action on these things because we agreed we were going to deal with rule XVI. We have to find time to do that. 
   We agreed we would work out something where we would have a Social Security lockbox. We haven't done it. We have to find a way to do that. The American people want a Social Security lockbox. Everybody agreed that we need it. Let's get it done. I don't think we need to do it with 75 amendments in 45 hours. It is a little procedural fix that we can agree on with regard to Social Security being protected. 
   I filed cloture on those bills because every bill which we ought to bring up, somebody is threatening to filibuster it. Sometimes it is on our side. Sometimes it is on the other side. 
   Intelligence authorization: We wanted to try to get that up, and get the Department of Energy issue considered. We had a heck of a time getting it up to get it completed. Yet when we got through it, it passed 96-1. 
   Transportation appropriations bill: I want to get the transportation bill up. I am told in advance now that we are going to filibuster that. 
   What option do you have but to file cloture? 
   They don't want to bring it up because there is a provision in there that a couple or half dozen Senators do not like, or four Senators. 
   Let's get it up. Let's debate it. Let's have a vote on it and then move forward. 
   In fact, then, at that point, if Senators do not like the result, they have the option to filibuster. But when I am told if you try to bring up the transportation appropriations bill we are going to filibuster the motion to proceed, what option do you have? 
   There are explanations for these things. 
   I am interested in legislating. But I also have responsibilities as majority  leader to legislate on issues the majority is interested in. I also have a responsibility--I think both leaders have a responsibility, all leaders--to get our work done. 
   Included right up front on that list of getting our work done is passing the appropriations bills. 
   I am doing my job. Most of these appropriations bills I don't particularly like, to tell you the truth. 
   It doesn't necessarily make me feel real good to be worrying about all the appropriations bills, but it is part of the job, part of the process. 
   There is not a single bill that comes through here where a single Senator likes everything in it, but we move the process along. I can think of a whole bunch of things in State, Justice, and Commerce I would like to knock out, and a lot of things I would like to add, but I will not do that because the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina put their work in there, it was passed by the committee, probably unanimously, and we ought to move it forward. 
   I will be glad to work with the Senator to try to lock in a time next week to get this issue debated. I am glad to debate it. I don't know how many times we will hear: You Republicans caused this problem. I am saying: All right, OK, we acknowledge it. Let's fix it. 
   I bet when the vote comes, it will be overwhelming. Both sides know this needs to be corrected. Let's get on with it. I don't know what the final vote will be, but I will be surprised if it is not 80-20. It will probably be more than that, 90-10. Why not do it? It is the right thing to do. It is good for the institution. 
   I thank Members for their patience while I responded. If we are ready, we can go forward and set up a time to have this issue debated and voted on. Hopefully, it will be within a reasonable timeframe.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, briefly, I note that in the presence of the President I was led to believe that, on the Social Security issue, two or three amendments would be enough on the lockbox. Then I am told later, well, we need 12 or 15. That is what I have to deal with all the time. 
   We can go back and forth as to what happened. We need a Social Security lockbox. We need to find a way to do it. The Senate is the only impediment to having that done. 
   What I propose to do with regard to rule XVI is ask consent --I am not doing it now--that when the Senate convenes on Monday, the 26th, we proceed to the original resolution to be placed on the calendar by the majority leader, immediately following the asserting of this agreement, and the resolution be considered under the following time constraints--this is the resolution; obviously, it is very short and very simple--that the resolution be limited to 3 hours for each leader or his designee, no amendments or resolutions be in order, and final adoption be in order prior to recess or adjournment of the Senate on Monday. We could have that vote at the same time we have the vote on the juvenile justice conferees cloture, if necessary. 
   I ask the Democratic leader to consider that. If the Senator can check to see when Senator KENNEDY will be back--I talked to him myself early this week, and I had the impression he would be back early next week, but I didn't press him in terms of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever. 
   That is, I think, a fair way to do this. That is how it was outlined to me. I think we ought to do it. Hopefully, we can make some progress now on the underlying commerce bill.

   Members to have a debate on that and a vote. If rule XVI is put back into place, of course, legislation on appropriations bills will be limited, unless there is a rule by the Chair and it gets 51 votes. 
   We also have to debate and vote on the question of scope issues coming back out of conference. 
   When we do bring up agriculture appropriations before the August recess, there will be one amendment relating to disaster relief by Senator DASCHLE or his designee, and we will have an opportunity to have our amendment on the same subject. It will not relate to dairy, I make that clear.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to tonight, we need to just keep going forward. Senator REID, as usual, is doing good work. The managers, Senator JUDD GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, have been working. I think if we will be serious--and I don't think a lot of Senators are on either side--in trying to get this completed, we still have a raft of amendments that either need to be accepted or withdrawn. 
   I tried to see if we could do the work in the daylight, and I tried to see if we could do it on Mondays or Fridays. None of that seems to suit the Senate. I think we ought to keep going as late as it takes to finish this legislation. That way, we can get it completed. So it is at your pleasure. I live on Capitol Hill, so I will be at home watching you all on TV and wishing you the best. When the votes are ready, I will come back and vote. It is up to the Senators. Do we get rid of this long list of amendments that Senator REID and Senator GREGG have been working on and keep going on into the night, or we can come in tomorrow. I am flexible either way. We have to get this bill done. I think we ought to keep going. 
   I hope Senators will get serious about getting rid of some of these amendments. There is no reason we shouldn't have another vote or two and final passage. I hope we can get that done. This is not aimed at one side or the other. It is on both sides. Let's get serious and complete this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to address the need for prompt action on S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. Senator ABRAHAM has crafted a solid legislative measure that will promote continued growth in electronic commerce. 
   The Millennium Digital Commerce Act has 11 cosponsors including Senators WYDEN, TORRICELLI, MCCAIN, BURNS, FRIST, GORTON, BROWNBACK, ALLARD, GRAMS, HAGEL, and myself. 
   Mr. President, on June 23, almost one month ago, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved and ordered S. 761 reported with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. This substitute is widely supported by the States, industry, and the administration. In fact, on June 22, the day before the mark-up, the Commerce Department issued a formal letter of support for this bipartisan measure.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act provides a baseline national framework for conducting online business to business transactions. It is vital to interstate electronic commerce because it would provide legal standing for electronic signatures on contracts and other business transactions. 
   This common sense and timely legislation will help promote continued growth in electronic commerce. It is good for business, consumers, and the overall American economy. 
   While more than forty States have laws on the books concerning the use of authentication technology such as electronic signatures, the States have not yet chosen to adopt the same approach. This hodgepodge of State laws will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on e-commerce. 
   This Congress cannot and should not sit by and wait until the States coordinate this milieu of laws on electronic signatures. This delay would unnecessarily restrain the growth of our Nation's economic well-being.  
   The Millennium Digital Commerce Act is an interim step that will help facilitate interstate and international commerce. It is a necessary precursor to state-by-state adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). 
   Mr. President, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle strongly agree that it is now time to move S..761 to the floor. 
   It has broad support and I hope we can work together to move this bipartisan pro-technology, pro-electronic commerce legislation forward as soon as possible.

We had intended to vote at 12; then we were told 12:30, 12:40, 1:15, and now it is 1:20.

   Mr. LOTT. I reserve the right to object--and I will object. 
   First of all, this is the kind of motion that usually the majority leader would make, and it is my intent to do that in the near future. I think we should go to conference on this issue. The juvenile justice bill came from the Judiciary Committee. The committee had been working on it, I think, for 3 years. Senators on both sides of the aisle worked on that bill. It included a variety of Senators, including, obviously, Senator LEAHY, Senator HATCH, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SESSIONS, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator THOMPSON, and a whole number of Senators over a period of years. 
   It does have very important provisions in regard to how do you deal with juvenile crime, how do you try offenders, and where do you incarcerate them. It deals with the real world problems of trying to deal with juvenile crime, including security in our schools. Specifically, it provides for metal detectors at our schools. It has programs that deal with alcohol abuse, drug abuse. It has some very important  amendments dealing with values in society and how we can help in that area with our young people. 
   So I think this is legislation that should go to conference. It is my intent to move to go to conference and to appoint conferees. However, there have been some Senators who had some concerns about it both in terms of the makeup of who the conferees would be, but also I think it would be fair to say that Senator SMITH of New Hampshire has indicated that he would be opposed to going to conference at this time. I have been working with him to see how that procedure could be worked out. 
   I know most Senators don't get into some of the esoteric rules around here, but believe me, we need to try to find a way to work it out where we can get to conference. I am trying to do that. At an appropriate time, within the next 2 weeks, I will do so--if not this week, next week. The only reason I didn't do it this week is because of interminable delays by the Senate on other issues. 
   We had the whole of last week tied up with the Patients' Bill of Rights. We didn't want to interrupt the Patients' Bill of Rights for a 3- or 4-hour process to appoint conferees. And then this week we have been dragging all day and yesterday on a question we should have done like that--reorganization of the Department of Energy. Hearings have been held on it. We had a good proposal. Instead, we have been talking and chatting here all day. Now it is 6 o'clock and we still have not gotten it done, the intelligence authorization bill, an authorization for intelligence, the CIA. Give me a break. 
   If the Senate would like for us to act on some of these issues, then the Senate needs to find a way to quit delaying and dragging out other issues. We have appropriations bills to do. We need to get going on them. 
   The main thing I want to assure the Senate is, I think we should go to conference. I intend for us to go to conference. If Senators on both sides will work with me and support my effort to do that, I think we will get an overwhelming vote to do that. But as is the case with Senators on both sides of the aisle, when a Senator or Senators have problems, my disposition is to try to see if we can work it out in a way that is acceptable to him or her. That is my intent. 
   Mr. President, I make that explanation as to what is happening. We do intend to go to conference. With the cooperation of both sides of the aisle, I am sure we will go to conference. 
   I do object.

   Mr. LOTT. Today the Senate will resume debate on the motion to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill with the cloture vote occurring at 10:30 a.m. Following the vote, Senator SMITH of New Hampshire will be recognized to make a motion to discharge from the Finance Committee S.J. Res. 28 regarding the trade status with Vietnam. Therefore, Senators can expect an additional vote prior to the weekly party caucus meetings. The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 so that the party conferences can meet and have lunch. Senator SMITH will again be recognized under a privileged resolution at 2:15 to offer a second motion to discharge from the Finance Committee S.J. Res. 27 regarding trade status with China. There will be 1 hour of debate on the motion with the vote occurring at approximately 3:15 p.m. Senators may also expect further action on the intelligence authorization bill or any appropriations bills on the calendar during today's session.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am delighted to engage in a colloquy now that will involve a number of other Senators but particularly Senator LANDRIEU of Louisiana. I hesitate to even begin until she is present on the floor, but I presume she will be here momentarily. 
   In her absence, I will praise her for her work on this particular legislation, S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. Her persistence, her willingness to work with all parties involved--I don't mean political parties; I mean those who are interested in this  type legislation--has made it possible for us to have this bill put together and have it before the Energy Committee and have not only the cosponsorship of her colleague from Louisiana but also of the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator MURKOWSKI. It has a broad spectrum of support, and I think a lot of the credit goes to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU. 
   I must say, it is a delicately balanced piece of legislation. If amendments start being added or changes start developing, then it could get out of control. And even though I am a cosponsor, I would have problems with that, even though clearly every piece of legislation can be improved as it goes forward. 
   I bring to the attention of my colleagues S. 25. The American public has an exciting opportunity for this Congress to enact landmark legislation that will make a long-term commitment to natural conservation initiatives. We have the opportunity to begin the next century with the same major commitment to conservation that the Nation had at the beginning of the century under the visionary leadership of President Teddy Roosevelt. I believe this legislation will serve our Nation well for generations to come. I intend to be involved in its process through the committee and, hopefully, we will be able to bring it up for consideration in the full Senate before the year is out. 
   This legislation would dedicate a portion of the annual reserves received from the production of Federal oil and gas revenues on the Outer Continental Shelf to a variety of initiatives that will conserve and enhance our Nation's sustaining and renewable resources. I am pleased to be a sponsor, joining a broad spectrum of my colleagues. The legislation, which is modeled after the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, will reinvest 50 percent of the revenues from the Federal OCS oil and gas production annually in coastal impact assistance and coastal conservation, in funding national, State, and local parks and recreation opportunities, and in conserving our Nation's wildlife resources before those wildlife fall into threatened or endangered status under the Endangered Species Act. 
   It does have the support of various groups. I have felt for years that those of us who live along the coasts and who take whatever risks are associated with offshore oil and gas exploration should get some benefit from that activity and from the risks associated and that we should have the funds that are necessary to deal with such things as beach erosion, to preserve some of our delicate estuaries along the coastal areas. We have not been getting our fair share. 
   So for the first time, I think this bill would move us in that direction. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives, H.R. 701, introduced by Congressman DON YOUNG, chairman of the House Resources Committee, with the cosponsorship of Congressman DINGELL and Congressman TAUZIN and others. I believe they have some 80 cosponsors. 
   This important legislation will affect not just my State or not just the coastal regions but the whole Nation. We are facing a continuing shortage of funds in wildlife conservation initiatives, for State and local parks and recreation initiatives, for conservation initiatives with respect to the peculiar problems that confront our coastal regions, but also there are great concerns in the West and the areas that are a long way from the coast. 
   Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, one-half of the revenue from Federal mineral resources that are developed in a State are shared with that State by the Federal Government. Unfortunately, a similar provision does not exist with regard to Federal oil and gas resources that are produced off the coast of a State, even though the adjacent coastal area could suffer impacts from that activity. Not until 1986 did the Federal Government share any of the Federal OCS oil and gas revenues with the coastal States, and then only a small portion of that revenue from those offshore activities occurring in the first 3 miles of the OCS. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 will correct this inequity while also reinvesting a portion of the funds in conservation initiatives in all 50 States. 
   The concept of reinvesting a portion of the revenue from the Nation's nonrenewable resources in renewable resources of the Nation has attracted the support of Governors, mayors, county governments, conservation groups, sports groups, and others around the Nation. The congressional hearings have created a record of great and broad support. 
   Some of the highlights of that testimony include Mr. Hurley Coleman, director of Wayne County, MI, Division of Parks. He testified:  
   You have the chance right now to take the place of the visionaries of the past and support a process that will provide for development, renovation and enhancement of critical recreation resources in important living spaces throughout the country.  
   He went on to say this was a moment of destiny. Obviously, he was very supportive of the bill. 
   Mr. Mark Van Putten, President and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, testified that it presented an ``historic opportunity to enact permanent and meaningful conservation funding that would benefit wildlife, wild places, and generations of Americans to come.'' 
   We had support from the commissioner of Santa Fe County in New Mexico on behalf of the National Association of Counties who endorsed the principles of this act that would reallocate Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas revenues to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a coastal State revenue sharing program, and add funding to the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program and establish an innovative procedure for adding funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program. 
   That is a very important thing. In my State, and a lot of States where the Federal Government owns a large amount of land--in my State, timberlands--and because, in my opinion, of bad national forest policies, those funds have been reduced. We are not cutting the trees that need to be cut. We had a disaster last year; a hurricane went through that affected two or three States. And because of resistance from certain environmental groups, the downed timber could not be removed. Now it is basically useless. Who benefits from that? Nobody. The timber that was downed wasn't used for the benefit of the lumber-timber industry. And by allowing it to just lay there on the ground and die raises the prospect of insects that would then infest other trees. It makes no sense whatsoever. So the idea that we would get some more money for the payments in lieu of taxes is very attractive to me. 
   Governor Tom Carper of Delaware, on behalf of the National Governors' Association, testified in support of this legislation. Governor Christine Todd-Whitman of New Jersey also supported it. Mayor Victor Ashe, the mayor of Knoxville, came and testified about how helpful this legislation could be. 
   I know there are some concerns about how this money will be used. There has been some concerns expressed by the Farm Bureau and by the Loggers Association. These are two groups that are very important in this country and in my State in particular. I listened to them. 
   If they have concerns about how these funds would be used in connection with land use, I would want to hear them out and make sure there is not a problem technically with the bill or make sure this bill does not further discourage and dissipate our resources from farming and from timber in this country. I also don't want this to become an opportunity for public land use groups to try to grab more land. 
   While there are some public lands we want to have access to, we want to preserve, that is fine. But I think this administration, in particular, has been exceeding what the law allows and is still trying to tie up more Federal lands when, in fact, we are providing proper stewardship of the lands we already have. One example is the Park Service. Many of our national parks are deteriorating. Bridges are not passable, monuments eroding. Yet the Park Service seems to be more interested in adding more land to the parks before we take care of what we already have. 
   This bill may help deal with that problem because it would make these funds more equitably available to go for not only coastal preservation but also could go to the national and State parks.  
   I think we have a good idea here. It is one of those conservation bills that I think could be of benefit to everybody in this country, all States, and particularly my own State of Mississippi. I don't generally go on bills of this nature because I am very leery that these conservation efforts sometimes become--let's see, what is the word I am looking for--``confiscation'' efforts rather than conservation. I don't believe that is what this bill does. This could lead us to some real good policies that could bring together divergent groups in a way that we have not had the opportunity in the past. 
   I am pleased to be here and point out to my colleagues this legislation, S. 25. I encourage them to take a look at it. I thank the chairman of the committee for his good work, and I look forward to working with Chairman MURKOWSKI as we move forward on this very important Conservation and Reinvestment Act. 
   I yield the floor.

But as the Senator indicated, that is over 2 months away  and changes might be necessary.

   First of all, in view of the request that was made and the potential objection that I assume there will not be, I will withdraw that unanimous consent request at this time and then I will propound this request. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to H.R. 1555. 
   I further ask consent that following the offering of the amendment by Senator KYL as provided for in the consent agreement on May 27, there be up to nine relevant second-degree amendments in order for each leader, or their designees, and an additional amendment to be offered by the managers to include agreed-upon amendments. 
   I further ask consent that the listed first-degree amendments noted below also be relevant and subject to relevant second-degree amendments: Senator TORRICELLI, with regard to funding disclosure; Senator MOYNIHAN, regarding declassification; Senator GRAHAM of Florida, relevant amendment; Senator FEINSTEIN, regarding the drug czar; Senator SMITH of New Hampshire regarding intelligence listing; again, Senator SMITH of New Hampshire, regarding intelligence declassification. 
   I further ask consent that following the disposition of the amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate, and no motions to commit or recommit be in order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I honor a Mississippian who made numerous contributions to Alcorn State University, to countless young student athletes and to the community. Coach Davey L. Whitney, Head Coach of the Men's Basketball team at Alcorn State University, has served as a leader at this educational institution, a professor of championship athletics and a mentor for many of his players. 
   Nearly 30 years ago, Coach Whitney first arrived on the Lorman, Mississippi, campus. From the beginning, Davey's tenure at Alcorn was destined for greatness. Within ten years, the Alcorn State Men's Basketball team went from little notoriety to groundbreaking achievement. His list of accomplishments is exemplary. His determination is heroic. 
   He was the first coach to lead an historically black college team to wins in both NCAA and NIT tournaments. His teams also won nine Southwestern Athletic Conference titles. In 1979, Alcorn accomplished something that no previous historically black college had done--winning a National Invitational Tournament game--when they defeated Mississippi State University. 
   Coach Whitney has been a mentor to many young men. Many of his players have become successful businessmen. Several of his players even had successful professional athletic careers in the National Basketball Association. Larry Smith, who was drafted by the Golden State Warriors, is now an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets. He is reproducing Coach Whitney's approach of discipline coupled with a warm personal devotion for the players. 
   Coach Whitney's career has not been one without trials. In 1989 he was fired after losing three successive seasons. Still Coach Whitney stayed involved in basketball by coaching in the Continental Basketball Association and the United States Basketball League. 
   Coach Whitney also remained close to Alcorn State for the next eight years, while the Braves struggled and in 1997 Alcorn asked him to return. After much thought, Coach Whitney returned to the Alcorn State University Family as head coach. Within two years, he took the struggling Braves to the 1999 Southwestern Athletic Conference Regular Season Championship where they not only won, they triumphed. This tournament championship earned the Braves a berth in the NCAA Tournament. This marked the first time since the 1986 season that the Braves have won the Southwestern Athletic Conference regular season title. This was also the first time since 1984 that the Braves have won the tournament title and appeared in the NCAA tournament. 
   Coach Whitney's 442 wins in 28 years--with 10 regular season titles, four consecutive titles between 1978-82, twelve post season tourneys and five NAIA district titles--earned him nine Southwestern Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors. It is a fitting tribute to Coach Whitney's accomplishments that he coaches in the complex named after him. Various groups have recognized Coach Whitney for his renowned success. USA Today's Reporter Jack Carey wrote, ``At Alcorn State Coach Davey Whitney is proving not only that you can go home again, but you also can be darned successful once you get there.'' Whitney is surely a man worthy of recognition. 
   Coach Whitney is not only a successful coach but an accomplished family man. He and his wife of more than 40 years have reared a fine family of four daughters and one son, all of whom attended Alcorn State University. He is a member of the National Association of Coaches, the Mississippi Association of Coaches, the National Black Association of Coaches, and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., just to name a few. 
   Mr. President, it is a great honor to pay tribute to Coach Davey L. Whitney for his athletic accomplishments and his dedication to the students of Alcorn State University. His efforts are both uplifting and encouraging. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Davey Whitney many more years of success.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need for leader time. I know Members expect to vote at 10:30. I will try to be brief. 
   I am compelled to make a couple of points. First of all, our Republican budget plan reduced the national debt by $1.9 trillion. That is the most significant and the only real contribution of reducing the debt in our lifetime. The point I want to make is, the American people overwhelmingly support the idea of the Social Security lockbox. 
   After resistance, the President even adopted that exact word, that he supported a Social Security lockbox. I don't know what the numbers are but in the high seventies, 80 percent of the American people think this is something we should do: Take all of the Social Security taxes, the FICA tax, and set them aside for what they were intended--Social Security, and only Social Security, a lockbox. 
   OK, so we advocated that--Senators DOMENICI, ABRAHAM, SANTORUM, and others. And finally the President apparently checked the polls and said: Oh, yeah, me, too; I want a lockbox. 
   Then the House voted for a lockbox--not as tight as this one, not as good as this one--with a vote of 415-12. Even the Democrats in the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly without a lot of shenanigans, playing around, distractions, and a dozen amendments. They voted for the lockbox. Apparently they got serious. 
   Now, here comes the point: We go down in our bipartisan meeting to the White House on Monday to meet with the President. I am hopeful. I am optimistic. In fact, I come out and say: Yes, maybe we can have a lockbox; work together on Medicare reform; we can get some tax relief. 
   Let me tell Members what happened. We go in there. The first subject I brought up was the Social Security lockbox. The President said: We need to do that. I'm with you. We can do that. 
   Senator DASCHLE said: Yeah, we ought to do that. 
   What happened? 
   I go out and say: We are going to get this done. 
   The President hasn't lifted a pinkie since--nothing. All he has done is run around and whine and threaten that he is going to veto a legitimate Patients' Bill of Rights bill, the health care needs of the people of this country. That is all he has done all week--maybe a fundraiser or two, but he has done nothing to help us get a Social Security lockbox. 
   So I invite, in fact I challenge, the President: Talk to the Democrats in the Senate, Mr. President. They are the only obstacle to setting aside Social Security in a lockbox for Social Security. 
   That is what I have to deal with all the time. I get a lot of soft soap: Oh, yes, we will work together; we will get it done. And then nothing. If the President wants a Social Security lockbox, make one call, Mr. President, one call. Call Senator DASCHLE and say: Get it done. And we will get it done next Monday. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am surprised by this objection by our Democratic colleagues. This issue concerns two very important matters: one, the intelligence authorization for the year, and also the very important Department of Energy reforms as a result of the Chinese espionage that has occurred during the last several years within the Department of Energy. 
   Needless to say, this issue needs to be debated in the Senate. I am truly sorry our Democratic colleagues do not want to debate it at this time. 
   I have urged the President, the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, and the Secretary of Energy to engage this issue. The headline should read: Senate resolves how in the future the Department of Energy will handle these matters to stop the leaks of very important nuclear weapons information from our labs. 
   That should be the headline, that we are working together to resolve this problem, instead of the situation where the Secretary of the Department of Energy is still trying to have a diffused system of reporting. There should be only one person who is reported to on the matters of national security at our nuclear labs, and that is the Secretary of Energy, and it should go straight to him and from him to the President of the United States. Surely we can work this out. 
   Having said that, I now move to proceed to H.R.----

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have consulted with the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, on this next unanimous consent request. I know Members will be interested in this. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on passage of S. 1344, as amended, at 8:20 this evening, with the Lott substitute and amendment No. 1232 having been agreed to and notwithstanding paragraph 4 of rule XII and the consent agreement of June 29, 1999. 
   I further ask that the time between now and 8:20 be equally divided between the two leaders, or their designees.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that having been agreed to, the final vote will occur at 8:20, with the time equally divided between now and then. So Senators who want to participate should be prepared to be here to be involved in the debate. Those who want to get supper at this point, now is the time to do it. 
   Having said that, I want to go ahead and make my statement on this substitute package at this time. Then I will yield to the assistant majority leader, Senator NICKLES, who will divide the balance of our time between Members on our side of the aisle who wish to speak on the final package. 
   I think we have had a really good debate on this issue. We have been on it 4 full days now, into the night on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and now Thursday. There have been a number of amendments offered. Some of them have passed and some have failed. But I think it has been handled quite well on both sides of the aisle. I believe we are now ready to finish the debate and get to final action on this legislation. 
   I thank the floor managers for the good work they have done. Senator NICKLES and Senator JEFFORDS on our side have been ably assisted by a number of our colleagues who have spent long hours on the floor, including Senators FRIST, COLLINS, and a number of others. Senator REID has done an excellent job as the whip on the Democratic side of the aisle, working with Senator NICKLES on behalf of the leaders to make sure time has been handled properly, and working out the charts on what amendments would be offered when, which has proven not to be an easy task, but one they have done a great job on. 
   Of course, I have enjoyed the exchanges that involved Senator KENNEDY and sometimes Senator GRAMM. It has been interesting, and I guess we can say elucidating in some respects. I also thank the task force on our side that has worked for a year and a half on this issue to make sure we were ready to go with an alternative, or to go with a solution to the problems we found in this area. They have done excellent work. Again, this task force was chaired by Senator NICKLES. Other members were Senators ROTH, GRAMM, COLLINS, FRIST, GREGG, SANTORUM, SESSIONS, ENZI, and HAGEL. 
   There has been a lot of great work by those members of the task force and members of the Health Committee who spent a lot of time and participated in the debate that has gone forward. I have really learned to appreciate the statement I heard on the floor earlier, that with Dr. FRIST, you really don't need a second opinion. He has done a great job. Sometimes it has been hard to understand for those of us who have not been in the medical profession. I appreciate that. 
   I think it is time we moved forward. We have done good work. Let's report out this legislation and go to conference and let's get a result. 
   There are certain things patients do need in America. Consumers do need some guarantees. I could go through a list of areas where there are problems, and I am going to go over the solutions we have here. I think the worst thing we can do now is to not wrap this up with a concluding favorable vote. 
   Now, there are some who will say the President will veto this bill. When we passed the missile defense bill, the word was: I will veto it. But we worked it out and he signed it. It was the same thing on education flexibility. The word was, you have language in here on the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and we thought we should meet our commitment there before we spent money on a lot of other programs. In the end, we worked out the disagreements and the President signed education flexibility. 
   Today, for the first time in history, enrolling, signing of a bill was done by Senator THURMOND and by the Speaker, and it was sent by Internet to the White House--the Y2K liability bill. It came out of committee on a partisan vote, but some Democrats worked with all of the Republicans and we got a bill through the Senate. It took us three tries. We were told the President would  veto this bill, but he is going to sign the bill. 
   The point is, to the President and to those of you who haven't supported the Republican position on this Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, work with us. If you want to get something done, let's make it happen. If you want an issue, you have got enough votes, you will have issues; so will we. And then what? Is America going to be better off? No. Let's get results. We have done that in the past on other issues related to health. So I challenge our Democratic friends to join us in this effort. 
   This is the main event. We have gone through a number of votes and we have had our debate on these amendments. But now we are dealing with a comprehensive package that the task force has developed on the Republican side of the aisle, and it will strengthen the rights of patients and improve the way HMOs work, without wrecking the American health care system. 
   The American people don't want the Federal Government to take over health care. They don't want that. They don't want bureaucrats making the decisions, and they don't want it being determined by a bunch of lawsuits. But they do want some action to clarify and solve some of the problems we have. 
   Make no mistake about it, the version of this bill that we have offered is far superior to the Democratic bill, which I believe contains a lot of bad policy. It is dangerous in many respects: dangerous because, under the guise of humanitarian concerns, it would drive into the ranks of the uninsured some 1.8 million Americans; dangerous because, under its compassionate rhetoric, it would threaten the ability of most small businesses to provide health insurance to their employees; dangerous because it would place the scalpels of litigation into the hands of the trial lawyers and virtually invite them to carve up the Nation's health care system. 
   I don't believe the American people want that. The system is not perfect. HMOs are not perfect, although the quality of their care, as every other consumer product, can vary tremendously from one group to another, from one region to another. In my own State of Mississippi, we only have about 5 percent of our health care that is provided by managed care organizations--5 percent. 
   So we have a very different view and set of concerns than do some of the other States where there is a lot more activity in this area. 
   If there is one thing we have learned from the downfall of the Clinton health package in 1994, it is this: The American people don't want the Government to control health care. They do want solutions, though, to some of the real problems that exist, such as portability, which we did deal with. They want us to recognize the problems where they really exist, but they don't want political grandstanding in Washington to imperil the highest quality health care in the world. 
   I heard it said yesterday on the floor, ``Health care in America is in real trouble.'' There are concerns about the evolution that is occurring. 
   But health care in America is still the best that the minds of men have conceived. 
   My mother is alive today because of medical procedures. She is on her third pacemaker. She is doing fine. If her knees would hold up, she would still be out looking for a date. 
   And the pharmaceuticals and the medicines they make are miracle drugs. 
   We should not kill the goose that laid the golden egg. 
   Can we improve it? Can we work with all those involved in the system to make it better. We can do that. That is what we are doing today. 
   I hate to think where we would be if the Congress, 20 or 30 years ago, had attempted to micromanage health care the way this Democratic legislation attempts to do now. 
   I wonder if we would, today, have the non-invasive surgery, the miracle drugs, the sophisticated diagnostics that we all take for granted. 
   If the Government moved in and said we are going to start dictating this and say what you can do, what you can't do, and when you can do it, we would have a loss of that entrepreneurial, dramatic innovation and spirit that we have had in health care in America today. 
   The Congress should not imperil the continuing transformation of American medicine. Will it be different in 10 years? You bet it will. So will life in America. It is happening so fast that it is breathtaking. 
   It is not our job to control or dictate that transformation. 
   Our job is to find ways for more Americans to have broader access to those innovations in health care. 
   That is precisely the point of our Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. We want to give more clout to health care consumers while, equally important, making it easier for families to get insurance. They will have a choice. They decide for themselves how they are going to get this care. 
   All the consumer rights in the world don't matter an aspirin if you aren't able to become a consumer. That's why our Republican bill creates new opportunities for uninsured Americans to buy into the health care system. 
   For starters, our bill makes all Americans eligible for medical savings accounts, not just the 50,000 currently allowed in a pilot program. 
   Give people that option to get into a medical savings account and to make the choice as to how they will use it. And give them the reward. If they don't have to spend it, they get to keep it. What a great American idea. 
   We offer full deductibility for health care costs. That alone will make insurance more affordable for 16 million Americans. 
   That is the way to go. We should make it deductible--not just for the self-employed, although we ought to do that, but for all of them. That would solve the problem of a lot of these small business men and women who can't afford to provide the coverage for their employees. Let them deduct the cost when they choose what they want. 
   We provide full deductibility for self-employed persons, so these 3.3 million hard-working people, and their families will have the same tax break that big business has. At least 132,000 households will be able to afford health coverage with this provision for the first time. 
   At every point, our approach is to expand access to health care. That is our greatest contrast with the other package that has been offered by Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE. 
   It is worth repeating. 
   If we went with their proposal, it would result in the loss of insurance for an estimated 2 million people. 
   That is far too heavy a price to pay for some of the things we have argued about this week. 
   This bill, the substitute amendment I am offering, is the main event of the debate of health care this week. 
   For the 48 million Americans whose health care plans are not protected by existing State regulations--that is a critical point--it will provide these things. 
   I want to emphasize that. The bill we are about to vote on will provide these things: 
   Guaranteed access to emergency room care; 
   Direct access to OB/GYN without prior authorization; 
   Direct access to pediatrician without prior authorization; 
   Better continuity of care if your doctor leaves a health plan; 
   Guaranteed access to specialists; 
   Improved access to medications; 
   Protection of decisionmaking by doctors and patients; 
   And, very importantly, our bill provides a way to get a review. 
   Dr. FRIST talked a lot about that. If the doctor makes a recommendation, and he and the patient disagrees with what the managed care organization says, they will have a chance to have a review internally, and then one externally with expedited procedures. And, at that point, there is still the opportunity for lawsuits. If they don't comply with the result, there will be penalties for noncompliance. 
   Again, instead of getting a lawsuit--which may be nice when it is finally concluded for your heirs--you will get action. You will get a decision through an appeals process. 
   That is the way to go. 
   I am not critical of lawsuits because I have a problem with lawyers. I am one. I was on both sides of this issue for plaintiffs and defendants when I practiced law. I was a public defender in my home county. I understand there is a necessity and a time for lawsuits. But  I don't think it should be the first resort. It should be the last resort. See if you can work it out. See if you can design an appeals process that will get you to a conclusion and that will get results, rather than a lawsuit that may be great for the deceased person's beneficiaries. 
   We believe patients should have a timely and cost-free appeals procedure to contest any denial of coverage. We believe patients should not suffer discrimination based on genetic testing. Our bill forbids it. 
   We believe government should facilitate breakthroughs in medicine and help providers gain access to them. Our bill does that, too. 
   What we do not do is put American health care in the hands and in the pockets of the trial lawyers. 
   Senator JEFFORDS has said it best: ``You can't sue your way to better health care.'' 
   In that regard, the Democratic bill that has been before us this week reminds me of the old days of medicine. Well, we will 
   bleed the patients. And, believe me, I think that is what would happen if we went with what they have proposed. It would be bled with Federal-level bureaucrats. They would be bled in the courts. 
   That is not the answer. I think that is a bad idea. There is a better way--a way that protects the rights of patients without imperiling the Nation's health care system; a way that opens the door to medical care; that gets more people covered by the insurance of their choice; a way that educates consumers so that they, rather than the government bureaucrats, can make their own informed choices. 
   That is the sum and substance of our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. It is ``plus,'' because it is a bill of rights, but also it provides some tax opportunities through the medical savings accounts and the deductibility. 
   I thank many Senators who have worked on this issue on both sides of the aisle. 
   I think we all know a little more about this subject than we did, and maybe more than we ever wanted to know. 
   I have every expectation that it will win the Senate's approval and find favor in the House of Representatives. 
   I am optimistic, as I always am, that we can get a result. If we make up our minds to do that, we will. 
   This bill addresses the real problems many Americans face with the delivery of health care. It expands access to health insurance and makes it more affordable. It bans genetic discrimination in health care, expands research, and educates the consumers. 
   In short, it is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately proceed to a period of morning business until 10 a.m. I see Senator GRAMS is here for some remarks after my opening statement. 
   Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and a number of amendments will be offered, I am sure, throughout the day. Debate will resume on the pending Dodd amendment regarding coverage of clinical trials. 
   As we go forward today, I remind Senators that we will continue to have what I am sure everybody will agree has been a good debate. I assume there will be several amendments offered today, and so there will be votes, I hope, even this morning or early afternoon and then throughout the rest of the afternoon. By previous consent, the Senate will complete action, I remind Senators, on the pending bill during tomorrow's session of the Senate. We may go into the evening, but it will be a normal evening. We have tried to make sure we had full time allocated for this debate and amendments. We agreed in the beginning that we would at least have normal days or more. 
   Actually, so far, on Monday we spent 6 hours 17 minutes on this bill. The average Mondays are 4 hours 46 minutes. On Tuesday we spent 7 hours 5 minutes. The average Tuesdays are 7 hours and 30 minutes. The average Wednesdays are usually around 9 hours 39 minutes. So we are going to stay right on track. I encourage my colleagues to make their best case, offer their amendments, make their speeches, but at the end of this week I hope we will come to a conclusion that will produce a bill which will address the important areas of patients' rights, consumer rights, protections they need, the right to access of documents, the rights that they should have to care, including emergency instances, but there has to be a prudent standard; there has to be some common sense applied to all of this. 
   I would also say at this point how proud I have been of the only doctor we have in the Senate. I think we are really blessed and privileged to have Dr. BILL FRIST here. Not only is he an outstanding human being but, unlike a lot of us, he knows what he is talking about. Having been a highly acclaimed heart surgeon, having a family that has been involved in hospital care, he has an extent of knowledge when it comes to clinical tests or how patients are treated, what procedures are necessary, most of us just do not have. So it has been a real pleasure to watch him at work over the past few days. 
   The Senate may consider any available appropriations bills when we complete the Patients' Bill of Rights. I remind Senators we are scheduled to have a vote on the Abraham-Domenici Social Security lockbox on Friday. There have been indications that the President supports a lockbox concept. I asked him in our meeting on Monday: Mr. President, what is your plan? Do you support the House version, which is a real lockbox? The Senate version is really tight because it bases the lockbox on the declining debt that would result from locking the Social Security funds up and not allowing them to be spent for anything but Social Security. Or the House version, which is a more procedural effort to keep these funds from being spent, requiring a supermajority vote, for instance, in the Senate of 60 votes in order to spend that money for anything but Social 
   Security, which I think it should not be. Or is there some compromise version? 
   Senator DASCHLE and I have communicated on that a couple times over the past 2 days. We hope that maybe we can come to some agreement and get this Social Security lockbox done, set those moneys aside so that we can move on and deal with other issues such as Medicare reform and returning  some of the tax overpayment to working American families. 
   So after the Patients' Bill of Rights, we do have the vote scheduled on Friday on the lockbox for Social Security, and then we are looking at other appropriations bills that we could go to Friday or early next week or the intelligence authorization bill. We will confer with leadership on both sides before that announcement is made. 
   With that, I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor so that Senator GRAMS can make his statement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I pay tribute to The University of Mississippi's 1999 Outstanding Teacher of the Year, Dr. Mary E. Stuckey. 
   Each year my alma mater The University of Mississippi, known as Ole Miss, recognizes excellence in the classroom with the Elsie M. Hood Outstanding Teacher Award during its Honors Day Convocation. Nominations for this honor are accepted from students, alumni, and faculty. A committee of former recipients then selects the faculty member who best demonstrates enthusiasm and engages students intellectually. 
   Dr. Mary E. Stuckey is an Associate Professor of Political Science. An 11-year veteran of the Ole Miss Political Science Department, Dr. Stuckey's teaching interests include the Presidency and political communications as well as American Indian politics. Her research focuses on Presidential rhetoric, media coverage of the President, and institutional aspects of Presidential communication. Dr. Stuckey is also working on several projects regarding depictions of American Indians in the media and in national politics. In addition to these areas of interest, she also teaches in the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College. 
   Dr. Stuckey's research has earned her several prestigious grants. These include the President Gerald R. Ford Library, the C-SPAN in the Classroom Faculty Development, a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, and the Canadian Studies Faculty Research. She has also published several studies such as ``The President as Interpreter-in-Chief'' and ``Strategic Failures in the Modern Presidency.'' 
   A native of southern California, Dr. Stuckey earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California at Davis. She then completed her graduate studies at the University of Notre Dame and joined the Ole Miss faculty in 1987. 
   Now, Mr. President, let me tell you that Dr. Stuckey and I probably will not agree on much when it comes to political issues. But three members of my current staff, Steven Wall, Beth Miller, and Brian Wilson, tell me she is outstanding in the classroom. They all agree that she is an equal opportunity challenger, regardless of political views, when it comes to the study of politics. She requires her students to use logic rather than emotions when advocating any viewpoint. Dr. Stuckey does not penalize her students when they don't share her views; rather she rewards academic scholarship. 
   The study of political science is essential to any society. And I believe it is even more incumbent on us, as Americans, to do so. Thomas Jefferson once said, ``Self-government is not possible unless the citizens are educated sufficiently to enable them to exercise oversight.'' He was right. Universities are an important institution to help instill in each generation an appreciation for the unique and honorable character required for our democratic republic. Americans want to learn from their past mistakes so they can strive to build a better society for their children and grandchildren. Dedicated and inspiring teachers, such as Dr. Mary E. Stuckey, this year's Elsie M. Hood Award recipient, are key to ensuring that our next generation of political leaders will have the necessary knowledge and character to make America strong.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to vote on the Conference Report on H.R. 775, the Y2K Act, I want to praise the bipartisan efforts of so many Senate and House Members who have worked diligently to construct an effective, fair bill that will address the important issue of liability as it relates to the possible Year 2000--or Y2K--computer problems. This has been a group effort, teaming members on both sides of the aisle with the private sector. The coalition of high technology businesses, large businesses, small businesses, and others provided the initiative and momentum that pushed this bill across the finish line. 
   This bill is constructive, positive legislation. It allows companies in the information technology industry to focus their limited resources on solving Y2K related problems in computer software by preventing frivolous litigation. Litigation which would divert those limited resources away from solving Y2K programming deficiencies. 
   Mr. President, so many Senators and their staffs have worked to insure the success of this legislation, even when faced with difficult hurdles and odds. The efforts of Senator MCCAIN, Senator WYDEN, Senator GORTON, Senator BENNETT, Senator DODD, Senator HATCH, Sentor FEINSTEIN and others, along with the efforts of the House sponsors and conferees, have brought us to this point. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that the House has passed this important bill today by a vote of 404-24. With only 183 days left until the globe turns the page on the calendar to a new century and a new millennium, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important bill. I am confident that this Conference Report will pass the Senate by a wide margin, just as in the House, and I urge the President to sign this bill into law when he receives it.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think it is important now we give Members some indication of what the schedule looks like. Senator DASCHLE and I have been talking about how we can move forward.  
   I believe we have two amendments that have to be dealt with, with the possibility of votes, at least two votes at 7:30, in order to finish the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. I think there will probably just be one amendment vote and final passage, although there is another amendment that has to be disposed of in that time. 
   At that point, our plan is to go to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. Work is being done on that now. Senator DASCHLE and I are ready to announce right now that if we can get that done tonight at a reasonable hour, we will not have any votes on Friday. If we have difficulty, if we can't get it done tonight, then we will be in with votes tomorrow. We probably are going to have to be in tomorrow anyway. Senator DASCHLE and I had already planned on being here. We want company. We are still working on nominations tonight, and we might have some we will try to get cleared tomorrow. 
   Basically, I am saying that if we could get this D.C. appropriations bill completed, then we would not have recorded votes tomorrow. It behooves us all. We are in a good mode now. We are making progress. I urge those who are involved in the D.C. appropriations bill to work aggressively so we can complete this at a reasonable hour tonight. Otherwise, we will see you in the morning at 9:30.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of the vote that just occurred on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill, and the agreement just reached a few moments ago with respect to the District of Columbia appropriations, the Senate has conducted its last vote for the week. There will be no further votes tonight and no votes in the morning. 
   The next vote will occur on Tuesday, July 13. The Senate will reconvene on Monday, July 12, at noon. However, no votes will occur during Monday's session of the Senate. 
   Votes will occur during the session of the Senate beginning Tuesday, July 13, through Friday, July 16. There will be votes on Friday, July 16. So be prepared for that. That was under a previously agreed to cloture vote at 10:30 on Friday, the 16th, concerning the Social Security lockbox issue. 
   We will be in session some tomorrow. But there will be no recorded votes in the morning. 
   I thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation. Senator DASCHLE and our whips have all worked to make it possible to complete not one but two appropriations bills. I wish all of our colleagues a safe and happy holiday. I look forward to seeing you back on the 12th.

   Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I just want to commend the Senator from Montana for his dogged determination to move this legislation. I am sure that all of its imperfections will be resolved in conference. I commend him for his efforts.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass a measure that will usher in a new era in the international satellite communications marketplace. This bill is the result of months of deliberation among many of my colleagues and builds upon a debate from last Congress. 
   First and foremost, I extend my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, Senator CONRAD BURNS, for his unrelenting diligence in working with all parties involved, both in the Senate and in the private sector. There were numerous players who had a stake or an interest in this reform measure. Senator BURNS was willing to accommodate their perspectives while remaining true to his commitment to move forward. I thank him for that. 
   Along with Senator BURNS, other Members in this Chamber, Senator BREAUX, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator STEVENS, and others were actively engaged in the process. Their contributions enhanced the final product in many respects and helped produce a more balanced bill. Let me also recognize Senator JOHN MCCAIN, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. His leadership and his support has been instrumental in helping to advance this effort, and I want to thank him as well. 
   Reaching a unified unanimous, Senate position on legislation of this magnitude was not a simple task. Although the bill garnered widespread agreement on principle, the technical issues have not been easy. Some were complex, given the marketplace transition from one dominated by intergovernmental organizations to one of private sector competition. Other issues were straightforward but contentious. This made it necessary to take the time and work through some of these areas in a fair and open manner. We did, and I am pleased that the Senate has now moved forward.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the story of the efforts to protect the Alabama Sturgeon has been a very long and very ugly one. For many years Congress has been involved. Just three years ago, Congress thought they had put an end to the listing battle when a partnership was formed between the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Alabama Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. A five-year recovery plan was established to repopulate the Tennessee-Tombigbee with Sturgeon. Now this program has fallen to pieces, because the FWS pulled the plug by taking the dedicated funds and proceeding directly to a formal listing under the Endangered Species Act. 
   The FWS needs to do the right thing. For me, this means the FWS should honor the partnership it set up with Alabama's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. This program is at year three of a 5-year program and there is no evidence that the state of Alabama was performing poorly. However, it is clear the FWS wants to renege on the deal. Renege on a program that provides more direct and dedicated funding, and thus more resources, for the Alabama Sturgeon restoration than any funds the Fish and Wildlife Service spent under its own auspices. This simply does not make fiscal or scientific sense. 
   In both 1993 and 1994 Congress opposed the endangered species listing of the Alabama Sturgeon because of the lack of sound science. Congress also recognized the tremendous economic impact this listing would have on our region. The listing would have caused billions of dollars in river commerce to be disrupted. Nothing has changed in six years--no new science--no difference in the economic impact.

   Mr. LOTT. This letter clearly states that dredging can only occur during six months of the year, and at no time can work be conducted across the entire river channel. It is clear to me, and it is clear to all my colleagues in the chamber today that dredging will be stopped. Also, on May 10, 1999, the FWS office in Daphne, Alabama, again wrote the Mobile Corp about another maintenance dredging project in Mobile. I ask unanimous consent that this letter to the Mobile Corp of Engineers be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. LOTT. This letter stated ``dredging, desnagging, and spoil disposition carried out in connection with channel improvement and maintenance represent an ongoing threat to these sturgeon species.'' Again this proves dredging will be stopped, and the FWS will not hold true to its oral promises here in Washington. 
   During this time frame a lawsuit has also been pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, styled Alabama Sturgeon. et al. v. Bruce Babbitt, as Secretary of the Interior, et al. Two months ago, on April 26, 1999, the court issued an Order noting the parties were engaged in ``settlement negotiations'' which were likely to lead to dismissal of the lawsuit. Four days later, on April 30, 1999, for some unknown reason the court issued the Order proposing to dismiss the lawsuit upon the payment of $20,000 in attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs by the government. Neither the Court Order nor the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal and Notice of a Compromise Settlement of Attorney's fees and Costs makes any attempt to justify the rationale for this result. For some reason the Justice Department apparently decided to simply make a gift of $20,000 to the lawyers in this case. 
   This Administration has not only given away $20,000 to these lawyers to sweep this lawsuit under the rug, it also stole more than $400,000 designated for sturgeon restoration. I am disappointed by these actions. 
   It is my firm belief that Alabama's Federal partner is not motivated by a desire to restore the sturgeon. Clearly, making a decision to list the Alabama Sturgeon as an endangered species, while having no new scientific information must be based in politics--not science. Why an adversarial approach? The solution to this politically driven problem is simple. Let Alabama finish its 5-year program. The Fish and Wildlife Service action is wrong for Alabama . . . wrong for Mississippi . . . wrong for America. We all must continue to press forward in this fight to do the right thing for the Alabama Sturgeon in spite of these actions by FWS.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Nelson Rhone who will be retiring from the Senate on July 7, 1999. Nelson began his Senate career December 21, 1964, as a laborer with Sergeant at Arms' custodial service operation. During his tenure with the Sergeant at Arms office, Nelson also worked in the Legislative Garage as a garage attendant and driver. In 1988, Nelso was promoted to Labor Foreman in the Sergeant at Arms' Environmental Service operation. 
   That account of his career here does not adequately convey the affection and respect he has earned at all levels of this institution. He is one of those rare individuals who, by virtue of both his tenure and his character, come to represent all that is best in the Senate of the United States. 
   In describing him, the word that immediately comes to mind is ``gentleman.'' These days, that can seem like a quaint or old-fashioned term, but it is the most accurate compliment for someone like Nelson, who, by personal example, has set a standard for others to follow. It is an understatement to say that we will miss him. He is a gem. 
   Now, after nearly 35 years of devoted service to the Senate, he is retiring to spend more time with his wife, Mary Jane, and his family. Nelson is an avid bowler and enjoys traveling. He and Mary Jane look forward to having the time to travel and spend more time with their friends and family. 
   Nelson has been a dedicated and valuable member of the Senate community, and I know all members join with me in wishing him many years of health and happiness.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment that would require that the Congress be notified in a timely fashion of any report or list submitted by the Taiwanese Government for the potential purchase or other acquisition of any defense article or defense service. 
   This amendment would remedy a long-festering situation whereby the Congress has ceded virtually all decisionmaking authority to the executive branch with respect to arms sales to Taiwan. This situation is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which established that arms sales decisions regarding Taiwan must be made jointly between the legislative and executive branches of government. 
   Specifically, the relevant sections of Public Law 96-8, the ``Taiwan Relations Act'' of April 10, 1979, are as follows: Section 3(a) states, ``..... the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.'' And Section 3(b) states, ``The President and the Congress shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan, in accordance with procedures established by law. Such determination of Taiwan's defense needs shall include review by United States military authorities in connection with recommendations to the President and the Congress.'' 
   When Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, it was in response to the Carter administration's abrupt efforts to curtail long-standing defense ties between Washington and Taipei. At the time of the adoption of the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress wanted to make clear that the enduring ties between the American people and the people of Taiwan included a clear and sustained commitment to ensuring that the people of Taiwan had the means to defend themselves. Taiwan's ability to maintain a credible deterrent, qualitatively superior to that of the mainland's forces across the narrow Taiwan Strait, has been crucial in keeping peace in East Asia. 
   The central tenet of the Taiwan Relations Act was stated very clearly in section 3, namely, that the President and Congress together would determine what Taiwan required for its legitimate self defense without regard to pressures imposed by any third party nation. This provision was written in the law to ensure that executive branch officials would not become excessively concerned with the protestations of the PRC whenever the United States proposed to provide Taiwan defense articles and services needed for Taiwan's self-defense. Unique among laws governing United States defense ties with other nations, the Taiwan Relations Act explicitly requires in law that Congress and President together decide what Taiwan's military defenses require. 
   The first year after the TRA's enactment, this provision was sorely tested when the executive branch failed to inform Congress fully and currently on what Taiwan needed for its defense. The Foreign Relations Committee under the leadership of Senator Frank Church lambasted executive branch officials. Together with Senator Glenn, Senator Javits, and others, Chairman Church insisted that the administration provide full details on those weapon systems Taiwan had requested. 
   This practice of involving Congress in reviewing procurement decisions--as required by law--lapsed since that time. In recent years, the executive branch has met with representatives of Taiwan in secret and has refused to share with Congress the complete list of those defense articles and services requested formally or informally by Taiwan. 
   In this regard, on May 11 of this year I wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright requesting a copy of the list of defense articles and services sought by Taiwan in the most recent round of annual arms procurement talks. Those talks ended on April 21. I received a reply to my letter on May 21, signed by Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Barbara Larkin. Mrs. Larkin's reply asserted that the Department would only provide information on ``the systems for which we [the Administration] have given Taiwan a positive response.'' 
   In other words, the State Department refused my legitimate request to be informed in writing of Taiwan's request for potential purchase or other acquisition of defense articles and services. Frankly, I was shocked and dismayed by this response, especially given the fact the most recent round of talks had already been concluded and given the clear intent of Section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act. Instead, Mrs. Larkin's letter provided information only on those portions of Taiwan's request that the administration unilaterally had decided to approve. 
   I understand that a similar, written request by the chairman of the House International Relations Committee Representative BENJAMIN GILMAN, and others, have received the same unsatisfactory response from the administration. 
   Mr. President, the current situation is intolerable and must be changed. The law of the land requires that Congress be involved in decisions regarding Taiwan's legitimate defense needs. The President and future administrations should know that the American people's representatives in Congress will meet our obligations under the law to be involved in this decisionmaking process. 
   Toward this end, my amendment requires that Taiwan's procurement request be furnished, on an appropriate basis and in a timely fashion, to the appropriate committees of Congress. I believe this is a necessary step in ensuring that there is a meaningful dialogue between the legislative and executive branches of government and that the decisionmaking process regarding what Taiwan legitimately needs for its self defense, proceeds on a basis that is fully consistent with the letter and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to Dr. Kent Wyatt who is  retiring today after serving as the President of Delta State University for the past 24 years. During his tenure at Delta State, Dr. Wyatt has repeatedly been recognized as one of America's premier higher education administrators. 
   Kent was born in Berea, Kentucky and later moved to Cleveland, Mississippi. He earned an undergraduate degree in education from Delta State and a Masters degree in education from the University of Southern Mississippi. Kent topped off his formal education at the University of Mississippi where he received a Doctorate in Education. 
   After completing his doctoral studies at Ole Miss, Kent commenced his teaching career back home in Cleveland, Mississippi where he served as a mathematics teacher, a coach, and then as a principal for the School District. Kent soon followed in his father's footsteps, Forest E. Wyatt, who served as a teacher and the head football coach at Delta State University. 
   In 1964, Kent's alma mater, Delta State University, hired him as its Alumni Secretary. But, he quickly shifted over to the university's management. Recognizing his leadership and vision, Kent was named Delta State's fifth President in 1975 after serving six years as assistant to the president. 
   During the last quarter century, Kent has amassed an impressive record. He continuously emulated ``quality without compromise.'' As a result of his stewardship, Delta State's faculty has grown from 202 to 328, with all academic programs receiving national accreditation, and 18 new facilities were built. Since 1975, Delta State's enrollment has grown by 32%. Equally astounding, Kent increased the university's financial assets by a factor of ten since 1975. A most impressive record for Dr. Wyatt and Delta State University. 
   Kent's peers in Mississippi and across the nation have repeatedly drawn on his academic leadership. For example, Kent recently served on the Search Committee for the Executive Director of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and on the NCAA's President's Commission. 
   Running a large university would challenge many, but Kent also managed to serve those off campus too. Kent also served his community for over three decades. He was the President of the Cleveland Lions Club as well as the President of the Chamber of Commerce. He also served on the boards of the United Way, Mississippi Economic Council, Grenada Banking System, Union Planters Bank of Northwest Mississippi, and the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Kent currently serves as a Deacon at the First Baptist Church. 
   Kent's wife Janice, their children Tara and Elizabeth, as well as their grandchildren Kent Wyatt Mounger and Collins Hartfield Mounger, have good reasons to be proud of his many accomplishments. 
   As Congress addresses the many challenges facing higher education in America today, my colleagues and I can benefit from the many contributions Kent has made in Cleveland, Mississippi. Not only has he been an inspiration to the more than 15,000 college students who passed through the halls of Delta State during his tenure, Kent has helped to mold the future leaders of this great country. 
   Kent and Janice have chosen to stay in Bolivar County. While he will be missed at Delta State, the town of Cleveland, the County of Bolivar, the State of Mississippi, and Mississippi's Congressional delegation are thankful that Kent, a true Delta State Statesman, has chosen to remain in his hometown to serve as a continuing inspiration for public service at its best. 
   Mr. President, I want to express to Kent my heartfelt appreciation for everything he has done for his community, our state, and the nation. I am hopeful that Kent and Janice will enjoy the next important phase of their lives.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, Ron Kavulick, who has faithfully served the United States Senate for 20 years, will officially retire from the Senate family. 
   It took Ron Kavulick a while to get to the Senate. He worked first as an official court reporter for the office of The Judge Advocate General, United States Air Force, and later, as an official reporter in the White House--serving Presidents Nixon and Johnson. When he finally got to us, as an Official Reporter of Senate Debates, he advanced quickly, ultimately serving as Chief Reporter. 
   As Chief Reporter, Ron oversaw the preparation and editing of the proceedings of the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record. His greatest challenge, perhaps, was the impeachment trial of the President, where Ron's institutional memory and experience were called upon throughout the lengthy proceedings. It's all too easy for us to assume that capable and dedicated Senate employees, like Ron, will always be here providing abiding support and quiet efficiency. 
   Thomas Carlyle argued that history is the sum of the work of outstanding individuals. If so, then Ron Kavulick has contributed much to our Senate history. His support to me and my staff will always be remembered. I commend Ron for his dedicated service, and wish him and his wife, Pat, many years of health and happiness in retirement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say first Senator DASCHLE and I have labored long and hard to come to an agreement on a unanimous-consent procedure to deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights issue, appropriations bills, and nominations, and it still takes an awful lot of good faith. We have to work together. We have to have some trust. We have to give the benefit of the doubt to the leaders. Also, in the Senate we have to be prepared to deal with action. We are trying to find a way to deal fairly with the appropriations bills and with the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader or his designee, introduce the underlying health care bill and it be placed on the calendar by 12 noon on Thursday, July 8, and the bill become the pending business at 1 p.m. on Monday, July 12, 1999, with a vote occurring on final passage at the close of business on Thursday, July 15, and the bill be subject to the following agreement: 
   That the bill be limited to 3 hours of debate, to be equally divided in the usual form, that all amendments in order to the bill be relevant to the subject of amendment Nos. 702, 703, the introduced bill or health care tax cuts, and all first degree amendments be offered in an alternating fashion with Senator DASCHLE to offer the initial first degree amendment and all first- and second-degree amendments be limited to 100 minutes each, to be equally divided in the usual form. I further ask consent that second-degree amendments be limited to one second-degree amendment per side, per party, with no motions to commit or recommit in order, or any other act with regard to the amendments in order, and that just prior to third reading of the bill, it be in order for the majority leader, or his designee to offer a final amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order. 
   I further ask consent that following passage of the bill, should the bill, upon passage, contain any revenue blue slip matter, the bill remain at the desk and that when the Senate receives the house companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the Senate bill that was passed be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill as amended be passed, the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House, all without any intervening action or debate.

   Mr. LOTT. I want to announce at this time that the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, and I have discussed several times how we would proceed with this matter once we have had this period of time for debate and votes on and in relation to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Senator DASCHLE has given me his assurance that although this agreement will not prohibit Members from offering this issue or an amendment related to this issue again in the session, he does not expect a need to offer this issue again, presuming the normal legislative process is followed. 
   In other words, if we should complete an action and it goes to conference, if it languishes there or does not come back, this arrangement would not prohibit some amendment from being offered at some subsequent point. 
   I can fairly say that the minority leader is willing to say this issue will have had due consideration after these 4 days of debate, and at the conclusion of this week we would not feel the need to readdress it. 
   Finally, I announce to the Senate, following this agreement, the two leaders have jointly agreed to pass three to five of the remaining appropriations bills available prior to the Fourth of July recess. This will take a good bit of cooperation, too. 
   The top priority of the appropriations bills are likely in the following  order: foreign operations, D.C., Treasury-Postal Service, and the pending agriculture appropriations bill. We will work to see what the prospects are and time to be consumed for Transportation, State-Justice-Commerce, or Interior. 
   I have already discussed this matter twice this afternoon with the chairman of the committee. I believe he is working with Senator BYRD to try to identify the bills we could most likely move in this remaining time, and how that can be done--time agreements, if necessary--but we will have to work together. I believe we can move at least three, and hopefully four, of these bills. 
   In light of this agreement, I now ask consent that the pending two amendments to the agricultural appropriations bill be withdrawn.

   Mr. LOTT. It is my intent to move forward in the normal fashion that we deal with these legislative days. Of course, we always take into consideration conflicts that one party or the other may have. There will be no intent to have short days. We intend to have long days so we can have adequate discussion. 
   Let me express my appreciation to Senator NICKLES for the amount of time and effort he has put into all of this. He is very knowledgeable on the substance of the Patients' Bill of Rights issue. 
   There are many Senators on both sides of the aisle who prefer to do this another way. It has taken restraint on both sides. I know Senator NICKLES still has concerns about it, but he has been willing to work with us to come up with an agreement to move forward. I know that applies to Senator KENNEDY also. 
   I also have to thank Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL, managers of this agriculture appropriations bill, around whose neck this issue has been attached for the last week. They have been very patient and understanding. 
   I hope tomorrow we will be prepared to move forward aggressively on a number of these appropriations bills--the three I mentioned at the top or agriculture or one of the others. 
   I will be talking to the ranking member and Senator DASCHLE about the appropriations we can move forward with first.

   Mr. LOTT. I think there will be full opportunity to talk about the substance of the issue and the bills pending, and amendments would be offered. I think after 2 or 3 days on this issue, most of the issues that need to be debated--or all of the issues--will have been addressed. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I will have talked back and forth about that. I think once we have some critical debate and some critical amendments, the Members will think they have had the opportunity to be heard and will have made their points. 
   So I think there is going to be plenty of time here. It doesn't specify amendments. It doesn't specify a maximum or a minimum. There are some time limitations, which is the orderly way to do business around here, but there is not going to be any effort to have two or three amendments and then forestall everything else. You could not do it under this arrangement.

I assume some of them may even be agreed to by both sides. I also think it is possible we might be going along with pretty hot debate and Senators may want a little extra time. Usually, we try to accommodate each other, if there really is a need for it, on both sides of the aisle. I am not advocating it now. I think we could nitpick it to death, but I think we have come about as close as we possibly can.

   Mr. LOTT. As we have discussed, it is my intention to work to clear the Executive Calendar. We now have a number of nominations on the calendar, including a long list of military nominations and the nominee to be Secretary of Treasury. We may even have other nominees coming on the calendar. I understand the Finance Committee reported three more nominations today, including the Under Secretary of Treasury. We have some judicial nominations. We will begin the process tomorrow of hotlining those nominations. We will be moving them along as  we go forward on this process of getting appropriations done. 
   Again, our purpose is to work together and do the people's business in the next 2 1/2 days, and that will include clearing nominations. Some of them, of course, may hit a snag for one reason or another, but we will certainly work on that. 
   The other thing is we have talked on both sides of the aisle about how someday we needed to go back and correct a situation that developed a few years ago with regard to rule XVI so that we can preserve the integrity of the appropriations and the authorization process. Senator DASCHLE and I have talked about this. We want to reach a point where he and I together--not when one side or the other seizes the opportunity, but at the earliest opportunity, he and I will stand together to correct what I think was a mistake. And it originated on our side of the aisle. I acknowledge that. I was part of the problem. But I think for the future sanctity of the appropriations process and to make the authorization committees really work as they should, we should have that point of order reinstated. Senator DASCHLE has indicated he would work with me on that. I would like it to be totally a bipartisan effort. I 
   know our ranking member and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee would like to do that, too. So I thank him for his cooperation on this unanimous consent.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to make one further announcement. I have been communicating, as I said, with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In the wrapup, we will announce that in the morning we will go to one of the appropriations bills, perhaps D.C. or foreign ops. We will need to confer with a lot of different people. But when we get the time agreement, we will go to one of those. 
   In view of the work that has gone on, I will announce at this time there will be no further rollcall votes tonight, but Members should expect votes to occur in the morning and throughout the day. 
   Mr. President, one final announcement: We are going to pursue the possibility of laying down one of the appropriations bills tonight so we would have it pending. I want Members to be aware of that, but there still would not be any more recorded votes. 
   Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Let me ask you the critical question. For the average person out there--senior citizen who is worried about their health care--they are in an HMO or managed care organization and they have a problem and they want that problem dealt with, this very graphically shows what the problem is with the bill. It winds up that a bureaucrat is involved and a lawyer is involved. 
   What I want to know is, the alternative bill that has been developed by you and Senator NICKLES and Senator COLLINS and Senator SANTORUM, Dr. FRIST, and others, does it provide a way for that patient's problem to be dealt with? Is it a timely issue? Is it dealt with in a way where lawyers are not necessary?

   Mr. LOTT. You give the patient that choice. They can choose to go with an MSA account. They can choose the doctor they want. 
   But again, I want to ask the question, what if that person decides to stay in their managed care organization and a problem develops? Under your bill, there is a review process--an internal and external process--that has a specified period of time in which action has to occur; is that correct?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. All right, sir. I just wanted to emphasize those points. You always do an excellent job with your cards and even your unusual stethoscope. 
   Let me talk about the issue of where we are. First of all, I think it is very important that we in the Senate act to do the people's business. This time of year, every summer, the Senate is very much involved in passing the annual appropriations bills--the bills that do keep the Government going, bills that have many programs that the administration has asked for and, quite frankly, many programs that the American people rely on. 
   We are going to have four votes this afternoon, trying to bring up four different appropriations bills to try to get the people's business done: the agriculture appropriations bill, the transportation appropriations bill. So many of us in this country depend on an improved transportation infrastructure. I know that is true in my State and a lot of other States. We have dangerous bridges, narrow, two-lane, hilly roads. We have interstate systems that are in disrepair. We have mass transportation systems that need additional systems. All of that is in the transportation appropriations bill, which we hope to have considered in short order by the Senate. 
   We have the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. This is a bill that has to do with everything from fisheries in this country to foreign policy to law enforcement. Certainly, we need to get that bill up. We need to have all three of those bills done before this week is out. 
   Another one is the foreign operations appropriations bill, a bill that has been masterfully put together by the members of the appropriations subcommittee in a bipartisan way, under the leadership of Senator MCCONNELL of Kentucky, a bill that probably could go through here on a voice vote. Yet it appears that these appropriations bills are going to be delayed or obstructed. 
   The one that is presently pending before the Senate, and has been here now for this being the third week, is the agriculture appropriations bill, a bill that is so important to our farmers in America and important to our consumers and to our children and to the poor people in this country. This bill does provide the farm programs, but it also has programs such as food stamps and school lunches and the Women, Infants, and Children Program. It is the one that determines whether or not in many instances the American people get access to the farm products from our farmers, who are the geniuses of the world in terms of production and what they have done in our lifetime to provide quality high protein food. They have done a magnificent job. 
   Right now, they have fallen on somewhat hard times. For the second year in a row now we will see a significant downturn in farm production in terms of money that comes to the farmers. This is being brought about by depressed prices, by the fact that we have not been opening up new markets, the fact that we have let countries block our farm products from China to Japan as well as Europe and get away with it. In the case of Europe, they are systematically ignoring WTO decisions with regard to bananas. Now we have the impending problem with beef. 
   So at a time when our markets are not being expanded and opened up, at a time when prices are depressed, farmers are looking for any sign of hope and encouragement. And yet here we are, for the third week, tangled up with an unrelated issue to agriculture. 
   This is not a small bill. This is $60.7 billion for agriculture in America. There is a strong feeling that there is probably going to be a need for additional disaster assistance. I saw where some States right now are looking at another serious drought. You add that on top of depressed prices, declining markets instead of growing markets, and now a drought on top of that, you have the prescription for a disaster. 
   So we may have to come back and take a look at that later on this year. But farmers need some encouragement right now. They need to know what they can depend on. 
   The schools need to know what they are going to be able to count on in the next school year that begins in August, by the way, not at the beginning of the next fiscal year. They need to know what they are going to be able to count on. 
   So we have had this delay because an agreement can't be reached as to how to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. Frankly, for 8 months I have been trying to find a way to do just that. I have offered repeated suggestions--the fairest one of all probably just to have a jump ball and say, OK, we will begin here and at a date certain, after a reasonable period of time, we will be through with it. But we tried all kinds of variations. 
   I read into the RECORD last week the complete unanimous consent agreement I had suggested on Thursday that would have allowed us to bring it up, would have had a reasonable time for  consideration, 2 hours on first-degree amendments, 2 hours on second-degree amendments. I don't know how I could be any fairer. That, too, was rejected. 
   So I have tried repeatedly to make this happen. Add to that that this is a charade. This is a farce. This is not for real. So not only are the farmers being taken advantage of, they are being played with. They are being laughed at. Every Senator knows, men and women, Republican, Democrat, regardless of region, no amendment that is added from the Patients' Bill of Rights to the agriculture appropriations bill will ever see the light of day. It will be sheared like wool from a sheep before it gets to the conference just the other side of the Rotunda. It will not happen--not the Feinstein amendment, not some other amendment, not the Kennedy alternative. It will not be a part of the agriculture appropriations bill and shouldn't be. It is still legislating on an appropriations bill. It is an unrelated, nongermane amendment that is being insisted on by, I think, really a few on the Democratic side of the aisle. 
   So this is a farce, ladies and gentlemen. We should no longer allow the people's business to be shunted aside and delayed and obstructed and held up by this kind of activity. We should treat it for what it is. It is a charade. It is a farce. But it is not a happy one. It is a sad one. 
   I encourage my colleagues today on both sides of the aisle, don't be a part of this. We should summarily dismiss as frivolous these amendments that are being added or offered to be added to this agriculture appropriations bill. Maybe they are substantive. Maybe some of them have merit. But to offer them here, who are we kidding? Nobody, nobody in this room. I think most Americans know this is not a serious effort. 
   Can we work out a way, an agreement to bring this up for a reasonable period of time and still get our work done in terms of the appropriations bills and other legislation that is pending, some of it in conference, some of it waiting to come before the Senate? The bankruptcy reform package is waiting for action. The flag burning constitutional amendment has been passed by the House of Representatives. Yet we are over here tangled up in a procedural activity. 
   I think we should not be a part of that. I am going to insist that we dismiss it and that we move on and get our work done. I really hope and reach out to the leadership on the other side of the aisle and say: Let's see if we can't find a 
   way to deal with this at another time in a way that is fair to all sides. Let's go on and pass these appropriations bills. Several of them that I have not even mentioned here today we could probably move through very quickly, in a limited period of time, with limited amendments, because there are just not going to be a lot of amendments offered, and do some of the other business, including the nominations that we all know should be at least given an opportunity to be considered. 
   I just wanted to lay that marker down and get that word firmly planted in our lexicon. This procedure is a farce. It will not happen. 
   And by the way, just to make sure I was on totally safe ground, it always behooves one to check with the appropriations chairman to make sure he agrees. He agrees. He obviously is offended and upset that his bills out of the Appropriations Committee are being delayed, and he agrees we should not have these legislative matters, these extraneous matters being used to delay very important appropriations bills so that we can get our work done. 
   By the way, the President is out there saying: Let's work together. Great, let's do. I am ready for deeds, not words. I want us to have Medicare reform, but the commission, the bipartisan commission's work was basically rejected. The President didn't allow one of his nominees of the commission to vote for it. Yet we had Democrats and Republicans who were for it. The Finance Committee, I believe, is willing to move forward in a constructive way. If he wants to work on some of these issues, we would certainly be glad to find the time to do it. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, again, I did offer the Kennedy health care bill to the agriculture appropriations bill. My thinking is that rather than doing this piecemeal, let's go ahead and deal with the overall Democrat bill dealing with the Patients' Bill of Rights. In order to make sure it is properly considered, I will advocate cloture and I will, in fact, vote for cloture. I think that way we can deal with this issue straight up, not playing around with it. 
   I emphasize again that this is a farce. I am treating it accordingly. When both sides really want to get serious about sitting down and working out a way to consider this bill separately as a legislative vehicle, I will be glad to do that. But it should not continue to tangle up the appropriations bills. I believe Senator DASCHLE and I really want to get some work done this week for the benefit of the country. I am convinced that he has that intent. By taking this action, I think we can still pass some appropriations bills this week and clear our calendar of a lot of nominations.

I am not asking for that right now, but I make that offer to our colleagues. We can vote on that cloture motion this afternoon if they wish, or we can do it tomorrow. But at some point, it will ripen, and we will then have a chance to vote on cloture. I suggest that we actually vote on it. 
   At this time, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, our effort with these cloture votes was to find a way to move the people's business forward. We had four cloture votes on four appropriations bills: one on the agriculture appropriations bill and three on motions to proceed to other bills--Commerce-Justice-State transportation, and foreign operations appropriations.  
   Obviously, these bills are ready to go. We should make every effort to consider those and/or other bills. I understand the District of Columbia appropriations bill is ready and perhaps Treasury-Postal Service. The Appropriations Committee is doing its work, and its work is stacking up now on our calendar. 
   The business before us is exactly how to proceed with the cloture motion filed on the Kennedy bill, which was offered as a second-degree amendment to the Feinstein amendment. I had suggested we would be willing to do it in the stacked sequence today, but I did not ask consent for that. We need to find some way to move forward on that cloture vote. 
   Rather than waiting until Wednesday, I want us to find a way to have that vote so we can move on to what is to be the outcome of that and whatever follows next.

They have been doing it for a number of years, and I think it is most appropriate that we begin to do the same thing in the Senate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I think it is important that I take a minute to sort of review the bidding as to what has been going on. There have been a number of discussions as to how to proceed  with the pending agriculture appropriations bill, as well as the two pending Patients' Bill of Rights proposals. Senator DASCHLE and I talked numerous times throughout the day. At one point, beginning on Tuesday night, we talked about trying to find a way to take the Patients' Bill of Rights issues up and deal with them on Wednesday and Thursday. We could not quite get that approved. 
   Then a proposal was made to go ahead and go forward with the appropriations bills and maybe some other legislative issues that could be cleared and to take up the Patients' Bill of Rights issue on Monday, July 12, when we come back from the recess, and spend until the close of business that week, Thursday, July 15, on the Patients' Bill of Rights issue. Originally, I was thinking it would just be sort of a jump ball; we would get started. We would go forward, no limits on amendments, no limits on time, but understanding everybody had to be fair with each other. 
   There should not be an attempt on this side to block a reasonable number of amendments. Neither should there be an attempt on the other side to say we have to have 18 or 26 or 35 or any requisite number of amendments but just do like we do legislative bills--we take them up and go forward. 
   Concerns developed on both sides of the aisle, and we modified that proposal two or three times. As of late last night, about 6, we were still exchanging ideas. So we do not have a finalized agreement. 
   I think progress has been made toward finding a way to complete action on the pending bill; that is, the underlying bill, the appropriations bill, as well as other important appropriation bills. We should be able to find a way to consider the Patients' Bill of Rights issue, because there is belief, I think on both sides, that there are some areas that need to be addressed. There are some rights that need to be protected. There should be some way to appeal decisions within HMOs. Once we make up our minds that we will get together and work through it, I think we will be able to do that. We can continue trying to negotiate, which I am always willing to do, or we can just go ahead and go forward and see what happens. 
   Keep in mind that this Patients' Bill of Rights issue, or pieces of it, would be on the agriculture appropriations bill, which is not the normal place we would want it. Also, I presume it won't be there when the appropriations bill comes back. So I do not quite understand why we would be doing it this way. 
   To enable us to negotiate, I will ask for a period of morning business, but I would like to discuss that momentarily with Senator DASCHLE and leadership on both sides. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate has a responsibility, obviously, to do the people's business. Up until a couple of days ago, we were doing pretty good this year. We had already moved four appropriations bills. We had taken up a number of important issues including the Y2K liability bill, the financial services modernization, the national missile defense bill, education. We were moving right along. But all of a sudden a couple of days ago that stopped. 
   Why is that? It is because the Democrats--Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, Senator FEINSTEIN, and others--want to offer an unrelated bill to agriculture appropriations. That bill is the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Going back to last fall, we have talked many times about finding a way to have that legislation considered, trying to come up with some timeframe that is fair to all. Consistently we have had requests for many amendments. I don't know, I think it started off with the Democrats saying they had to have 40 amendments. I believe at some point it got down to 20, although it is not clear to me they would even agree to limit it to 20. 
   On the other hand, we have argued we have a good Patients' Bill of Rights bill, one that was developed by a task force chaired by Senator NICKLES which included Senator COLLINS, Dr. BILL FRIST, Senator SANTORUM, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator ROTH. A really good group worked very hard to come up with a good bill, with some provisions for protections of patients' rights, with provisions for an appeals process when there is a disagreement with a decision within a managed care facility, both internally and externally. It is a good bill. We are prepared to vote on that. 
   The Democrats, on the other hand, have a bill of their own that takes a very different approach, and a big part of it is lawsuits will be the final arbiter on how these health decisions will be made. 
   We say if you have a good package, let's vote on yours. We will vote on ours. This week we, in effect, did that. We voted not to table our proposal, and we voted to table the underlying Kennedy amendment. 
   We have tried very hard to come up with a way for this to be considered without it becoming an obstruction to the people's business. 
   What is the people's business? The bill pending is the agriculture appropriations bill, $60.7 billion for the farmers in America. But it goes beyond just farmers. It also includes such programs as food stamps, women, infants, children, school breakfast, and lunch programs. It is a broad bill and an important bill. At a time when our farmers have lost markets and are having a tough time, we are tied up and delaying the agriculture appropriations bill with an unrelated measure. 
   In addition to that, we have ready for consideration the transportation appropriations bill, the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill, the foreign operations appropriations bill, and I believe in short order the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. 
   In addition to that, we have very important legislation such as the intelligence authorization bill we need to have considered, now that we have passed the defense authorization and appropriations bills. We have the very critical question of how are we going to deal with the nuclear espionage at our labs 
   around the country. We have an important proposal pending on that. We have several very important appropriations bills that we need to move. They are the people's business. 
   The point is, we want to have our other measure considered. We have gone back and forth. Senator DASCHLE and I have worked through the last 36 hours or so. We have gone back and forth with alternative suggestions. We started out 2 nights ago saying maybe we can do it this Wednesday and Thursday and be through with it Thursday night. That did not get very far. 
   Then we said, how about if we take it up July 12 when we come back from the recess and we will spend that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and by the close of business on Thursday we will have completed this debate. 
   Maybe some people say that is not enough time. That is a pretty long period of time for debate on a legislative measure, and it is a long period of time when you take into consideration the other work that we really must do for the people in passing appropriations bills, in complying with the budget resolution, and the reconciliation bill to allow us to return some of the tax overpayment to the working people of this country. That is a long period of time in the middle of the summer when our focus really needs to be on considering the appropriations bills that provide what the people in this country need from their Government, if you are convinced these appropriations bills do that. 
   We talk about agriculture and transportation. You can certainly argue that. Foreign operations, here is a time when we have very delicate relations around the world. We just passed the State Department authorization bill after about 3 years of trying. It seems now we need to provide the funds that go along with that. So we went back and forth. 
   I want to read the latest iteration as of 6:30 last night, June 23, of what we  offered to try to get this matter considered by itself and in a reasonable period of time. Apparently, for a variety of reasons, we have not been able to get this agreed to or worked out:  
   I ask unanimous consent----  
   I am not asking this, I am just reading the consent request because it is obvious there would be objection to it----  
   that the text of amendment No. 703, as modified, or 702-- 
   That would be either the Kennedy version or the Republican version--  
   be introduced by the majority leader, or his designee, and become the pending business at 1 p.m. on Monday, July 12, 1999, with a vote occurring on final passage at the close of business Thursday, July 15, and the bill be subject to the following agreement: That all amendments in order to the bill be relevant to the subject of amendment No. 703 or 702 or health care tax cuts, and all first-degree amendments be offered in an alternating fashion, and all first and second-degree amendments be limited to 2 hours each to be equally divided in the usual form.  
   Two hours for the first-degree amendment; 2 hours for the second-degree amendment. I don't know quite what that adds up to over a period of a week, but a lot of amendments could be considered under that period of time. I think 2 hours is a reasonable period of time when you take into consideration the significance of some of the issues that would be debated. In some instances it would not take 2 hours; it might not take 30 minutes. 
   I assume that somebody is going to offer an amendment both sides will like, and we will say: Yes, we'll take that. So it would not take that long.  
   I further ask consent that second degree amendments be limited to 1 second degree amendment per side, with no motions to commit or recommit in order, or any other act with regard to the amendments in order, and that just prior to third reading of the bill, it be in order for the majority leader, or his designee, to offer a final amendment, with no second degree amendments in order. 
   I further ask consent that following passage of the bill, that should the bill, upon passage, contain any revenue blue slip matter that the bill remain at the desk and that when the Senate receives the House companion bill, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the Senate passed bill be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill as amended be passed, [and] the Senate insist on its amendment.......  
   Very simply, that is to avoid the blue slip problem with the House of Representatives of a measure we pass that has revenue in it and to make sure this matter does not just die aborning here.  
   I further ask consent that no other amendments relative to the Patients' Bill of Rights be in order, for the remainder of the first session of the 106th Congress. 
   Once again, let's have the debate, have the amendments. Let's have a vote--win or lose, whichever side. Then you move on. 
   I further ask consent that at any time on Thursday, July 15, it be in order for the Majority Leader, if he deems necessary, to offer a comprehensive amendment containing several provisions, that the amendments/titles therein be considered en bloc and a vote occur on or in relation to that amendment, with no second degree amendments in order, prior to 3rd reading and the offering of the last amendment by the Majority Leader.  
   That is traditionally the way it has happened. The majority leader--the majority gets to offer the last amendment or substitute, for that matter.  
   Finally, [we] announce ..... the two Leaders [will work together to agree] to pass three to five of the remaining appropriations bills available, prior to the July 4th Recess.  
   And we listed the appropriations bills. 
   I wanted to make sure everybody knew that--both the Democrats and Republicans, and members of the media, and our constituency--because I think it is a fair proposal. Basically, it is 4 days on this subject, with designated periods of time, with an end date involved--Thursday, July 15. 
   Amendments could be offered. I do not know how many that would provide for, but I presume as many as 16, maybe more, depending on how long it takes on some of them and how much time would be yielded back. 
   Let me just say, there is not 100-percent agreement on our side of the aisle that we should do this. But at some point you have to come to an agreement of how you proceed and how you get an issue considered, how you get it voted on. This seemed fair to me. 
   Frankly, I do not even like the idea of putting time limits on these amendments. I think we ought to have a jump ball, call it up on Monday, the 12th, and offer amendments. Let's debate them and vote and, when we get to the 15th and have final passage. But there was a feeling, to some degree on both sides, that we ought to have some time limit specified in that agreement. 
   I think we are dealing here with sort of a Molotov minuet. Everything we have tried to do, we are being met with: No. Nyet. We can't do that. No. We can't do something else. 
   I began to wonder, do we want to address this issue or do we just want the issue? I have been through that before. 
   I can remember we had the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill a few years ago--3 years ago--and as long as everybody was all dug in and saying, we are not going to consider that, we are not going to do this and not going to do that, nothing happened. Once we finally said, we are going to do it, we did it and moved on. 
   I think that is what we ought to do--move on here, have a focused debate, have some amendments, vote on them, and be done with it. 
   Where are we at this particular time? 
   We do have pending, I guess, an amendment by the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, that she feels very strongly about. I would like to get a time agreement on that amendment and have it considered and vote on it and move on. 
   We have a Frist second-degree amendment by Senator FRIST 
   from Tennessee that will be offered. 
   But I also should make this point: All of this is legislating on appropriations bills. All of that is possible under the rules because of a ruling that occurred a few years ago which allows this sort of legislating on appropriations bills. I have been heckled in the past: ``We ought to change that,'' on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. And I think we should. 
   People on both sides of the aisle might say: Wait a minute, that is the only way I can get my legislation considered. Look, that is why we have authorization bills. We--both sides--abuse this. We ought to stop it. That is what contributes to the difficulty we have in passing appropriations bills now every year, because we are busy legislating things on appropriations bills that we might not be able to get through a committee or might not be able to get on an authorization bill. 
   Somebody said: Well, how would we do it? A novel idea: Go back and do it the way we always did it, on authorization bills, not on appropriations bills. I think you could argue back and forth whether that benefits the majority or the minority. I do not think we ought to get into that on something such as this. It is the right thing to do in eliminating this procedure. We should not be having legislation, a whole bill, put on the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   So that is sort of where we are. 
   I propose we go forward and try to get some indication of where the votes are, have some debate on the point of order or legislation on appropriations bills, have the debate on the Feinstein amendment, have some debate on the Frist amendment, and then let's have some votes and see where we are. But I think we need to make up our minds: Are we just going to say no or are we going to move forward? 
   We could still do a lot of work next week that would be in the people's interests. Last week we passed six bills and made a big start on State Department authorization. We can do that next week. We could go out next week having passed three or four appropriations bills, perhaps the intelligence authorization bill, and several nominations. 
   We are now beginning to have some nominations come on to the calendar out of the Commerce Committee and out of the Judiciary Committee and out of the Foreign Relations Committee. In fact, I saw we had about 8 or 10 that came on last night, and more have come on. We could wind up with a burst of activity that would serve the Senate well. It would serve the American people well. 
   Quite frankly, Senator DASCHLE and I like to do that, because we agreed a long time ago, when you do your work, everybody wins, but when you dig in and just find ways to continue the Molotov minuet and say no, everybody loses. 
   So I think we ought to move forward. I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to consider how we can get this done. Let's get this agreement  worked out, and let's move on with these very important appropriations bills. 
   Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. I will yield briefly to the Senator from Idaho, who did a lot of work on this sort of issue when he was in the House, and he believes very strongly we should not be legislating on an appropriations bill. He was not here when we made this mistake. He is right, I think, that we should find a way to fix it. 
   By the way, we are going to have a vote on this issue this summer. I am going to find that sooner or later an amendment will come up in a way that I am going to appeal the ruling of the Chair, and we are going to fix this problem, or at least we are going to vote on it. I believe when we get a vote, it will actually pass. I hope some Democrats will vote for it. I think we changed the rule XVI inadvertently without actually understanding the impact of what we were doing. It has been sitting there for 4 or 5 years, and I think it is time that we do something about it. Would the Senator from Idaho like to comment on that?

   Mr. LOTT. Today the Senate will resume consideration of the State Department authorization bill under a previous order. A cloture vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 975, the steel import limitation bill, will take place at 12:15, with 40 minutes of debate on the motion prior to the vote. 
   Following that vote, the Senate will stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. so the weekly party caucuses can meet. It is our intention to complete action on the State Department reauthorization bill during today's session of the Senate and to resume consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I thought we had reached an agreement as to exactly how to complete the State Department authorization bill late yesterday afternoon, but because of the absence of some Senators who needed to be consulted, we were not able to lock in the procedure and the time for completing that action. I hope we can complete it this morning and have a vote or votes on or in relation to the State Department authorization bill after the party caucuses at 2:15. When we go back to the agriculture appropriations bill, we would expect a number of votes this afternoon. 
   Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership has chosen to confuse the issue and delay action on the agriculture appropriations bill by offering the Patients' Bill of Rights to this very important bill. We could work out an agreement otherwise, if they would be reasonable as to how we might consider that issue. But for now it is pending to the agriculture appropriations bill, and I would expect there would be a couple of votes on or in relation to that issue also.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at the request of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, and others, we are going to have this vote today. They made the point this was an important issue to them. They thought there should be some discussion about it and asked for an opportunity to have some debate and a vote. Little did I know at the time it was going to be a weekly event. 
   Last week it was the revolving fund loan for steel. This week it is the quota bill. Next week it will be something else. In fact, the Finance Committee has reported out something, and it is probably, of the three options, the only one we should be considering. But do not fool yourselves; this is not an inconsequential vote. Don't be saying we can vote for this on the motion to proceed and then we can vote against it later on. In order to go forward, the proponents have to get 60 votes today but only 51 tomorrow. 
   So I urge my colleagues, do not say, I'll give them a procedural vote. What you may be giving them is something that would be very dangerous, because we then could be voting on the substance itself. I think the consequences of such a vote that would befall America's economy and our trade policy would be dire, indeed. Not only would it increase the burden on our consumers, it would also run counter to our international trade agreements, and it would adversely affect our businesses and farmers that depend upon access to these international markets. There is no question this bill would undercut the economic growth we enjoy today. It would be starting down an extremely dangerous path. 
   We all struggle with similar issues in our own States in one area or another--perhaps agriculture here, textiles there, something else elsewhere. But free trade has been proven, time and time again, to benefit America, to benefit American consumers. It is the right thing to do, and we should not start down the trail of passing quotas here, there, or somewhere else. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote against cloture. 
   I yield the floor.

As the Senate moves toward consideration of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000, I want to note the significant efforts being made by the Government of Bolivia in its counternarcotics program. Since taking office in August, 1997, the government of Hugo Banzer has reduced Bolivia's cocaine production potential by a remarkable 40 percent. This is historic progress, which I hope will be emulated by other nations in the region. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a letter I received from the Vice President of Bolivia, Mr. Jorge Quiroga Ramirez, which discusses the Bolivian Government's plans and seeks continued American assistance in its counternarcotics efforts.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will convene at 9:30 a.m. and immediately resume consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill.

All Senators can, therefore, expect rollcall votes throughout the session tomorrow as the Senate makes further progress on the agriculture appropriations bill. Once that is completed, of course, other issues may be considered, but we could consult with both sides of the aisle before we move to the next bill.

   Mr. LOTT. The Finance Committee did report it out today. I did vote, along with everybody else, for the nomination. It will be on the calendar tomorrow. 
   I had indicated I assumed that before we went out for the Fourth of July recess, which is a week from Friday, that would be taken up. It very well could be taken up before then. But we have not gotten it on the calendar, and we have not made a definite determination as to when we will call it up. 
   I assume other nominations will be on the calendar tomorrow from other committees, and I hope we have the same approach as we have had this year--including three nominations last week--to move these nominations through pretty quickly after reaching the calendar, barring complications that do sometimes come up, of course.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I find our Democratic colleagues have put the Senate in an unfortunate position by offering this bill at this time. The pending bill is the agriculture appropriations bill, certainly a very important appropriations bill. I think you could probably argue they all are. But even more so than usual, the agriculture appropriations bill this year is very significant because we are still dealing with an agriculture economy that has been shaken by prices and by the loss of some markets around the world. We need to move this bill forward. 
   American farmers are in dire need of many of the provisions in this bill that has been developed in a bipartisan way, with Chairman COCHRAN leading the way. These farmers rely on the legislation and appropriations every year. For some reason, the Democrats have decided to ignore the needs of the American farmer and instead turn this bill into the health care reform bill. 
   I have in the past, and as recently as last Friday, offered our colleagues on the other side of the aisle an opportunity to debate this issue in the form of a separate bill under a time agreement. However, they have always indicated a request for dozens and dozens of amendments. In fact, the latest discussion, sort of indirectly, but the latest number would call for a minimum of 40 amendments. 
   Now, I thought they had a bill that basically represented the position they wanted to take on the Patients' Bill of Rights, as developed by Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE. We have our approach, which is quite different, developed by Senator NICKLES, the Senator in the Chair, Ms. COLLINS, Senator FRIST, who certainly is one who could be very helpful in devising health-related legislation. So we have our two alternative bills, which I thought we could get a direct vote on and have some reasonable number of amendments and then go on to a final conclusion. 
   However, it seems to me that colleagues on the other side of the aisle are interested in having an issue rather than bringing this Patients' Bill of Rights issue to a conclusion. 
   I think clearly there are some things we need to do in this area. I assume there are some areas of agreement. There are some fundamental disagreements. For instance, I believe very strongly, in dealing with patients' rights and needs, where there is a dispute, there should be a process for resolving that dispute within a managed care organization or through an expedited outside procedure to get a result and not just look for more opportunities to file more lawsuits. 
   However, I will continue, as I did last year, to work with the Democratic leader to propound a time agreement which will allow for votes on these important issues, the two approaches, as well as a reasonable number of amendments. 
   In the meantime, I call for regular order with respect to the State Department authorization bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe we will be waiting for the managers of the State Department authorization bill to come back to the floor. We had a time agreement on the State Department authorization, and we had hoped to complete that bill last Friday, but for a variety of reasons we weren't able to do so. We did get a list of amendments. I believe we have some pretty tight time agreements on those amendments. 
   We need to move forward with getting to a conclusion early this week on final passage of the State Department authorization. That will be helpful in dealing with other issues pending before the Foreign Relations Committee, including possibly some nominations that have been pending there, because of the very serious nature and the need to get the State Department reauthorization done. So we will go back to that and the managers will be coming to the floor shortly, I am sure, and then we will have a vote, as agreed to, at 5:30 this afternoon on the pending Sarbanes amendment. With that, I am glad to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. LOTT. That is correct, but it is temporary. We basically now are dealing with three different issues--the  State Department authorization, which began last Friday, the agriculture appropriations bill, and the managers of that appropriations bill were able to get, I believe, a couple hours of time on that, and now the Patients' Bill of Rights issue. We will go back to the State Department authorization and, hopefully, we can complete that, and then all of the interested Senators who would like to be heard in a reasonable period of time on the Patients' Bill of Rights, we will work that out for tomorrow. Senators NICKLES, COLLINS, FRIST, SANTORUM, and others will probably want to be heard on that, and I know a number of Senators on your side. We want to work with Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE to see how we set that up.

I know there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to speak about this issue and want to talk about the alternative proposals. We will line up a time to do that. I can't say right now, without talking to the managers of the two other bills and with Senator DASCHLE, exactly when that will be or how long it will be. We will work that out this afternoon or tomorrow morning.

   Mr. LOTT. Regarding the juvenile justice bill, you will recall I made a commitment we would bring that up and debate and amendments would not be shut off. But it was with some assurances that we would finish it by Thursday night of the week it came up--I think on Monday. As a matter of fact, it was the following week before we were able to finish it. That is why I think we need to get some clear understanding of exactly what time would be involved and when the votes would occur. I will make sure we get that clarified before we go forward.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I may respond. Frankly, I was surprised that this Patients' Bill of Rights amendment was offered to this bill. All that had been indicated was that it would be offered this week if some agreement was not worked out. 
   First of all, I want to make it clear that I am willing and very anxious to make a reasonable agreement. No. 2, this is not the only bill that was going to be up this week. There would have been--or there will be other opportunities. That is what surprised me, the fact that the agriculture appropriations bill was the bill to which the Patients' Bill of Rights issue was added. That was a surprise because I thought there would be a real strong feeling that we should move forward on the agriculture appropriations bill without it being delayed or deferred or impacted by other issues. That does not diminish at all the importance of patients' rights, but I thought there would have been another bill or another way that it could have been offered. So I, frankly, was surprised--I am not saying it was sort of a surprise attack; I don't mean that at all. I am just surprised the decision was made to offer it to the agriculture appropriations bill when we could have offered it or it could have been offered by others on other bills this week.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could reclaim my time, I am glad to try to enter an agreement as to how this issue would be handled. We are ready to go. But the comment about gatekeeper--we have a lot of important work to do here. Agriculture, obviously, is a very important issue, and State Department authorization is very important, and intelligence authorization is very important. We have appropriations bills we need to move through. We have a limited amount of time in which to do that. We have this week and next week before the Fourth of July recess. Therefore, there must be some reasonable understanding, some reasonable agreement about how much time or what amendments will be offered. We do that all the time. Every Senator knows we enter into agreements to limit amendments or limit time. If we can get that worked out, then we will go forward. The alternative is that we can have debate on this tomorrow, and we can have a couple of votes and sort of see where we are and then decide how to proceed after that. 
   But I believe we have broad support outside of this Chamber and in the Senate for the alternative that we have. Great work has been done by Dr. FRIST and Senator COLLINS and Senator JEFFORDS, a broad group within our conference working with Senators from all regions of the country who understand this problem. We are ready to do it. As soon as you can decide you are ready to have a vote on the merits of the two packages pending, with a reasonable number of amendments, we will do that. 
   We are going to have to get some order as to how that is done, and we will do that or we will just vote on the packages as they are and let that happen. I think we can keep wrangling back and forth. I invite others to join in the opportunity to discuss exactly the substance of the two bills and also how we will handle them. 
   I see the chairman is here, and Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania is here, and others. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly wish the Senator from Alaska a wonderful trip. I know how important his family is to him. I also want to thank him for his magnanimous decision not to object to the stacked votes. I know it is important to him to be here and participate in recorded votes. I also know his family is very important and Father's Day is very important. He could have objected, but he decided not to. I hope other Senators will follow that example. I try very hard to accommodate every Senator on both sides of the aisle. 
   I fear that the problem in the Senate now is that I have been too accommodating, because we try to work votes around every Senator's schedule, and it is absolutely out of control. I have Senators come in here and say: Oh, please, please, please, don't have another vote after 9:30 on Friday. And other Senators say: You mean we are going to vote Monday afternoon? 
   I realize voting is a problem, but it is required to move bills along. So I ask my colleagues to not get mad at me for trying to get our work done. 
   This week has been unusually productive. With this bill, if we could have finished it today, we would have completed seven bills this week. Senator REID and Senator DASCHLE share my frustration at what we go through. You would not believe the kinds of requests we get from Senators not to have votes during the middle of the day on Tuesday, or in the morning on Wednesday, or on Thursday afternoon. My colleagues, it is just 
   out of control. 
   We try to say on Mondays or Fridays, for good and valid reasons, we will not have votes on occasion. We try to tell Members in advance. Because of a number of problems, we have notified both sides of the aisle that there won't be votes next Friday, the 25th. But there is a limit as to how much we can do. I was always used to working Monday through Friday. I realize that when we go home, we are still working. When we tell Senators we are not going to have votes before 5 on Monday or after 12 on Friday, we still have difficulty. 
   I thank Senator MURKOWSKI for his attitude. I must say to all the Senators that we just have to be prepared to be here and vote. 
   Here is another thing. Senators have now gotten to where, when there is a death in the family, they don't even want to miss a vote. That is a terrible and difficult time, but your constituents will understand. You can't ask 99 Senators not to have a recorded vote because you have had a death in the family. Sometimes it is an in-law. People understand if you can't be here. Meanwhile, back in the jungle, we have to get our work done. So I ask for your indulgence. 
   I yield to Senator MURKOWSKI.

   Mr. LOTT. I must say, if I may respond, it was our intent to have more votes, but obstructionists can quite often prevail in the Senate. If somebody objects, it is pretty hard to force a vote. On Monday, I could call up Executive Calendar items. I can force votes, but I prefer not to do that. I have never liked the so-called ``bed check'' votes. I try to have votes on substance. That is the problem. Today, we had a blowup here at 9:45, and all kinds of efforts to be reasonable and get agreements came apart. I believe maybe by 11 o'clock, if enough people are gone, we can get this thing worked out.

   Mr. LOTT. I will use leader time to respond briefly. I thank Senator REID for his comments. I note the fact he was willing to work with us. We had the resolution worked out over a period of several days, commending our troops and commending the President and others for their work in Kosovo. That could have been difficult, could have caused amendments, and there could have been requests for recorded votes. 
   That was one of several things we have done this week. I note the Senator from Nevada in his new role as the whip on the Democratic side has really made a difference. We appreciate his cooperation. Quite often, it takes a lot of time to work through the pending amendments. He has been very helpful. 
   I am glad we had a good week. I am hoping every week will be similar to this week. I will keep working in that effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   I join in that exchange of compliments to each Senator. I commend the chairman of the committee and the ranking member on the Democratic side, Senator BIDEN. Senator HELMS, you have done a great job. I know you have put a lot of time and energy into this particular bill, and we would not be here without your persistence and without the cooperation of Senator BIDEN. 
   It is an important bill. When you showed up in my office a week or so ago and said we are ready to go, we need to do this, I was determined we would find a place to do it. I think you have now worked through an agreement that will allow us to get it completed and final passage, hopefully, Monday afternoon. I would like to enter into this unanimous consent request and thank both of you for the outstanding work that you are doing. 
   I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the State Department authorization bill, all amendments must be filed by 11:45 today, with the exception of the managers' amendment and any second-degree amendments. 
   I further ask that any votes ordered with respect to amendments be stacked at a time to be determined by the majority leader and the Democratic leader, and the following amendments limited to the following times, to be equally divided in the usual form.

   I do not think cloture should be invoked. I do not think this bill should pass. I think it would be a very large mistake if we pass it. I want to make that clear. 
   I am not in any way supporting it. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think about this vote very carefully. We have already had one steel-related issue passed by the Senate. If we start down the trail of imposing quotas, I think it will not be well received in the financial markets, and it is going in a different direction from what we have been trying to do. I want to make sure the record is clear from the beginning. 
   With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, 1 year ago the distinguished minority leader, Mr. DASCHLE, and I introduced S. 2180, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, to overcome the unintended consequences of Superfund which continue to have major negative impacts on recycling. There is widespread recognition of the need for relief in this area, as evidenced by the number of Superfund bills that have been introduced since the 103d Congress, as well as the measures being considered in this Congress, all of which include nearly identical recycling relief provisions. 
   I am grateful for the decision by Senators CHAFEE and SMITH to include a strong recycling provision in their Superfund reform bill currently pending before the Environment and Public Works Committee. This inclusion was an important contributing reason to my decision to be an original cosponsor of the Superfund Program Completion Act of 1999 (S. 1090). As the committee approaches a markup of its legislation, I understand that the committee chairman and subcommittee chairman are negotiating with their minority counterparts and the Environmental Protection Agency in an effort to reach a bipartisan consensus. In the spirit of the last year's Superfund Recycling Equity Act, which collected 63 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, I endorse such an approach and look forward to debating the bill on the Senate floor. 
   Today, I am pleased to join the minority leader in bringing to the attention of the Senate the need to move expeditiously in this regard, recognizing that another year has passed without needed relief for recyclers.

   Mr. LOTT. I have worked for years with my colleagues to reform Superfund. We must put this important program back on track to get the environment cleaned up effectively and efficiently, with polluters paying the bills, not innocent parties. There was clear tangible evidence of how Superfund is off track in a recent GAO report which was requested by House Commerce Committee Chairman BLILEY. The GAO report revealed that a majority of the funds go for activities other than clean up, and this is clearly wrong. I hope the Senate will act soon because America deserves a viable Superfund program. 
   While there are different bills being considered in the Senate at this time, both the minority leader and I stand committed to Superfund relief for recyclables and we assure all Senators that the differences between the bills in their recycling language will be addressed in the interest of moving forward with this needed legislation. With the bipartisan support of this needed relief in place, Mr. President, it is essential to stress that relief for recycling, an issue of fundamental fairness, must be accomplished in this session.

I again thank all supporters of this provision, especially the distinguished minority leader for supporting this attempt to restore equity and fairness where it has long been missing.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I'd like to pay a special tribute today to General Charles C. Krulak, the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, soon to relinquish command of our nation's Corps of Marines after almost forty years in uniform. With receipt of his final orders, directing him to stand-down and retire from active duty, an evolutionary change will occur--marking the first time in 70 years that a Krulak will be absent from the rolls of the United States Marine Corps. His father, Lieutenant General Brute Krulak, served as the Commanding General, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific. 
   From the blood stained rice fields of Vietnam, where General Krulak commanded Marines during two tours of duty, to the wind swept sands of Kuwait where General Krulak lead his men to victory, this Marine has distinguished himself time and time again.  
   For his devoted service to our country and for the brave Marines he led, General Krulak was awarded the Silver Star Medal; Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'' and two gold stars; Purple Heart with gold star; Combat Action Ribbon; and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. 
   While General Krulak's inspirational leadership has always characterized his military service, it is his tenure as the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps that will resonate long and far into the next millennium, ensuring the Marine Corps remains the world's premier crisis response force--the Nation's 911 force. A professional force that is committed, capable, and reliable to meet any challenge, under any circumstance, anytime and anyplace in the world. 
   General Krulak had the wisdom and foresight to field an agile and adaptable force--a Corps of Marines who could prevail against the multifaceted threats which would challenge our Nation's security and its interests. General Krulak understood the importance of developing new concepts and techniques that would ensure decisive victory in the ``savage wars of peace.'' He forged his Corps of Marines through unrelenting sacrifice, initiative, and courage. 
   His many initiatives as Commandant include, the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, the DoD lead in nonlethal weapons technology and the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force. He created and implemented the ``Transformation Process'' of making Marines--a holistic approach to recruiting and developing young men and women to ensure they have the skills and basic character needed to effectively meet the asymmetric 21st century threat. 
   Today, the Corps is meeting its recruiting requirements, forty-eight months consecutively and achieved its retention goals --a testimony to the wisdom and foresight of General Krulak. 
   A key contributor to the Marine Corps family and a person General Krulak owes much success to is his wife, Zandi Krulak. She gave dignity and grace to the maturation of the Marine Corps family. 
   In closing I want to recognize General Krulak for his uncompromising integrity to always do the right thing, for the Nation and his beloved Corps. The Marine Corps is a better institution today then it was four years ago, thanks to the sacrifice and devotion to duty by General Krulak. He has made a significant and lasting contribution to the Corps and to this Nation's security. Through his stewardship there is a renewed sense of esprit de corps. 
   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to wish General Krulak, his wife Zandi and their two sons, David and Todd, fair winds and following seas as he steps down as the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps. General Krulak's distinguished and faithful service to our country is greatly appreciated. He will be sorely missed, but surely not forgotten. Once a Marine, Always a Marine. Semper Fi.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know a number of Senators are going to want to join me in paying tribute to a great Marine, the Commandant, General Krulak. I hope that others will come to the floor this afternoon, or on Monday, and join me in expressing our appreciation for the work he has done. 
   Mr. President, Marines do it all--in the air, on the land, and on the sea. With a service like the Marine Corps, sometimes people come in and say: Well, can't they go ahead and just be in charge of it all? I certainly understand that when you get to know an outstanding man like General Krulak. It is especially true when you consider that the Nation's Marines have a tremendous record of pride and history and going out and doing the job when it is the toughest. Their attitude has been exemplified by this feisty, pull-no-punches Commandant. I have really appreciated the fact that when I met with him privately and asked him direct questions, he gave me direct answers. I have appreciated the fact that when he has been before committees of Congress--particularly the Armed Services Committee--he responded in a way he thought was best for our country, as to what the marines really needed, and not necessarily what he was expected to say or even told to say. That is typical of the Marines and typical of this General and his family. 
   So I want to pay special tribute to General Charles C. Krulak, the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, soon to relinquish command of our Nation's Corps of Marines after almost 40 years in uniform. General Krulak's retirement will mark the first time in 70 years that a Krulak will be absent from the rolls of the United States Marine Corps. His father, Lieutenant General Brute Krulak, served as a Commanding General, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific. 
   General Krulak's illustrious career is replete with achievements from the blood-stained rice fields of Vietnam, where he commanded Marines during two tours of duty, to the wind-swept sands of Kuwait, where he commanded Marines during the Gulf War. 
   For his devoted service to our country and for the brave Marines he led, General Krulak was awarded the Silver Star Medal; Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'' and two gold stars; Purple Heart with gold star; Combat Action Ribbon; and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. 
   During his tenure as the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Senate has come to know of many of the virtues of this modern-day warrior. His accomplishments will resonate long into the next millennium, ensuring that the Marine Corps remains the world's premier crisis response force. 
   I remember that during a 1996 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the posture of our military, the service chiefs were asked what they needed most. The other service chiefs rattled off some new weapons systems. Not Chuck Krulak. The Senate always relied on his frank and honest opinion, no matter the issue. He wanted Gore-Tex cold weather gear and boots for his troops. General Krulak has always placed his Marines first. That is why he is loved as Commandant. The people came first; the men and women of the Marine Corps came first. 
   General Krulak is a visionary, a person who clearly understands the situation at hand. He understood the importance of developing new concepts and techniques that would ensure decisive victory in the ``savage wars of peace.'' He forged his Corps of Marines through unrelenting sacrifice, initiative, and courage. 
   His foresight resulted in the creation of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, taking the DOD lead in nonlethal weapons technology and the creation of the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force. He created and implemented the ``Transformation Process'' of making Marines--a holistic approach to recruiting and developing young men and women to ensure they have the skills and basic character needed to effectively meet the Asymmetric 21st 
   century threat. He labored to institutionalize the Marine Corps core values of honor, courage and commitment, while maintaining, and in many cases elevating, performance standards in every aspect of the Marine Corps recruiting and development processes, be they mental, physical, or moral. 
   Today, the Corps has met its recruiting requirements forty-eight months consecutively and has achieved its retention goals--a testimony to the wisdom and foresight of General Krulak. 
   General Krulak not only pursued better Marines and asked for Marines to be capable of winning our Nation's future battles, but he also made better Americans. He promoted a focus on character development and high ethical and moral standards. He stressed the core values of honor, courage, and commitment, which exemplify the Corps. They are attributes that will serve the Marines well long after they have hung up their uniforms. In a way, I don't think Marines ever hang up their uniforms; they wear them the rest of their lives. 
   I remember, years ago, I had on my staff a man that worked on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Cecil Dubuisson, a Sergeant Major. A Sergeant Major in the Marine Corps is really super-special. As we traveled around South Mississippi into Louisiana, I would run into people--young men and older men--and they always recognized him as ``Sergeant Major.'' There was a special bond between these men that the rest of us could only hope to achieve. 
   In closing, I want to recognize General Krulak for his uncompromising integrity to always do the right thing for the Nation and his beloved Corps, and for his unwavering conviction that exemplifies a way of life, not just a motto. It speaks powerfully to the citizens he serves. It has been my good fortune, and the Senate's good fortune, to witness the resolve of a person who believes so strongly about the institution in which he serves. General Krulak, the Marine Corps is a better institution today than it was 4 years ago. 
   Your sacrifice and devotion to duty have made it so. You have provided a significant and lasting contribution to your Corps and to the Nation's security. Through your leadership, there is a renewed sense of esprit de corps. Those who follow your example will be a testament to the legacy you leave behind. 
   I wish General Krulak, your wonderful wife Zandi, and your two sons, David and Todd, ``fair winds and following seas'' as you step down as the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps on June 30, 1999. Your distinguished and faithful service to our country is greatly appreciated. You will be sorely missed but surely not forgotten. 
   Thank God for the Marines Corps, thank God for General Krulak.

   Mr. LOTT. I encourage Senators who are working on amendments to come to the floor. I know of two or three amendments that are being prepared. Perhaps one of them could go ahead and be offered. There is at least one that would be pretty simple. It would be to strike the emergency provisions. So it doesn't take a lot of preparation. We could go ahead and continue to make progress. 
   We need to finish this bill today. If we do not get our work done during the daylight hours, we will be here tonight. That is OK, if we have to do it, but if it is not necessary, it would be preferable we work during the day. I know the Senate likes to return to its nocturnal habits, but I hope that will not be the case. If there are two or three or four good amendments to be offered, let's bring them out on the floor. Let's have an hour debate, and let's vote. Then let's get to final passage on this issue. 
   I am glad that Senator SESSIONS is here and Senator DOMENICI. I know we  all need to get a bite to eat. If we could keep this moving along, I think it would save us some time tonight. I thank our colleagues for their cooperation. 
   I will go and make a call to Senators that I know have amendments. I urge them to come on out and have the amendments offered, and then we could make some progress. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for their work in the handling of this legislation today. They made a lot of progress. We will vote on final passage first thing in the morning. 
   A number of Senators have asked about the plan for tomorrow. We do take up the State Department authorization bill after we have final passage of this piece of legislation. There may be a necessary vote or two on amendments, but they will occur, hopefully, as early in the morning as possible, but none later than 11:45. So any of you who have plans to leave at 11:45 or 12 noon, whatever, you will be able to do that. 
   As usual, we announced we would have a vote or votes on this Friday, but the votes will not occur beyond 12 noon. I hope it will be earlier than that. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will begin now 10 minutes of debate on S. 1205, the military appropriations construction bill, followed by 20 minutes of debate on S. 331, the work incentives legislation. Votes on passage of those two bills will begin at approximately 10:45. Following those votes, the Senate will begin debate on the motion to invoke cloture on the House-passed Social Security lockbox legislation for 1 hour, with that vote to begin after all time has expired or been yielded back. 
   It is expected that the Senate will complete the energy and water appropriations bill during today's session of the Senate as well as resume consideration of H.R. 1664 regarding the steel, oil, and gas revolving loan. 
   I presume the vote on the Social Security lockbox legislation will occur around 12:30 or so. So we have two votes then, at approximately 10:45 and another one at 12:30, and then we probably will have at least one more, maybe two, with regard to the energy and water appropriations bill, and then we will go back to the oil and gas revolving fund. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under leader time to conclude the debate. I realize we had notified Members we would be having a vote around 12:30, so I will not use the full 10 minutes. I will just use a portion of it. 
   I want to begin by commending and thanking Senator ABRAHAM and Senator DOMENICI for their leadership in this area. As always, Senator DOMENICI pays very close attention to how we proceed on the budget and what happens with the people's money. He is a very good custodian of the people's money, and he has provided real leadership in this area; and Senator ABRAHAM has been persistent. 
   What we are trying to do is very simple. It doesn't need a lot of explanation. We have the good fortune after many years of having not only a balanced budget but having a surplus. But an important factor is that the surplus is caused or provided by the FICA tax. It is Social Security revenue that comes in that gives us this surplus. The question is, What are we going to do with it? 
   There are a lot of really innovative, thoughtful Members in this and the other body who will surely come up with a variety of ways and say, well, this is an emergency, or that is an emergency, or we need to add more money here, or we need a tax cut somewhere else. Social Security taxes should go for Social Security, and only for Social Security--not for any other brilliant idea we may have. We need some way to lock that in. 
   I have talked to young people about this. I talked to my mother. Bless her heart. She is 86 years of age and is living in an assisted care facility, and is very dependent on Social Security. I have talked to people from Montana to Pennsylvania, and Missouri. It is overwhelming. People say: You mean, it doesn't already exist this way? You mean that money has been being used or could be used for somebody else? The answer is, it can be, unless we have some procedure, some way to put it in a lockbox. 
   Senator DOMENICI and Senator ABRAHAM had a tighter lockbox, one that would really be hard to get out of, and it would include the President in the lockbox. We ought to do it that way. But the Senate has indicated three times it does not want to do that. The House has passed overwhelmingly--I think with 415 votes, bipartisan votes--this procedure, this procedure that would allow or require a super vote of 60 votes in the Senate to use these funds for anything else. 
   That is all we are trying to do--just say that Social Security tax money should go for Social Security; that people 
   support this overwhelmingly, probably at least in the 80 percentile. 
   As far as amendments, I would be glad to try to work to consider other amendments. I have asked for, and I presume we will be receiving, a copy of one amendment, at least, that Senator DASCHLE has discussed. 
   But the problem is, this is really simple. It is not complicated. We shouldn't be getting off into all kinds of other areas, which are very important. But Medicare should be dealt with as Medicare. We should have broad Medicare reform--not starting to piecemeal it or trying to attach it to Social Security. 
   That is why we want a clear vote. We want a straight vote. It is a simple procedure. Everybody can understand it. And we can move on and deal with other issues. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. Let's get this done. Let's move on. We will have other opportunities to deal with other issues. It is something that is long overdue, and it is only the first step. The next step should be a tighter lockbox, and the next step beyond that should be not just more spending for Medicare but genuine, broad Medicare reform. 
   But, for now, let's protect Social Security. Let's vote for cloture, and let's pass this procedure. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for the Gregg-Bond amendment that was adopted as part of this Y2K bill. I know that the small business community in Mississippi and nationwide must appreciate our removing the potential for yet another millennium headache. 
   Almost every federal agency requires small businesses to comply with a number of paperwork requirements. That is a fact that is unlikely to change with the new century. It is likely, however, that an unanticipated Y2K failure could prevent a small business from meeting these federal paperwork deadlines on time. 
   The Gregg-Bond amendment will provide relief to small businesses by waiving civil penalties in this type of case. Let me remind my colleagues that this is not an amendment that will reward those who misbehave or who fail to prepare themselves for Y2K. As the Senator from New Hampshire stated earlier, in order to take advantage of this one-time penalty waiver, a small business owner must first prove that he or she took prudent steps to prevent the Y2K failure in the first place. Let me give you an example of how the amendment will work. 
   Let's say a shoe repair shop owner in Inverness, Mississippi, does her best to make her computer system Y2K compliant, only to find that the New Year brings total system failure. Because of this computer crash, the store owner is unable to access her payroll records and cannot submit her payroll taxes on time. The Gregg-Bond amendment gives the business owner a reasonable amount of time to get her system running and pay her taxes--without the IRS slapping huge fines on her. 
   Mr. President, this amendment does not say that small businesses do not have to comply with the law. It does not say that small businesses do not have to meet their paperwork requirements. It simply says that if a small business has a legitimate Y2K failure that causes a hiccup in its paperwork flow, its federal fines can be waived. 
   As we enter the new century, I ask my colleagues: Do we want to start the millennium by fining small businesses for unpredictable and unintentional first-time paperwork violations? 
   Fortunately, the answer is no. 
   I would like to thank Senator GREGG and Senator BOND for offering this amendment, and my colleagues for adopting it. I would also like to thank the National Federation of Independent Business for its hard work on this amendment and this bill. The ``Voice of Small Business'' was heard loud and clear in this Chamber today. Thank you.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank a number of Senators and members of their staffs for the hard work and diligence that has resulted in the passage of the Y2K Liability Limitation legislation. This bill was crafted through the determination of Senator MCCAIN and Senator WYDEN of the Commerce Committee, Senator BENNETT and Senator DODD of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, and Senator HATCH and Senator FEINSTEIN of the Judiciary Committee. Additional help from Senator GORTON, Senator LIEBERMAN, and Senator BROWNBACK also helped to secure passage of this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, it is also important to recognize the work of a number of the staff members for the Senators who were instrumental in the successful efforts on this bill. We are very fortunate to have such intelligent, dedicated individuals working in the United States Senate, and the passage of meaningful legislation would not be possible without the hard work of these people. Specifically, I would like to thank Marti Allbright, Mark Buse, Carole Grunberg, Shawn Maher, Wilke Green, Larry Block, Manus Cooney, David Hantman, Tania Calhoun, Laurie Rubenstein, Karen Knutson, Brian Henneberry, and Steven Wall . The professional skills and abilities of these staff members were important in achieving this legislative success. These staff members and their colleagues ensure that the United States Senate is a responsive, effective body for the American people. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I again say ``thank you.'' 
   Mr. President, the passage of Y2K liability relief provides a reasonable public policy for America as our nation enters the next millennium. It ensures that America's technology sector focuses on solutions to the Y2K problem, rather than spending limited time and resources on defending lawsuits. American ingenuity will make certain that the Year 2000 problem is solved. Great strides have already been made toward this goal, and this bill is an additional critical step in the process for America.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senator asked a question and yielded to me for a response. First of all, I am standing so we can make an announcement about what the schedule will be for the remainder of the night and to get an agreement about how we will proceed during the day tomorrow. As soon as this 15-minute block of time that was agreed to is exhausted, I will be prepared to go to this. 
   In answer to the Senator's question, I will be delighted to go to this Patients' Bill of Rights very soon. We could even do it next week if we could get an agreement that we will vote on your version of the Patients' Bill of Rights and we will vote on our version of the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a good bill. We are ready to go. We think there are important things that need to be done in this area, and we are prepared to debate the issue and vote on the two different approaches. So we can do that. 
   Or we can work together and see if there would be a limited number of amendments that could be agreed to that would be offered on both sides. The problem we ran into last year is somebody said we will need 100 amendments. Please. We have lots of other work. If the Senator has a perfect product and we have a perfect product, why do we need 100 amendments? Then it got down to 20 amendments on each side.  
   But I have designated Senator NICKLES to work with the designee from the Democratic side of the aisle. I believe Senator DASCHLE has indicated Senator KENNEDY will do that. They are going to try to get some agreement on exactly how to proceed. We will be glad to vote on the two versions any time Senators are ready, because we think this is important. We have a bill that was developed by a task force that had broad involvement. Senator JEFFORDS was involved, as were Senator COLLINS, Senator GRAMM, Senator NICKLES, Senator SANTORUM--really a good group. So we are ready to go. It is just a question of getting an agreement on how the procedure will be worked out.

   Mr. LOTT. I would have to take a look at that. First of all, I think 5 days is probably excessive. There was no need to take up 5 days on the Y2K bill. We could have done that in 2 days very easily, but there were a lot of obstruction tactics and delays--having to vote on cloture. Finally, we came to a conclusion and 62 Senators voted for it. I am not prepared now to say we want to go that long or limit it. I think we need to look at what we need, have a fair debate, and get votes on the substitute. We do not have a list of the amendments. We have asked for a list of the amendments so we are in the process of trying to get an understanding of what is going on here. 
   I want to reemphasize we are aware that there needs to be some things done in terms of patients' rights. We have a good bill. We do not think the solution to the problem is lawsuits. Some people seem to think what we need to solve the problems of managed care is more lawsuits. No. If I have a problem with a HMO in my family, I would prefer to have a process to solve the problem, either internally or an external appeal. I would prefer not to be the beneficiary of inheritance as a result of a lawsuit 3 years later. So that is kind of the crux of it. 
   We have Dr. BILL FRIST who has worked on this, I mean a doctor, somebody who understands what it is like to have your heart replaced, someone who understands the need for managed care. We want to do this, so we will be glad to work with all the Senators who are interested. We would like to get a list of amendments. I think it would be fair for the other side, Senator KENNEDY, to want to look at our amendments. I hope that process is underway. 
   Senator NICKLES has been designated to work on this issue on our behalf, and he might want to respond to your question, if you would yield to him for that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate is presently considering the energy and water appropriations bill. There are now, and have been, negotiations taking place in the Cloakrooms to put the finishing touches on the managers' amendment which will encompass most, if not all, of the remaining amendments. 
   While progress is being made, final passage on that vote is not anticipated this evening. Therefore, I do want to get a unanimous consent agreement about how we will proceed tomorrow. If we get that entered into, then we will not expect further votes tonight. The managers will remain tonight to complete action on the appropriations bill, and final passage will occur tomorrow, hopefully in a stacked sequence, beginning at approximately 10:45. 
   Once again, if we get this unanimous consent agreement, then there will be no more votes tonight, and the first votes will occur in the morning at 10:45.

   I now ask unanimous consent that with respect to S. 1205, when the Senate receives from the House the companion measure to this bill, the Senate immediately proceed to the consideration thereof; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted in lieu thereof; that the House bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the foregoing occurring without any intervening action or debate. I further ask unanimous consent that with respect to S. 1205, the bill not be engrossed and that it remain at the desk pending receipt of the House companion bill; and that upon passage of the House bill, the passage of S. 1205 be vitiated and the bill be indefinitely postponed.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill with amendments expected to be offered throughout the day. Votes were scheduled to occur at 5:30 p.m. However, we expect to reach an agreement, hopefully within the next few minutes, requiring Senators to file amendments to the energy and water appropriations bill by 5 o'clock today. Assuming that is agreed to, then there would be no votes today. 
   As a reminder, a series of votes will occur on Tuesday beginning at 2:15 p.m., and the first votes in the series will be on the completion of the Y2K legislation, to be followed by cloture votes on the Social Security lockbox issue and the oil, gas, and steel appropriations bill. 
   So we will have three votes at 2:15, and we may even have additional votes at that time because we could have amendments that will have to be voted on with regard to the energy and water appropriations bill and even, hopefully, final passage. 
   For the remainder of the week, we expect to complete the energy and water appropriations bill no later than the close of business Tuesday. Today, I will file cloture on the House-passed Social Security lockbox bill, with that cloture vote occurring on Wednesday. We also expect to continue with the appropriations bills process when they become available, hopefully disposing of all that would be available to us. That could include the military construction appropriations bill, legislative branch, transportation, and State-Justice-Commerce. 
   I realize we can't do all those this week, but we will work with the Democratic leadership to see if we can maybe do one or more of those bills in a short period of time. We also have entered into an agreement with regard to State Department authorization, with a limited amount of time and, I presume, a limited number of amendments. We will try to find an opportunity to do that this week. Perhaps Friday morning we could take up that bill and complete action on it by noon, and that would be the final vote of the week. 
   Therefore, I think Members should be aware now votes will occur on Friday. This will be a very busy week with votes occurring every day, and we probably will go into the evening at least on Thursday. But it will depend on how things proceed. 
   Let me take a moment now to express, frankly, my disappointment in the Senate at the number of Senators who have indicated they will not be here or would not be here for a vote late this afternoon. Senator DASCHLE and I have discussed the dates on Mondays or Fridays when we knew we would not have votes. We have advised Members of that. That was true last month, and we have indicated a couple dates here in the next month or so. But unless we say there will not be votes, Members 
   should expect to have votes occur sometime after 5 o'clock on Mondays and up until 12 o'clock on Fridays. 
   Because of the large number of Senators who were not going to be able to be here this afternoon, we have decided to defer the votes until tomorrow. But that inconveniences other Senators, some of whom came all the way back across the country to be ready to vote at 5 o'clock, only to find that because of the number of Senators who say they are not coming back, we are not going to have a vote. 
   So I am very disappointed in that. I have to assume some of the responsibility because we could go ahead and say we are going to vote at 5:30. But I  do have to take into consideration that we do have a large number of Senators who would not be present for a vote. 
   So I am taking this opportunity to publicly admonish the Senate as a whole. Last week, I had Senators who said, well, we shouldn't vote on Tuesday morning. I had some Senators say we can't be here at Thursday noon. If it continues at this pace, we will have votes stacked in sequence on Wednesday afternoon at 3 o'clock, which would suit me fine, but I don't think it is a very good way to do business. I do intend to have votes on Fridays so we can complete our work. It is not that I necessarily want them; it is because we have to have them in order to complete our work. So I hope Senators will plan on being here on Mondays and Fridays because we do assure them that there will be no votes before 5 and no votes after 12. But I was very disappointed in what the whip check looked like for today.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I do want to note that for the first time in history, within the last month, the Senate leadership has selected our first woman to be the Senate legal counsel, and she is Pat Bryan. She has served at the Justice Department and at the White House in the past. She is highly capable, and we are delighted to have her joining the Senate in this very important position. But my reason for wanting to comment this morning is to talk a moment about the position and to talk about her predecessor who served as legal counsel. 
   Among the officers of the Senate, one of the least known is the Senate Legal Counsel. There is a reason for that. 
   The Legal Counsel usually works out of the limelight, away from publicity, serving the Senate with a certain anonymity that is appropriate for the very important responsibilities of the office. 
   The Office of the Legal Counsel is, in effect, the Senate's own law firm. Its staff handles any litigation concerning the Senate or its Members acting in their official capacity. 
   The Senate Legal Counsel also advises the Senate, not about legislation, but about legal matters of all sorts. The most recent and most dramatic instance, of course, was the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
   Throughout that extraordinary experience, our Legal Counsel, Thomas B. Griffith, played a crucial role in shaping our procedures. 
   He assured the legal propriety of everything we did, keeping us, along with the Parliamentarian, true to the Senate's rules and precedents. 
   The meticulousness he brought to our labors was characteristic of Tom's work, as was the unflappable demeanor and unwavering courtesy he showed throughout the impeachment ordeal. 
   With gratitude for Tom's service to the Senate for the last four years, and yet with deep regret at the prospect of losing him, I must report that he will be rejoining his former law firm of Wiley, Rein, and Fielding. 
   It is customary on occasions like this to say that we all wish him well. In this case, that is an understatement. 
   We wish Tom the best, as he deserves, for that is what he has given to the Senate. 
   One example of his dedication should suffice. Tom lives quite a distance away from Washington, considerably outside the Beltway even, in Lovettsville, Virginia. 
   During the weeks of the impeachment proceedings, Tom left his family there and moved closer to the Capitol, to be always available to us here, spending perhaps one day a week with Susan and the children. 
   I want all of them--Chelsea, Megan, Robbie, Erin, Torre, and Tanne--to know that, during those weeks when they must have sorely missed their dad, he was serving his country in a very important way. 
   That kind of selfless service has always been a part of Tom's life, from his days as a missionary in Zimbabwe with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through his activities with the Federalist Society. 
   His example of integrity and commitment to the highest ideals of the law has brought honor to the Senate. He leaves us now with our affection and our enduring gratitude.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to The Macon Beacon, a newspaper in Macon, MS, on the occasion of its sesquicentennial celebration. 
   This is a special event for Mississippi and for the city of Macon. Media exists to report what actually happens locally, nationally and globally. For 150 years, the Beacon has been reporting facts relevant to the lives of Noxubee County residents. The Beacon reached the Sesquicentennial milestone because it is a reliable source of information for its community. 
   I want to tell my colleagues a brief history of this historic yet vibrant newspaper. The Macon Beacon paper was founded in July 1849, for the people of Noxubee County, Mississippi. The county was established only 16 years before in 1833. The Beacon is the third oldest newspaper in Mississippi. It even has the distinction of being Noxubee County's oldest continuous business. This demonstrates the Macon Beacon's continued importance to the people of Noxubee County. 
   E.W. and Henry C. Ferris founded The Macon Beacon in 1849 and it remained in the Ferris family for the next 123 years. Its editorship passed down through the Ferris family from Henry to his son, Phillip, and then to his son Douglas. Douglas recruited a cousin, Brooke Ferris, to continue the family's leadership in the business. This is an amazing and honorable family legacy. 
   In 1972, upon Mr. Brooke Ferris's retirement, Mr. Jim Robbins purchased The Macon Beacon. The Robbins family of Macon, Mississippi, continued to publish the newspaper until 1993. Then Mr. Scott Boyd bought it and he continues to publish The Macon Beacon today. 
   The First Amendment to the Constitution indicates the importance of a free and vigilant press to our democratic republic. The Macon Beacon has lived up to these expectations by faithfully reporting community events for 150 years. The Macon Beacon has survived and flourished through three major wars, including the War Between the States, and the Great Depression. Each edition of The Beacon is eagerly awaited by the newspaper's 3,100 subscribers, more than a fourth of the county's population. 
   In the words of its founding editor, Mr. Henry C. Ferris, The Macon Beacon is ``a semi-public institution dedicated to the service of the people.'' I want to congratulate The Macon Beacon on the celebration of 150 years of dedicated service to Noxubee County.

The appellant alleges that he was terminated from his employment with the Department of Veterans Affairs unlawfully in retaliation for communications that entitle him to protected status as a whistle blower.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to object at this time, not that I will object to it in the end. The Senate will go on record on this matter, but we just saw the language 15 minutes ago. I have already initiated a process to have it reviewed by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, and other interested Senators, to make sure they are comfortable with the language, because it does go beyond just the resolution we see underway now concerning Kosovo and the withdrawal of the Serbian troops and, hopefully, the return of the Kosovars. It also goes into some language with regard to what should happen in Kosovo now and also language with regard to President Milosevic. 
   All I am saying is we want to review the language and make sure all interested Senators are aware of it. We will be glad to work with Senator REID, Senator DASCHLE, and others to have a statement by the Senate on this matter, as we usually do when there are events such as this. 
   I do want to go ahead and say for the Record, as others have, that the Senate is, I am sure, and I personally am very pleased an agreement appears to have been worked out and appears to be going forward.  
   Earlier I was able to discuss this matter with the President. It does appear that the Serbian troops are beginning to be withdrawn and the bombing will be halted. This should lead to a process where the Kosovars can return to their homeland. That is good news. 
   I think we all should express our appreciation for the leadership that has occurred in this area, and also for the good and outstanding work done by our troops. That is the thrust of what is in this resolution. So I think we all should acknowledge that. I think there is a sigh of relief that it did not go on further, with great problems facing U.S. men and women in uniform who had to go in as ground troops, or as the weather turned bad. We are all very pleased that this appears to be working out. 
   As the President said to me when we talked earlier today--and I do not want to quote the President, because you do not do that, but the upshot of it was we still have a long way to go. And we do. But we all can hope and pray for the best. 
   So while I will reserve the right to object at this point, we will work with the leadership on both sides of the aisle and develop some language on which the Senate can act.

I commend all of the pages and wish them good luck in their future endeavors. I know all Members would want to personally thank them for their hard work. Many days they have worked late into the night, and the next morning they would get up early to go to school. It is not an easy job being a Senate page. Their work here is very important, as we move through our legislative process and quite often move a lot of paper around. They help us an awful lot. 
   I have particularly enjoyed watching this group and seeing them at the door and seeing them in the halls and seeing them led by Senator THURMOND into the dining room for ice cream for one and all.

   It is my hope the energy and water appropriations bill can be completed during Monday's session of the Senate. Two cloture motions were filed with respect to the Social Security lockbox issue and the oil, gas, and steel appropriations revolving fund bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the Senate considers S. 96, the Y2K Act, I rise to first praise the bipartisan work of Senator MCCAIN and Senator WYDEN. They have worked tirelessly to construct an effective, fair bill that will address the important issue of liability as it relates to the Year 2000--or Y2K. There are enough challenges for America's industry and governments to ensure that they are Y2K compliant. We all know how vexing computer problems can be. 
   This bill is constructive, positive legislation. It allows companies in the information technology industry to focus their limited resources on solving Y2K related problems in computer software by preventing frivolous litigation. Litigation which would divert those limited resources away from solving Y2K programming deficiencies. 
   With only 205 days left until the globe turns the page on the calendar to a new century and a new millennium, the Y2K problem is a crucial matter and must be fixed. 
   Lawsuits are already being filed regarding the Y2K problem, and Congress must act now to ensure that frivolous suits are prevented. Our legal system allows those who have indeed suffered because of the fault of another party to have their grievances adjudicated in court. This bill protects that process. This bill allows plaintiffs to bring suit  for Y2K related problems if these problems are not addressed. This bill, however, prevents and places limits on opportunistic and unwarranted suits. 
   Senator MCCAIN and Senator WYDEN have worked closely together to address this relevant matter, and I congratulate them for their efforts. Their approach has gained support from a substantial number of our colleagues--from both sides of the aisle. 
   I would also like to recognize the efforts of Senator HATCH and the Judiciary Committee. They too have brought additional attention and clarity to the issue of Y2K liability problems. Senator BENNETT and the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem have also been invaluable in educating the Senate. Although his task force does not have legislative authority, he has explored all facets of the public policy dilemma. The Special Committee has continued to investigate this matter and provide education on preparations for the new century. 
   Yes, there were three separate efforts from three different vantage points to ensure that the Senate gets to a solution rapidly. The participating Senators have brought expertise and legitimate concerns from their various roles and responsibilities within the Senate. All of our colleagues will benefit from their collective efforts. 
   I am delighted that, without further delay, the full Senate can now begin consideration of S. 96--the result of the diligent efforts of many. I am proud to be a cosponsor and urge all Senators to support a solution that ensures America's continued prosperity. 
   Mr. MCCAIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I commend Senator DASCHLE for his comments about Senator STEVENS. He is about to cast his 12,000th vote. 
   Senator DASCHLE observed the interesting array of TED STEVENS' tie. My favorite one is the Tasmanian devil. When he comes in with that tie on, you know an appropriations bill is fixing to be moved through the Senate. But he has been a great Member of the Senate. He is a great friend. He is a credit to his State of Alaska. 
   He has had an unbelievable career, including being a Flying Tiger, the 14th Air Force, in World War II. He is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School. He has overcome that. He was a solicitor at the Interior Department under the Eisenhower administration, and he certainly was a powerful advocate for Alaska statehood. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives. He was appointed to the Senate in 1968, and he has been elected five times since. 
   My greatest experience with the distinguished Senator from Alaska was when he served as the whip of the majority in the Senate, and I was the whip for the minority in the House. Unlike what most people think, where there is this natural difficulty between the House and the Senate, he was never anything but helpful to me personally. He helped the two institutions work together. Because of his leadership, we addressed a number of important problems for the legislative activities and the security of the U.S. Capitol Building. 
   His wife Catherine and six children are here, a wonderful assemblage of people. Catherine does a great job at keeping Senator STEVENS on the straight and narrow. She is a wonderful lady. We thank her for the sacrifice she makes in allowing Senator STEVENS to be here, sometimes through late nights, to allow him to accumulate these 12,000 votes. 
   On behalf of the Senate, I extend our appreciation and thanks to Senator STEVENS, a great Senator from Alaska, for what he has done for his State and for our Nation.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional dedication, vision, and public service of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Severs who is leaving the Air Force Legislative Liaison Office for assignment as the program manager for the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser Program at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. It is a privilege for me to recognize the many outstanding achievements he has provided for the Senate, the Air Force, and our great Nation. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Severs has served our country with distinction for nearly 14 years. After graduating from the University of Georgia in 1985, he embarked on his Air Force Career with a training assignment at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. He subsequently completed tours of duty at McClellan Air Force Base, California; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; Los Angeles Air Force Base, California; and back again to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. In each of his Air Force assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Severs' performance has been outstanding. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Severs began his tour on Capitol Hill as a legislative fellow assigned to the office of my esteemed colleague from Oklahoma, Senator JIM INHOFE. During this assignment, he worked on the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill. After his assignment with Senator INHOFE, Lieutenant Colonel Severs was reassigned to the Air Force Office of Legislative Liaison in the Pentagon. 
   Initially, he was responsible for acquisition and logistics issues and was responsible for preparing the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force for posture testimony. He was then selected to be the Executive Officer to the Director of Air Force Legislative Liaison followed shortly thereafter by his reassignment as Deputy Chief of the Air Force Senate Liaison Office.  
   Lieutenant Colonel Severs has earned the respect and trust of many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. His professional abilities and expertise enabled him to foster excellent working relationships that have served the Air Force and the Senate exceptionally well. As a liaison officer in the Senate, Lieutenant Colonel Severs has provided members and staff with informative and timely support regarding Air Force plans, programs, and constituent casework. His efforts have contributed greatly to maintaining the best trained, best equipped, and best prepared Air Force in the world. 
   Mr. President, Jeff Severs, his wife, Gay, and children, Hugh and Brooke, have made many sacrifices during his 14-year Air Force career. He continues to serve with a dedication and enthusiasm seen only in our Nation's best and brightest. He is a great credit to the Air Force and the country, and his efforts on behalf of members and staff of the Senate will be greatly missed. As he now departs for new challenges at Eglin Air Force Base, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize his service to the Senate and wish him well in his new assignment.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the defense authorization bill and immediately begin debate on the Allard amendment regarding the Civil Air Patrol. A vote in relation to the Allard amendment has been ordered for 10 a.m. I understand discussions are still continuing with regard to that amendment. Other amendments will be offered, I am sure. They are pending. I am sure Senators will want to have them offered and considered one way or another today. There will be votes throughout the day. 
   It is the intention of the managers--and certainly my intention--to complete action on this bill. I urge the managers to complete action during today, not tonight. There are a number of Senators who are planning on proceeding to their States tonight, late tonight, or early in the morning, so we really need to get this legislation completed. 
   I commend the managers on both sides of the aisle for the work they have done, but I do think we need to get a definite list of amendments locked in. Otherwise, I am sure some Senators will continue to think of ideas they may want to have addressed. If Senators have amendments they want to have considered today, they need to see the managers during this next vote. After that, we hope to limit the amendments, limit the time, get the votes, and complete this work. This is very important legislation that needs to be completed and must be completed before tonight. 
   I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I will propound at this time. I do think the issue which has been before the Senate is a very important issue. I have shown my interest and my concern regarding security and more reports with regard to China, satellite technology, and security of our labs. We have added a significant amount of language into this bill. I also think an important part of making sure we have secure labs in the future and that the administration is handled properly will involve reorganization at the Department of Energy. Obviously, what is now in place is not working. But this is not about organization; this is about security. 
   I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour for debate to be equally divided on amendment No. 446, the amendment by Senators KYL, DOMENICI, and others; following that time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the amendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote. 
   I might add before the Chair rules, this agreement is the same type of agreement that we have been reaching for dozens of amendments throughout the consideration of the DOD bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, then we will continue. The managers have some work they need to do with regard to some amendments that are still pending. During this 60 minutes of debate, I hope that can be resolved. We are expecting that final passage on the Department of Defense authorization bill would occur this evening, hopefully before 8 o'clock. If we can make it any sooner than that, certainly we will try to, but 8 o'clock is still our goal. 
   Just one final point. I must say, I do not like having to pull aside this amendment. I thought we should have full debate, that it was a very important amendment and we should have had a vote on it. But we will have an opportunity. This is an issue that is important. It does go to the fundamental question of security at our energy and nuclear labs. But I think this Department of Defense authorization bill is the best defense authorization bill we have had in several years. A lot of good work has been done and I thought it would not have been wise to leave tonight without this Department of Defense authorization bill being completed. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to clarify the applicability of the Cargo Preference Act to the acquisition streamlining authority found in section 805 of S. 1059. Section 805 creates a new pilot acquisition program for commercial services, one of which is ``transportation, travel and relocation services.'' Although cargo preference or preference waivers are not mentioned, this pilot program could potentially be used to permit waivers of cargo preference law found in 10 U.S.C. 2631. In the absence of cargo preferences, DOD would have to acquire an immense organic fleet and use very scarce uniformed manpower at enormous cost of more than $800 million per year. This would dwarf any acquisition reform savings. This amendment would ensure the waivers of 10 U.S.C. 2631 for commercial service contracts are not authorized under this pilot program.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on July 1, 1999, Donald E. Meiners will retire from Entergy Mississippi after 39 years of service. Don started as a salesman in Jackson and culminated as the president and chief executive officer. 
   Mr. Meiners rose rapidly in the company and quickly became one of its officers. He has worked in marketing, operations and customer services, and within various subsidiaries of the company requiring frequent moves. Entergy recognized his leadership capabilities early, and he excelled at each challenge. 
   He has also been very involved in the civic aspects of his community. He has taken on different roles from steering various United Way Campaigns to chairing the Chambers of Commerce for Jackson and Vicksburg, to leading MetroJackson's Housing Partnership and the Newcomen Society of Mississippi. Don has also supported the Executive Women's International Night, Mississippi Museum of Art, International Ballet Competition, Jackson Symphony Orchestra, and the Boys and Girls Club of America. His efforts have ensured that all Mississippians can be exposed to the full richness of the Magnolia State's culture. 
   Mr. Meiners has made a personal commitment to education by serving on the boards of the Mississippi State University Foundation, Tougaloo College, Jackson State, and the Mississippi University for Women. Through these post-secondary institutions, he wanted to foster an atmosphere that inspired all Mississippians to reach up and participate in our national prosperity by having essential educational skills. He has also served or is currently serving on the boards of the Trustmark National Bank, Institute for Technology Development and Mississippi Manufacturers Association. Here, his focus has been to promote the right type of job producing capacity in my home state. 
   As a result of his contributions to Mississippi, Mr. Meiners has been recognized as the Governor's Volunteer of the Year, Mississippi's Economic Development Outstanding Volunteer of the Year, Goodwill's Outstanding Volunteer, and he received the Hope Award from Mississippi's Multiple Sclerosis Chapter. It is clear that he has given his time and energy to all facets of Mississippi. 
   Mr. Meiners is a family man caring for four generations of his relatives. He is devoted to Patricia Stone, his high school sweetheart and wife for 42 years. He also cares for his 90-year-old father. His sons, Christopher and Charles, have truly made him proud, and his two granddaughters, Hannah and Mallory light up his life. He is also an active member of Christ United Methodist Church. 
   I must not forget to mention that Don is a Mississippi State University Bulldog with a degree in electrical engineering. This Rebel found a way to look past this personal educational flaw. No, seriously, I am proud to call Don, a Hazlehurst native, my friend. I respect his professionalism and dedication to Mississippi. He is a true southern gentleman, and he will be missed. I wish Don and Pat the best as they pursue a well-earned retirement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on behalf of myself, and Senators WARNER, SHELBY, MURKOWSKI, DOMENICI, SPECTER, THOMAS, KYL, and HUTCHINSON. 
   This package is the product of the serious investigative and oversight work performed by the relevant committees and other Senators who have devoted considerable attention to the issues of satellite exports, Chinese espionage, lax security at DOE facilities, foreign counterintelligence wiretaps, and more. I commend my cosponsors and others for their helpful efforts in this regard. 
   I have stated that the damage to U.S. national security as a result of China's nuclear espionage is probably the greatest I have seen in my entire career. And, unfortunately, the administration's inattention to--or even hostility towards--counterintelligence and security has magnified this breach. 
   It is simply incredible that China has acquired sensitive, classified information about every nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal. But this apparently is precisely what happened. 
   It is simply incredible that American companies illegally provided information to the Chinese that will allow them to improve their long-range missiles aimed at American cities. But this apparently is exactly what happened. 
   It is simply incredible that American exports were delivered to certain Chinese facilities that will assist their weapons of mass destruction program. But this apparently is exactly what happened. 
   It is simply incredible that it took this administration 2 years from the date the National Security Adviser was  first briefed by DOE officials on the problem of Chinese espionage at the nuclear weapons laboratories, to sign a new Presidential directive to strengthen counterintelligence at the labs and elsewhere. But this apparently is exactly what happened. 
   And, after all this, it is simply incredible that the President would claim that all this damage was a result of actions of previous administrations and that he had not been told of any espionage that had occurred on his watch. But this is exactly what the President said in a mid-March press conference. 
   As I have stated previously, the Congress must take several steps to better understand what happened and how it happened, and to lessen the likelihood of a recurrence of such events in the future. 
   First, we must aggressively probe the administration to determine the facts. We know much of what happened. But we don't have all the facts, and we certainly don't know why certain events unfolded the way they did. We need to get to the bottom of that. 
   Several committees are exploring aspects of this scandal, and it is multi-faceted: DOE security; whistleblower protections; counterintelligence at the FBI; CIA operations; export controls; illegal campaign contributions; the Justice Department; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA; DOD monitoring of satellite launches in China; waivers of laws for companies under investigation for illegal activities; and much, much more. 
   Second, we must take all reasonable steps now to remedy problems we have identified to date. Does this mean that the actions recommended in this bill, or in this amendment, will solve the problem of lab security for all time? Of course not. But they do represent important first steps in addressing the myriad problems that have emerged during the various on-going investigations. 
   For example, we know that security and counter-intelligence at the labs was--and is--woefully inadequate. We can take steps to begin to fix that problem. 
   We know that the Clinton Commerce Department failed miserably to adequately control and protect national security information as it relates to commercial communications satellites and rocket launchers. We took steps last year in the Defense authorization bill to help protect national security by transferring from Commerce to State the responsibility for reviewing license applications for such satellites. 
   Third, we must hold appropriate executive branch officials accountable for their actions. This means we need to understand why certain Clinton administration officials acted the way they did. Why, for example, were DOE intelligence officials told they could not brief the Congress on aspects of this espionage investigation and its implications? Why did the Reno Justice Department refuse to approve a wiretap request? Why was a certain suspect's computer not searched much, much earlier when, in fact, the suspect had agreed several years earlier to such a search? And why was a waiver granted for the export of a satellite built by an American company that was under investigation by the Department of Justice and whose head was the single largest individual contributor to the Democratic National Committee? 
   In posing these and other questions, does this mean the Senate is on some partisan witch-hunt? Absolutely not. I recognize that a full understanding of this issue requires going back decades. 
   For example, the reports recently issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Cox Committee in the House reviewed documents from prior administrations. 
   But simply saying that errors were made in previous administrations cannot and does not absolve this President and this administration from responsibility. In fact, this administration's record in the area of security and counter-intelligence, in its relations with China, and in several other areas, leaves much to be desired. 
   As I said before, there are some steps we can and should take now. For example, the Defense authorization bill before us now proposes several important measures regarding Department of Energy security and counterintelligence. Likewise, the intelligence authorization bill includes several legislative proposals on this topic as well. 
   My amendment is entirely consistent with, and indeed builds upon, those two vital legislative measures. Allow me to describe what this amendment proposes to do. 
   First, it seeks to address the Loral episode, wherein the President approved a waiver for the export of a Loral satellite for launch on a Chinese rocket at the same time Loral was under investigation by the Justice Department for possible criminal wrong-doing. 
   This amendment requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an investigation is undertaken of an alleged violation of U.S. export control laws in connection with the export of a commercial satellite of U.S. origin. 
   It also requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an export license or waiver is granted on behalf of any U.S. person or firm that is the subject of a criminal investigation. 
   I am absolutely convinced that had these ``sunshine'' provisions been in effect at the time of the Loral waiver decision, I doubt very seriously that the President would have issued his decision in favor of Loral. 
   Second, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to undertake certain actions that would significantly enhance the performance and effectiveness of the DOD program for monitoring so-called ``satellite launch campaigns'' in China and elsewhere. 
   For instance, under this amendment, the DOD monitoring officials will be given authority to halt a launch campaign if they felt U.S. national security was being compromised. In addition, the Secretary will be obligated to establish appropriate professional and technical qualifications, as well as training programs, for such personnel, and increase the number of such monitors. 
   Furthermore, to remove any ambiguity as to what technical information may be shared by U.S. contractors during a launch campaign, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to review and improve guidelines for such discussions. Finally, it requires the Secretary to establish a counter intelligence program within the organization responsible for performing such monitoring functions. 
   Third, my amendment enhances the intelligence community's role in the export license review process. This responds to a clear need for greater insight by the State Department and other license-reviewing agencies into the Chinese and other entities involved in space launch and ballistic missile programs. In this regard, it is worth noting that the intelligence community played a very modest role in reviewing the license applications for exports that subsequently were deemed to have harmed national security. 
   This section also requires a report by the Director of Central Intelligence on the efforts of foreign governments to acquire sensitive U.S. technology and technical information. 
   Fourth, based on concerns that China continues to proliferate missile and missile technology to Pakistan and Iran, this amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the People's Republic of China should not be permitted to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, as a member until Beijing has demonstrated a sustained commitment to missile nonproliferation and adopted an effective export control system. Any honest appraisal would lead one to the conclusion, I believe, that China has not demonstrated such a commitment and does not have in place effective export controls. 
   Now we know, from documents released by the White House as part of the Senate's investigation, that the Clinton administration wanted to bring the PRC into the MTCR as a means of shielding Beijing from missile proliferation sanctions laws now on the books. This section sends a strong signal that such an approach should not be undertaken. 
   Fifth, the amendment expresses strong support for stimulating the expansion of the commercial space launch industry here in America. As we have seen recently with a number of failed U.S. rocket launches, there is a crying need to improve the performance of U.S.-built and launched rockets. This amendment strongly encourages efforts to promote the domestic commercial space launch industry, including through the elimination of legal or regulatory barriers to long-term competitiveness. 
   The amendment also urges a review of the current policy of permitting the export of commercial satellites of U.S. origin to the PRC for launch and suggests that, if a decision is made to phase-out the policy, then launches of such satellites in the PRC should occur only if they are licensed as of the commencement of the phase-out of the policy and additional actions are taken to minimize the transfer of technology to the PRC during the course of such launches. 
   Sixth, the amendment requires the Secretary of State to provide information to U.S. satellite manufacturers when a license application is denied. This addresses a legitimate concern expressed by U.S. industry about the current export control process. 
   I not that each of these recommendations was included in the Senate Intelligence Committee's ``Report on Impacts to U.S. National Security of Advanced Satellite Technology Exports to the PRC and the PRC's Efforts Influence U.S. Policy.'' That report was approved by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, so there is nothing partisan whatsoever in these recommendations. 
   My amendment also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the military balance in the Taiwan Straits, similar to the report delivered to the Congress earlier this year. That report, my colleagues may recall, was both informative and deeply troubling in its assessment that the PRC has underway a massive buildup of missile forces opposite our friend, Taiwan. 
   Annual submission of this report will assist the Congress in working with the administration in assessing future lists of defense articles and services requested by Taiwan as part of the annual arms sales talks between the U.S. and Taiwan. 
   Eighth, the amendment proposes a mechanism for determining the extent to which then-Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary's ``Openness Initiative'' resulted in the release of highly-classified nuclear secrets. We already know, for example, that some material has been publicly-released that contained highly-sensitive ``restricted Data'' or ``Formerly Restricted Data.'' 
   While we are rightly concerned about what nuclear weapons design or other sensitive information has been stolen through espionage, at the same time we must be vigilant in ensuring that Mrs. O'Leary's initiative was not used, and any future declassification measures will not be used, to provide nuclear know-how to would-be proliferators in Iran, North Korea, and elsewhere. 
   Ninth, the amendment proposes putting the FBI in charge of conducting security background investigations of DOE laboratory employees, versus the Office of Personnel Management as is currently the case. I applaud the Armed Services Committee for including additional funds in their bill for addressing the current backlog of security investigations. 
   Tenth, and lastly, the amendment proposes increased counterintelligence training and other measures to ensure classified information is protected during DOE laboratory-to-laboratory exchanges, should such exchanges occur in the future. For example, having trained counter-intelligence experts go along on any and all visits of lab employees to sensitive countries, is a small but useful step in the direction of enhanced security. 
   Mr. President, I readily concede that this package of amendments will not solve all security problems at the Nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. Nor will it solve the myriad problems identified to date in the Senate's on-going investigation of the damage to U.S. national security from the export of satellites to the PRC or from Chinese nuclear espionage. 
   These are, as I mentioned before, small but useful steps to address known deficiencies. Most of these recommendations stem from the bipartisan report issued by the Intelligence Committee. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   In summary, good work has been done by the Cox committee in the House of Representatives. They should be commended for the work they have done in this critical area. They should be commended for the fact that it has been bipartisan. It would have been easy for them to veer into areas or procedures that would have made it very partisan. They did not do that. 
   The same thing is true in the Senate. The Senate has chosen so far not to have a select committee or a joint committee. The Senate has continued to try to do this in the normal way. 
   We have had hearings by the Intelligence Committee. They have done very good work. Chairman SHELBY has been thoughtful and relentless, and he continues in that way. The Armed Services Committee, under Senator WARNER, the Energy Committee, under Senator MURKOWSKI, Foreign Relations, Governmental Affairs--all the committees with jurisdiction in this area have been having hearings, they have had witnesses, and they have been coming up with recommendations. 
   As a matter of fact, some of the recommendations that have been developed are included in this Department of Defense authorization bill. I understand other proposed changes to deal with these security lapses and with counterintelligence will be included in the intelligence authorization bill that will come up in early June. 
   I do not believe we should rush to judgment. We should make sure we understand the full ramifications of what has happened. We should not say it has been just this administration or that administration or the other administration. This is about the security of our country. I agree with Congressman DICKS when he quoted former Senator Henry Jackson about how, when it comes to national security, we should all just pursue it as Americans. 
   This amendment I have just sent to the desk is a further outgrowth of some of the information we have found through some of the hearings that have occurred. There were some provisions in it that I am sure would have evoked some criticism, and we have taken those out, so that we can take our time and deal more thoughtfully with it over a period of time. 
   We are going to have to deal with the Export Administration and the fact that law was allowed to lapse back in 1995. But there are some things we can do now. To reiterate, this is what this amendment will do: 
   First, it requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an investigation is undertaken of an alleged violation of U.S. export control laws in connection with the export of a commercial satellite of U.S. origin. 
   It will also require the President to notify the Congress whenever an export license or waiver is granted on behalf of any U.S. person or firm that is the subject of a criminal investigation. 
   Second, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to undertake certain actions that would significantly enhance the performance and effectiveness of the DOD program for monitoring so-called satellite launch campaigns in China and elsewhere. 
   Third, the amendment will enhance the intelligence community's role in the export license review process and requires a report by the DCI on the efforts of foreign governments to acquire sensitive U.S. technology and technical information. 
   Fourth, the amendment expresses the sense of Congress that 
   the People's Republic of China should not be permitted to join the Missile Technology Control Regime as a member until Beijing has demonstrated a sustained commitment to missile nonproliferation and adopted an effective export control system. 
   The amendment expresses strong support for stimulating the expansion of the commercial space launch industry in America. This amendment strongly encourages efforts to promote the domestic commercial space launch industry. That is why we have seen more of this activity occur in other countries, particularly China and even Russia, because we do not have that domestic commercial space launch capability here. We should eliminate legal or regulatory barriers to long-term competitiveness. 
   The amendment also urges a review of the current policy of permitting the export of commercial satellites of U.S. origin to the PRC for launch. 
   The amendment requires the Secretary of State to provide information to U.S. satellite manufacturers when a license application is denied. 
   The amendment also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the military balance in the Taiwan Straits, similar to the report developed earlier this year and was delivered to the Congress. 
   The amendment proposes a mechanism for determining the extent to  which classified nuclear weapons information has been released by the Department of Energy. It proposes putting the FBI in charge of conducting security background investigations of DOE Laboratory employees versus OPM. It seems to me that really is beyond the capabilities of the Office of Personnel Management. Surely, the FBI would be better conducting the security background investigations. This does not call for putting the FBI totally in charge of security at our Labs, for instance. That is something we need to think about more. I had thought the FBI should be in charge, and there are some limitations in that area. That is an area we should think about a lot more. We should work through the committee process. We should think together in a bipartisan way about how to do it. 
   Clearly, the security at our Laboratories has to be revised. We have to have a much better counterintelligence process, and our committees are working on that. 
   Last, the committee proposes increased counterintelligence training and other measures to ensure classified information is protected during DOE Laboratory-to-Laboratory exchanges. 
   These are pieces that I think Senators can agree on across the board. They are targeted at dealing with the problem, not trying to fix blame, not claiming that this is going to solve all the problems. But these are some things we can do now that will help secure these Laboratories in the future and get information we need and give enhanced capabilities to the intelligence communities. 
   I urge my colleagues to review it. It has been, of course, considered by the committees that have jurisdiction. We have provided copies of it to the minority, and we invite their participation. I believe this is something that can be bipartisan and can be accepted, after reasonable debate, overwhelmingly. I certainly hope so. I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have followed the base closure recommendations, the so-called BRAC issues, for many years, going back to my years in the House. We have been down this old BRAC road several times before. I have always been opposed to this approach. 
   I remember standing in the center well of the House years ago, talking to Congressman ARMEY of Texas. He was talking about his concept. I told him that I thought it was an abdication of responsibility, but if he wanted to pursue it, here is how to do it, and here is how it has to come through the Rules Committee. He took notes copiously and pursued it and it went through. 
   I think this is one more example where we and the administrations are avoiding the tough choices. For years, for 100 years, when there was a need to close a base, the administration, the Pentagon, the Department of Defense sent up recommendations of surplus or unneeded bases that Congress, through the authorization process, appropriations process, considered those recommendations and made a decision to close them or not. 
   Over the years, as it became more and more difficult to close remaining bases or to make increasingly tough decisions, these so-called BRAC rounds gained popularity and were pushed and, in fact, passed through the Congress. I don't think this is the way it should be done and I maintain it has not worked well. 
   In many cases, bases were closed, including several in my State. I go quite often now to those former bases as we continue to work to get new business and industry to come into those facilities. The tough decisions were made. We did our job. 
   So the first thing I recommended is let's do our job. I discussed that with Secretary of Defense Cohen and he, of course, smiled and said yes, but we probably won't get them closed. 
   I believe if the case is made and they recommend a surplus, that could be done--maybe not as many as they would like, but the process is there and we should honor that process. 
   We have had these base closure proceedings in the past. They have been painful. They cause tremendous upheavals in the defense community. In the communities where it happens, millions of dollars have been spent trying to defend against closures or, once a closure decision has been made, trying to find a way to make use of the base. 
   For such communities, losing a base is more than just an economic loss; it is an emotional loss and a blow to the core of their identity. These are just not nameless, faceless people involved. In most military communities, personnel from the base are church leaders, little league coaches, and scout masters, not just men and women with money to spend. Communities that lose a base lose much more than economic well-being; they lose friends, neighbors, and community leaders. I think it is very important that we remember what this process does to communities and to the people who are involved. 
   I maintain the ones that we have had in the past have worked pretty well, although some bases are still not fully closed. The environmental cleanups have not happened in other instances. Many of these facilities, now, are just sitting there. 
   I recommend before we go to another round, if we ever do, of base closures, we ought to let the ones that have already been recommended fully run out the string. Let's see what we have saved. 
   I am told a good bit of money will be saved this year from the base closures. But if you read the little asterisk down at the bottom, it doesn't include, for instance, environmental cleanup costs. 
   So if you look at the impact this has had on our communities, on our defense installations, and what has actually come from it, I think it is not good judgment to go forward with another round now. Think about what we are doing. Think about the timing. 
   Here we are at a time when our defense capabilities are being stretched to the maximum steaming time, time our men and women are out on ships and they are on remote assignments, at a time when our troops are in combat this very day, we are talking about closing installations or closing facilities back here at home. 
   Also, a side note: Just last week we passed a bill that provided money for construction of more military facilities in Europe, so we are going to be adding a half billion dollars in new construction in Europe. Maybe it is needed. Maybe that says we have acted too hastily in drawing down in Europe. We allowed our facilities--the runways, the air traffic control towers, the housing facilities--to deteriorate even there. But at a time when we are going to be spending money in Europe, we are talking about cutting back here at home. 
   Are American servicemembers going to return to find that while the bases overseas are being rebuilt there are ``For Rent'' signs on the ones they left back home in the United States? 
   I think, first of all, the whole idea of doing it through a commission is not wise. Second, I do not think we have completed the process of the base closure decisions that have already been made. Third, the timing could not be worse. 
   Let's look at this more. Let's make sure we can stop the free fall our defense has been going through in readiness, in morale of our troops, in recruitment and retention. It is just one more factor that can serve as a discouragement to our men and women in the military. Some people say, let's go ahead and do it, the Department of Defense wants to do it this way--instead of doing their job, in my opinion--and it probably will not affect me. 
   I have a list I recommend Senators review before they cast their votes. This list will be available in the Senators' cloakrooms. I will have them on desks. I will have it in my hand. Look at the bases that were on the list that  were not closed in the past. These will be the ones that probably would be first choice to be reviewed again. Just in the State of California, you are talking about 15 facilities. It covers the entire country. It covers facilities in almost every State. 
   When I look down this list, it really scares me, the facilities that could be considered for closing, what it would do in those communities and what it would do to our military capabilities. So take a look at this list before you cast this vote. Maybe sometime in the future we will need to take another look at it. 
   But I still think there is fallout from the fact that the last closure did become tangled up in political decisions. There is a very strong feeling that some of the decisions recommended by the BRAC were changed or evaded subsequently. I remember Secretary of Defense Cohen believing very strongly he was not given the information he was entitled to when the Base Closure Commission was acting involving the State of Maine. We need to spend more time thinking about this. We should get over this hump we are at right now of our military capability and the involvement we have now in the Balkans. Maybe another year. 
   I will tell you what I think we ought to do. Let's try doing it the way it was done for 100 years. Let's try doing it through the normal process. I support commissions sometimes. I guess the day might come when I would support one in this area. But I do not think this is the right time and I do not think this is the right way to go about it. 
   If the DOD feels further base closures are needed, the most logical solution I see is for the Pentagon to identify bases it no longer decides are necessary and submit these findings to us. Show the Congress where the redundancy and obsolescence are. I have full faith that this body is capable of looking objectively at our defense needs and determining whether a base has outlived its usefulness. 
   Where is accountability in the BRAC process? We in Congress should not be abdicating congressional authority to some ad hoc commission. In this time of severe military drawdowns and austere budget cuts, I think it is all too easy for us to pass the buck and allow a commission, which has no obligation to answer to any constituency, to further strip our military. I do not think we were elected to leave all the difficult choices to a special commission. The average American feels very strongly about our national defense, and its important that the buck stops here when it comes to ensuring our military readiness. 
   So I urge my colleagues, before they vote, look at this list. Think carefully about what you are doing. Can we be assured this will be done in a totally objective way? What will be its impact on our military right now? I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator WARNER, for his thoughtfulness in this area. He has generally, in the past, been supportive of this effort, even when it affected his own State. He has stood up and said, We will do our own part. You have to commend him for that. But he, this time, has said this is not the right time; maybe another day, maybe another way, but not now. 
   That is what I hope the Senate will do. I hope the Senate will vote against this next round at this time. 
   I might emphasize, earlier on there was a recommendation we have two rounds, 2001-2005. It was considered we would exclude certain areas and allow the others to go forward. I think the principle of that is wrong. My own State might be exempted and everybody else might have to deal with it--that is wrong. We should not do things that way. We should have a fair, across-the-board policy. I think that is the way we should do it. 
   I yield to the Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator WARNER. 
   Let me point out another instance of another Secretary of the Navy, Senator CHAFEE of Rhode Island. When he was Secretary of the Navy, the decision was made, and it was very difficult, but the decision was made to basically mothball the Davisville, RI, Seabee base. I think it is still maintained in a state of readiness, but the number of troops and employees were substantially reduced. But he had done his job. We have done our job in the past without a commission. 
   By the way, right now there are lawyers and various people going around the States saying, get ready, there is going to be another BRAC, you better hire me so I can make sure your case is made. I think that is wrong and I thank you for your leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. President, I urge the Members to vote against this base closure commission proposal. I have always opposed this procedure. I opposed it in the House in the eighties, even though I remember talking to Congressman ARMEY from Texas about the merits and demerits and how he could proceed to get it done. He did it quite well. 
   We have been through not one, not two, but 2 1/2 rounds of base closure commissions. I think it is wrong in principle, because we are abdicating, once again, our responsibility to make decisions about what is best for a strong national defense to a commission. For 100 years, if bases, depots, or facilities needed to be closed, the Department of Defense made recommendations to Congress, the Appropriations Committee reviewed the recommendations and made decisions, and bases and facilities were closed. I know of three in my own State of Mississippi that were closed in the fifties and sixties, probably with good justification. 
   I can remember when the Secretary of the Navy was JOHN WARNER of Virginia. Some tough decisions were made, recommendations were made to the Congress, and facilities were closed. The same thing occurred when Senator CHAFEE was Secretary of the Navy. That system worked for 100 years. Some 15 or 20 years ago, it got harder and harder to get Congress to go along with this and the commission idea came along. 
   I think we ought to go back and do it the way it was originally intended. Let's do our job. I think when Members say we will never have any facilities closed, history belies that fact. 
   My next point is, we have been through these 2 1/2 rounds. They were a terrible experience for the communities and for the States involved that have facilities that are impacted. I maintain that we haven't yet quite felt the impact or gotten the benefit of the base closure rounds that have already been done. We still have facilities that have not been completely closed or the environmental cleanup has not been accomplished. We don't know whether we really saved money or not. 
   I urge we not go to another round until we have been able to assess completely how the earlier rounds worked or didn't work, what the cleanup costs were, what the real impact was on the communities. 
   I must say, the timing is terrible, at a time when we are asking our military men and women for more and more in terms of steaming time, time spent on  remote assignments, and, in fact, at this very moment Americans are involved in a bombing campaign in the Balkans. 
   Just last week we passed legislation providing about half a billion dollars to add to facilities in Europe. At a time when we are spending more money for facilities in Europe to upgrade or replace facilities that probably we should have already done, we are talking about setting up a process to close them in the United States. I don't think that is very wise. 
   It also comes at a time when our readiness is falling, when our retention and recruitment is declining. We are trying to do something about that by adding some money for readiness and for the future needs of the military, to increase the pay for our military men and women. This is just one more little stick in 
   the eye that will affect, I think, adversely, the morale of our military men and women. 
   Finally, and not the least, I maintain that last time politics got very much involved in the base closure round. Bases that were supposed to be closed in California and Texas found a way to evade that. It was not just one or two States; it happened in several different places. I don't think the system worked very well. 
   I don't think we should do this now. I think we ought to wait and assess what has happened, do it at a time when we are not basically at war. Let's wait until the next administration comes in. We don't know whether it will be Republican or Democrat. Let's take a look at this thing in 2001. If, in fact, we haven't been able to get rid of some of the excess or unneeded facilities, and if we are not at war, if we have been able to turn around our needs for readiness and the morale and retention of our troops, I will take a look at it. I don't think this is the right thing to do. I don't think it is the right time. I think it is wrong in principle. 
   I could have probably found a way to limit this base closure in a way that would have been responsible, and it would also probably have spared my own State, but I thought that was wrong. I don't think I ought to be trying to find a way to spare my own situation and let others bear the brunt of the decision. We ought to do it all the way or not. 
   What we ought to do is let the Pentagon make the recommendations and act on them. 
   Finally, any Members who think this is fine, don't worry, it will affect somebody else, I have a list here of bases, depots, and facilities that were on the list of earlier base closure rounds that were not closed. These are the likely facilities to be affected. This is not a free vote in isolation, where Members can let somebody else pay the piper. Members can take a look and see how it would impact New York or Michigan or Ohio before casting a vote. Ask yourself when you look at the facilities: Are these excess? Are these unneeded facilities? I think that might affect your decision. 
   We should defeat this. We should go on and pass this very good defense authorization bill that has been developed by the committee, without this provision in there. 
   Maybe another day, another time, would see it differently or we would need to vote differently, but not here and now. I urge the defeat of the base closure commission amendment. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. 
   Mr. President, 137 years ago today, Major General Henry W. Halleck and his 120,000 man strong Union Army commenced the siege of Corinth, Mississippi. The ensuing six month battle between General Halleck's federal troops and General P. G. T. Beauregard's 53,000 Confederate defenders marked a turning point in the war between the states. It was a fierce engagement over a mere 16 square feet parcel. This small piece of real estate was of critical strategic importance to both the North and the South. 
   It was in Corinth, Mississippi that the Memphis and Charleston and Mobile and Ohio Railroads crossed paths. This vital east-west and north-south railroad junction served as a passageway for troops and supplies moving from Illinois to Alabama and from Tennessee to points further east such as South Carolina and Virginia. 
   Ed Bearss, Chief Historian Emeritus of the National Park Service, stated that ``during the Spring of 1862, Corinth was the most important city in the Confederacy and almost the length of the War . . . because of the railroads.'' In fact, because of its status as a vital rail hub, the town was occupied by either Confederate or Union forces from 1861 to 1865. It also served as a springboard for the careers of over 200 leading Confederate and Federal generals who were stationed in Corinth at one time or another. A figure matched by few other locations. 
   Corinth is a city that exemplifies the trials and tribulations experienced by soldiers and civilians throughout the Civil War. A town whose railways lied at the center of a grand military chess match. An area, like many others north and south of the Mason-Dixon line, racked by the ravages of war. 
   Even with its new status as a National Historic Landmark, Corinth is still considered a ``Civil War Landmark At Risk.'' The Civil War Sites Advisory Commission, chartered by Congress to assess threats to America's premier historic sites, identified Corinth as a priority one battlefield in critical need of coordinated nationwide action by the year 2000. Local, state, and national preservation groups agree. And, so do I. 
   Mr. President, today, I am proud and honored to introduce the Corinth Battlefield Preservation Act of 1999. This much needed legislation would provide further protection for one of America's most important Civil War sites by establishing Corinth as a unit of the Shiloh National Military Park. 
   The 106th Congress needs to add the Corinth Battlefield and its surrounding sites to the National Park System given the area's pivotal role in American history. It is also appropriate for Congress to establish Corinth as a unit of the Shiloh National Military Park as these two sites were indelibly linked during the Civil War. The 1862 battle of  Shiloh was actually the first strike in the Union force's overall Corinth Campaign. It was in April 1862, that federal and southern forces competing for control over Corinth first struggled in the Battle of Shiloh/Pittsburg Landing. The battle for Corinth also had international implications. As a result of the Union's victory, the British government chose not to officially recognize the Confederacy. 
   The conflict in and around Corinth eventually included the Battles of Iuka, Tupelo, and Brices' Crossroads, as well as engagements in Booneville, Rienzi, Ripley, and numerous skirmishes in southwest Tennessee and northeast Alabama. 
   In 1862, Union General Halleck said ``Richmond and Corinth ..... are the greatest strategic points of the war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards.'' Halleck's subordinate, General Ulysses S. Grant, regarded Corinth as ``the great strategic position in the west between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers and between Nashville and Vicksburg.'' In arguing for the defense of Corinth, Confederate General Beauregard stated to General Samual Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army that, ``if defeated here [in Corinth,] we lose the Mississippi Valley and probably our cause, whereas we could even afford to lose for a while Charleston and Savannah for the purpose of defeating Buell's army, which would not only insure us the valley of the Mississippi, but our independence.'' Corinth's strategic importance to both armies led to some of the bloodiest battles in the Western Theater. Tens of thousands of soldiers were killed or wounded in this bitter offensive. 
   It was also here that thousands of war refugees, mostly African-Americans from Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama, sought shelter with the Union Army in Corinth. After President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the federal army created a model ``Contraband Camp.'' By the Spring of 1863, the camp housed around 4,000 freedmen. Almost half of these freedmen joined the ``First Alabama Infantry of African Descent'' which later became the ``55th Colored Infantry.'' 
   Corinth is also one of the few existing Civil War sites that boasts extraordinary earthworks and fortifications--many of which remain in pristine condition. A National Park Service studying authority stated that, ``today the surviving [Corinth] earthworks are one of the largest and best preserved groups of field fortifications, dating to 1862 in the United States.'' Unfortunately, many of these historic resources, undisturbed for over 130 years, are now threatened. For example, a 500-yard section of earthworks was specifically sold for development. These earthworks are important to our national heritage because they helped shape the face of war from the 1860's to today. In fact, trench warfare evolved from the battle for Corinth. These earthworks and fortifications are symbolic reminders of the epic struggle that ensued between friends and neighbors and the Civil War's lasting impact on modern warfare. 
   Although, the Battle of Shiloh has been etched into American history as part of the Shiloh National Military Park, a number of important historic sites and resources relating to the pre-battle and the rest of the Corinth Campaign have not been adequately protected or interpreted. Establishing the Shiloh Nationally Military Park as the nation's second Military Park back in 1894 was a good start. Now it is time for the 106th Congress to complete the preservation effort. Congress needs to give a lasting presence to the Corinth Battlefield, a key component of the historic Shiloh-Corinth Corridor. 
   Corinth remains a central transportation gateway. It serves as a junction intersecting Highways 72, running east and west, and Highway 45, which runs north and south. It is also a mecca for dedicated history buffs given the town's close proximity to Shiloh and other Civil War sites and its connection to the Corinth Campaign. 
   I am sure that my colleagues will agree that the sixteen Corinth Civil War sites designated as National Historic Landmarks are far too important to be relegated solely to review in history books or by professional historians. Americans need to see it. 
   The 106th Congress can and must highlight the importance of the Siege and Battle of Corinth for the millions of adults and children, both American and foreign, interested in learning about an essential facet of Americana. 
   For over one hundred years, the United States Congress has advanced the notion that our national interest is best served by preserving America's historic treasures. Not only by ensuring the proper interpretation of important historic events, but also the places--the properties where pivotal military milestones occurred. 
   As Ed Bearss proclaimed, ``the Battle of Corinth was the bloodiest battle in the State of Mississippi. Troops were brought from New Orleans, Mobile, Texas and Arkansas because Corinth was such an important place. With the fall of Corinth, Perryville, Kentucky, and Antietam, Maryland the Confederacy was lost.'' We owe it to our ancestors and to future generations to protect Corinth and the wealth of Civil War history that exudes from this small town. 
   Mr. President, the measure offered today is vital to the successful interpretation and preservation of Corinth. It builds upon previous efforts and gives Corinth its proper status as one of America's most significant Civil War sites. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of the Corinth Battlefield Preservation Act of 1999. A bipartisan measure which is widely supported by local, state, regional, national, and international preservation organizations. 
   Along with the strong local support shown by the residents and local officials of Corinth and Alcorn County as well as assistance from several Civil War preservation groups, I would also like to take a moment to thank Rosemary Williams of Corinth, Woody Harrel, Superintendent of the Shiloh Military Park, and Anne Thompson, Manager of the Interim Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center. They were instrumental in assisting with the preparation of this important historic preservation legislation. 
   Mr. President, I also want to thank my colleagues, Senator COCHRAN, Senator ROBB, and Senator JEFFORDS, for their formal support of this pro-parks, pro-history measure. 
   I hope that the rest of my colleagues will join with us in taking this necessary step to protect our heritage so that our children and grandchildren can gain an understanding of the struggles of this great nation. Struggles that have help shaped our American democracy and transformed our diverse states and peoples into a cohesive and prosperous union better prepared to meet the challenges and opportunities of the next millennium. Corinth has a story to tell Americans today and in the future. Corinth merits inclusion in the Shiloh National Military Park.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering Establishment Act. The bill would create a concentrated focus at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on biomedical imaging and bioengineering. 
   Imaging has been on the forefront of many of our advances in early diagnosis and treatment of disease. Innovative technologies have greatly reduced the need for invasive surgery and provided a remarkable tool for early detection of disease. Breakthroughs in imaging research have direct application to advances in molecular biology and molecular genetics, accelerating the development of new gene therapies and genetic screening. 
   Despite the revolutionary influence of imaging on both research and treatment, the NIH traditionally has not concentrated basic research efforts on the imaging sciences. The bill I am introducing today ensures that research is not only focused in this important field, but that its applications are disseminated across disease fields. The bill also encourages information sharing among federal agencies. Many agencies, such as NASA, do basic imaging research. We should be committed to ensuring that all advances that have applications in our fight against disease are shared with our medical community. 
   I am proud of the commitment that this Congress has made to the National Institutes of Health. We have demonstrated our determination to provide increased federal resources in the fight against disease. I believe that the establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering will compliment those efforts.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what we have now--if I could explain it to the Senate--we have set aside the juvenile justice bill for now. We are going to do the supplemental appropriations bill. We have a 3-hour time agreement with some specific time set up for individual Senators. We also have a waiver of a point of order, with 30 minutes of time equally divided on that. 
   So there will be a vote on that point of order and, I presume, the vote on final passage. At that point, it is our intention to go back to the juvenile justice bill. 
   I say to the Senators who reserved their right to object, I certainly understand why they are doing it. I appreciate it and I want to support their effort. There is no question that more of this bill should have been offset. I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who is probably in the vicinity, does not agree with that. But I have indicated all along I thought there should be more offsets. To Senators ENZI and BROWNBACK, HUTCHINSON, GRAMS, and perhaps SESSIONS--and I am not quite sure if Senator MCCAIN is here to raise that concern also--I certainly am sympathetic, but there was objection heard from Senator DORGAN.

   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Ashcroft-Frist amendment, No. 355, after 20 minutes of debate to be equally divided in the usual form; following that vote, if agreed to, the Senate immediately agree to an amendment to be offered by Senator HARKIN.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, consumers, motor vehicle administrators, law enforcement, and the automotive and insurance industries anxiously await Congressional action on appropriate and workable title branding legislation. Legislation that provides used car purchasers with much needed pre-purchase disclosure information for severely damaged vehicles. 
   As a result of varying state approaches, consumers are not always advised of a vehicle's damage history. The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655, that I introduced back in March, would help correct this problem. It provides grant funds to states to encourage their adoption of uniform terms and procedures for salvage and other severely damaged vehicles. While a mandatory federal scheme was suggested during the last Congress, there were serious Constitutional concerns and the real potential that Congress would create an expensive unfunded mandate on states. The approach taken in S.655 overcomes these problems and provides states with offsetting funding. 
   Mr. President, it is clear that any title branding legislation Congress adopts must contain a rational definition for vehicles that sustain significant water damage. 
   The Congressionally chartered Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee, whose recommendations for curtailing title fraud and automobile theft spurred my sponsorship of S.655, came to the reasoned conclusion that water damage was so potentially insidious in nature that a separate and distinct consumer disclosure category needed to be created. One that distinguished flood vehicles from salvage and nonrepairable vehicles.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize that today is National Maritime Day, when the Nation pays tribute to the American Merchant Mariners who have given their lives in the service of their country. Throughout the history of the United States, our U.S.-flag Merchant Marine has always been there, providing the support that time and again has proven to be essential to victory. It is with the most profound gratitude for the service and sacrifice of America's Merchant Marine veterans that we reflect upon the importance of our U.S.-flag fleet on this day. 
   On April 29, 1999, I was privileged to be given a very special momento by a group of Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. It was a patch, of the kind worn by Merchant Mariners during World War II, and it was designed in 1944 by Walt Disney Studios. Walt Disney's people created a mascot for the Merchant Marine, called ``Battlin' Pete,'' and the patch shows Pete knocking out an Axis torpedo. 
   The presentation was made to express the veterans' gratitude for a very important piece of legislation that the Senate passed last year. Last year's veterans' benefits bill ensures that those American Merchant Marine veterans who served our country in World War II between August 16, 1945--the day that hostilities were officially declared at an end by President Truman--and December 31, 1946--the cut-off day for World War II service for all other service branches--receive honorable discharges for their service and are eligible for veterans' burial and cemetery benefits. This is the least we can do for these deserving veterans. I was privileged to introduce legislation during the 105th Congress seeking that change, and it was later incorporated into the veterans' benefits bill. 
   The overwhelming majority of World War II Merchant Mariners were previously awarded veterans status. Now, those who served in harm's way through the war's final days are also being recognized. Although Japan officially surrendered in August of 1945, harbors in Japan, Germany, Italy, France--indeed, across the world--still were mined. Twenty-two U.S.-government-owned vessels, carrying military cargoes, were damaged or sunk by mines after V-J Day. At least four U.S. Merchant Mariners were killed and 28 injured aboard these vessels. Even as Americans at home were celebrating victory, American Merchant Mariners carried on as they have always done--bravely serving their country with pride and professionalism. 
   I am proud that, at that April ceremony, the first honorable discharges for this previously forgotten group went to two Merchant Marine veterans from my home state of Mississippi: Mr. Robert Hoomes and Mr. Louis Breaux. Also, I was pleased that Mr. Joseph Katusa, National Chairman, Merchant Marine Fairness Committee, received  his honorable discharge. The ceremony was attended by my good friend and colleague, Congressman BOB STUMP, Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee; Mr. Rudy de Leon, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; Admiral Jim Loy, Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard; and Mr. George Searle, National President, American Merchant Marine Veterans. I would like to thank them for participating in the ceremony and acknowledging the service of Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hoomes, and Mr. Katusa, and the role that these, and all, Merchant Marine veterans played in preserving freedom. 
   As we mark National Maritime Day, it is important to note that our country's Merchant Mariners continue to stand ready to serve. In fact, the leaders of the major maritime labor unions--the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association; the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots; the National Maritime Union of America; the American Maritime Officers; and the Seafarers International Union of North America--recently expressed their readiness to support America's military effort in the Balkans. Recent reports that Greek seamen are refusing to support that effort is a reminder of why the United States requires its own highly capable Merchant Marine. 
   Mr. President, I will treasure that patch of ``Battlin' Pete'' from the Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. It will always remind me of the importance of National Maritime Day, and of the sacrifices that America's Merchant Mariner veterans have made in the service of their country. For those who braved the Murmansk run; for those who served through the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf; for those who today stand ready to sail into harm's way with our Armed Forces; we salute you on this day.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator BOB SMITH and Senator. JOHN CHAFEE in introducing the Superfund Program Completion Act. For several years Congress has worked diligently to find common ground for all parties involved, common ground that will also correct the flaws of the original law. Senator SMITH's legislation will do just that. 
   In 1980, Congress approved the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) which was intended to pay for the cleanup of the nation's most hazardous waste sites. This law became known as Superfund--a bit ironic since the law provides no funding, but instead requires those who operated or used the landfill to pay for the cleanup. 
   There is logic and fairness in requiring the polluters to pay for the cleanup; however, Superfund's liability structure was so poorly planned excessive litigation was encouraged. Cleanup did not occur and costs were passed to small businesses across the nation. Superfund did cause unnecessary lawsuits and wasted valuable time, all the while leaving sites across America polluted. 
   Mr. President, this new legislation by Senators SMITH and CHAFEE would exempt those small businesses who acted in good faith and are still being dragged into Superfund as third and fourth party defendants by simply throwing out their household trash. Superfund does not distinguish large from small, nor does it distinguish polluters from responsible businesses. In many instances, these business owners did nothing wrong. Yet, the law penalizes people for something that at one time was legal. 
   Virtually all sides agree that some small businesses should have never been pulled into the system. While this legislation would not be retroactive, it will save small businesses in other communities from future Superfund lawsuits. It is important to reward those who have acted responsibly. I believe Senator SMITH's bill is responsible. 
   Mr. President, I do not believe there is one Senator who is pleased with the way in which the Superfund statute has operated. Like small businesses, recyclers have also been targeted to pay for cleanup. They should not be held responsible for pollution at a Superfund site. The Administration agrees. A majority of the Congress agrees. The environmental community agrees. Senator SMITH's bill will fix the recycler's problem and remain faithful to the environment. 
   Over the past three decades, concern for our environment and natural resources has grown--as has the desire to recycle and reuse. This makes environmental sense. This legislation would remove an unintended yet troublesome legal obstacle to recycling. This bill corrects current law and encourages recycling. It simply recognizes that recycling is not disposal and that recyclables are not waste. Common sense tells us that recycling something is not the same as disposing of it. 
   This bill will help level the playing field between the use of recycled goods and competitive virgin raw materials. Currently suppliers of virgin raw materials face no Superfund liability for contamination caused by the consumer. This bill will supply the same waiver to those who sell recyclable materials. 
   This bill also contains protections to ensure that sham recyclers are unable to benefit from this exemption. In order for recyclers to be relieved of Superfund liability, they must act in an environmentally sound manner and sell their product to manufacturers with environmentally responsible business practices. Considering that most recyclers are currently operating in a reasonable and conscience manner, this should be an easy test. 
   Mr. President, the recycling portion of the bill is the product of lengthy negotiations between the federal and state governments, the environmental community and the recycling industry. It serves only one purpose--to remove from the liability loop those who collect and ship recyclables to a third party site. These negotiations have resulted in a provision that I believe to be both environmentally and fiscally sound. By removing the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, we will encourage more recycling. 
   Mr. President, while this provision is not precisely the Superfund Recycling Equity Act which Senator DASCHLE and I introduced last year--a bill which was supported by 63 of our Senate colleagues--I look forward to working with all parties to ensure we pass a bill that the Administration, environmentalists, and industry can support. 
   Mr. President, I will also work with my colleagues to ensure that no Superfund taxes will be reinstated. After many years and millions and millions of dollars spent by the government, large businesses, municipalities, schools, and small businesses, only a fraction of the costs has been devoted to cleanup. This cannot continue to happen. 
   I have seen a copy of the May 14, 1999, letter from Senators CHAFEE and SMITH to the Environmental Protection Agency, and I completely agree with its conclusions. There is no need for additional tax revenue. I want to quote from their letter because the Senators said it just right. 
   ``Many responsible parties who have already paid for their own cleanups would also be liable for reimposed taxes. They are frankly unwilling to see the tax reinstated unless there are sweeping reforms in the structure of the program, as well. We find their arguments persuasive. We will not vote to reimpose the tax, unless it is part of a comprehensive Superfund reform.'' 
   ``There is a second reason for our opposition to a tax extension at this time. As we noted in a recent letter to Administrator Browner, Congress has appropriated $15.9 billion for Superfund from its inception through 1988. The Superfund Trust Fund was created to facilitate rapid cleanups carried out by the federal government's expenditures would be recovered from responsible parties once the cleanup action was complete. This is real ``polluters pay'' principle.'' 
   ``However, only a small percentage of the $15.9 billion has been recovered. To date, the Agency has obtained commitments to recover $2.4 billion. EPA has written off $5 billion of past expenditures and GAO reports that another $1.9 billion is likely unrecoverable because EPA did not properly calculate its indirect costs. This is a troubling record. A good cost recovery program that actually made the real polluters (as opposed to the taxpaying industries) pay could have recovered sufficient funds to carry Superfund through another authorization cycle without the reimposition of taxes. We are reluctant to ask Superfund taxpayers to once again prop up a Trust Fund that EPA has allowed to dwindle.'' 
   Mr. President, I'm very impressed with the Chairman CHAFEE and Chairman SMITH have done in getting this bill drafted and introduced. They are also working on a second major environmental bill in the waste area--RCRA. Last year we jointly requested a report from the GAO on what saving and efficiencies can be achieved with rifle shot fixes. This year Senators CHAFEE and SMITH have been diligently working on finalizing a legislative approach that is compatible to this GAO study. I know their staffs have been consulting with all the stakeholders, and I look forward to seeing this bill this summer. Hopefully, both bills will have a chance to advance through the legislative process so that the full Senate can consider them. Both approaches are reforms that Americans deserve and need. 
   As environmentalists talk about laws which protect the environment, Congress must determine who actually bears the burden of cost, and determine the balance. Superfund does not discriminate. The way Superfund is being implemented, it attacks our neighbors, our schools, and even our corner grocers. The Superfund Program Completion Act makes positive strides toward  correcting the balance and reflects society's progress from the 80's and incorporates the methods of the 90's.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena for testimony and document production in an action brought by the United States Customs Service in the Court of International Trade against Nippon Miniature Bearing, Inc., and its parent and subsidiary, alleging false representations to Customs about the composition of imported bearings. The defendants have subpoenaed Tim Osborn, a former employee of the Senate Committee on Small Business, seeking to depose him regarding his communications with the Customs Service and others about this investigation. Mr. Osborn's activities were on behalf of the Small Business Committee, in preparing for and conducting a September 1988 oversight hearing of the Customs Service concerning its enforcement of laws affecting the bearing industry. The information that the defendants seek therefore is privileged from compelled discovery from the Congress under the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause. 
   This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to provide representation in order to move to quash the subpoena and otherwise protect the Senate's privileges in this matter. The resolution would authorize Mr. Osborn and any other former Member or employee of the Senate to testify and produce documents in this case only to the extent consistent with these privileges.

   Mr. LOTT. I think everybody is trying in good faith to find a way to deal with this issue and move on. I thought that idea just proposed might work, but it looks as if that would be objected to. 
   What I would like to propose as an alternative--and it is being typed up now, and we want both sides to look at it--is that we go forward. We set aside the pending amendment, and we go forward with a series of votes, including probably the managers' package, which a lot of people have been interested in and concerned about. They would be able to see what it was. And then go to the Lautenberg amendment and have a vote. Then go to a Smith-Jeffords amendment and have a vote. Then go to Wellstone and have a vote, and then to a McConnell. 
   So we would have a series of stacked votes while we continue to work to see how we can resolve other outstanding issues. But rather than just continuing to talk back and forth without making progress, looking at the hour here, if we could have a series of, I believe it would be five votes--six votes now--I think that would be one way to give us time so we could make progress and  give us time to continue to work on these other issues.

In a show of good faith, an indication from Senator LEAHY was that Senators would like to have that done and see what is in it. We would put that first in the pecking order, which would not be the way it is always done, but it would be constructive. Then Lautenberg, I think, would be the next pending thing. And these others, I am not sure of the exact order they are in, but I propose that we do them that way so we can move forward.

We have had a good lengthy discussion today, and there is a fundamental disagreement on this. At some point, I hope the Senator from Iowa--like on Lautenberg and on these others, we worked through this without second-degreeing, without obstructing. You all have had some amendments you don't like, and we have had a few amendments we don't like, but in the end you vote. If you win, you win; if you lose, you lose. It still has to go to conference and all that. I hope we can get an agreement on this. I don't think anybody is disadvantaged. I think everybody will think they have had a fair shot.

Let me make it clear at the beginning, Mr. President, we don't want to in any way dispossess the Senator from Iowa from his opportunity to be further heard, if he so desires, on his position with regard to the Ashcroft-Frist amendment. I ask in this agreement that that discussion be set aside and we go to four other amendments and have the debate and stacked votes on those amendments. 
   I will state the agreement which Senator DASCHLE had a chance to review. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside and the Senate proceed immediately to the managers' package, and following that amendment, the following amendments be considered for votes in the following sequence, under time agreements where noted, in the usual form. 
   I want to emphasize, the managers' package would go first; there would be some description of that. We understand that would probably not require a recorded vote. I further ask consent that the amendments be voted in the order listed below, with 2 minutes for debate prior to each vote for explanation. In other words, we will have 2 hours of debate on the first one, then go to the other amendments, but before the actual votes occur there will be 2 minutes for final explanation, and that all provisions of the consent agreement of May 14 be in place.

   We have narrowed down the number of amendments to a finite list. Senator REID has worked very diligently to accomplish that. We must deal with the supplemental appropriations bill before we go. In order to do that, we will have to have some cooperation. 
   I have been criticized because I have maybe tried to be too fair, everybody has that fair, straight-up shot: No second-degrees, make your point, have the vote, win some, lose some. If we go with that attitude, we can complete this list and the other amendments and complete this bill and do the supplemental.

We would have to dispose of that and then we would go to, I hope, a series of additional stacked amendments which would lead off, I presume, with Lautenberg right at the front. 
   In order to do that before we did Ashcroft-Frist, we would have to get another agreement. I would like to do it because I think that is an issue that a lot of people feel very strongly about. I would like to do it like the rest. It is time to vote.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I would like to propound. First, obviously, we have had the last vote for the night. I thank the managers of the bill for their diligent efforts. I thank Senator REID for his efforts, and Senator ASHCROFT, and Senator FRIST, and Senator HARKIN, and Senator LAUTENBERG, who  have all been willing to at least make concessions so that we can make progress. Senator DASCHLE and I appreciate that. The consent we will ask would provide for two amendments to be brought up in the morning, and it would be the Gordon Smith/Jeffords amendment, followed by the Lautenberg amendment, with a vote on both of those at 10:30. The pending business is still the Harkin amendment, but we would intend at that time to go to the supplemental bill. We are going to try to get a 2-hour time agreement on that. When that is over, we will be back where we stood with the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. That summarizes the agreement. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the Gordon Smith/Jeffords amendment there be 60 minutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form on the Gordon Smith amendment and amendment No. 362, the Lautenberg amendment, to run concurrently beginning at 9:30 a.m. Thursday, and all other provisions of the consent agreement of May 14 remain in place and the amendment be laid down tonight prior to the close of Senate business. 
   I further ask consent that the vote occur on the Gordon Smith-Jeffords amendment just prior to the vote on amendment 362, under the same time restraints and provisions as provided above. 
   I further ask that the Senate resume amendment No. 355 immediately following the disposition of amendment No. 362.

Both sides of this issue don't want to lose their positions. But this will allow us to do these two amendments and to do the supplemental, and then that will be the pending issue. We know we have to find a way to get to a conclusion. 
   I want to emphasize now that we will do the supplemental after those first 2 votes.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself some of the leader time if necessary. I thank Senator MCCAIN for his continuing effort on this important legislation. 
   I wonder how many people or how many Senators think the solution to the year 2000 computer problem is litigation, lawsuits. I don't believe most Senators believe that is the answer. I know the American people don't believe that is the answer. What they want is a solution. They want us to do everything we can to help small business men and women and the computer industry, everybody, address the problem. If we don't get it done by the year 2000, they certainly don't want lawsuits to be the solution. 
   That is what is at stake. I have acted in good faith. I know Senator MCCAIN has. I was assured last week by Senator DODD of Connecticut that they were ready to go forward, that a number of Democrats would join the overwhelming Republican vote to support getting cloture. 
   I want to emphasize this is on the motion to proceed. People need to understand that. This apparently is going to be an effort by the Democrats to block even taking up the bill to deal with this Y2K litigation problem. 
   This is the second time in 3 weeks political games are being played with a very serious issue. If that is the way it is to be, I want the American people to understand the Democrats do not want a solution. They want to play games with this bill and they want litigation. That is what really is at stake. 
   As majority leader, I have to try to deal with a lot of important issues, including the juvenile justice bill, supplemental appropriations for disasters, the situation in Kosovo, bankruptcy legislation, Department of Defense authorization, a whole long list of bills. We can't keep bringing up this bill or other bills. So this is it until somebody shows me that there is a good-faith effort. 
   As far as having votes on alternatives, I think Senator MCCAIN and other managers would be glad to do that. If somebody has an alternative proposal--by Senator KERRY, Senator DASCHLE --fine, let's vote on that. But to just block even the consideration of this bill I think is very questionable action. 
   I hope the Senator will find a way to deal with this. At some point, if somebody shows me they are ready to go and we go to the substance and we have the votes to pass it, fine. Otherwise, the Democrats have on their shoulders the fact they have killed the Y2K legislation. Let them explain it to the businesspeople of this country, the men and women who have small businesses and to the computer industry, because that is where the problem is. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again how disappointed I am that it appears the Senate did not want to deal with the question of the year 2000 computer liability problem. I think that is a devastating blow for business and industry in this country, big and small,  as well as the computer industry. If we do not do this, I predict by this time next year our courts will be clogged with lawsuits. I do not believe that is the answer to the problem.

   Mr. LOTT. It is anticipated that following those tributes, some time might be spent hearing further from Senators expressing their concern at and disappointment about the vote against cloture on the motion to proceed to the Y2K issue. Then we will work with the Democratic leadership and the managers of the juvenile justice bill to see how we can proceed on that bill after the policy luncheon hour or two hours. Hopefully, we could have some wrap-up debate on amendments that were offered Friday and Monday, because some of those amendments were offered and some debate was heard but the other side was not heard on that particular amendment, and it could have been from either side of the aisle. So some additional time might be needed for that, and I was thinking of maybe a series of stacked votes. 
   We have some 13 amendments that are pending. Hopefully, we would not have to have a recorded vote on all of those, but whatever number would be required, and then see if we can work for a way to complete the juvenile justice bill in a reasonable period of time with a reasonable number of amendments on both sides, and then go tomorrow, hopefully, not later than noon, to the supplemental appropriations bill, assuming the House passes that this afternoon or tonight. 
   I think it would be irresponsible for us to delay any longer than is absolutely necessary to take up this legislation. It has been pending too long. It is supposed to be an emergency, supposed to deal with disasters in Central America, in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as the defense needs in support of our men and women who are flying bombing raids right now over Kosovo. It would be my intent, as soon as we receive it from the House, to go to that legislation. It is still my hope that we can complete juvenile justice in a reasonable period of time.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, based on that request and a full measure of trying to be reasonable and get an agreement to get this worked out and completed, because I think juvenile crime in this country is a very serious issue, for the Senate to not deal with it seriously and to complete action would be indefensible. 
   My problem, as the majority leader, is that we have the supplemental, which is not going to be completed in 2 hours. This bill is going to take some discussion. I think it is a tragedy that we are not going to do the Y2K issue, but I am interested in getting a result. I think if we can get some cooperation, we can achieve that. 
   Keep in mind that we have had some 25 amendments, I believe, that have been offered and debated. This would call for 20 more. That is 45 amendments on a bill that has been in the making for 2 years. So I think my request is reasonable, and it is my third or fourth attempt to find some sort of time agreement. 
   I thought and was assured that we would work to complete this bill last Thursday. That didn't work out. And I understand. Sometimes the leadership on both sides of the aisle has goals we wish to achieve, but the rest of the troops don't necessarily follow and fall in line, so we can't quite fulfill that commitment. But the suggestion was made, well, we will have amendments Friday and Monday, and we would vote on a series of amendments Tuesday morning, final passage by noon. That was objected to. Then we said, how about 5, with more amendments after the stacked votes on Tuesday morning. That was objected to. Then I said 6. That was objected to. 
   Now I am saying, how about getting what we have standing, 20 more amendments, and complete it by noon on Wednesday so we can go to the supplemental. I think I am bending over backwards, not because I want more of the type of debate that I heard last week where Senators even object to a Senator amending their own amendment. I didn't realize that happened in the Senate. I was very disappointed with that action. But instead, we must come together and seriously try to deal with this problem. 
   I know there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to do that, and I am anxious to find a way to get it done and get it completed. I will withhold this request. I hope the managers will work through this, while we are having this very well-deserved tribute to Admiral Nance, and then after the luncheon hopefully we can wrap up some agreement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his very kind and heartfelt comments. I know Senator HELMS appreciates it very much also. 
   In case it hasn't been announced, I want all Senators to be aware that Admiral Nance's graveside services will be at Arlington National Cemetery at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, tomorrow. For any Senators who would like to be there and participate, I am sure it will be a beautiful and appropriate ceremony. 
   I served 4 years as a staff member on the House side, working for the chairman of the Rules Committee. Now I have served 26 years in the House and the Senate. I have a very enduring appreciation for the importance and the loyalty, the dedication and the fine service that we receive from our staffs, both in this Chamber, in our committee work, and on our personal staffs. 
   Admiral Nance was one of those unique staff members, though, who had a very close personal relationship, beyond a normal staff relationship, with the chairman of the committee, but also with a lot of Senators. When I first came to the Senate, I found myself more than once back in the back room seeking the advice and counsel of Admiral Nance, and he always took the time to try to explain the situation and try to make clear what was in the country's best national interests. And so I feel a personal sense of loss. 
   When you go through life and then you sort of get to the end of your road and you look back, I think there are really at least three things you hope for: a good name, good friends, and, hopefully, a little good fortune. But very important on that list is good friends. 
   I have had the privilege of having some great friends, going back to my childhood days at Duck Hill, MS, people I still stay in touch with from high school and college years. We still get together. In less than 2 weeks, we are all going to be together at the marriage of my daughter. My friends from high school and college will be there. I know that when you are in the greatest need of comforting, the greatest need of counsel, there are few friends that you turn to. 
   So we have had this unique relationship with Rear Admiral James W. ``Bud'' Nance and our beloved chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the senior Senator from North California. He was born in Monroe, NC--most folks probably have never heard of it, or certainly have never been there--a small town, one block from the home of JESSE HELMS. I wonder how many blocks there are in Monroe--probably not many. But this son of the South from North Carolina went to the Naval Academy, a 1944 graduate. He was a gunnery officer on the U.S.S. North Carolina at Iwo Jima. He was a combat pilot in Korea and Vietnam. He was a test pilot. He was commander of the U.S.S. Raleigh, a cruiser, and commander of the U.S.S. Forrestal, one of our great carriers in history. 
   I had the pleasure one time of landing on the deck of that carrier. It was a tremendous experience. My attitude ever since has been: I have done that. I don't want to do it anymore. 
   To be commander of that great vessel is the height of success in many people's lives. But he went beyond that. He went on to be Deputy National Security Adviser in the Reagan administration. And then, of course, for the last 6 years, he was staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   His wife, Mary Lyda, and their two sons--I know Phil--are grateful to have had this man as husband and father. We all have been enriched and are better off because of his service to 
   our country and to this institution and to his friend. 
   Bud Nance, sailor, public servant, patriot. God rest his soul. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Today, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. It is expected the Senate will resume debate on the juvenile justice bill this afternoon. Senators who have amendments on the list with respect to the juvenile justice bill should be prepared to offer their amendments today. I understand at least three Senators are prepared to offer one or more amendments, so that will take up, I am sure, a considerable amount of time. I understand that Senator SANTORUM and Senator WELLSTONE and Senator MCCONNELL have amendments they will be prepared to offer this afternoon. No rollcall votes will occur during today's session. 
   Also, today it is the intention of the leadership to debate the Y2K legislation for an hour or so at the end of the day, which would then, of course, take us over into tomorrow, when, under a previous unanimous consent agreement, there will be a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to Y2K at 9:45 a.m. 
   For the remainder of the week, the Senate will, hopefully, complete action on the juvenile justice bill and the Y2K legislation. Also, the Senate will turn to the supplemental appropriations conference report. I understand that may not be available until late tomorrow afternoon or perhaps even Wednesday. Exactly when that will be brought up will depend, in part at least, on the disposition of these other two bills. Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout each day and into the evening, if necessary, although I would not anticipate a late night on Tuesday, but we could have to go into late nights Wednesday and Thursday. 
   On Friday, we will not have any legislative business even 
   though we may have a pro forma session. There is a Democratic retreat similar to the one the Republicans had last month, and that is scheduled for Friday. So we will not have any recorded votes so that they can attend this meeting. 
   Mr. President, I want to again ask for cooperation by Senators in offering amendments and also trying to complete action on these two very important bills. The Y2K liability issue is one of growing concern. If you read the newspapers Friday and Saturday, you learned that there is a growing problem with small businesses trying to become Y2K compliant. There is a great deal of consternation about the liability exposure, and this bill provides a way for these problems to be addressed without leading to a myriad of lawsuits. I have even seen one statement that the Y2K litigation costs could exceed the cost of asbestos, breast implants, and tobacco litigation. That is massive. I do not know whether that is accurate or not, but it is a problem with which we need to try to deal. 
   Also, on juvenile justice, this underlying bill has been in the making for 2 years. We have had amendments, and we will have other amendments offered with regard to violence in the schools, how you deal with that, with the impact of certain laws that we already have on the books as to schools and, of course, gun amendments. I hope we can come to a reasonable agreement of how we can complete both of these bills this week and then go to the supplemental appropriations bill and be prepared late this week or early next week to turn to the defense authorization bill. At a time when we have our men and women engaged in combat, we need to go ahead and move this very important piece of legislation. 
   So those, along with the DOD appropriations bill, I hope to have completed by a week from Thursday night before the Memorial Day recess. 
   With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I observe the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent passage of the juvenile justice bill, S. 254, occur no later than 6 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, May, 18, 1999. 
   Let me emphasize that this is the third request I have made to try to find a way to have fair debate on amendments and votes and a conclusion at some point. Last week, I had suggested we take Friday and Monday to have a number of amendments offered and debated, as we are doing. We asked that the votes on amendments occur on Tuesday morning and that final passage occur by noon. That was objected to. So I said we could have votes on Tuesday morning on the amendments, continue on amendments with votes throughout the afternoon, and complete it by 5 on Tuesday. That was objected to. 
   This now moves it another hour. Before there is a reservation or objection, let me emphasize why I am doing this. We had thought we could take up this juvenile justice bill that has been in the process for 2 years, have debate, amendments and votes, and complete it by last Thursday night, since we started on Monday. We had Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. That turned out not to be practical because there were other amendments still pending, even though we had taken up 15 amendments, and I think now we have taken up probably 20 or more. We thought about trying to continue on Friday and Monday and then complete it on Tuesday. 
   This week, we don't have a Friday session because there is a Democratic retreat, so we won't be able to have legislative business or votes on Friday. Let me emphasize that is not intended to be critical because we had a similar Friday last month for Republicans. We each take one Friday during the year to do that and it makes sense to do that. 
   During this week, we have a vote or votes on the Y2K liability issue, which is very important to small businesses, to industry people trying to comply with the Y2K bill. The computer industry in general has a tremendous liability problem that should be treated as finding a way to solve the problem rather than just trying to find a way to have a whole lot of lawsuits. 
   We also have a supplemental appropriations bill. Unlike some supplemental appropriations bills that go through here lickety-split in an hour or two, this one very well may take some time. It is large and has a lot of moving parts. It needs to be explained completely. In order to complete Y2K, the juvenile justice bill and supplemental appropriations, we have Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday--3 days. We will have to find some way to get some time agreements and move these bills through to completion. 
   That is my request.

   Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I regret the objection by our Democratic colleagues. This juvenile justice bill is critically important. Just last night here in the Washington suburbs, two 15-year-old young men were charged with murder and charged as adults. This is not new. This is a pattern that has evolved not only here in this metropolitan area but across the country. I think this juvenile justice legislation is very important and is long overdue. As a result of the objection from the minority, I have to say it looks as if at this point it will be difficult to get this bill done this week without this sort of concept of final passage. 
   I am trying to get some way to identify how to get this bill done. I want this juvenile justice bill done. It has been in the mill for 2 years. I think we need it. We had good debates, we had some amendments, and I presume we will have more amendments. If we can't get some sort of time agreement, we will never reach a conclusion. There is a finite number of amendments, but I think it must be 40 or 50 amendments that are still pending. None of the three consents I propounded has been cleared by the minority, and I do find this very disturbing. 
   Having said that, I realize that the Democratic leader is not here. He will be coming in later on this afternoon and we will, I am sure, confer together. I assume my colleagues want this bill completed. Let me state where I am. 
   Give me some practical suggestion. What are we talking about here? Hours? Days? Weeks? Months? I think the Democrats think they found a good issue, but I don't think it's a good issue if we don't deal with the problem of juvenile crime in this country, if we don't deal with the problem of violence in our society and the cultural decline in our country, and with the gun amendments that have already been debated. So I think we ought to find a way to get it done. Let's find a way to do it, because we have other legislation we have to deal with: a great big liability problem with Y2K, a tremendous problem with the need for disaster supplemental appropriations, and funds for our military men and women who have been doing bombing raids right now. 
   I think we ought to try to get that done. All I am trying to do is find a way to do those three bills this week. And with your help, we will keep looking for it and hopefully we will find a way to get it done. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators--and I see there are a few still interested in what the schedule may be; a few have decided they will worry about it next week--I will propound a unanimous consent agreement now that would allow for a list of amendments to be locked in and passage time of this vital piece of legislation. 
   I know that Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY, Senator BIDEN, and Senator SESSIONS have spent a lot of time trying to craft this legislation, and there are some good features in here. I am sure there are a lot of Senators who have agreed or disagreed with certain parts of it, but there are a lot of good things that have been included. If this agreement can be entered into, then this vote that would be coming up would be the last vote until Tuesday morning. If the agreement cannot be reached, then we have no other alternative but to keep going forward today and have votes to try to dispense with this legislation. 
   I think it is important that we get the list locked in and find a way to bring it to a reasonable conclusion, with Senators being able to offer amendments and have debate during the day today and on Monday, and then we would have votes on Tuesday and Tuesday night. 
   It is very hard for the leadership to try to honor all Senators' requests. First of all, all Senators knew that we would be having votes today, and yet a lot of them have complained about it and have now left. It is very hard to get amendments accommodated and voted on when Senators say: I do not want to vote Thursday night. Or when we have Senators that say: I have to be gone Friday. Or when we have Senators say: I have amendments I want to offer, but I don't want to do it Thursday night, Monday or Friday. I want to do it Tuesday afternoon when it is convenient for me, even though it may inconvenience 99 other Senators. 
   I am asking Senators, please, be reasonable. I know on both sides there has been an effort to narrow down the list and get a way that we could have votes on key amendments and bring it to a conclusion. But it is very hard when you have that kind of attitude with Senators saying: I don't want to do it on Thursday night or I don't want to do it on Friday or I don't want to do it on Monday. I would like to do it at my pleasure, Wednesday afternoon. 
   I hope we can at least lock in amendments where they won't continue to grow. We have had a lot of good debate and a lot of good amendments. 
   I now ask consent the following amendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments in order, with relevant second-degree amendments in order only after a vote on or in relation to the amendment and the amendments limited to time agreements where noted, all to be equally divided in the usual form. 
   I further ask that all first-degree amendments be offered and debated on Friday and Monday's session of the Senate, with votes stacked to occur in the order offered beginning at 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday, with 5 minutes for debate equally divided prior to each vote. 
   I further ask that following the disposition of the listed 
   first-degree amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage to occur, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   I do have a list of amendments and I need to, I believe, read and submit them. I will just send it to the desk. 
   I believe Senators REID and DASCHLE have a list of amendments on their side they would like--are you going to submit those to the desk now?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will have another suggestion on what we might be able to do in a moment. I want to remind Senators that next week we have the Y2K liability issue that we need to have concluded. The House has voted on that. The clock is running. This is not an issue we can leave unclarified any longer, because we are fast approaching the time when this liability question has to be known and dealt with in one way or the other because we are fast approaching the turn of the clock into the next millennium. We also have, after a lot of difficulty, the supplemental appropriations bill, which we have waiting in the wings. We need to bring that up. We also have the bankruptcy bill that is scheduled for next week--a bill that has overwhelming bipartisan support on both sides. That bill is beginning now to be squeezed out of the picture because of other bills. 
   I want to complete this bill. Two years of effort has been put into juvenile justice, and we need to have some decision made in that area. We have had amendments, and more will be offered, on violence in the schools and how we deal with it, and violence in the movies, and the gun issue. So we need to try to find a way to conclude it. 
   I will then propound another UC, the same as the earlier one, with votes occurring on Tuesday morning, stacked. Those amendments that had been debated on Friday and Monday, beginning at 9:45, with 5 minutes of debate; and instead of asking that following disposition of the listed first-degree amendments the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur all without any intervening action or debate, I will modify that to say we will go to third reading and final passage at 5 o'clock on Tuesday. That way, we would have the debate on amendments the rest of today, on Monday, votes on Tuesday morning, more amendments and debate with time limits, and final passage to occur no later than 5 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. 
   Then we would be prepared to have a vote on the Y2K liability issue and go to the supplemental on Thursday, hopefully completing it. Although the supplemental can't be completed probably in just a couple of hours; it will take a little longer. Then we would go to bankruptcy after that. I will make that request. The Senator suggested that we go ahead and use the bulk of Tuesday. I think that is fair, and I hope we can get this agreed to. 
   Remember, I made a commitment to call up this bill so we could have this debate, and I made a commitment to bring it up on last Tuesday, I guess. Actually, we started on Monday. We agreed we would work to try to complete it on Thursday. That effort has been made by Senator DASCHLE, along with Senator REID, and I appreciate that. We haven't been able to achieve that. So we will have other amendments and debate on Friday, Monday, votes on Tuesday morning, more debate, amendments and votes Tuesday afternoon, but finish it up Tuesday. That will have been a full week. That will have been 7 days we will have spent on it. I believe that we will have been able to craft, hopefully, a good bill, and we have all been able to make our case and get to a conclusion. I make that request.

   Mr. LOTT. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. At least we have locked in the amendments where they will not continue to multiply. But I don't view this as a positive development. It is unfortunate. If Senators are waiting to see if there are any now, there will not be any further rollcall votes today. The next rollcall vote will occur probably at 9:30 Tuesday morning. But we will need to make sure, and we will make the Democratic leader aware of the exact time and the vote. I presume that vote will be on Y2K. 
   I yield to Senator LEAHY.

   Mr. LOTT. If I could respond, just to show you what I am talking about, at least this stops them from multiplying. But this is a pathetic accomplishment. There are 100 Senators, and we have about 75 amendments left. Please, let's get serious. Every Senator doesn't have to offer an amendment. We can make our case about what we think is positive juvenile justice and what is causing the violence in our country and the violence in our schools. I think it is a societal and a cultural problem. I don't think it is as a result of guns in this country. It is why these things are happening, not what and who. 
   This is very minimal. It is a very, very disappointing accomplishment. We will have to evaluate now how to proceed.

   Mr. LOTT. If we have to spend a month on a bill, or 6 weeks on a bill, how many bills are we going to be able to take up that are important to our country? The defense authorization bill is one that we have to take up next week. It is extraordinarily important, because here we are with our troops engaged in combat at this very moment. We have to get that work done. 
   It is a very interesting crossfire you get into when we are saying, wait a minute, we have to have 99 amendments, we have to have 6 weeks, or 11 days, on this piece of legislation.

   Mr. LOTT. Then the argument is, why aren't we doing more bills? You can't have it both ways. 
   Give it a reasonable time, give it full debate, have reasonable amendments, and then vote. 
   I, frankly, feel used and put upon. I thought we were going to have a good debate, have amendments, and complete this by Thursday night. I understood there was good effort being made. We said, OK, we will be in on Friday, debate all day on Friday, and debate all day on Monday, with votes Tuesday, and all day Tuesday. There has to be an end to this. There has to be some reasonableness. 
   But look, we made our point, and now that we have the amendments locked in, hopefully the managers and others can find a way to figure out how to end this. When they do, give me a call.

But what I suggested was the amendments be offered on Monday, on Friday, and debated, that amendments be offered all day Monday--the Senator could surely get his amendment offered on Monday, and I think it is one that ought to be offered and debated--have the debate, and then on Tuesday we would vote on all those amendments that had been offered up to that point, and have votes. Then we would go on to other amendments with time limits agreed to during Tuesday afternoon, and then have those voted on, and final passage by Tuesday afternoon. 
   That was objected to. 
   The problem is, Senators don't want to offer their amendments on Mondays or Fridays or Tuesday afternoons. It really makes me question whether they are serious about getting to a conclusion.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, No. 351. I am pleased to join Senator ALLARD from Colorado in offering this amendment. 
   It would allow the erecting of an appropriate and constitutional permanent memorial on the campus of any public school to honor students and teachers who have been murdered at the school and allow students, faculty, and administrative staff of the public school to hold an appropriate service on their campus to honor these students and teachers. 
   I am horrified to find, and I think the American people would be horrified to find, that there are those in this country who object to having appropriate memorial services on the school campuses for teachers and students who are murdered. This should clearly be included in this legislation. 
   I am pleased to join Senator ALLARD in that amendment.

   Mr. LOTT. First of all, Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY, the managers of the bill, are not on the floor at this time. I assume they are still in the area. And I have a call in to Senator HATCH so he will come back. And we can discuss how we might proceed and see what amendments we are talking about. Because you can certainly understand, it is hard to have the debate go forward without the managers knowing what amendments we are talking about, and that they are sort of in an order. 
   I understand the Kohl amendment, for instance, was next in order, and maybe even pretty much has been worked out. But I need to make sure that that is the case. And then, secondly, there may still be somebody opposed to it and have indicated they want to be able to be heard on the other side. So we have to make sure that Senators both for and against bills are protected in their desire to speak on an amendment. And that is basically it. 
   Senator KOHL is here. If there is no particular problem, then maybe we could go to that one and have him present it and make his statement. If there is a Senator opposed to it, he or she could come over. If not, we could go on. But there is a need to make sure that everybody knows what is happening. And both sides are aware that they should come to the floor and express themselves if they desire to. 
   The problem is, it is 12:15; it is Friday afternoon. As you know, it is very hard to work down this list of amendments when--once Senators realize basically the votes are over, they have commitments, and they are gone. But I will talk with Senator HATCH as soon as we get in touch with him and see if there is any problem with going forward with Senator KOHL. Then, of course, we need to go back and see if there is another amendment on this side. We will work through that. But we have to make sure everybody is notified we are going to be trying to do it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. On that particular point, I do not know what the vote would be on the cloture on the motion to proceed on Y2K. I suspect it may pass, maybe even pass unanimously. At that point we are on that unless we can get an agreement to come back to the juvenile justice bill, which I assume we could do, but with the understanding we get something worked out as to how we proceed. 
   I have been signaling all week that we wanted to go back to Y2K especially, and we need to get started early since we had to file a cloture motion on even the motion to proceed. But you know, if we can get a solid, overwhelming vote on that, rather than spending 30 hours on it, hopefully something could be worked out on that as to how we would proceed to that, maybe right after the juvenile justice bill, and that we could get agreement to come back to juvenile justice at that point. 
   It is just that I had to get that ball rolling. And I assume and I hope maybe that is just one vote in what could be a series of votes. But hopefully we will get something worked out on that. But I wanted to make sure that--I am certainly amenable to trying to work out an agreement to go back to juvenile justice after we have that vote Tuesday morning.

   Mr. LOTT. I wonder if the Senator would yield. Is there a possibility we could work out some agreement where we wouldn't have to have the vote on the motion to proceed? It is pretty hard to explain to people, when you are facing the threat of a filibuster even to take up a bill. So I wonder if we could maybe get some agreement to skip over that and then go on, if we had to have a cloture vote on the bill itself. I hope you will think about that or talk to the people who are involved to see if that would be a possibility. That would perhaps then vitiate the necessity of having to get this started next Tuesday in order to get it completed within a week's time. If we could get around that vote, that would help.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators for hosting a demonstration of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) today in Arlington, Virginia. 
   Staff representing Senators from both sides of the aisle were shown how the national titling information system will allow participating states to track a motor vehicle from essentially birth to death. NMVTIS will let DMVs and consumers know where a vehicle was previously titled and which, if any, brands have been associated with the vehicle. It will also let law enforcement know if a vehicle being registered or titled is stolen. Again, this is crucial disclosure information for states, car buyers, and police forces across the country. 
   It is a system that is consistent with advances in technology. One that allows states to share information over the wire. NMVTIS makes a great deal of sense as state governments move to paperless systems and greater use of the Internet to share information with their citizenry. 
   Mr. President, Congress directed the establishment of NMVTIS as part of the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992. In part, to curtail motor vehicle theft, but also to allow states to share ``real time'' up-to-date vehicle information. 
   It is clear though, that the effectiveness of a national titling information system depends on maximum state participation. Congress knew this when it authorized incentive grants to encourage states to use the system. A minimum of $300,000 is available to a state to offset its implementation costs. 
   Virginia, often a technology leader, embraced NMVTIS early and agreed to be the first state to pilot test the system. It will have the system online at all DMVs this June. Indiana, Massachusetts, Florida, and Arizona are also in the process of implementing NMVTIS. Kentucky and New Hampshire are not far behind. Both states submitted formal grant applications to the Department of Justice which oversees NMVTIS. Additionally, a number of states have also sent letters of interest and are hopeful to obtain startup funding this year. These include: Alabama, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. 
   It is expected that 21 states will be full partners in the national titling system by 2000 and that all states will choose to participate in the system by 2003. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate Virginia and the other participating states for leading the way. NMVTIS is one significant tool that will be used to combat title fraud and vehicle theft. With NMVTIS, and appropriate and workable uniform salvage vehicle titling definitions and standards, consumers across the country will have the kind of disclosure detail they need to make informed purchase decisions. 
   Somewhere down the road, consumers will be able to conduct vehicle queries and get ``real time'' vehicle history information from their home computers. 
   Mr. President, the 106th Congress does not need to put roadblocks in the way. My colleagues must reject any proposal that would jeopardize full nationwide implementation of this much needed system. Instead, this Congress must do everything it can to maintain the vitality of NMVTIS. For America's motorists, for car purchasers, and for all 50 states.

   Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I know all the Senators are interested in what the schedule might be. It is that time of the week when we begin to have to make some decisions. I would like for us to finish this bill tonight. There have been a dozen or more amendments that have been considered and others I am sure have been accepted. We still have a large number of amendments, though, that are pending. 
   I hope Senators will consider either not offering their amendments or agreeing to put them in a package of amendments. We are encouraging Senators on this side of the aisle to do that, and we have at least one that has been done that way. 
   If we finish the bill tonight, then we will not have any votes tomorrow. If we do not finish it tomorrow, then it is essential we stay in tomorrow. This is important legislation. A lot of amendments have been offered. Others will be offered that are critical amendments and very important to Members on both sides. I have discussed this with  Senator DASCHLE, and I know Senators on both sides and the managers are trying to work through a list of amendments that probably is still in the range of 40 or 50. We have to work very fast and hard to get through those. 
   With that in mind, I say, again, that we will go as late as we can tonight. I know we have a delegation of eight or so Senators that is supposed to leave for Kosovo at 6:30 in the morning. We will have to ask them to delay that. We can keep going tomorrow and we can keep going, if it is the desire of the Senate, even into Saturday. I have to check with Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY. They are committed to getting this bill done. 
   The reason we have to complete it this week is that next week we have to deal with supplemental appropriations, which I hope will be ready then. We hope to have something we can vote on concerning Y2K next week. We have the bankruptcy bill. We also have State Department authorization, defense authorization and defense appropriations and a satellite bill, all of which we would like to consider and get done before the Memorial Day recess. 
   It is not a question of not wanting to complete this bill. It is just we do not have time next week. So we will either have to work through these amendments quickly or we will have to keep going tonight and over into tomorrow. Please work with the managers. They are trying to do the job and they need your cooperation. I say to those of you who are looking to leave tonight or tomorrow morning, right now it looks as if we will not be able to finish tonight and we will have to be in session tomorrow. We cannot even give you assurances that we will finish by noon. We will just have to keep going until we get it done. 
   If we really cooperate with these managers, which happens quite often, I believe we can finish tonight. I looked down the list, and I think there are maybe four to six amendments that we really need to have discussion and votes on. I think we can find a way to complete that tonight or early in the morning. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could say this so Members will understand how we are going to proceed and how we are going to deal with this issue and others, I regret that we have had that much time on this vote. We had been trying to work out some way to make progress on this bill tonight and, hopefully, even get some amendments done tonight or complete it. At this point, it is obvious we are not getting enough movement to achieve that tonight. I know there are a lot of Senators who have commitments tomorrow and hoped we could complete it tonight. At this juncture, sufficient progress is not being made and it is unrealistic to attempt that. 
   I have a unanimous consent request to deal with two of the amendments that are in line now, and we would have the two votes in the morning at 9:30. After that, during the process of the night, hopefully more amendments can be accepted, combined, or even worked out, where we could have more than just the two votes in the morning, or the next couple of amendments would be in order. 
   What I am saying here is, with this consent request, we would expect two votes at 9:30 a.m., and we would expect to keep going, and we will see where we are in the morning. Something short of that has not been achievable at this point. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to amendment No. 344--that is the Hatch-Craig amendment--debate be limited to 2 hours equally divided in the usual form with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote, and following that debate the amendment be laid aside. 
   I ask consent that Senator SCHUMER be recognized to offer an amendment regarding Internet firearms, and that the debate be limited to 1 hour, that following that debate the amendment be laid aside and the Senate proceed to a vote in the order in which the amendments were offered, with 5 minutes prior to each vote for explanation. 
   So we will come in at 9:30, have 5 minutes of explanation on the amendments, equally divided, and the votes will begin at 9:40 a.m. Friday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, I encourage Senator REID to continue that effort, and I ask Senators HATCH and NICKLES, who will work with him on that, to continue. I urge the managers, Senator LEAHY and Senator HATCH, during the debate tonight, to sit down and see if we can't squeeze this down. Some of you are thinking that if we just stay with it and keep working tonight, we might actually see this thing concluded at 11, 12, 1, or 2. We have been thinking in those terms, but we have not been able to get an agreement beyond what we have right here. It is going to take, apparently, 3 hours of debate to get through these two amendments, which will put us to 10:15 or 10:30. At that point, it would be physically impossible to complete this action. 
   So I hope we can complete it tonight, but I think there is no choice other than to be in session on Friday and have votes, which we have told the Members we would do up until at least noon on Friday. In this case, it could actually go beyond noon. The good news is, as we announced some time ago, there will not be recorded votes next Monday or Friday because of conflicts which we identified to the Members 2 months ago. But that also makes it difficult for us to do the other things we have to do next week, including the supplemental appropriations, Y2K liability, and bankruptcy reform. We must conclude this bill either tomorrow or Saturday or sometime before we have to go to these other bills.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to urge the two managers, if you would tonight, to work to get a McConnell and a Kohl--or what other amendments are in order--get those two locked in, and a vote, and do it tonight. The Members would like to know what the timeframe is going to be tomorrow morning. If you could get that locked in tonight during the process of the debate, that will help facilitate moving forward. 
   Having said that, then, we have had the last vote of the night. The next votes will be the two votes stacked in the morning at 9:40.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators recently provided me with letters it has received from state motor vehicle administrators across the country on title branding legislation. As a collective group, DMV directors are looking to Congress to enact a balanced and responsible measure to combat title fraud. Legislation that is based on real world experience. Legislation that they can implement. 
   As my colleagues know, I reintroduced the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655 back in March. This legislation is similar to the bipartisan title branding bill Senator Ford and I coauthored during the 105th Congress. Legislation that received 57 cosponsors and which overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives with some modifications last October.

   Congress needs to pass S.655, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, for America's used car buyers and motorists and for the people who have to administer titling rules.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate my good friend and colleague, Senator JOE BIDEN, on casting his 10,000th vote in the United States Senate. 
   All of us who have listened--and listened--to Senator BIDEN on the Senate floor have come to deeply respect his leadership and commitment to causes of concern. 
   He led the historic effort for NATO expansion with courage and conviction. 
   He has a deep concern for America's role in the world and is a true leader of our foreign policy establishment. 
   Senator BIDEN has been a champion of victims of crime, particularly crimes against women. 
   Most of all, those of us who know him, have watched his grace and courage through personal suffering and serious illness. 
   I join my colleagues in recognizing Senator BIDEN's contributions to the Senate and extend my congratulations to him. 
   I congratulate the Senator from Delaware. I note he is only 56. I am 1 year older and he has already cast 10,000 votes. What an achievement. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join my other colleagues here today in recognizing National Teacher Appreciation Week. I am the son of a schoolteacher. My mother taught school for 19 years, between first and the sixth grade. She finally had to leave teaching because in those days teachers basically could not make enough money to live on. She wound up in bookkeeping and broadcasting. I also worked for a university for 3 years, and I have a very serious appreciation for our teachers and the jobs they do. 
   I have stayed in touch, over the years, with my second-, third-, and fourth-grade teachers at Duck Hill, MS. I don't know why, but I particularly remember those three and have always appreciated them. I guess we remember the ones who teach us to write and do the basic reading. They were wonderful women and wonderful people, and they inspired me in many ways. 
   So in appreciation of this National Teacher Appreciation Week, I will quote from the Bible. It says:  
   Train up the child in the way he should go, and when he's old, he will not depart from it.  
   Those were the words of Solomon. That is good advice from Solomon. 
   So today I want to pay particular attention to our Mississippi Teacher of the Year, Mary Beth Black. She teaches chemistry, physics, and advanced placement physics. I remember those courses. They are the reason I didn't go into pharmacy or med school. Biology, chemistry, physics--I took all the college preparatory courses, and I look back now and I know that I was wasting space. I was really never destined to major in the sciences. But it is so important that we have teachers who inspire students in that area. If we are going to be competitive in the future, in the next millennium, and participate in the world economy, we are going to have to have students who are good in science, physics, computer sciences, and the sciences in general. 
   In order for them to learn what they need to know and to be inspired in that field, you need great teachers like this teacher, the ``Teacher of the Year'' in Mississippi, who teaches at Emory, MS, a wonderful lady with a wonderful record. 
   She points, interestingly enough, to her second-grade teacher who, she noted, inspired her when she was 7 years old--that she knew when she was 7 she could be anything she chose to be: She could be a brain surgeon, she could drive a fire truck, or go to the Moon. But this second-grade teacher inspired her to want to be a teacher. She always wanted to be a teacher--and to be more than just a teacher, to be an inspiration to young people. 
   She said:  
   Second grade can be challenging. My problem was cursive writing or ``real writing'' as we second graders called it. No matter how hard I tried, my loops and swoops and tilts were never as good as my peers.  
   ``Until now,'' she said, ``school had been great.'' But in this instance it got to be a problem and a challenge. But her second-grade teacher, Mrs. Hurt, worked with her and taught her and then became an inspiration to her. 
   So today I give thanks and appreciation to all of our teachers across our great country, and in my State of Mississippi to the ``Mrs. Hurts'' who taught in those small, sometimes one- and two-classroom buildings as my mother did, who not only taught the course but inspired a generation of more teachers such as Mary Beth Black, Mississippi's Teacher of the Year. 
   An 18th-century American historian, Henry Brooks Adams, said: ``A teacher affects eternity; (she) can never tell where (her) influence stops.'' 
   So our teachers influence our young people, and they affect the future of our country and the world. Thanks to all of them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, Members should be aware that votes will occur today on the CRA issue and possibly other banking issues. If debate is completed before the 7 o'clock hour, there are other amendments that could be considered. There will certainly be one at 7 o'clock on this CRA issue. 
   If the Senate is able to complete this banking bill by the close of business on Thursday, then I would be prepared to announce at that time that there would be no votes on Friday. So if we can get this work completed--and it looks as if we may be able to; the managers are working together. And we have a couple of issues that will have to be debated and considered carefully, plus there are other amendments that won't take as long to be debated. This could be completed by Thursday night. If that is the case, we will not have any votes on Friday. If we are not able to finish it Thursday night, we may have to go over until Friday and complete it. I wanted Members to be aware of that possibility. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. This morning the Senate will resume consideration of S.J. Res. 20, with a brief statement by Senator MCCAIN. Following Senator MCCAIN, the majority leader will be recognized to make a motion to table S.J. Res. 20. Before I speak, however, and make that motion, I believe Senator DASCHLE will use leader time to make some remarks, too. So Senator MCCAIN will speak, Senator DASCHLE, and I will speak and make a motion to table S.J. Res. 20. Therefore, the first rollcall vote of the day will occur at approximately 9:45. 
   If S.J. Res. 20 is tabled, the Senate will immediately begin debate on S. 900, the financial services modernization bill, under the provisions agreed to last night by unanimous consent. It is hoped that significant progress will be made on the banking bill, and therefore Senators can expect further rollcall votes today. 
   We do have one complicating factor. We have also had another natural disaster to strike our country, this time in Oklahoma. The Senators from Oklahoma feel the necessity, understandably, to go to Oklahoma, and we will have to take that into consideration in how we schedule votes. I will consult with the Democratic leader about that timing. 
   The Senate will be in recess for the weekly party caucus luncheons from 12:30 to 2:15. I thank my colleagues for their attention. I believe Senator MCCAIN is ready to speak.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to use my leader time to make a brief statement also. 
   Mr. President, I should begin by saying I understand the feeling of the sponsors of this resolution and I commend them for their dedication and their untiring efforts. But I would today, in dealing with this resolution, quote an ancient Greek historian who once said, ``Observe due measure, for right timing is in all things the most important factor.'' 
   This resolution is out of sync with current events. There is no request for this action. NATO is not seeking additional authority. The President is not seeking additional authority. The Senate has already acted and expressed its support for the bombing campaign. 
   I have had my reservations about the President's policy from the beginning and I so voted; but it appears that perhaps the Administration has stopped deciding on targets by committee and that they are actually attacking targets that have greater value. We should allow that campaign to continue to work. This is the wrong language and it is at the wrong time. Currently, there seem to be some effort to find a negotiated settlement. We should encourage that. 
   But this language would go too far, beyond what I think the Senate is prepared to do and what is necessary and what has been requested. It authorizes the use of all necessary force and other means to prosecute this fight. That does include ground troops. I think the Senate would want to have a longer debate and want to discuss other options. For instance, when we were considering the timing of 
   this resolution last week, we were exchanging language between the majority leader and the Democratic leader, to see if we could find language that would have broad, bipartisan support. That was interrupted by this resolution. 
   Let me review how we got here. This resolution was introduced weeks ago. And under the War Powers Act, it was the pending business as of last Friday. We cannot go to another matter, under the War Powers Act, once the Parliamentarian ruled that this language kicked into action the War Powers Act. So we had to either act on it or get an agreement to postpone it. I agreed and urged that we postpone it for a week or 10 days until we had some bipartisan language we could agree on. Senator MCCAIN agreed to that postponement. Senator DASCHLE indicated that he thought he could support that. 
   But, along the way, as Senators are entitled to do, there were objections to postponing it by unanimous consent. So we had to deal with this issue. My suggestion at that time was that we not get into a substantive debate, that we offer a procedural motion to set it aside until another time when we can better determine what is needed--if something different is required than what is already on the books, if something more is asked for by the President, or if we are ready to go forward with the War Powers Act or even a declaration of war. But I don't think we are there at this moment. 
   So we are forced to have this vote today. I would like to describe it as a procedural vote because I think it is. It is to table this resolution and to reserve the opportunity at some future date to have a vote on whether or not we want to give the President authority to prosecute this matter with all necessary force. I do not think that is where we are today. But I do want to say emphatically that I think the language is substantively excessive, not necessary, and uncalled for. 
   So, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to support the motion to table and I so move to table the resolution. I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the past year has been a trying one for the United States Capitol Police. The deaths of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson struck a chord with the American people and the Congress. We are keenly aware that we rely on the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police to protect the Capitol Complex and all of those who work and visit here. In doing so, they ensure that the national legislative process proceeds unhindered and that citizens are safe and free to visit their Capitol, view the House and Senate in session, and meet with their elected representatives. 
   Protecting the Capitol Complex requires well trained, highly-motivated, and dedicated police officers. On April 27, the U.S. Capitol Police added such officers to its ranks when it graduated Recruit Class 116. The twenty-four recruits in this class proudly became police officers after successfully completing five months of exhaustive training. These officers came from all walks of life and from a number of states around the nation. Many had prior military experience, others had previous experience in the law enforcement profession, while some just recently graduated from college. The  common bond among these officers is the desire to enter the law enforcement profession and honor the memory of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just one moment to explain what has transpired. We have a number of Senators who wish to be heard on this issue. I view this as a procedural vote by moving to table it. We have this issue before us at this time because of the War Powers Act. There was a lot of feeling that we should have postponed this debate and vote until a later time, but under our rules we couldn't get that done. That is why Senator DASCHLE and I felt at this time that a procedural motion to table was appropriate and that that vote should occur at 5:30. 
   Senator DASCHLE is on the way back, but I understand he has agreed to this request. You cannot cut Senators off who are asking to speak on a matter of this magnitude. We have worked out an arrangement. We have gone into the night. There are probably an hour or two more of speeches left, and that way we will have a vote in the morning. Even if Senators had to come back for a 9:30 vote, they would have to be here tonight anyway. So I apologize for any inconvenience that may be caused by this delay of the vote for Senators who did come back for the 5:30 vote, but it seems it is the fair thing to do at this time. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I want to honor the premiere high school show choir in the Nation--Mississippi's own Clinton High School's Attach&#233;. Forty-two singers/dancers, sixteen instrumentalists, and seventeen crew members make up the outstanding group of young adults from a high school with an enrollment of 11 hundred. 
   For the past decade, the members of Attach&#233; have proven to be goodwill ambassadors for their high school, their community, and the great State of Mississippi. They have traveled to competitions all across America--Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Florida, New York, and California. During this time, Attach&#233; has not only competed in, but won every major show choir competition in the United States. They are the only high school show choir to ever win the grand championship in each venue of the Showstopper's International Invitational Competitions--an accomplishment of which Mississippians should truly be proud. While competing with other American high school students, they have demonstrated to the nation Mississippi's culture and excellence in the arts. 
   Mr. President, I want to point out that all of these accomplishments have been made while balancing practice and performance schedules with academics. These students serve as role models for the Nation. They demonstrate the tremendous achievements which are possible through dedication and hard work. 
   Since 1992, David and Mary Fehr have led Attach&#233;. David serves as the group's director. He arranges all numbers, directs the vocals and serves as the pianist during the show choir's performances. Mary designs the sets and costumes for the performers and personally sews the girls' outfits. This husband and wife team illustrates the value of teamwork. Discipline, self-reliance, and hard work are each of their charges. They are the epitome of what a public school educator should be. The Clinton Public Schools are blessed to have them on board. 
   This outstanding group of young adults and their dedicated leaders are shining examples of what positive energy can produce. It is refreshing to know that there are still teenagers out there with dedication and determination. Being a part of this show choir requires long hours and hard-work. Clinton and the whole state of Mississippi should be truly proud of the accomplishments of Attach&#233;.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I am including in the RECORD today a draft Senate Joint Resolution setting forth requirements that must be met before the United States Armed Forces may be deployed in or adjacent to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to conduct offensive ground operations. This draft resolution has been the subject of discussion among numerous Senators, as a possible compromise measure on the subject of Kosovo. My discussions with Senator DASCHLE and other Senators, from both parties, continue in an effort to determine whether bipartisan agreement can be reached on the timing and substance of a Kosovo debate here in the Senate. I commend the attached resolution to the attention of my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume consideration of S. 96, and the last amendment pending to S. 96 be modified with the changes proposed by Senators DODD, WYDEN, HATCH, FEINSTEIN, BENNETT, and Senator MCCAIN which I now send to the desk. And I send a cloture motion to the desk to the compromise amendment.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this cloture vote would have occurred, if consent had been granted, on Monday on the so-called compromise worked out among the chairman and Senator DODD, Senator FEINSTEIN, and others as mentioned above. 
   Let me say, I appreciate the effort of the chairman. I appreciate the effort, the work, and the willingness to try to find an adequate solution by Senator WYDEN. And Senator FEINSTEIN has been involved, and a number of others, Senator DODD, obviously. 
   But in light of this objection, I do not intend to bring this bill back before the Senate until consent can be granted by the Democrats. And if it is predicated on agreement that we open this up for every amendment in the kitchen, then it is over. Or until we get a commitment that we are going to get the votes for cloture and get a reasonable solution to this problem, I think it would be unreasonable for me to waste the Senate's time with any further debate or action on this amendment. 
   We need to do this. We can do it. But I am prepared now--if everybody is ready, we will just say it is over, the trial lawyers won, and we will move on to the next bill. But I am willing to be supportive of Members on both sides of the aisle who, acting in good faith, want to get this done. 
   We should do it. This is a reasonable approach. There is no reason we should use the Y2K computer glitch as an opportunity for a litigation bonanza. I am a lawyer, and everybody in this Chamber knows I have relatives who would be very interested in this. But I am interested in what is fair and what is right. We need to do this. The negotiations have happened. Concessions have been made. But, frankly, I am ready to move on to something else, unless we can get this done. So I do not intend to do anything else until we hear some solution to this problem. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is a lot I would like to say in response to Senator DASCHLE's remarks and Senator HOLLINGS' remarks. Some of it would probably be better left unsaid, but I must comment. 
   Regarding amendments, I reiterate what Senator MCCAIN, the manager of the legislation, said. Amendments that are relevant to this bill, germane to this bill, we ought to do that. That is why I left a window in the parliamentary procedure yesterday so we could do that. Unfortunately, the Senator from Massachusetts showed up and stuck in a totally irrelevant amendment, and I felt that that was an abuse of my good-faith effort. But we can still do that. If Senator DODD, Senator ROBB, or some other Senator has an amendment with regard to Y2K, OK, that is the way you legislate. But the idea that we are going to have a political legislative agenda dumped off on this bill, which is a 
   very thinly veiled effort to kill the bill--that is really what is at stake here--any majority leader would be certainly unwilling to agree to that. 
   I offer this to Senators again: If we have relevant amendments, we will be glad to do that. 
   Let me talk for a moment about what this bill does. It seems to be a little bit clouded by the debate. It provides time for plaintiffs and defendants to resolve the Y2K computer problems without litigation--without litigation. That sounds like a good idea to me. Those who think the solution to the problem in America is more lawsuits, I don't think they have been talking to the real world. I am a lawyer. But the idea that we ought to just have more opportunities to file lawsuits--I understand lawyers are calling the families of the poor victims in Colorado and saying, ``Can we sue somebody for you?'' That makes me sick to my stomach, that in this moment of grief, members of my profession would call and say, ``Let me sue somebody for you.'' 
   No, the answer is not more lawsuits in America. The answer is solutions, opportunities for resolution, sanity, for Heaven's sake. So we would like to have a process here where we don't always have to resort to litigation. Wonderful lawsuits. Great. I don't believe the American people want that. 
   This bill reiterates the plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages and highlights the defendant's opportunity to assist plaintiffs in doing that by providing information and resources. Does that make sense? Why, sure. It is giving them help to solve the problem. This is a unique problem, one we have never had before. Shall we rush to the courts? No. Should we try to find a way to resolve the problem for all concerned? Yes. 
   The bill provides for proportional liability in most cases, with exceptions for fraudulent or intentional conduct, or where the plaintiff has limited assets. 
   Are there legitimate causes for court actions? Yes. I don't have the extensive practice background that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has, but I practiced a little law and I did some corporate work and some public defender work, and I filed some lawsuits because I thought they were necessary. I can remember a medical malpractice case that I thought was justified. Yes, there are cases, but they should be only after other avenues have been pursued where there is fraud or intentional misconduct. 
   This bill protects governmental entities, including municipalities, schools, fire, water sanitation districts from punitive damages. Should there be some general protection for the school districts from being sued? Sure. 
   The bill eliminates punitive damage limits for egregious conduct while providing some protection against runaway punitive damage awards. Do we need some protection here? You see lawsuits out here in some States for $40 million, and it is totally inexplicable and, in my opinion, indefensible. 
   It provides protection for those not directly involved in a Y2K failure. And it is a temporary measure. We are not trying to have product liability reform on this bill or tort reform--although we ought to have both, in my opinion, and the sooner the better. I can't wait until we can get it done. But this is a temporary measure to deal with a temporary, one-time problem. It sunsets January 1, 2002. 
   I want to emphasize that it does not deny the right of anyone to redress their legitimate grievances in court. 
   What is at stake here? What is going on here? Some people don't want this bill at all, pure and simple. To the credit of the Senator from South Carolina, I don't think he has denied that. His goal is to defeat this bill. For every name of people out here in the hall on the business side, I can assure you there is somebody on the other side. But the idea that we are going to resort to the courts to solve all of the problems in America, and the insinuation that this bill is some sinister plot to block legitimate legal action, I just find that wrong.  
   I think it is a good effort. I hope we get it done. But I am willing to stand on this line right here. Those who just voted against cloture can live with it, as far as I am concerned, and they can explain it to their constituents--big businesses, small businesses, farmers, people who are going to get sued if we don't do this, when it is not even necessary. 
   So if this bill dies on this line, it is OK with me, because I think the blame is clear. But I am not going to be a part of shenanigans here, to have an agenda dumped on this bill that would result in killing it. We are not going to keep spinning our wheels. We are going to come up with a legitimate compromise solution, and we are going to vote and move or not--either way. If anybody in this Chamber thinks the solution to the Y2K problem is more lawsuits, I don't believe they have talked to the people in America.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, more than 15 years ago, Congress directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to take responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste created by commercial nuclear power plants and our nation's defense programs. Today, there are more than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel that must be dealt with. Over a year has now passed since the DOE was absolutely obligated under the NWPA of 1982 to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from utility sites. Today DOE is no closer in coming up with a solution. This is unacceptable. This is in fact wrong--so say the Federal Courts. The law is clear, and DOE must meet its obligation. If the Department of Energy does not live up to its responsibility, Congress will act. 
   I am encouraged that Congressmen BLILEY, BARTON, UPTON, and the rest of the House of Representatives have begun to address this issue. It is good to see a bipartisan effort for a safe, practical and workable solution for America's spent fuel storage needs. The proper storage of spent fuel is not a partisan issue --it is a safety issue. The solution being advanced is certainly more responsible than just leaving waste at 105 separate power plants in 34 states all across the nation. There are 29 sites which will reach their storage capacity by the end of this year. 
   Where is DOE? Where is the solution? All of America's experience in waste management over the last twenty-five years of improving environmental protection has taught Congress that safe, effective waste handling practices entail using centralized, permitted, and controlled facilities to gather and manage accumulated waste. 
   Mr. President, the management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize on this knowledge and experience. Nearly 100 communities have spent fuel sitting in their ``backyard,'' and it needs to be gathered and accumulated. This lack of a central storage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of several nuclear power plants. These affected plants produce nearly 20% of America's electricity. Closing these plants just does not make sense. 
   Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future, and must remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to maintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity. Nuclear power, at the same time, allows the nation to directly and effectively address increasingly stringent air quality requirements. 
   Both the House and the Senate passed a bill in the 105th Congress to require the DOE to build this interim storage site in Nevada, but unfortunately this bill didn't complete the legislative process because of time constraints. We ran out of time. I challenge my colleagues in both chambers of the 106th Congress to get this environmental bill done. The citizens, in some 100 communities where fuel is stored today, challenge the Congress to act and get this bill done. The nuclear industry has already committed to the federal government about $15 billion toward building the facility. In fact, the nuclear industry continues to pay about $650 million a year in fees for storage of spent fuel. It is time for the federal government to honor its commitment to the American people and the power community. It is time for the federal government to protect those 100 committees. 
   To ensure that the federal government meets its commitment to states and electricity consumers, the 106th Congress must mandate completion of this program--a program that includes temporary storage, a site for permanent disposal, and a transportation infrastructure to safely move used fuel from plants to the storage facility. 
   Mr. President, this federal foot dragging is unfortunate and unacceptable. Clearly, the only remedy to stopping these continued delays is timely action in the 106th Congress on this legislation. By moving this process, which must also include the work of the Senate, the House's work can be improved. Let's move forward and get this bill done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Internet is nearly a ubiquitous aspect of American life. It goes without saying ``electronic commerce''--e-commerce--has become a central aspect for buying products and services. Only two years ago five million households shopped for some product on the Internet. Last year that number doubled. Now the forecast for this year is that  nearly 15 million households will let their keyboards do the work. This is a threefold increase of shoppers in only two years. One can also look at the dollar volume affected, which is predicted to double to $31B this year. 
   Mr. President, city, county and state officials are understandably overwhelmed by this Internet Tsunami--15 million homes spending $31 billion. I have spent time talking with these public officials. I have listened to their views. They are frightened, and they have legitimate concerns about their sales tax base. However, electronic commerce will not end Main Street as we now know it. I am confident public policy will evolve to deal with the new electronic marketplace in a fair and balanced manner. 
   Although the Internet is currently accessed by almost 40 million American homes, less than half are using the Internet for commerce purposes. This tells me there are issues that need to be addressed beyond how the sales tax is treated--issues like encryption, privacy and digital signatures--all necessary components for vibrant Internet commerce. I hope Congress will examine and act on these issues during the 106th Congress, while the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce works on the tax implications. 
   The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce must complete its report promptly so the information is available to Congress before the moratorium on new Internet taxes ends. Mr. President, the report date does not need to be extended. I am very impressed with Governor Jim Gilmore's leadership of the Commission and his aggressive technology agenda. I commend him for his progress thus far, and I know he will deliver on time a fair and balanced report. 
   Mr. President, let me back up and say a few words about the Commission. This provision was part of the compromise Representative CHRIS COX worked out with state and local government associations. His efforts precipitated the legislative process and culminated in the bill becoming law. I want to thank Representative COX for proposing and fine tuning the Commission. I consulted with him as Congress worked to get this Commission up and running and appreciate his diligence and insight throughout the process. 
   Mr. President, today I also want to commend my friend Jimmy Barksdale for graciously volunteering to step down from the Commission. He and I both agree that the issues surrounding the Internet are too important to let individuals and personal agendas get in the way. Jimmy decided to step aside so the Commission can get beyond the disruptive law suit. Let me say a few words about why I selected Jimmy in the first place--I wanted a Mississippian who could bring Southern common sense and wisdom to the evolving public policy for the Internet. Jimmy knows what it takes to create a new marketplace and he understands the interplay and context for each facet of the telecommunications sector, especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 empowered many sectors to compete with each other. 
   I have selected Ms. Delna Jones to fill the vacancy. Ms. Jones is a public official who brings the Commission into a balance between public and private sector interests. Ms. Jones is a county official from Washington County, Oregon, thus ensuring that each layer of local government is now represented. Ms. Jones is from a non-sales tax state which now means all state configurations for income and sales tax approaches are present. Ms. Jones also worked for a telecommunications company and is no stranger to this aspect of the communication world. Ms. Jones will provide the Commission a voice for the 46% of all Internet users who are female. Ms. Jones has been recognized by the National Federation of Independent Business which tells me she is sensitive to the needs of small business--a key component of our economy. Her background brings a valuable professional richness to the Commission. Senator GORDON SMITH both knows and has served with Ms. Jones in Oregon's state legislature. He believes she has the right mix of professional and personal skills to make a meaningful and significant contribution to the Commission. 
   Mr. President, I want the record to be clear. The Commission's imbalance was not created by me, and it is unfortunate that those who did not fulfill the law's mandate were paralyzed and unable to offer a real fix. I have stepped up to the problem and changed one of my selections. Evolving Internet public policy is just too important to be held hostage. I want America to have a vibrant electronic communication and commerce medium for the 21st Century. 
   I also want to challenge the members of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce to focus and produce recommendations that will assist Congress in making the right public policy for the Internet. 
   Mr. President, today 37 million Americans will click on the Internet for something, perhaps a purchase. They need and deserve the right public policy--a policy this Commission can and will influence. We should not be afraid of this technology shift--the Internet's Tsunami, e-commerce--nor should we ignore the consequences of how America's commerce is or should be structured to ensure the prosperity and vitality of America's 21st Century electronic economy.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Arizona. 
   The bill before us is the Y2K liability legislation, which is time sensitive, which has bipartisan support, which would allow for a process for small business individuals and others who might be talked into Y2K computer problems, to deal with the problem without winding up with the typical lawsuits being filed. 
   That is what this is really all about, trying to deal with the liabilities that could be facing a lot of people inadvertently, or because they don't have the ability to deal with this problem, to find a way to deal with the problem, and not just, as is the idea of a lot of people, just to provide an avenue for a lot of lawsuits. 
   I had hoped we could have amendments on the subject and maybe substitute amendments by others. There are two or three different bills that are very close in this area. I thought we could deal with the subject matter and move forward. In a show of good faith, I wanted to leave those options open, and I didn't completely ``fill up the tree,'' as it is described around here, and offer a lot of amendments to block everybody, to see if we really had a good-faith intent of dealing with this important legislation. There are a lot of small business men and women, and businesses in general, who are very interested in this legislation and know it needs to be done, and they know it could be done in a bipartisan way. 
   But my show of good faith has been rewarded with an amendment that is unrelated and is intended to change the subject to fulfill an agenda that has been developed on the other side. They had the opportunity and they took advantage of it. That, I think, is a tragedy, but that is the way it goes around here. I have learned a lesson. If we are going to pass legislation, whether it is on bankruptcy or financial modernization, FAA reauthorization, or this legislation, Y2K legislation, which is important, I am going to have to take actions to block irrelevant, nongermane amendments that are just part of a political agenda. 
   Having said that, I move to table the motion to recommit the bill and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret that we have to use this procedure. But we are hoping that we can see an agreement reached with regard to Y2K. I know there is a bipartisan effort underway on this important issue. It is timely. I hope that Members will work together this afternoon and tonight, and that we can find a way to come to a conclusion on it. 
   The Social Security lockbox also is an issue that we think is very important which we need to be talking about and find a way to actually achieve that goal. This will give us an opportunity to discuss that some more. 
   I want to say to Senator DASCHLE publicly what I have been saying to him privately. It is not my intent, and I will not be used to prevent a discussion in a reasonable period of time--we talked about week after next--with regard to school violence, how you deal with that. I think it is appropriate after a reasonable period of time to have a debate and have votes on amendments. I suggest that we would do it on the Justice bill. If for some reason that bill is a problem, we will find some other vehicle, and I am sure there will be amendments with a lot of different ideas of how we try to deal with this problem. 
   I am not sure we can solve what has happened in Colorado here. But we will have a chance to have a discussion and have a debate and have amendments. 
   I said to Senator DASCHLE that we are going to do that, and he and I will work together to find a way to do it and to have amendments dealing with school violence. 
   I don't want this to become a laundry list of all kinds of other issues. But the Senate needs to be heard, and needs to 
   have an opportunity to debate and vote on those issues dealing with school violence. How we try to address that--we will find a way to get that done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to support this resolution submitted today by Senator MCCONNELL assigning the Henry Clay Desk in the Senate Chamber to the senior Senator from Kentucky. This resolution will ensure that the Henry Clay Desk will forever stay within the family of Kentucky Senators. 
   The Senate has a proud tradition of passing this type of resolution. During the 94th Congress, for example, the Senate adopted a resolution assigning the Daniel Webster Desk to the senior Senator from New Hampshire. And, during the 104th Congress, the Senate agreed to a resolution ensuring that the Jefferson Davis Desk would forever reside with the senior Senator from Mississippi. 
   Let me take a brief moment to reflect on the life and legacy of Henry Clay. Henry Clay began his political career in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1803, at age 27, and remained in public service until his death in 1852. During Clay's long and distinguished career, he served his state and his nation in a wide range of capacities including speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and, of course, as a U.S. Senator for fifteen years. Clay also served President John Quincy Adams as Secretary of State for four years, and received his party's nomination for President in 1824, 1832, and 1844. 
   Henry Clay's ability to facilitate compromise was quickly recognized in Washington, and he became well-known as a highly-skilled negotiator. This skill, coupled with his knack for convincing and persuasive speech, made Clay the ideal appointment in 1814 to help negotiate the Treaty of Ghent that concluded the war with Great Britain. And, during Clay's quest to save the Union in 1820, he earned his reputation as ``The Great Compromiser'' by helping broker the Missouri Compromise. His leadership, however, did not end there. He also went on to play a significant role in crafting the Compromise of 1850. 
   Henry Clay's lifetime of public service is indeed worthy of recognition. He will always be a role model for public servants because of his dedication to the people of Kentucky and to our great Nation, and lives on his history as one of the greatest Senators of all time. In fact, Henry Clay's portrait is displayed just off the Senate floor to honor his designation in 1957, as one of history's ``Five Outstanding Senators.'' Clay certainly deserves today's honor of committing his former desk to Senator MCCONNELL and to the senior Senators from Kentucky who will follow. 
   Mr. President, let me say today that I think Senator MCCONNELL is following in the footsteps of Henry Clay. He has done a tremendous job representing the good people of Kentucky for the past 15 years. And, on a personal level, I would like to say that I have developed a genuine appreciation for Senator MCCONNELL's courage, his political insight, and his keen and candid advice on a wide range of subjects. I value him as a friend, a confidant, and an advisor, and look forward to many more years of service with him here in this chamber. 
   Mr. President, I am proud today to support this resolution submitted by Senator MCCONNELL. It is his strong desire to maintain the heirloom of the  Clay desk in the family of Kentucky Senators for the years to come. I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution and ask that it be included in the collection of the Standing Orders of the Senate.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know that a number of Senators do wish to express their concern, sympathy, and great regret with regard to the incident for which we are all so very sorry, and suffering. As Senators ALLARD and CAMPBELL said, I think we can save that until we have the resolution up later this afternoon when Senators will have the opportunity to speak on this matter. I will be speaking with Senator DASCHLE and we will be talking about an appropriate way for the Senate to consider this matter for a reasonable period of time. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know there is a sincere effort underway on both sides of the aisle to work out an agreement on this Y2K legislation. I know that will continue. But we need to make progress, or have the opportunity for a cloture vote in the meantime, or, in case that doesn't work out, you always have the option, if we get everything worked out, to vitiate the cloture vote, or we could move to a conclusion earlier. If we can get an agreement worked out and conclusion on Wednesday, that would be ideal. 
   But, barring that, a cloture vote will occur on Thursday. As soon as the time for the vote has been determined, after consultation with the Democratic leader, all Senators will be notified.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could make a couple of observations with regard to the schedule, I know Members are interested in a variety of very important issues they wish to be heard on. I have to be sympathetic to those requests. We don't have it worked out yet. 
   But I am discussing with Senator DASCHLE the possibility of having some measure on the floor of the Senate later on this week which would be an opportunity for further discussion and perhaps votes with regard to the Kosovo matter. We wish it to be a bipartisan resolution that allows Senators to state their position and to allow the Senate to take a vote on exactly how they wish to proceed at this point with regard to Kosovo. We will have to work through that. Hopefully, we can take it up Thursday and complete it Thursday night, or Friday, or later, if the Senators so desire. 
   On another matter, I know there are Senators who have a real desire to say something and have a policy discussion about what has happened in Colorado. I ask my colleagues, let's give this a moment. Let's allow a period of mourning and grief. Let's allow these families to bury their children. Let's all wait to see more about what happened and ask not only what but why. 
   Then 2 weeks from today, if the Senate thinks well of it, we will look for a vehicle--and we have one in mind, perhaps a juvenile justice bill--that we could take up, and the Senate would then have an opportunity for debate, have amendments, and have votes. 
   I think we need a period of time to think this through and allow our country, collectively, to have a period of mourning and then see if there is something we can do. I don't think the answer is here. I think the answer is out across America. 
   I wanted the Senators to know I recognize their desires and I am trying to find a way to accommodate those desires. I ask, also, that we must continue to work on Y2K and find a way to complete it without getting into a myriad of subsidiary issues and complete our work by Wednesday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's question, I think it is always incumbent upon the leadership to make sure we proceed in an appropriate way and that Senators have an opportunity to express their views and offer amendments on issues of policy. I think we are doing that. We have appropriately had a moment of silence and a prayer for the children and the families, and for our country. We are going to have a resolution this afternoon officially expressing our regret and sympathy. 
   I have asked that we have a brief period of mourning where we don't rush to judgment before we start flinging amendments at each other. I mentioned the idea to Senator DASCHLE moments ago in which I said that 2 weeks from today we will look at bringing up a particular piece of legislation. I don't want to say it will be exactly that day or exactly that piece of legislation because Senator DASCHLE needs to confer with a lot of Members on that side. 
   However, it is my intent, that 2 weeks from today we give Senators an opportunity to offer amendments, thoughts and policy issues they wish to have addressed. I think the timing would be appropriate and I think that the issue or the issues are appropriate for Members to debate and vote on.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret having to file a cloture motion on this important piece of legislation. However, we need to have a vote on Monday afternoon so that Members will be here. We can have committee meetings hopefully Monday and Tuesday. 
   We have a number of very important issues that need to be considered by committees. We need to move forward on the now two supplemental appropriations requests that we have. So we are going to have a vote on Monday in any case. 
   But also I think this is very important legislation in and of itself. It is important that we get up and get started on the discussion. I had hoped we could actually work on it today and tomorrow. But because of the NATO meeting and the congestion and the concerns about access to and from the Capitol, we will not be in session on tomorrow. That gives the Members who are working together--Senator MCCAIN I know is working with others, Senator BIDEN, Senator DODD--time to try to work out some of the remaining problems on this legislation. 
   We can go forward with this cloture vote on Monday afternoon. Or, if something is worked out where it is not necessary, we could still vitiate the cloture vote. 
   We need to get this done. This is urgent. The clock is ticking. We are moving towards 2000. This liability, this problem, is hanging over us like a sword. I think it is important that we go forward. I hope that next week--Tuesday or Wednesday, certainly--we will be in the substance of the bill and we can get to a final conclusion on the substance. 
   I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to work together to see if we can't resolve this issue and move it on into conference. 
   I thank Senator MCCAIN, Senator HATCH, and Senators from both sides who have been working on it. 
   Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that Friday be considered the intervening day under the provisions of rule XXII.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today marks the 29th annual Earth Day --a day to evaluate our environment--a day to celebrate. Along with all Americans, I too want to live in a clean environment, and like most Americans, I fully believe efforts are needed to ``protect the environment.'' However, I question how ``protecting the environment'' is defined and bureaucratically implemented, especially when it begins to truly hurt Americans. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will look at each environmental policy--new and old--carefully, to make sure the benefits are both real and achievable. Congress should make sure the costs are tolerable and properly allocated, and Congress needs to ensure that the standards and time tables make sense. Most importantly, the Congress needs to make sure that the science is legitimate. 
   There are some who advance an agenda under the guise of environmental concern. This is not only wrong, but harmful. There are some who do not provide accurate costs and who inflate benefits. This too is wrong. There are some who have no concern about those who will really be affected by the new policy. This is also very wrong--Congress should never lose sight of the constituents. 
   Mr. President, the Senate needs to continue to ``protect the environment'' while ``protecting the people'' who live in that environment. The Senate must examine the costs inflicted upon our society, as it relates to the environmental protection, to make sure it is acceptable. 
   This Earth Day anniversary is a good anniversary. There are many things of which to be proud, and many people and organizations which should be proud. Many can rightly take credit. Yes, the federal government stepped in. However, over the past three decades I've seen states and local governments also step up to the plate and act responsibly. After 30 years states should be given more responsibility, because of their effectiveness in environmental matters. 
   Mr. President, this Earth Day anniversary is a good anniversary, because the corporate world has invested billions and billions of dollars more than thirty years to clean the environment--the air, the soil, and the water. Everyone has benefited. The initial federal rules worked, but over the past 30 years industry has learned how to take environmental action in a more effective way. The federal government, not known for its efficiency, should do a better job of asking for these environmental solutions, because the same results at lower costs are good for America. Industry wants to be a partner in this effort. 
   Mr. President, today the new environmental enemy is urban sprawl. This is unfortunate because Congress does not need to find a new evil enemy to pursue to make environmental policy work. Suburbs, backyards, and shopping centers are not our enemy. Mr. President, the family living in the suburbs is not the enemy. I hope my colleagues will take a more balanced approach, and look for ways to legislate that avoid the adversarial approach. For thirty years industry was blamed for our environmental problems, now it's the family living in the suburbs. This is counter productive. This is a terribly destructive way to ``protect the environment.'' 
   Mr. President, nearly 30 years of Earth Days has heightened everyone's awareness--yours and mine. I truly believe everyone is now a better steward  of our planet. Lets unleash America's entrepreneurial spirit and search for new approaches and new incentives to protect America's air, soil, and water. Happy Earth Day.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Senator LAUTENBERG or perhaps other Senators will be here momentarily and will wish to comment on this subject--perhaps even the Senator from South Carolina. I know Senator ABRAHAM is prepared to begin the discussion. 
   For years we have talked about how we can set aside Social Security to come up with a process so Social Security cannot be used to make the deficit look better or be spent for other programs or, for that matter, for tax cuts. A lot of thought has been given to this. Efforts have been made by Senators on both sides of the aisle. I think what we have this time is real. It will keep this money from being spent, without a supermajority vote in the Senate, for other than defense. It is a clear step in the right direction. 
   We need to be able to say to the American people that not one cent of Social Security is going to be able to be spent on anything but Social Security. This lockbox will make it a lot more difficult, although under emergency circumstances obviously that could still be pierced. The key, though, is to lock this money up, make sure it is not frittered away, and then see if we can come up with genuine long-term Social Security reform so this money can be used for that. If it is not, it will still be used, available to reduce the debt, and, over a period of years, that itself will be a significant benefit to the country, to the economy, to our seniors, and to the Social Security program. 
   So I commend Senator ABRAHAM for his persistence on this issue, and I think the best thing for us to do at this point is to get into a discussion about what we are trying to do here and see if we can get this process through. This is a change in the law; this is not just a budget process change. This is something the Senate would have to act on, the House would have to act on, and we would have to send it to the President. 
   So I think it is time, and appropriate, now, that we have this discussion about the future of Social Security. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I reintroduced the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655. This bipartisan bill has several cosponsors including Senator BREAUX. It is similar to the measure that Senator Ford and I coauthored during the 105th Congress. 
   This responsible legislation is important to used car buyers and motorists across the country because it will help curtail motor vehicle titling fraud. It does so by providing states with incentives to adopt minimal uniform definitions and standards that promote greater disclosure to potential used vehicle purchasers. 
   During the last Congress, this legislation received the formal support of over 55 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle and a modified version passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming majority last October. 
   Mr. President, every year used car buyers throughout the nation are cheated by those who pass off rebuilt salvage vehicles as undamaged. These consumers are never notified that the used vehicle they purchased was totaled and subsequently rebuilt. Often times, they find out only when the supposedly undamaged car or truck they bought is taken in for repair. It is at this point that they find their vehicle has been rebuilt and that it may pose a safety hazard. One where the cost of repair far exceeds the vehicle's worth or which cannot be fixed for safe operation 
   Today, used car buyers and automobile dealers are paying over $4 billion dollars annually for vehicles that have been rebuilt--many of which are virtually worthless. It is happening in Mississippi and in your own states. Title laundering is a growing problem. It must be stopped. 
   Congress recognized the primary reason that millions of structurally unsafe vehicles were being placed back on America's roads and highways was due to the lack of uniformity in state titling rules. That is why the 103rd Congress passed the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 which required the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a task force, the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee, to study problems related to motor vehicle fraud and theft. The Act directed the Committee to include representatives from several cabinet agencies, police chiefs and municipal auto theft investigators, State motor vehicle officials, industry and insurance representatives, recyclers, salvage yard operators, and scrap processors. Their primary function was to develop reasonable and balanced recommendations that would protect consumers. 
   The Salvage Advisory Committee was formed in 1993. It was chaired by the Chief of the Odometer Fraud Staff for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It included the Justice Department's Assistant Director for Consumer Litigation and a senior attorney from the Criminal Justice Division. It also included several Secretaries of State, State DMV Directors and other stakeholders. These are the experts on the front line who deal with titling issues on a day-to-day basis that Congress chose for the Committee. The Salvage Advisory Committee deliberated for almost a year and issued its findings in February 1994. The Committee's report identified a series of practical, well thought out solutions to address the issue of title washing. It included the establishment of national uniform titling definitions and standards for salvage, rebuilt salvage, flood, and non-repairable passenger vehicles. 
   This esteemed group knew what would work and what would not. They did not recommend a complex, overly burdensome titling and registration scheme. Instead, they identified a few definitions that should be standardized and minimal procedures that should be adopted by states. 
   The task force recommended that a passenger vehicle that experiences damage exceeding 75% of its pre-accident value be designated as ``salvage.'' 
   It also recommended that salvage vehicles that have been repaired for safe operation be branded ``rebuilt salvage,'' have an inspection to determine whether stolen parts were used to fix the vehicle, and have a decal permanently affixed to the driver's door jamb indicating the vehicle's history. 
   The Salvage Committee identified a nonrepairable vehicle as a passenger motor vehicle that is incapable of safe operation for use on roads or highways and which has no resale value except as a source of parts or scrap. 
   Another recommendation included the carrying forward of all brands on new title documents so that the terms used in one state would be identified on the titles of other states where the vehicle is re-registered. 
   Mr. President, Senator Ford and I simply authored a bill during the last Congress that codified these task force recommendations. 
   The bill also included a slightly modified definition of flood vehicles. One that focuses on the electrical and mechanical damage resulting from excessive water. The task force originally recommended that all passenger vehicles submerged in water that has reached over the door sill or has entered the passenger or trunk damage be designated as a flood vehicle. 
   Upon further reflection, and actual real world experience, the flood definition in this legislation was modified to brand only those vehicles that suffer debilitating damage instead of simply cosmetic damage, such as wet carpeting, that would have occurred under the original flood definition. The reason for this change was to ensure that a consumer's vehicle is not branded as a flood vehicle merely because its floor mats got wet. It makes no sense to brand a car or a truck as a flood vehicle, causing a significant and unnecessary devaluation of its worth, when the vehicle's operating functions and electrical, mechanical or computerized components are not damaged by water. This legislation also improves upon the task force's recommendations by including any vehicle acquired by an insurer as part of a water damage settlement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the outstanding work of Mr. Lynn  W. Heninger as NASA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs. Having served in this position since December 1987, Mr. Heninger is leaving to pursue other opportunities in the private sector. He definitely will be missed by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   I have enjoyed working with Mr. Heninger on a wide range of matters affecting NASA. I always found him to be extremely knowledgeable and very effective in representing NASA's views. He has always maintained a friendly and constructive approach to his work which has served NASA very well. 
   Mr. Heninger had the difficult task of coordinating the NASA legislative agenda. He deftly balanced a wide range of NASA issues including the International Space Station, Rocket Propulsion Programs, Earth Science and Remote Sensing initiatives. Because Mr. Heninger earned the trust and confidence of those with whom he worked, he was able to promote NASA's views very effectively in Congress. 
   After graduation from Utah State University with a Bachelor of Science, he served in the U.S. Army for three years as an artillery officer and helicopter pilot, including duty in Vietnam with the 1st Infantry Division. He returned to Utah State University, after briefly working with NASA Johnson Space Center as a Program Analyst, to earn a Masters in Business Administration. In 1970, he joined the Department of Transportation to work as a Budget Analyst. Mr. Heninger returned, yet again to his alma mater, where he served as a Project Director with the Economic Department at Utah State University. Before rejoining NASA in 1977 as the Chief of Program Support in NASA's Office of Space Science, he worked briefly as an Organizational Specialist with the United Nations in Bogota, Columbia. Lynn is married to the former Colleen Johnson and has five children, Jeffrey, Camille, Diana, Patricia, and Natalie. 
   Mr. Heninger has earned the respect of many Members of Congress and their staffs through hard work and his straightforward nature. As he now departs to share his experience and expertise in the civilian sector, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize his outstanding and dedicated public service and wish him all the very best in his new challenges.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action commenced by a pro se plaintiff in Yakima County Superior Court, Yakima County, Washington, against Vice President ALBERT GORE, as President of the Senate, and Senators GORTON and MURRAY. The complaint attacks the validity of federal tax laws essentially by challenging the validity of all legislation enacted subsequent to the Seventeenth Amendment, on the basis that the Constitution prohibits the direct election of Senators provided for by the amendment. 
   This action is subject to removal from state court to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senate defendants in this suit to move for its removal to federal court, and then to seek its dismissal for failure to state a claim for relief.

   Mr. LOTT. I join Senator DOMENICI in thanking the Senator from Missouri for his leadership on Social Security. I recall a lengthy letter Senator ASHCROFT sent me earlier this year advocating that walling off Social Security should be the top budget priority for this Congress. I also remember the bill he introduced earlier this year creating the Social Security point of order that is similar to the one in the conference report and his advocacy during Senate debate and when the bill was in conference for the final bill to include the point of order. With passage of this budget which, for the first time in 30 years, balances the budget without using Social Security and puts procedures in place to protect Social Security in the future, the Senate has made protecting Social Security a high priority. I commend Senator ASHCROFT for his efforts in protecting Social Security.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is an important time with a lot of very serious matters before the Senate. Obviously, we are going to be working on the budget resolution. But also, we are very much concerned about what is happening in the Balkans, we are concerned about what is happening in Kosovo, we are concerned about the impact that that is having in Macedonia and the Montenegro area, as well as countries that are not as directly impacted from a standpoint of refugees, but the impact on Albania, which obviously is housing a number of refugees, and even countries such as Romania are being affected by what we see happening there. 
   I think it is important that we work together in a bipartisan way to express our support for our troops, to express our support and appreciation for countries that are dealing with this influx of refugees and providing haven and humanitarian assistance working with international organizations, with military representation that has been trying to deal with this tremendous influx of refugees. 
   We are going to work over the next 24 hours to see if we can come together with an agreement on a bipartisan resolution expressing our appreciation and recognition for the outstanding work that is being done by our men and women of the military, by all the organizations that are helping with the refugees and for the countries that are dealing with a tremendous burden right now. But I think we should begin here at home also.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I always enjoy working with him. He is absolutely right in repeating the need for us to express our appreciation to our military men and women and to continue our commitment to the humanitarian effort that is underway and express our appreciation to the front-line states that are there dealing with this problem and the cost of the problem in a very serious way. We will work to see  if we can express that appreciation and concern. 
   But I want to emphasize that we have our own military men and women who are doing a magnificent job. All of our Senators and House Members who have gone to the region, who have gone to Brussels and have gone to Aviano or been in Albania or Macedonia, have come back saying what a magnificent job our military men and women have been doing. 
   But it has gone now beyond our active-duty pilots and men and women who are involved in the exercise there. It now involves Reserve unit members, National Guard, volunteers. We have Air Guard members that are now flying the refueling aircraft that are helping in that effort. And they have been called up unexpectedly with very little notice. 
   Now you have spouses that are in the region that did not have time to file their income tax return, and tomorrow is the infamous day. Tomorrow is April 15. And like so many Americans, I will file my return tomorrow and send my check along with the return, which is a very unhappy situation. But we have military men and women who are doing their duty for their country that were unexpectedly, and on very short notice, called up. And you have their spouses now scrambling, trying to perhaps deal with filing their income tax returns tomorrow, the 15th. 
   We have legislation now moving through the House that has been through the Ways and Means Committee that will be coming to the Senate later on today or tomorrow, and we have legislation 
   that has been prepared in the Senate now that would give, I believe, a 60-day extension on filing returns to our military men and women that have been called up for this service to our country. 
   There may be some other provisions that have been cited, too, that should be outlined. It exempts U.S. troops serving in the Yugoslavia theater from being taxed on the hazardous duty pay. It grants our troops a 180-day filing extension on their 1998 income tax returns after their return from duty in the combat zone designated by the President and exempts our troops from the 3-percent excise tax levied on long distance telephone calls, which I am sure they are making now to assure their families that they are in the area and they are safe and they are doing their job. So it is more than just a 60-day extension. 
   I think it is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do. And it is important we do it today and make it clear that we are going to complete this action when the House bill comes over. That may be later on today or tomorrow. But if we do not make it clear that we are going to do it today, and if we do not get it done tomorrow, these families are going to be under the duress of either not filing on time, as the law requires, or asking for an extension, which a lot of Americans are hesitant to do. 
   So I think it is important that we prepare the way to get this legislation completed today, or not later than tomorrow, and make it clear to the families of our service men and women that are in the zone that they are going to have these benefits and this extension of time. 
   In that vein, then, I do have a unanimous consent request that we have been trying to get cleared, I hope we can get cleared, because we need to do this. And then we can get this behind us and we can move on to another resolution. 
   So I ask unanimous consent that----

   object to. I would like to say to them, there will be other bills, there will be other ways. It will give us time to focus on something that would be an expression of our appreciation and our commitment to be of assistance to not only our military men and women that are there in the area but to those that are dealing on the international basis with humanitarian needs for these front-line states. 
   I think we can do both. But as is usually the case, you need to do one and then the other. And so I am trying to find a way to achieve both of those.

And he has taken some action, some executive order, but he cannot, by executive order, do what we are doing. It takes a change in the law or a revision in the law in order for these things to occur. So it is a supplement to, in addition to, what he has already done by executive order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could describe this unanimous consent, what it will do is provide for an hour of debate equally divided, of course, so that Members could comment on the actual content in S. 767. This is the critical  part. It will also say, this unanimous consent agreement, that when the House language comes over, then the House bill would be read for a third time and a vote on passage of the House bill, without any intervening language, motion or debate. So it in effect locks in the guarantee that this is going to be done by tomorrow. Our people will have that guarantee by the Senate by this unanimous consent agreement tonight. That is what I would like to do. 
   If it would be helpful to the Senator from Connecticut, I do not know if other Senators are seeking recognition now, we could wait just a moment more. I will notify the Senate that I would be prepared to make this unanimous consent request as soon as we can get further Senators on the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to recognize the efforts of Senator ABRAHAM who authored and spearheaded the effort to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act during the 105th Congress. 
   This good government measure, which the President signed into law last year, requires federal agencies to automate their forms and allows computer users to complete, electronically sign, and submit government forms online. 
   Aside from saving thousands of square feet of storage space, this landmark legislation will significantly reduce the amount of time it takes Americans to complete government paperwork. The millions of hours freed up translates into billions of dollars saved over time. This legislation, which was supported by the Administration, will also help the federal government transition to a paperless document management system. One that allows agencies to collect and maintain forms and other records faster, easier, and cheaper. 
   Mr. President, Senator ABRAHAM, my friend and colleague, has once again demonstrated his leadership on electronic commerce issues by recently introducing the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This bipartisan measure, which I cosponsored, is a direct outgrowth of and a natural extension to the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. It provides a national framework for online business to business transactions. This important interstate commerce measure provides legal standing for electronic signatures on contracts and other business transactions without preempting state law on intrastate commerce. 
   Electronic signatures are the equivalent of an online ``royal seal.'' Electronic signatures are highly controlled and are far more secure than manual signatures. As my colleagues are aware, it is not difficult to mimic someone's handwritten ``John Hancock.'' An electronic signature, however, is verifiable and it becomes invalid if any of the data in the electronic document is altered or eliminated. This revolutionary communication tool can also time and date stamp someone's unique electronic signature. It is an emerging technology that will serve as a springboard for electronic commerce. 
   Over the last few years, states have recognized the importance of authentication technology on trade and have already adopted rules governing its use. However, of the more than forty states that now have laws on the books, none has adopted the same approach. Congress should not allow an electronic signature hodgepodge to thwart the exponential growth occurring in electronic commerce. 
   In our fast-paced global and highly technical environment, where time is money, companies transacting business across state lines need assurance that electronically signed documents are fully and legally executable. Senator ABRAHAM's Millennium Digital Commerce Act will ensure that businesses located in different states are held to their agreements and obligations even if their respective states have different rules and approaches concerning electronically signed documents. 
   This much needed and timely legislation is a necessary precursor to state-by-state adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). Once UETA is finalized, its enactment by all fifty states is not expected to occur for several years. 
   The Millennium Digital Commerce Act is an important interim step towards eventual national uniformity. It merely establishes the legal certainty of electronic signatures when used for interstate business transactions. It strikes a necessary balance between a state's individual interests and the need for reciprocity among and between states. It fosters the expansion of trade on a state-wide, national, and international basis while promoting continued innovation. 
   The Millennium Digital Commerce Act is technology neutral and allows businesses to determine the methods they want to utilize for executing an online transaction. This legislation also establishes guiding principles for the use of electronic signatures for international transactions. A framework based on open, non-discriminatory standards. Lastly, Senator ABRAHAM's bill requires federal agencies to identify rules or regulations that impede electronic commerce and recommendations for improvements. 
   Mr. President, the United States cannot lag behind our industrial trading partners. Already, the United Kingdom has called for the legal recognition of electronic signatures. 
   I look forward to working with Senator ABRAHAM and Chairman MCCAIN as the Commerce Committee gives prompt consideration to this important pro-technology, pro-electronic commerce legislation. 
   The Millennium Digital Commerce Act will help move our nation's economy forward into the 21st Century. I hope the rest of my colleagues will support this responsible measure which will benefit both American consumers and American businesses.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with a little assistance, I believe we can finish this bill within the next 45 minutes. 
   I commend Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked hard to work out these amendments and accept them by voice vote. The managers have been doing an excellent job, and Senator REID, and Senator DORGAN, so that we can do this. 
   But I want to try to explain where we are. The votes are still taking close to 10 minutes. But there is a physical problem with just how long it takes to call the roll. We will continue to try to do those as quickly as possible. 
   I believe we have no more than five amendments left. We have two that we already had ready to go, and we have possibly three more, and two more on that side. We could be down to, I think, no more than five. I don't want to say fewer than that until we are sure what we have done. But let me ask unanimous consent and see if we can identify this properly.  
   I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only amendments remaining in order, other than those previously in order by Senator DOMENICI, and except those agreed to by the two managers, and, following the disposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 68, the House companion bill. 
   I further ask that all after the enacting clause be 
   stricken in the House resolution, the text of the Senate resolution be inserted, passage occur immediately, and the Senate resolution be placed back on the Calendar. 
   The amendments are as follows. I believe we have two that are still pending. 
   Robb, No. 181. I believe we are going to be able to do that one by voice vote. 
   Lautenberg, No. 183, which I believe will very likely take a recorded vote. Voice vote? All right. We will do those two by voice vote. 
   Then Kerry No. 190; 
   Kennedy, No. 196; 
   And Chafee, No. 238. 
   I further ask that the votes occur in sequence, as provided in the previous consent, with all provisions of the previous consent still in order. 
   I want to emphasize, we may still work out one or two of those that are on the list. But we are locking it down to the two that we are going to do by voice vote and the three that may require a recorded vote. 
   I yield to the manager.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are ready now for the last vote of the night and the last vote on the budget resolution. I commend the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, the Senator from New Jersey. 
   This is a record handling of a budget resolution. I think, in at least the 5 years that I have been watching it closely, this is the shortest time--2 days--and a limited number of votes in the ``vote-arama.'' I think it makes more sense when you have a more limited number. We understand a little bit better about what we are voting on. 
   So you have done an exceptional job. But it would not have happened without the leadership and cooperation of Senator DASCHLE, his team, Senator REID and Senator DORGAN; on our side, Senator NICKLES, Senator CRAIG, and a lot of other people who cooperated and were willing to forgo votes on their amendments. So I think, sincerely, a lot of congratulations should be passed out for the cooperation on this concurrent resolution.

   Mr. LOTT. This is actually so much fun, we might want to stay on and take up another bill. But I want to give a little 
   more credit here because it has been a very productive legislative period. With this budget resolution, we  have also passed the national missile defense bill; we passed the Ed-Flex bill; the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act; the supplemental appropriations bill, on a voice vote; the Y2K small business bill; and the resolution supporting our men and women overseas in Kosovo. 
   Particularly this week, we took up the vote on Kosovo, the supplemental, and the budget resolution. It is one of the most productive weeks I have seen in a long time. 
   When we adjourn shortly, the Easter recess will, of course, begin tonight. There will be no recorded votes until Tuesday, April 13. 
   We will not be in session this Friday. We will be in session on Monday, April 12, but there will be no recorded votes. At that time, we expect to take up the supplemental appropriations conference report, if available, and a budget conference report, if available, and other legislation that may be cleared at that time. 
   Thank you all very much. Have a good Easter recess.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the first anniversary of National Tartan Day. While it is observed on April 6 of each year, I make this recognition today because Congress will be in recess on that day. I want to remind my colleagues that the resolution which establishes National Tartan Day was Senate Resolution 155. It passed by unanimous consent on March 20th of last year. 
   As an American of Scottish descent, I appreciate the efforts of individuals, clan organizations, and other groups such as the Scottish Coalition, who were instrumental in generating support for the resolution. These groups worked diligently to foster national awareness of the important role that Americans of Scottish descent have played in the progress of our country. 
   Mr. President, the purpose of National Tartan Day is to recognize the contributions that Americans of Scottish ancestry have made to our national heritage. It also recognizes the contributions that Scottish Americans continue to make to our country. I look forward to National Tartan Day as another opportunity to pause and reflect on the role Scottish Americans have played in advancing democracy and freedom. It is my hope that this annual event will grow in prominence. Scottish Americans have helped shape this nation. Their contributions are innumerable. In fact, three fourths of all American Presidents can trace their roots to Scotland. 
   Mr. President, in addition to recognizing Americans of Scottish ancestry, National Tartan Day reminds us of the importance of liberty. It honors those who strived for freedom from an oppressive government on April 6th, 1320. It was on that day that the Declaration of Arbroath was signed. It is the Scottish Declaration of Independence. This important document served as the model for America's Declaration of Independence. 
   In demanding their independence from England, the men of Arbroath wrote, ``We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his live.'' These words are applicable today to the heroism of our American veterans and active duty forces who know the precious cost of fighting for liberty. 
   Mr. President, Senate Resolution 155 has served as a catalyst for the many states, cities, and counties that have passed similar resolutions recognizing the important contributions of Scottish Americans. 
   I would like to thank all of my colleagues who supported this resolution last year and who helped to remind the world of the stand for liberty taken on April 6--almost seven hundred years ago--in Arbroath, Scotland. A call for liberty which still echoes through our history and the history of many nations across the globe. 
   I believe April 6th can also serve as a day to recognize those nations that have not achieved the principles of freedom which we hold dear. The example of the Scotsmen at Arbroath--their courage--their desire for freedom--serves as a beacon to countries still striving for liberty today.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the nation lost one of its most distinguished military leaders when Admiral Roy L. Johnson passed away on March 20. He was 93. His Naval career spanned 38 years, at the end of which he was Commander in Chief of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Pacific at the height of the Vietnam conflict in 1965-1967. Prior to that, as Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, he had given the orders to the U.S.S. Maddox and U.S.S. Turner Joy to fire back at Viet Cong gunboats in the Tonkin Gulf incident. 
   The Admiral was a pioneer of Naval aviation. He received his wings in 1932 and served as a flight instructor at the U.S. Navy flight school at Pensacola, both in the era of the biplane in the early 1930s and at the dawn of the space age in the 1950s. 
   This remarkable man was born March 18, 1906 in Big Bend, Louisiana, the eldest of twelve children of John Edward Johnson and Hettie May Long. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1929 and devoted his life thereafter to the security of his country. During World War II, serving on the U.S.S Hornet, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Air Medal and the Legion of Merit with gold star. He saw action in the places  whose names have become a litany of courage: the Philippines, Wake Island, Truk, Iwo Jima, Okinawa. A few year later, as Commanding Officer of the escort carrier U.S.S. Badoeng Strait, he again saw action in the Korean War. 
   In 1955, he became the first commanding officer of the U.S.S. Forrestal, the first of the ``super-carriers,'' was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, and later assumed command of Carrier Division Four, with the Forrestal as his flagship. In 1960, he was named Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy, was later promoted to Vice Admiral, and in 1963 became Deputy Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A year later, he was appointed Commander of the Seventh Fleet, and in that capacity was awarded his second Distinguished Service Medal. In 1965, he was promoted to full Admiral and became Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the last Military Governor of the Bonin Islands, which include Iwo Jima. 
   After his retirement in 1967, Admiral Johnson remained active in civic affairs. He was Chairman of the Board of Virginia Beach General Hospital, a founding trustee of the U.S.S. Forrestal Memorial Education Foundation, president of the Early and Pioneer Naval Aviators Association (The Golden Eagles), President of the Naval Academy Alumni Association, and other organizations. He was an active contributor to the U.S. Naval Institute's Oral History Program, which published his military memoirs, served as an advisor on national security matters, and was on the national board of Senator Bob Dole's veterans' group in his presidential campaign. 
   The Admiral's wife of 69 years, the former Margaret Louise Gross, died last year. Anyone who has been close to a military life theirs knows that it has to be a joint enterprise, in which both husband and wife share the sacrifices, the uncertainties, and the satisfaction of a job heroically done. 
   On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to offer one last salute to Roy Johnson, a patriot from the beginning, a patriot to the last. As we extend our condolences to all his family--especial his daughter, Jo-Anne Lee Coe, our former Secretary of the Senate--we know they share our pride and our appreciation for all that Admiral Johnson did, and gave, to the country he loved.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers, Senator LAUTENBERG and the chairman of the committee, Senator DOMENICI, for the work they are already doing, for the cooperation we have been receiving from Senator DASCHLE, and the fact that we started off last night with an agreement that we would have 35 hours remaining. 
   These Senators have worked through the debate this morning. We just had two back-to-back votes. Getting this agreement to have the first-degree amendments offered by 12 noon is also an important step in the right direction. I know they are going to continue to push aggressively. 
   Let me say to Members on both sides of the aisle, I know how prolific we are and how much we enjoy having amendments with our names on them. However, if we come up with 40 amendments on this side of the aisle and 40 amendments on that side of the aisle--80 amendments on top of the remaining 26 or 27 hours--we are not going to be able to make it by Friday. 
   In view of that, I have already made arrangements for my flight to be Saturday, not Friday. I also want to notify Members that in order to accomplish this goal of finishing up by Friday, we are going to have to go late--unless we can work out some other arrangement--Wednesday night and Thursday night, possibly Friday night. We already have presiding officers signing up for hours to go all night Wednesday and Thursday night. We only have a couple vacancies here. We have a 4 to 5 a.m. slot that will be left for somebody to sign on to. Maybe Senator BROWNBACK will sign up for that slot. We need to fill in these time blanks for both nights. 
   I know the managers are going to need help in order to get through this, especially if we have to go all night. I hope we can work out a way to avoid that, but it is going to take the cooperation of Members on both sides with the managers. 
   I am serious about doing this, not for punishment, but so we can do our work. I have Senators on both sides of the aisle coming up to me saying: ``I really need to get out of here Thursday night.'' ``Can I be gone by 1 Friday?'' ``I must be out of here by Friday night.'' In order to achieve that, we have to come to additional agreements, drop some amendments, and perhaps seriously go around the clock one night. 
   Please cooperate with the managers. You will have the chance on both sides to make your principal points, get votes on those amendments, and then we can move on to conclusion. 
   Thank you for the cooperation we have already received. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Francesco Ghebresillassie plans to retire after 32 years of service to the Senate. That is quite a record, and it deserves notices from those of us who depend so heavily upon--and are never disappointed by--Gheib and the men and women who work with him. 
   Since 1987, he has been Manager of the Production Services Branch of Central Operations under the Sergeant at Arms. In that role, he has supervised all the activities of the Micrographics and Production Services sections. He came to that post step by step, working his way from machine operator to computer operator to shift supervisor. By 1975, he was responsible for two work shifts and for the operations in two buildings. 
   Thereafter, as Hardware Manager, he was responsible for keeping the Senate current with technological changes in the computer arena, refining our procedures, and working with vendors. Later on, as User Support Manager and Production Services Manager, he emphasized quality service to the staff who sit at the thousands of computers within our Senate offices. He has been responsible for interaction with them, and has improved the tech support they have needed to deal with the rapid pace of change in the cyber world. Gheib has also supervised the staff who maintain our microfilm documents for posterity. 
   Needless to say, today's Senate is quite a different institution from the one to which Gheib came in 1967. One of the ways it has changed for the better has been the technological modernization of which Gheib has been a part. Because of his labors, and the diligence of those who have worked with him over the years, we have been able to better serve the folks back home in ways that were not possible three decades ago. 
   As we congratulate Gheib on his retirement, I want to also acknowledge his wife, Theresa, who works for our colleague from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL. We wish for them and for their daughters, Lisa and Ayesha, all the good things the future can bring.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Connie Sullivan, who has served as Reprographic Manager in the Service Department since 1989, plans to retire in June. This will be a significant loss for the Senate. For the past decade, she has been responsible for all phases of the Reprographics Division--more recently known as Printing, Graphics, and Direct Mail--within the Sergeant at Arms office. 
   Connie has been with the Senate for 24 years. She came here in February, 1975 from the House of Representatives as a Composer Technician in the newly created ``Composing Room,'' which was part of the Printing Section of our Department. You can imagine the technological changes Connie has seen since then, when she was asked to assume the duties of Composer with oversight for all the typesetting and layout functions of the Composing Room. 
   In the restructing of the Service Department in 1984, when the Composing Room became the Pre-Press Section, Connie was promoted to supervisor. In a subsequent reorganization in 1986, she was again promoted to Operations Branch Head. That was a well-deserved recognition of her long experience with the growth and integration of services and, especially, the development of the Pre-Press section from conventional typesetting and layout to desk-top publishing and a full-color graphics operations. 
   In that regard, Connie has been one of the people who have helped the Senate enter fully into the information age. We are able to keep in closer touch with our constituents, and they with us, and that has a positive impact on just about everything we do here. 
   So on behalf of the Senate, I want to thank Connie for all her years of service and wish her many happy years of time with her family, her garden, and the enduring satisfaction of a job well done.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are today only four Senators who were here in 1965 when Russell Jackson first came to the Senate to work as an elevator operator. He has observed this institution, both its changes and its continuity, for a long, long time. Now, as he retires as Senior Manager of Central Operations, I want to thank him, on behalf of the entire Senate, for a lifetime of service. 
   Early on, Russell interrupted his work here for a different kind of service, in the U.S. Army, but he returned to the Senate to work with the Office of the Superintendent. Within that Office, he worked his way up the ladder by doing it all: evening shift, day shift, staff assistant, supervisor, office manager, and senior service officer. 
   Within the confines of the Senate family, we all know how important is the coordination of office moves, the  maintenance of our furniture inventory, and all the other operations of the Superintendent's Office. Russell had a hand in it all, and also served as liaison between the Superintendent and our Senate offices. 
   Since 1987, Russell has been Director of the Service Department, a division that is little known to the outside world but so essential to all of us in the Senate. His leadership there brought technological changes to meet the Senate's increasing demands for charts, graphs, exhibits, and the enormous amount of daily work that keeps our offices in contact with constituents and the media. At the same time, he updated personnel practices to boost both productivity and morale, and to open advancement opportunities through an evaluation process and cross training for staff. 
   The Senate, and the constituents whom we are here to serve, owe him a debt of gratitude. And I know my colleagues join me in wishing him a wonderful retirement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr, President, on February 20, 1899, the 56th Congress took an important step toward preserving one of our nation's most significant historical resources when it established the Vicksburg National Military Park. The campaign and siege at Vicksburg, the ``Gibraltar of the Confederacy,'' was a pivotal moment in American History. As the gateway to the Mississippi River, the region was of vital strategic importance to both the South and the North. For this reason, the Vicksburg engagement is heralded as one of the most brilliant offensive campaigns ever fought on U.S. soil. 
   Every year, the Vicksburg National Military Park plays host to over one million visitors who are able to take advantage of this national historic treasure. Like many other National Parks, Vicksburg contributes to the cultural, recreational, scenic, and economic vitality of the region. 
   As America celebrates the centennial anniversary of the Park's founding, it is important to recognize that a number of other campaign related sites throughout Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, used by both the Union and Confederate Armies during the 1862 to 1863 Vicksburg conflict, are in desperate need of study, interpretation, management, and protection. 
   These are sites that have been listed as historically significant properties on both state and national registries. Unfortunately, many of these same sites, buildings, fortifications, earthworks, and other landmarks along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail route have been identified by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as being among the 11 most endangered historic places in America. The Mississippi Heritage Trust, based in Jackson, also named the Campaign Trail as one of its highest priorities and placed the Vicksburg Trail on its list of most threatened historic areas in the state. 
   Mr. President, that is why I am introducing legislation today to authorize the Park Service to conduct a feasibility study on the Vicksburg Campaign Trail. A study that will identify options for preserving some of our nation's most important Civil War battlefields and sites. 
   At the outbreak of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln gathered his ranking civil and military leaders to develop a strategy for ending the war. While seated around a large table examining a map of the nation, Lincoln made a wide sweeping gesture with his hand, and then placed his finger on the map at Vicksburg. He said, ``See what a lot of land these fellows hold of which Vicksburg is the key. The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.'' 
   It was a crucial for the Federal government to regain control of the lower Mississippi River. The goal was to enable troops, supplies and commerce to flow unhindered from the Northwest. Taking the Gibraltar of the Confederacy would sever vital Southern supply routes, achieve a major objective of the Anaconda Plan, and effectively seal the doom of the Confederate capital in Richmond. 
   Even with Major General Ulysses S. Grant leading the charge, Vicksburg would prove a tough nut to crack. Its powerful Southern batteries were trained on the river and an 8 mile-long swath of earthworks guarded all land based approaches. The reinforced line consisted of nine major forts connected by trenches and rifle pits manned by a garrison of 30,000 troops and 172 mounted guns. These fortifications posed the greatest challenge to Union domination of the Mississippi River. 
   The campaign to capture Vicksburg, to ``pocket the key'' to Union victory, lasted 18 months and involved more than 100,000 soldiers. It was here that entire regiments of black soldiers wore the uniform of the United States Army for only the second time in American history. The battle of Vicksburg also involved a number of historic naval engagements between Union gunboats and Confederate warships. 
   After months of frustration and failure to capture the Confederate bastion, General Grant marched his force of over 45,000 men down the west side of the Mississippi River. With the assistance of the U.S. fleet, Union troops crossed the river below Vicksburg and swiftly moved deep into Mississippi. After five fierce battles, the state capital of Jackson was taken. The Union Army then turned west and marched along the rail line towards Vicksburg. Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton led the defense of Vicksburg and held the Rebel line for some time. Pemberton refused to succumb to unconditional surrender even after 47 days of siege. He finally relinquished the city on July 4, 1863 after securing paroles for his resistance forces. 
   Mr. President, many historians consider the battle of Vicksburg to be the most decisive campaign of the Civil War. It was also the most complex combined operation ever undertaken by American armed forces prior to World War II. In fact, the Vicksburg Campaign is required study at the United States Military Academy, the Army War College, and the Commanding General Staff College. These are the men and women who will eventually lead our armed forces. Rather than just read about the conflict in textbooks, troops from military units throughout the country ride the battlefields to experience first hand the tactics of war. 
   At a time when the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' is recognized for its true-to-life depiction of the battlefield on Omaha Beach, Normandy, France, our nation must continue to reflect on the hardships suffered here on our own soil. Those suffered by soldiers and civilians throughout the North and South. 
   The Vicksburg campaign is truly an example of the pathos of war here on America's shores. Brother fought against brother on opposite sides of the battle lines. In defense of ideals each held dear. During the siege, soldiers fed off the land while the civilian population lived underground to escape the constant bombardment of Union guns--enduring exposure, sickness, and little food. It was a military operation where tens of thousands of lives were lost. 
   Vicksburg is also an illustration of the healing and reunification that followed Reconstruction. Union and Confederate veterans joined forces to establish Vicksburg National Military Park. We owe these former combatants a debt of gratitude for their efforts. Not only for their distinguished bravery during the most trying of times, but also for the vital legacy they left us all. 
   Now it is our solemn duty to safeguard the memory of those who fought so dearly during the many battles that occurred to secure Vicksburg by studying the entire campaign trail. For its contribution to our understanding of the Civil War and for its continued influence on American history. This great contest encompassed a vast geographical region. Battle related sites are scattered throughout Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. While some landmarks have been lost to age and neglect, it is not to late to protect the hundreds of remnants associated with the campaign that remain to tell the story. 
   Mr. President, the non-partisan measure offered today is also a key. The key to protecting our national heritage. This bill will begin a much needed process to protect the integrity of the many historic venues associated with the battle of Vicksburg that still exist. Literally hundreds of miles of roads, fields, and bayous were covered by Yankee and Rebel troops during this engagement. To truly understand and appreciate this historic conflict, it is important to look beyond the confines of the Vicksburg National Military Park as it exists today. The 106th Congress needs to build upon the legacy our forefathers left us by developing a comprehensive plan leading to the eventual preservation of the many endangered sites along the four state campaign trail. This Congress needs to authorize this much needed study--the second key. President Lincoln got the first key over one hundred years ago.  Now that 136 years have past, the current President needs the second key. 
   Without Congressional action, historians, soldiers, re-enactors, and tourists will forever lose direct access to the many at-risk landmarks and battlefields along the Vicksburg campaign route that have not yet disappeared. Sites, that while inexorably linked by time and honor, will simply vanish into the wind without the development of coordinated and comprehensive preservation strategies. Sites where the true experience of history will only be left to words. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of this non-partisan measure. Let us take this first and necessary step to protect our national heritage for those who have gone before us and for those yet to come.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators HUTCHISON, BREAUX, and WYDEN, introduce the ``Look, Listen, and Live Stamp Act.'' This bill would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to establish a special-rate postage stamp to promote highway-rail grade crossing safety. 
   There are approximately 150,000 public crossings in America today, the majority of which are equipped with only passive warning devices. In 1998, there were 3,446 grade-crossing collisions involving motor vehicles resulting in 1,950 serious injuries and 422 deaths. A motorist is 40 times more likely to die in a crash involving a train than in a collision involving another motor vehicle. Most recently, this nation witnessed the horror of the Amtrak grade-crossing collision in Bourbonnais, Illinois last week. 
   Sadly, Mr. President, grade-crossing deaths are preventable. Unfortunately, the cost of separating or eliminating all of these crossings would run into the trillions of dollars, and even the cost of equipping every crossing with the most effective active warning devices would run into the billions of dollars. While the railroad industry and Federal, state, and local governments are slowly reducing the number of grade-crossings and improving others, the process will take decades to complete. Also, about half of all collisions at highway-rail grade crossings occur at crossings equipped with active warning systems in place: flashing lights, bells and gates. 
   To save lives now, we must intensify our efforts to educate our citizens on the hazards of, and proper method for, crossing a railroad track. The ``Look, Listen, and Live Stamp Act'' would promote this worthy cause in two ways. First, the stamp itself, and its display in post offices throughout America, would serve as a reminder to all to treat the crossing of a railroad track as a life or death situation. Second, it would provide an additional source of revenue to the Department of Transportation to fund Operation Lifesaver programs. Operation Lifesaver is non-profit, nationwide public education program dedicated to reducing collisions, injuries, and fatalities at intersections where America's roadways meet railways and along railroad rights-of-way. ``Look, Listen, and Live'' is an Operation Lifesaver slogan intended to remind motor vehicle drivers how to protect their lives when they approach a highway-rail grade crossing. 
   Mr. President, the bill would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to sell the stamp at up to 25 percent more than the cost of a first-class stamp, with the difference going to the Department of Transportation to provide additional Operation Lifesaver funding. U.S. Postal Service customers could choose to buy these special stamps, and thereby contribute to this worthy cause, or continue to purchase regular first-class stamps at the going rate. The choice would be theirs. Most importantly, the stamp will provide a constant reminder of the need to exercise caution in crossing railroad tracks. Public memory of the Bourbonnais, Illinois incident, and similar fatal collisions, will fade as media interest shifts to new topics. Operation Lifesaver's public awareness programs are an effort to change driver behavior, but additional reminders, such as this stamp, are required. 
   The lives lost by a driver's careless crossing of a railroad track are usually those in the motor vehicle, but many times include the passengers and crew members of the train. Even when the train crew survives, they are haunted by the memories of helplessly watching these needless deaths. This is a nationwide problem, but a March 22, 1999, USA Today article detailed the dangers of this problem in my home state of Mississippi. I want to dedicate this bill to the families of the victims of the Amtrak ``City of New Orleans'' collision in Bourbonnais last week, especially to the families of the five victims from Mississippi: June Bonnin and Jessica Tickle of Nesbit, Mississippi, Lacey Lipscomb and Rainey Lipscomb of Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, and Sheena Dowe of Jackson, Mississippi. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are obviously dealing with very serious matters for the future of our country and our military men and women today. We want to make sure we proceed properly. We are looking at how to proceed on the Kosovo issue and the supplemental appropriations and be prepared for consideration of the budget resolution beginning tomorrow. 
   We have looked at a lot of options. Obviously, we have been talking among ourselves and the administration, and Senator DASCHLE and I have gone through a couple proposals. 
   Our conclusion is, at this time we should go forward with the cloture vote as scheduled. The cloture vote is on the Smith amendment, which is an amendment to the Hutchison amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill. 
   When that vote is concluded, depending on how that vote turns out, then we will either proceed on the Smith amendment or we will set it aside, if cloture is defeated, and work on the supplemental appropriations bill while we see if we can work out an agreement on language or how we proceed further on the Kosovo issue. 
   We thought the better part of valor at this time is to have the vote on cloture. Is that Senator DASCHLE's understanding, too? We will continue to work with the interested parties. A bipartisan group will sit down together and look at language to see if we can come up with an agreement on that language. We may be able to, maybe not. But we should make that effort. Then we also will press on the supplemental appropriations bill while we do that. 
   With that, Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will resume consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill with amendments in order as outlined in the consent agreement reached on March 19. 
   I should advise the Senate that there is beginning now a working group of Senators who will be working to determine if they can draft language for the resolution regarding the Kosovo situation. We still have pending the Hutchison amendment and the Smith amendment. And there will be a bipartisan effort to see if there can be some compromise language worked out or some language that might be voted on in some form before the afternoon is over. 
   In the meantime, we are working now toward an agreement with regard to consideration of the supplemental appropriations and beginning of the consideration of the budget resolution. The managers are here, and they are ready to begin to work on some amendments, I believe, which have been cleared. We hope that within the next 30 minutes we can enter into an agreement with regard to finishing the supplemental today, with Kosovo language being considered in the process as a possibility, and then begin tomorrow on the budget resolution. 
   With that, I yield the floor so that the distinguished chairman can begin to have these amendments considered that are ready to be cleared. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. This amendment is a very simple one. In March 1995, the beginning of the 104th Congress, the Senate overturned a ruling of the Chair with respect to legislation on an appropriations bill. Ever since that March day, Senators have not been able to raise a point of order against certain amendments offered to appropriations bills. Any amendment dealing with matters not addressed in the specific appropriations bill would no longer be subject to a point of order and therefore are always in order, regardless of the subject matter. 
   In this Senator's opinion, once that prohibition was lifted, the appropriations process was weakened by Senators on both sides of the aisle offering nonrelated amendments to very vital and time-sensitive appropriations bills. Having said that, I, along with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the ranking minority member and the Democratic leader have been attempting to resolve this and other issues we believe weaken the appropriations process. There are several resolutions pending in the Rules Committee that address some of these issues. However, final committee disposition has not been reached with respect to those resolutions. 
   Therefore, I think it is time for the Senate to take this first step toward strengthening the appropriations process and reinstating what had been a part of the Senate Rules for well over 100 years. The time is now and I hope all Senators will be able to support this initial but important step to a more responsible legislative process.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express my happiness and congratulations to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on the birth of his great granddaughter. One of the most memorable experiences I had in my life in the Senate was his beautiful and eloquent statement on the floor in recognition of June 20, 1998, the date of the birth of that fine young American, my grandson, Chester Trent Lott, III. So I know how much it means to Senator BYRD as his family continues to grow and expand, and what a lovely gift it is to have that great grandchild. I thank Senator BYRD for making us all aware of this. I am sorry my eloquence could never rise to the level of his on the birth of my grandson. But I will continue to work on that, I should say to Senator BYRD.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator BYRD and I, as a matter of fact, just came from an extended meeting with the President of the United States, where the joy of our grandchildren and great grandchildren was also uppermost in our minds, because we are  talking about actions by our country, our Government, that affect the young people--a military action. While I always try to have that smile on my face, sometimes it is very serious, what we have to attend to. But I appreciate Senator BYRD's comments this morning to the President. I appreciate the President of the United States meeting with the leaders of Congress as we talk about the situation regarding Serbia and Kosovo. I thought it was a positive step. 
   The Senate, the Congress, must be involved and consulted if a decision is made to take military action, certainly if it is an action that could lead to being an act of war. And we will consider this very carefully. I think it is important this afternoon, and on Monday, the Senate be heard on this issue; that we have the time to discuss and debate, as a matter of fact, the merits and demerits of the plans in Kosovo, what risks are involved. I don't believe the American people now are properly informed about the situation as it now exists. The dynamics have definitely changed in the last few days. 
   We have gone from considering whether or not ground troops from the United States as a part of a NATO mission would be placed in a peaceable situation in Kosovo--to a situation where it appears that an agreed settlement is not going to be achieved and that the Serbian officials will not agree to have a NATO force come in a peaceful arrangement--to the possibility of 
   airstrikes involving Serbian troops and Serbian sites. This is a very serious step. I think the Senate should have an opportunity to be briefed as we were on Thursday, as we meet with the President as we did today, and to continue to be involved in the dialog. 
   I believe the President needed to hear some of the things that he heard today. That is why these meetings are not one-way, they are two-way streets--to make sure that we as the people's representatives are being heard. We made the point, the Speaker and others made the point, that the President needs to address this issue with the American people, explain what the present circumstances are. The President will have a press conference this afternoon. I hope he will address it, and I hope there will be appropriate questions about exactly what the plans are for our military in the near term. 
   Does Senator BYRD wish me to yield on that point?

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the purpose of the procedure that I just undertook was to make sure we had an opportunity today and on Monday to begin to debate the issue surrounding Kosovo and to decide what the Senate's role should be and what action we will take. This may not be the amendment we wind up considering in the end, but to make sure that we have this opportunity for this debate, I thought it was essential we go ahead and take this action now. 
   I have been working with the minority leader for the last 2 days in an effort to try to reach an agreement with respect to the situation in Kosovo, as to how we could consider it and when that would be. Unfortunately, because of the evolving circumstances and because of the briefings that occurred on Thursday and again today, we have not been able to best decide how to proceed. 
   Therefore, I did call up the Hutchinson amendment, which primarily had to do with the things that would have to occur, information we would have to receive from the President before the deployment of ground troops in Kosovo. I then sent to the desk an amendment to that which said, basically, that military action could not be undertaken without the Senate having considered this issue. That is basically the Smith of New Hampshire proposal. 
   Again, I reiterate, so we can lock in the guarantee that we will have an opportunity to discuss this, a cloture motion was filed, but hopefully it won't be necessary to have this vote occur on cloture. We will need to continue to talk about how to proceed, how long we will need, what a vote would be, or to make the decision not to go forward with it would also be an option. I will continue to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle who wish to be heard on this to try to come to a conclusion about how we want to have this vote. 
   We also have the situation where next week the budget resolution will be taken up on Tuesday afternoon, and we have 50 hours of debate on that. It is our intent to complete action on that before we leave so that we can, for the first time in a long time, meet the April 15 deadline in having a budget resolution agreed to. We have a lot of work to do. I want to try to set this up.

   Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield, I think that is a reasonable request. My only purpose in trying to get it to begin and be completed before the policy luncheon is so we could go right to the budget resolution right after lunch. I think to just have the vote right after lunch at 2:15 and then go to the budget resolution is a reasonable request. We will have Monday in which Senators can begin to express themselves. Senator BYRD and I just had a little colloquy. We will have more Members, I hope, available, as we go forward, and Senators are already calling to indicate they would like to be heard even this afternoon or Monday, to discuss this. We will have the opportunity Tuesday morning. 
   I want to say, again, we may decide to vitiate all of this. We are just not ready to go forward. If that is the case, then we will do so. 
   I will modify my request to say that--I would like to have the time still equally divided before the luncheon--the vote occur at 2:15 instead of 12:15.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since all time has been used, except for maybe 5 minutes--40 seconds for the opponents and 4 1/2 minutes or so for the proponents--I would like to use leader time to state my position on this issue. 
   This morning I happened to be listening to one of the Washington, DC, all-news radio stations. There was an ad on there done by the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, speaking about the importance of tobacco cessation campaigns. Now, I wondered who paid for that, how that was being supported. Why was a Lieutenant Governor--a candidate for Governor--being used in this ad? It relates to this whole debate. I think probably the State of Maryland is paying for that campaign, or maybe it is a campaign unrelated to all this. But the point there is that there is already a lot being done, and there is going to be  a lot more done in the smoking cessation campaigns by the States. 
   Mr. President, this is a very fundamental argument. It goes to the heart of the broader question: Does the Federal Government have the great wisdom reposing here in the Secretary of HHS, or do States have a certain modicum of wisdom of their own? 
   Frankly, I trust the Governor of Pennsylvania and the legislature in Pennsylvania. I trust the Governors of Iowa and Illinois, and the legislature in Ohio, and in my own State, to make the best decision for the people in that State. There are those here who think the Federal Government has to review this, the Federal Government has the answer, the Federal Government must direct how this money is spent. I don't agree with that. That is the fundamental argument here on this issue and on a lot of others, as well. 
   First, a little history. How did this all begin? Well, whether you agree with it or not, or whether I like it or not, it began in my State of Mississippi. An attorney general developed this lawsuit and, to their credit, they did a fantastic job. The Federal Government wasn't involved. The Federal Government could not find a way to get involved. They did it. It was Mississippi, Florida, Texas, Washington State, all across the Nation. The States, through their attorneys general and their lawyers, did the job and they got settlements. They got the money. They won the issue. 
   Now, the Federal Government shows up and says, oh, by the way, give me that. The truth of the matter is, there are many people in this city who think all of that money, or somewhere between 50 and 77 percent of that money, should come to Washington, even though the Federal Government did nothing to win this settlement. They weren't a positive force. But they have the temerity to show up and say the law requires this or that and they want that money. I want to emphasize again that you are talking about a very substantial portion of that money. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-3-19990318</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. The Governors say:  
   ..... we are adamantly opposed to any amendments that would restrict how States spend their tobacco settlement money.  
   They point out that 20 percent of the settlement funds, under this amendment, would have to go for smoking cessation, and then another 30 percent for health care programs. But also what the States do has to be approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Why? What do they have at HHS that the various States don't have, and why can't they decide on their own what is best for their people? 
   They say in their letter they are opposed to earmarks on smoking cessation on the basis that it represents unsound public policy. 
   They then go on to say that there are many things already being done. In fact, the settlement agreement contains two major programs funded at $1.7 billion over 10 years dedicated to reducing smoking, and $250 million over the next 10 years will go toward the creation of a national charitable foundation that will support the study of programs to reduce teen smoking. An additional $1.45 billion over 5 years will go toward the National Public Education Fund to counter youth tobacco use and educate consumers about tobacco-related diseases. 
   So there is a great deal already being done. There is a significant number of restrictions in the settlement with regard to advertising and promotion of smoking. The States are already, on their own, spending funds for the smoking cessation campaign. 
   The Governors need flexibility. That is what they say. In one State, perhaps, they need more money for smoking cessation. Fine. Perhaps they need more money for child health care. I think under this amendment that would be fine. But in another State perhaps they need it for HOPE scholarships, like Governor Engler in Michigan has been talking about. Or perhaps in another State, like my own, they want to use these funds for juvenile detention facilities, which, by the way, would be smoke-free. But there is a real need there. Let the States make those decisions. 
   Again, I want to point out that in the letter from Secretary Shalala she notes that the Federal share of Medicaid expenses ranges from 50 to 77 percent. And they don't want 
   anything to happen here that would not allow them to come back around later and try to get more, or large, chunks of this money. 
   I think that is typical Federal Government arrogance: ``We have the solutions. We have the greater knowledge.'' I fundamentally reject that. I think the people closer to the problems are closer to the people, whether it is the farmers, or the children, or health care needs of the children in their States. I represent one of the poorest States in the Nation. We have tremendous needs for our children based on problems of poverty. We have needs across the board. We know what those needs are better than some all-powerful Federal Government. 
   So I just want to urge that this amendment be defeated. 
   I don't think, by the way, that every year for the next 25 years the States should have to submit their plan to the Department of Health and Human Services. Maybe the next Department will be headed by a Republican-appointed Secretary of HHS. ``Frankly, I don't care, my dear.'' I think the States can do this on their own. The Federal Government wants the money. Or, if they don't get the money, they want to control it. 
   That is one of the reasons I am glad to serve in the Senate today--so I can fight just such ideas as this, that the Federal Government has the answers and should have the control. We should reject this amendment and allow the States to do what is best for their people. They know what the needs are. They will provide the right decision. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Did we get agreement to that request? I will go ahead and complete the entire request. Let me say on the list of amendments, Senator DASCHLE is correct. There are apparently 80-something amendments on that list. I assume that a lot of them are defensive in nature and some of them can very likely be accepted. We have the two best managers, probably, in the Senate handling this bill--the Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD. I am sure they will go through that list like a knife through hot butter. But there are some on that list that certainly will have to be dealt with in the regular order. We will work on our side to get that list worked down, just as I am sure Senator DASCHLE will. 
   Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above-listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. I further ask that the bill remain at the desk, and when the Senate receives the House companion bill, the Chair automatically strike all after the enacting clause, insert the text of S. 544, as amended, the House bill be advanced to third reading and the bill be passed, all without intervening action or debate. 
   I further ask that the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate. 
   For the information of those who might be wondering about that, the House has not yet acted on this supplemental. It is anticipated they will not act until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Therefore, we do not want to run this to final completion. This will allow us to stop at a critical point and wait for the House action and then go straight to conference. 
   Finally, I ask that the Senate bill be placed back on the Calendar and final passage occur no later than 11 a.m. on Friday, March 19, and that paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, millions of Americans awoke yesterday to the tragic news of the derailment of the Amtrak ``City of New Orleans'' passenger train in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Late Monday night, the train, bound for New Orleans from Chicago, struck a tractor trailer at a highway/railroad crossing, throwing the two locomotives and 11 of the 14 cars off the tracks. More than 100 of the 196 passengers, 18 crew members, and two off-duty Amtrak employees were injured. At least eleven passengers were killed, including three Mississippians. 
   Both Tricia and I are keeping the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy in our prayers, especially the Bonnin and Lipscomb families of DeSoto County, Mississippi. June Bonnin of Nesbit, Mississippi was diagnosed with what doctors described as incurable cancer five years ago. However, her strong faith in God kept her going and inspired others around her. She and her granddaughter, Jessica Tickle of Memphis, Tennessee, are in God's hands now, and her daughter Ashley was severely injured. Rainey and Lacey Lipscomb, two young sisters from Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, also perished in this crash. We grieve with these families for their loss. 
   Mr. President, a group of students and adults from Clinton High School and Covenant Christian School in Clinton, Mississippi riding that train were returning to Mississippi after a spring-break ski trip. These young teenagers were jolted into a nightmare situation as some of the train's locomotives and cars overturned, split open, and caught fire. 
   I want to recognize the reactions of two of those students during this catastrophe. Clinton High School students Michael Freeman and Caleb McNair quickly recovered from the initial shock of this crash and went to the aid of their fellow students and passengers. The Jackson, Mississippi newspaper reported today that Michael located an escape route through a side window, which was now at the top of their overturned passenger coach, built a ladder from broken seats, climbed out, and pulled his fellow students out to safety. Meanwhile, Caleb searched the coach for his fellow students. They had rescued more than a dozen students by the time emergency personnel arrived on scene. Michael then assisted one of the injured students to a telephone so she could notify her parents. 
   Mr. President, the actions of these two young men may have prevented the other students from suffering additional injury or even death. Their reaction during this unexpected and disorienting event was truly commendable, as was the response by local, state, and Federal emergency personnel, Amtrak, and the Red Cross. 
   It is unfortunate that the Nation's awareness of the dangers of road/railway crossings tends to be raised by tragedies such as this, only to fade as time passes. Drivers who fail to heed rail intersection warnings place not only themselves at risk, but others as well. More needs to be done to prevent such accidents. I intend to work with my colleagues this year to do just that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to combat the growing and costly fraud of title washing. Title fraud is a deceptive practice that costs consumers more than $4 billion dollars annually and places millions of structurally defective vehicles back on America's roads and highways. These are millions of unsafe cars and trucks sharing the roads with your loved ones. 
   The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act encourages states to adopt uniform titling and registration standards to protect used car buyers from unknowingly purchasing totaled and subsequently rebuilt vehicles. It is a sound and reasonable measure that enhances consumer disclosure and aids state motor vehicle administrators throughout the nation by giving them identical points of reference to describe salvage vehicles. 
   Let us be very clear on this, there are no uniform definitions and standards in place today and this leads to a hodgepodge of disclosure approaches throughout the country. Unscrupulous automobile rebuilders take advantage of inconsistencies in state titling definitions and procedures to purchase damaged vehicles at a low cost, rebuild them, oftentimes by welding the front and back of two different cars together, and then retitling the vehicle in another state. The new ``clean'' title bears no indication of the vehicle's previous damage record. As a result, consumers in your states are being sold previously totaled cars and trucks without having any knowledge that the vehicle they purchased, sometimes at a very high price, was severely damaged. A vehicle where only minor damage could cause it to fall apart. The unwitting purchasers of these vehicles experience significant economic loss. They and other motorists may also suffer bodily harm from these wrecks on wheels. 
   Mr. President, the title branding bill offered today will promote greater disclosure to potential used car buyers than occurs today. It establishes uniform definitions for salvage, rebuilt salvage, nonrepairable, and flood vehicles based upon the recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee. This congressionally mandated task force, overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation, included the U.S. Attorney General's Criminal and Civil Justice Divisions, State motor vehicle officials, motor vehicle manufactures, auto dealers, recyclers, insurers, salvage yard operators, scrap processors, the U.S. Treasury Department, police chiefs and municipal auto theft investigators, and other interested and affected parties. The uniform definitions and standards contained in this bill are theirs, not mine. Their recommendations are based on a wealth of day-to-day experience dealing with consumer fraud, vehicle titling, and automobile theft. The Salvage Advisory Committee's recommendations struck an appropriate balance between consumers' economic interests and their personal safety. 
   The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act requires rebuilt salvage vehicles to undergo a theft inspection in addition to any required state safety inspection. To further promote disclosure to potential used car buyers, the legislation also requires rebuilt salvage vehicles to have a decal permanently fastened to the driver's doorjamb and a sticker would be affixed to the windshield disclosing the vehicle's status. Additionally, a written disclosure statement must be provided to buyers and the vehicle's title would be branded with the statement ``rebuilt salvage.'' 
   The bill also requires that the brands included on state vehicle titles be carried forward to each state where the vehicle is retitled. 
   So if your state wants to add additional requirements--they can. And these items will be a permanent part of the title. 
   In an effort to take aim at automobile theft, the bill requires the tracking of Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) of irreparably damaged vehicles. This provision ensures that VINs are not simply swapped from damaged cars to stolen cars to mask their identity. 
   Mr. President, Congress came very close to enacting title branding legislation last year. The original Senate measure received the formal bipartisan support of 57 Senators, and a similar bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 333 to 72. Throughout the legislative process, a number of significant changes were made to the bill to address the concerns expressed by consumer groups and some state attorneys general. 
   The title branding bill before you today retains all of the changes approved by the House of Representatives last October and it includes additional pro-consumer, pro-states rights modifications received from states and the Administration. 
   Under this revised bill, states are free to adopt disclosure standards beyond those provided for in the bill. Let me say again that nothing in this bill prohibits states from providing unlimited disclosure to their citizens. This important legislation merely creates a basic minimum national standard while giving participating states the flexibility to adopt more stringent provisions and additional disclosure requirements. 
   The bill also does not create a federal mandate on the states as some big government advocates would have it. My colleagues are well aware that the Supreme Court ruled in New York v. United States [505 U.S. 144 (1992)] that states cannot be forced by Congress to execute programs that should be administered by the U.S. government. In the New York decision, the Justices upheld ``access incentives'' which allow states to decide whether they want to use federal standards. 
   This legislation follows the Supreme Court's ruling by offering incentive grants, as proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, to states that voluntarily choose to participate in the uniform titling regime for salvage vehicles. Thus, states that enact the bill's uniform titling definitions and procedures will be eligible for conformance funding. They can use the authorized funds to issue new titles, to establish and administer vehicle theft or safety inspections, for enforcement activities, and for other related purposes. While I believe most states will decide to participate in this completely voluntary program, rest assured no state will be penalized for choosing not to participate, or for adopting only some of the bill's provisions. 
   I would also like to point out that the revised bill no longer links state adoption of uniform titling standards to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) funding or participation. Again, there is no penalty for nonparticipation.  
   The bill merely identifies and defines the minimum number of terms that should be used by states to characterize damaged vehicles. The use of nationally and consistently recognized terms will help consumers make informed decisions wherever they purchase a used vehicle. Whether in Mississippi, Utah, Florida, Montana, Texas, Virginia or any other participating state. 
   Mr. President, let me tell our colleagues this bill is about a commission's recommendations. Quite frankly, I took the recommendations from a commission created by Congress and codified their ideas. The ideas of the experts. The ideas of all the stakeholders. As we all know, many commission reports gather dust. I do not want this one to gather dust because motorists could be driving used cars which are literally wrecks. This is the commission's bill and I am proud to be associated with its sponsorship. 
   The bill fully adopts the federal task force's ``salvage'' vehicle definition as a vehicle that sustains damage in excess of 75% of its pre-accident value. This figure is lower than the House's proposal during the 105th Congress which would have set the uniform salvage threshold at 80%. The revised bill also gives states the flexibility to establish an even lower threshold if they choose. A state may set its salvage threshold at 70%, for example. The bill does not, however, set the uniform standard at an arbitrarily low minimum salvage threshold, such as 65%, when no state in the union currently has such a standard. No state. Not one. 
   The bill defines a flood vehicle as one that suffers water damage that inhibits the electrical, computerized, or mechanical functions of the vehicle. This definition expands upon the recommendation of the Advisory Committee by taking into account real world experience. State's found that merely being exposed to water alone does not in and of itself threaten the structural integrity, safety, or value of a vehicle. A car or truck should not be branded a flood vehicle just because its carpeting and floor mats are wet. If it were the case, none of us would drive our cars through the rain or snow. It is only when water damage impairs a vehicle's operating functions and the electrical, mechanical or computerized components have not been repaired or replaced, that the vehicle should be classified as a flood vehicle. The revised bill also goes beyond the task force's recommendations by including any vehicle acquired by an insurer as part of a water damage settlement. 
   A nonrepairable vehicle is one that is incapable of being driven safely and has no resale value except as a source for parts or scrap. This is similar to the nonrepairable definition used by California, our nation's largest state. This is also the common sense definition the Advisory Committee wisely chose in lieu of an arbitrary percentage based definition that would force otherwise repairable vehicles into the scrap heap. It should be noted that only five states have a percentage based nonrepairable definition. I find it troubling that these same five states have been far less successful in reducing automobile thefts than the nation as a whole and accident related deaths higher than the forty five states that do not have a percentage based nonrepairable definition. Coupled with the negative economic effects on consumers, these are additional reasons not to adopt a percentage based definition for nonrepairable vehicles. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues should also be aware that this legislation allows states to use additional terms in their titling regimes such as ``reconstructed'', ``unrebuildable'', and ``junk vehicles'' in addition to the terms defined in this measure. If a state that chooses to conform to the federal standard also wants to use a percentage based definition to describe a ``parts only'' vehicle, it can use a term synonymous to nonrepairable. 
   The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act also allows states to cover any vehicle, regardless of age. It allows older vehicles to be designated as a ``older model salvage vehicle.'' This is a change recommended by a state attorneys general representative to provide states with even more flexibility. Again, the age of a vehicle is no longer an issue under this revised title branding bill. 
   This legislation even grants state attorneys general the ability to sue on behalf of consumers victimized by rebuilt salvage fraud and to recover monetary judgments for damages that citizens may have suffered. 
   Two new prohibited acts are included in the bill--one related to failure to make a flood disclosure and the other related to moving a vehicle or title across state lines for the purpose of avoiding the bill's requirements. 
   Mr. President, I have just gone over a number of changes that I incorporated into the bill. I have reached out to accommodate a number of issues, but there is a point where making changes defeats the purpose of the bill which is to promote consumer disclosure through uniformity. 
   Mr. President, this bill does nothing to inhibit a consumers ability to pursue private rights of actions available under state law. Moreover, states are free to continue or adopt new civil and criminal penalties against individuals or companies that defraud consumers. The bill does not, however, negatively impact the already overburdened Federal courts. This bill is about disclosure. If your son or daughter is buying a used car, you want them to know right up front whether the vehicle they are about to purchase has been severely damaged. Getting relief after several years of litigating in a U.S. Court does not protect consumers. It does not turn the clock back for someone who has been killed or seriously injured in a structurally unsafe vehicle. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to reiterate some key points concerning The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act: 
   State participation is completely voluntary. V-O-L-U-N-T-A-R-Y. 
   There is no preemption of state law. None whatsoever. None. None. None. State legislatures can fully enact the bill's provisions, enact only some of the uniform definitions and standards, or take no action whatsoever. 
   States that choose to participate in the minimal uniform definitions and standards identified in this bill will be entitled to conformance funding. 
   There is no penalty for non-participation by a state. None whatsoever. None. None. None. And, no linkage to state National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) funding or participation. 
   It mirrors recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee. 
   The bill's definitions and standards are the minimum necessary for a voluntary uniform salvage titling framework. M-I-N-I-M-U-M. 
   This legislation does not force states to adopt standards or definitions that not even one state currently has in place. 
   The bill does not unnecessarily devalue vehicles or cause otherwise repairable automobiles to be junked. This is key because some will talk about greater protection, but these proposals threaten the car's value for no good reason and this makes no sense 
   The revised bill includes many additional technical corrections provided to me by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the National Association of Attorney's General, and others. I want to personally thank them for their time and effort in going over the bill with me--line by line. Their thoughts were invaluable and helpful. Throughout the legislative process, I have made several good faith efforts to reach out to all groups interested in this legislation and where possible, I included reasonable changes in the bill. 
   It is widely supported by state motor vehicle administrators, law enforcement agencies, state legislators, consumers, and the automobile and insurance industries. Widely supported. 
   Experts on the front lines, those who deal with titling issues everyday, have described other proposals that have been floated recently as confusing, or overly complex, or unworkable, or unwise, or counter productive. In many instances, these proposals have been flatly rejected by state legislatures. 
   The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act represents a fair, balanced, and workable approach to dealing with the issue of title fraud. It provides a voluntary framework for states to provide much needed disclosure to potential used-car purchasers. It would help close the many loopholes that exist in state titling rules. This measure maintains a state's ability to provide more disclosure, to take direct  and timely action against dishonest parties, and to adopt more stringent rules and procedures should they decide to do so. It is both pro-consumer and pro-states rights. This bill protects the safety and well-being of consumers and motorists across America. 
   I urge the more than fifty of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who formally supported this title branding legislation during the last Congress to cosponsor this important bill again. I ask the rest of my colleagues also to protect their constituents by lending their support to this much needed consumer protection measure. 
   The time has come for Congressional action. Repeated hearings have been held on this issue in both chambers over several years. The record is clear. Title fraud is a significant problem across the country. It continues unabated. The solution is more consumer disclosure based on the use of appropriate and rational national standards. This legislation is a win-win solution for consumers, states, and industry. 
   You know the time has come for Congressional action when the Department of Transportation's crash test cars are rebuilt, title washed, and back on America's roads and highways. Remember, these are deliberately wrecked vehicles. Yes, the time has come for action. 
   Let us work together to move this measure forward. To keep dishonest rebuilders from taking advantage of even one more used car purchaser in your state.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, S. Res. 65 concerns a request for testimony in a civil action pending in North Dakota state court. The plaintiffs in this case claim that defendant Pearson defrauded them into paying him money in return for promises to alleviate plaintiff' tax liability on an investment. In particular, plaintiffs claim that defendant Pearson misrepresented the frequency and nature of his contacts with two members of Senator DORGAN's staff. Counsel for the plaintiffs wish to depose the two staff members to test the accuracy of the defendant's representations about their meetings. Senator DORGAN has approved testimony and, if necessary, production of relevant documents by his staff in connection with this action. 
   This resolution would permit these two members of Senator DORGAN's staff, or any other current or former employees of the Senate, to testify and produce documents for use in this case. 
   The resolution (S. Res. 66) was agreed to.

   The action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the operation of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which provides for the automatic adjustment of the compensation of Members of Congress on an annual basis to reflect changes in employment costs in the preceding year, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is the same annual cost-of-living adjustment paid to Federal judges and senior executive branch officials and is timed to coincide with the annual January 1 adjustment of the general civil service schedule. The issue presented in this action was the subject of a lawsuit brought in 1992 by another Member of the House of Representatives, who sought unsuccessfully to enjoin the 1993 congressional COLA, based on the then newly-ratified 27th Amendment. 
   This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Secretary of the Senate and to seek dismissal of this action in order to defend the Secretary's ability to continue to carry out his duty under the law to disburse congressional compensation payable pursuant to the Constitution and Federal statute.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin consideration of a resolution commending Senator KERREY on the 30th anniversary of his receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor. I had the pleasure of talking to Senator KERREY late last night, as a matter of fact, as he typically was working aggressively on matters of great interest to our country. I think it is appropriate that we have this resolution before us. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour for consideration of the resolution, with the time equally divided between Senators HAGEL and EDWARDS or their designees. 
   At 11:30 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of S. 257, the national missile defense bill, with a Cochran amendment pending regarding clarification of funding. Under a previous consent agreement, there will be 1 hour for debate on the amendment, equally divided between Senators COCHRAN and LEVIN or their designees. 
   At the conclusion of that debate time, the Senate will recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow the weekly party caucuses to meet. Upon reconvening at 2:15, the Senate will immediately proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Cochran amendment. And further votes are expected throughout Tuesday's session as the Senate continues consideration of the missile defense bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the missile defense bill, it seems to me good progress is being made. And the fact that we did not have to have a vote on a motion to proceed or on cloture on a motion to proceed was a very positive development. 
   I hope the Cochran amendment can be adopted and perhaps other action taken today, but if we could actually get to final passage of this bill tonight, that would be very positive, because we do have two other issues we would like to be able to consider in some form this week. One of them is the matter of Kosovo, how the Senate wishes to express itself on that issue and how ground troops would be introduced, if at all. And then also we have the emergency supplemental appropriations bill pending. Next week, the entirety of the week will have to be spent on the budget resolution in order to complete action on 
   that before the Easter recess. So the sooner we can finish the missile defense bill, the better it will be in addressing these other issues in a timely fashion. 
   Mr. President, I know that Senators HAGEL and REID and EDWARDS are in the Chamber and wish to speak on the resolution commemorating this Congressional Medal of Honor given to Senator KERREY, but I would like to take just 5 minutes or so to talk about the missile defense bill.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support and am a proud sponsor of S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. If enacted, it would make the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as is technologically possible, an effective national missile defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate. 
   As I go around the country and I talk about this issue, people are surprised, stunned, to hear that we do not have this missile defense capability right now. They think that if there happened to be a rogue missile launched, accidentally or even intended, we would be able to just knock that out, no problem. When they find out we do not have  that technology in place now, they are greatly alarmed. 
   So I commend the principal sponsors of this bipartisan legislation, Senator COCHRAN of Mississippi and Senator INOUYE of Hawaii, for their diligent efforts to ensure that all 50 States--indeed, all Americans--enjoy protection against missile attack. 
   My colleagues are aware that similar legislation has been brought before the Senate before--twice last year--and twice we failed, just one vote short of cutting off a filibuster. I am glad it appears we may not have a filibuster this time, that we can deal with the substance of this bill and we can vote on amendments and hopefully get to final passage, because it is clear there is bipartisan support and the realization that we need to move forward. 
   I know there are those who are concerned that it could be misinterpreted what we are trying to do here and what are the ramifications with regard to the ABM Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. My answer to that is that we should make it clear what our intentions are. This is a defensive mechanism; this is to go forward and develop the technology, and when we have that technology, then we should move to deploy it. But we would have time to explain to one and all--whether it is Russia, members of the Russian Duma or the federation in Russia, their leadership, or members of the Israeli Knesset--what our intentions are. 
   To make sure that is done, I have been discussing with the President and with Senator DASCHLE, and with others on both sides of the aisle, the idea that we should set up a working group, patterned after the example of the arms control observer group that served us quite well during the 1980s and early 1990s when we were dealing with the SALT treaties and we were trying to get disarmament agreements worked out in Europe and with the Soviet Union. 
   We had Senators and Members of Congress who met with representatives of the then Soviet Government. We went to the Soviet Union. We had them come here. We had meetings in Geneva. And I believe that Members of the Senate who were involved will tell you it was very helpful. I discussed it with Senator MOYNIHAN just yesterday at lunch, and he said clearly when he went to Geneva and met with the Russians and explained what our intentions were, and they talked about their concerns about cruise missiles in Europe, that everybody had a better understanding. 
   So what I have advocated is that we set up a group which would be entitled something like this, although I am not wedded to a title, but the national security and missile defense working group, and that Senator COCHRAN would chair that group. I understand Senator DASCHLE has some Senators in mind on his side of the aisle--it would be equally divided--who would be involved in this effort. It would be a follow-on to what we are trying to do with the National Missile Defense Act. I hope that before this day is out we can set up this group and it will represent a broad cross section of the Senate so that everybody will understand what is intended. 
   There are real dangers here. ``The threat is real, serious, and growing.'' 
   That is not my quote. That is a quote of the Central Intelligence Agency, an analyst who works in this critical area. 
   Let me recite what has happened since March of last year: Pakistan launched a medium-range missile that it acquired from North Korea; China and North Korea continue to provide Pakistan with technical and other assistance on missiles and nuclear weapons; Iran launched a medium-range missile. The original design also came from North Korea. It was improved by technology that it has been receiving from Russia and China. Up to this day, Russian companies are still exchanging technology and information with Iran. They are developing greater capability. That is extremely dangerous. 
   While Congress has expressed its concern about this, the administration has even taken actions against certain companies in Russia. It continues to this very moment. We know that Iran is interested in developing and acquiring a long-range missile that could reach--yes--the United States as well as European capitals and that Tehran is benefiting from this extensive assistance from Russia and from China. 
   North Korea is a very nervous situation. That country launched a long-range missile last August that demonstrated both intent and capability to deliver payloads over extremely long distances. Having been advised of this development, the CIA now concludes that the North Koreans ``would be able to use the three-stage configuration as a ballistic missile.....to deliver small payloads to ICBM ranges.'' With minor modifications, this missile, the CIA notes, could probably reach not only Hawaii and Alaska but also the rest of the United States. 
   The People's Republic of China, PRC, likewise continues to engage in a massive buildup of its missile forces both at the theater level--that is aimed against our friend, Taiwan, their neighbor--and the strategic level--aimed at, perhaps, even the United States. 
   Today the PRC has more than a dozen missiles aimed at American cities. Yet, we are told on occasion there is not a missile aimed at the United States today. That is not true. The Chinese are in the process of developing multiple warheads for those and their next-generation mobile missiles, which are much more difficult to locate. 
   Sadly, there is a serious problem here, and it is one that is growing. Just recently, of course, is the situation brought to the public's attention regarding China's nuclear espionage and how we are dealing with that. There are those wanting to know, How did this happen? Who did it? Who is to blame? All of that is interesting and we should determine that, but here is the real question: Is it still going on? Have we stopped it? 
   I think Congress should take a serious look at this situation. We need to deal with some laws to make it possible for us to stop this sort of espionage. Do they need additional money? We would need to have the appropriate briefing from the Energy Department and the CIA to judge whether or not additional money should be needed. 
   This post-cold-war era is a unique time, but it is also a dangerous time. It is a time when historically, reviewing what we have done in the past, we drop our guard when there appears to be times of calm and peace, but I think that is when we are at our greatest danger. Our inability to defend against incoming accidental or rogue-launched missiles is our Achilles' heel. It is where we are in the greatest danger. Would we not act? Should we not begin the process now? The truth of the matter is we should have already done it. If we don't, there will come a time soon--perhaps early in the millennium--when we will, in fact, be threatened and in serious danger. 
   This National Missile Defense Act will get us started. It will be the kind of progress we need. We will still have to make the decisions about the appropriations and when we actually go forward with deployment. I sense there has been movement in the Senate on this issue. I know there has been movement in the administration on this issue. Now is the time to act. I hope the Senate will do it in an expeditious and bipartisan manner. I believe we will look back on this bill and this vote as one of the most significant votes that we take in the year 1999. 
   I yield the floor.

We will not have any recorded votes on Friday, and because we have been able to work out an agreement on how to proceed on the national missile defense issue, we will not have any recorded votes on Monday either. We will be on the bill. We worked it out where we would not have to have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. I think this is a positive. I want to commend the Democratic leader for working with us on that. 
   Also, before we vote, I want to say how pleased I am that we have completed this Education Flexibility Act. The managers of the bill have done a good job. We have been through all these votes today and we are going to complete this legislation, and the story will be that the Senate passed a bipartisan education bill that is going to help the children at the local level.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, across our Nation, courageous teachers and school administrators, parents and Governors, are working to find creative ways to ensure that our children receive a world class education. The United States Senate is prepared to promote and support these efforts. Nothing is more important to the future of our Nation that the education of our children. 
   The ideas we propose today are confident reform, rooted in tested principles, parents, teachers and principals, the ones who know our children best, should have the greatest influence on their classrooms. The needs of America's schools differ from community to community, and we help them most when we empower them to make wise choices for the children in their care. Our money, manpower and energy should be primarily devoted to teaching children, not to filing paperwork and fueling bureaucracies. 
   These commonsense proposals have broad appeal. They have received strong bipartisan support. Every Democratic Governor in the country supports this bill. Last year, the President promised he would expand the program we are considering today to all fifty States. The bill passed out of committee by a vote of 17-1 last July, and Secretary Riley strongly supported its enactment at that time. There is no reason why the Senate should not quickly pass the bill sponsored by Senators FRIST and WYDEN.  
   So the question before the Senate is really quite simple. It is not whether we will pass the Ed-Flex bill, for in the end the overwhelming majority of the Senate will support it. Rather, the question is whether the Senate will keep faith with the American people, by working together in a bipartisan fashion, to help America's school children. Republicans stand ready to do just that. The evidence of our commitment is the fact that we offer a bipartisan bill as one of the very first we bring to the Senate floor. 
   Republicans and Democrats have honest disagreements on many education initiatives. Democrats believe that new Federal categorical grant programs that distribute money to States and counties based on complex formulas are the best way to hire more teachers. Republicans believe that Federal dollars should be sent directly to the classroom so that parents, teachers, and principals can address the unique educational needs of their particular students, whether it be to hire more teachers, to provide special tutors, to buy new books or to teach computer skills. These differing philosophies will be debated, and ought to be debated, fully by the Senate. We will have ample opportunity throughout this Congress to do just that. 
   However, there is simply no need to have divisive debates on a bipartisan bill. So I urge my colleagues from across the aisle to choose constructive progress over political posturing for the sake of improving America's schools. 
   Ed-Flex works for America's children. It proposes a simple exchange. States will hold schools accountable for their performance in return for granting each school the freedom to determine how best to achieve those results. This is not an untested premise. Currently, twelve States have this authority. The results have been promising. 
   In Texas, Ed-Flex schools outperformed those without waivers by several percentage points on student achievement scores. An elementary school in Maryland now provides individual tutors for its students who lag behind in reading. The same school has dramatically reduced class size in math and reading, providing one teacher for every twelve students. 
   The bill before us today simply expands the right to become an Ed-Flex State to all fifty States. It is strongly supported by our Nation's Governors, both Democrats and Republicans. Last month, the National Governors Association stated, ``The expansion of the Ed-Flex program is a high priority for Governors. ..... We strongly support this legislation as well as your decision to move forward at this time.'' The Nation's Democratic Governors joined together unanimously saying, ``S. 280 is commonsense legislation that we believe deserves immediate consideration. We hope, therefore, that you will join in supporting its prompt enactment.'' 
   Governors across America are united. There is simply no reason why the Senate should not be as well. I urge my good friends and colleagues on the other side of aisle to listen to their Governors. Join us in supporting the prompt enactment of a simple bill that will provide meaningful reform to schools throughout our Nation. Let's not squander an opportunity to work together to demonstrate our common commitment to America's schoolchildren.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Pennsylvania may wish to make a statement in a moment also, but if I could just do a couple of things here. 
   First, before the Senators leave the Chamber, the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Oregon, I want to again thank them for their effort. It was bipartisan because the Senator from Oregon, Mr WYDEN, made it so, stayed in there, worked with us, but I particularly wish to thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. FRIST, the doctor, who gave us an education. He took us to school. He used apples and information and examples. He acted like a good teacher should. I congratulate him for that. He even showed us how you could use a scalpel to cut the redtape, and that is what this Ed-Flex bill will do. 
   So to the two Senators, I thank them for their leadership, for their work, for their persistence because they both have been heckling me about this bill for a year, and I am glad it is done. I congratulate them for their effort.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on February 28, 1999, the Senate said farewell to a valuable employee. William D. ``Bill'' Lackey, Jr., Journal Clerk of the Senate, retired after 34 1/2 years of service to the Senate. 
   Bill arrived at the Senate's doorstep on September 1, 1964, from North Carolina. He served the Senate in a number of important capacities, including Assistant Executive Clerk, Bill Clerk, Assistant Parliamentarian, Assistant Journal Clerk, and from 1987 to 1999, as Senate Journal Clerk. During the last 12 years, Bill was responsible for the production of the Senate Journal. This role required that he sit at the dias here on the Senate floor to record the minutes of the Senate's legislative proceedings. His became a very familiar face to us all. 
   Bill Lackey has been the source of wise and good counsel to many over the years. We commend him for his outstanding service to the Senate and the Nation, and wish him Godspeed as he returns to the beloved foothills of his native Shelby, NC.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see one of the cosponsors of the legislation here. Since we will have a vote momentarily, I wanted to make a statement and then propound a unanimous consent request that will help facilitate passage of this bill. 
   My colleagues, can't we even do education flexibility--this bipartisan bill that everybody is for? I don't direct this at the Democratic leader; he is working with me and we are trying to find a reasonable solution. But it seems to escape us. I just think it is a legitimate question. Why can't we find a way to agree to education flexibility, to give this opportunity to States other than the 12 that already have it and do what is best for education at the local level? That is why I brought it up, because I thought it was broadly supported and we could do it quickly. 
   If we can't get an agreement, we will keep working on it, debating it. But it is going to affect the rest of our schedule. It is our intent when we complete the education bill to go to missile defense, and then, if there is time, to do the supplemental, keeping in mind that the week after next, the whole week would be spent on the budget resolution. So I am concerned about our ability to come to an agreement. I thought we had a legitimate one worked out, and I want to propound that request, hoping that maybe it can still be agreed to.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled to occur at 2 o'clock today be vitiated and that the cloture vote scheduled for Thursday be vitiated. 
   I further ask that all amendments pending to S. 280 other than the Jeffords substitute be withdrawn and Senator LOTT be recognized to offer an amendment relative to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act/choice and the amendments immediately be laid aside. 
   I further ask that Senator KENNEDY be recognized to offer an amendment relative to class size and that amendment be laid 
   aside. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Senator LOTT, or his designee, have a chance to offer an amendment relative to the special education amendment, and it be immediately laid aside. 
   I ask consent that Senator BINGAMAN be recognized to offer his amendment relative to dropout programs and it be laid aside. 
   I further ask that I or my designee be allowed to offer another amendment relative to special education, IDEA, and that it be laid aside, and that Senator BOXER be recognized to offer an amendment relative to afterschool programs and that it be laid aside. 
   I further ask that I or my designee be allowed to offer another amendment dealing with special education and that it be laid aside for a Feinstein amendment relative to social promotion, and that there be 5 hours equally divided in the usual form for debate on the eight first-degree amendments, and no additional amendments or motions be in order to S. 280, other than the motions to table. 
   I emphasize that we are saying, basically, we have amendments by Senators KENNEDY, BINGAMAN, BOXER, FEINSTEIN, with amendments on this side of the aisle to match each one of those, and that we would have debate only, limited to 5 hours of debate, and so we would have an opportunity to debate and vote on those issues. 
   Then I ask that at the conclusion of yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the eight pending first-degree amendments in the order in which they were offered, with the first vote limited to 15 minutes and all others after that be limited to 10 minutes, and there be 5 minutes between each vote for explanation. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following those votes, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   So, we could have these issues all debated, eight amendments, then go to final passage, and we could complete it at a reasonable time tomorrow and move on to the next issue. 
   I think this is a very fair approach. So I ask unanimous consent it be agreed to. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would object to that modification. 
   I would say that then we would have 14 additional amendments, but crammed into 5 hours on this noncontroversial bill that is broadly supported on both sides. I don't think that is an adequate solution. 
   We can go forward with a cloture vote, and we can continue to have debate, and we can continue to work to come to conclusion on this in a way that everybody is comfortable with. 
   I understand Senators want to offer amendments. There are Senators who want to offer amendments on this side. I understand there are Members who want to offer amendments who want a direct vote. There are other Members who would like to second-degree them. So we have made a very complicated process out of a broadly supported, simple bill that would help education. 
   I would object to that modification at this time. 
   But we will continue to work to see if we can come up with something later.

   Mr. LOTT. In light of the objection, the Senate will conduct two back-to-back votes on cloture motions relative to this bill. 
   I regret that there are objections. The agreement is exactly what the ranking member and the whip had indicated they would support a few days ago. But we can continue to work on this, and hopefully we can get an agreement where we can complete it tomorrow so we can go to the other issue. Until we complete this bill, everybody else will have to wait.

We were trying to craft an agreement, and the attitude he had was that he wanted to get it done; that was more important. I wish we had more Senators who were willing to make such a concession. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for that approach.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator DASCHLE for his cooperation in this effort, too. We found, a few moments ago, that we were very close to an agreement, even though it might not have appeared so. I am sure Members on both sides would have liked to have done it differently, but I believe this will allow us to get to a conclusion on this bill. It has broad support. We  can then move on to other very important national issues. So I thank Senator DASCHLE for his help in working out this modification. 
   One last thing, and I will yield the floor. In light of the agreement, then, there would be no further votes today. The Senate will debate the amendments to S. 280 for the remainder of the session today, and up to 11 back-to-back votes will occur tomorrow morning. I hope maybe it won't be necessary to have all 11, but it could be 11, with the 10 amendments and final passage. All Senators will be notified of the exact time of the votes. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. We did get the unanimous-consent agreement, correct?

   I further ask that immediately following the vote the Senate stand in adjournment until 12 noon on Wednesday, and that the routine requests through the morning hour be agreed to, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, and the Senate proceed for 1 hour of debate to be equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee relative to the cloture votes. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. on Wednesday the Senate proceed to the cloture vote with respect to the Kennedy motion regarding class size, and the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived. I also ask that immediately following that vote, if not invoked, the Senate proceed to a cloture vote relative to the Lott amendment regarding IDEA and choice. 
   Finally, I remind all Senators that under the provisions of rule XXII, all second-degree amendments must be filed by 12 noon on Wednesday, March 10, in order to qualify postcloture.  
   Before the Chair rules, I just want to advise the Members that the purpose here is that staff and others be able to avoid what may be a very difficult afternoon rush hour with the snow coming down. And indications are it is probably going to increase even more. But we do want to have this cloture vote, so we will have 30 minutes equally divided for debate and then the vote, and then we will be back up with this very important bipartisan education flexibility bill on Wednesday.

   Mr. LOTT. Before the Senate conducts the cloture vote and then adjourns for the day, it is my intention to file another cloture motion with respect to amendment No. 37, as modified, the Lott IDEA, special education/choice amendment. 
   I still hold out hope that during the session tomorrow Senators will be able to agree to a small, limited number of amendments remaining to the pending education flexibility bill and that our Democratic colleagues will then allow the Senate to conduct a passage vote on this very important bill, which has broad support, which would give the rest of the country, along with 12 other States, this flexibility to allow the paperwork, bureaucracy, to be waived so we could get the education money to the schools, to the children, where it really belongs. I hate to see this delay taking place on this broad bipartisan bill. In the event that such an agreement cannot be reached, I feel the need to file another cloture motion.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could briefly comment on the process we just went through and where we are with regard to this bill, Ed-Flex, the education flexibility bill, that is the underlying bill. It has broad bipartisan support. The President is for it. He had suggested we should pass it last year. We did not get it done, but he went before the National Governors' Association and called again for this legislation and says that he supports it. The National Governors' Association--all 50 of the Governors--supported a resolution in support of this bill, education flexibility. 
   Twelve States have this flexibility now. My State is not one of those. It has been working quite well, I understand, in Massachusetts and in Maryland and other States where they now have this option in those 12 States. The rest of us want it. 
   I just came from Chester, PA, earlier today, and Pennsylvania does not have this education flexibility. They would like to have it. They desperately would like to have it. The Governor of that State said: Please, give me this option. Let's waive some of this paperwork and the regulatory requirements. Let's have this option so we can give schools the flexibility, at the local level, to make these decisions to where the funds can best be used but results based. We need to see the proof that it actually is working. And all of that is included in this legislation. 
   But in spite of that broad bipartisan support that we wanted to continue to show with this legislation, we now see there is a raft of amendments developing that would undermine or stop or add to, explode this legislation. I have asked the Members on this side of the aisle to try to withhold a whole number of amendments. 
   We started off the first week--last week or the week before last--with a very broad bill in support of our military men and women. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights passed overwhelmingly. I believe that if we can get to a direct vote on Ed-Flex to waive this bureaucratic redtape that the vote would probably be 98-2 or 100-0. But now we see, with all these amendments being offered, and with us having no option but to add amendments of our own, with support for the special education commitment being fulfilled that we have not done, that this legislation now is being bogged down. 
   We see that the first bill of the year that has broad bipartisan support is now approaching gridlock. Let's don't do that. Free the Ed-Flex bill. Let's let this bill go. There will be other opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to offer their ideas on education on other bills this year. We have the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act coming up. There will be plenty of opportunities to offer that. I would like for us to have another day or 2 to discuss the underlying bill and then vote. Let's get it done. I think it is good that we are having an education debate even on those issues that we might not have agreement, but let's find a way to move this legislation through. 
   I have encouraged the Members, the Senators that are involved with this, to come up with some recommendations of how maybe we could have a limited number of amendments and then go on to final passage. But again, I call on Senators to free this important legislation. Let's give these other States this opportunity. Let's see if we can't get more decisions made at the local level and give them the option to decide whether this money should go for teachers or to repair roofs or technology for computers--whatever it may be. But in one school, perhaps, they need a greater emphasis on excellence in reading; in another school maybe they don't have a single computer in the classrooms. 
   Let's give them the option, the flexibility to use these Federal funds without Federal Government mandates that you must use it here, you must use it there. I think the American people would support that. I know the Governors do. We say we do. Let's find a way to get this legislation passed. 
   I urge the leaders and the managers of the legislation to see if they can come up with some ways to get this bill completed in the next 2 days. But for now we will have a cloture vote on Tuesday. We will have at least one cloture vote, I guess maybe two, on Wednesday. And maybe in the interim we can find a way to get an agreement to provide for final passage. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate now is in its third day of debate on the education flexibility bill. I think that is good. This is a subject we should all be more than happy to talk about. There has been a good debate and a number of amendments have been disposed of. But progress has begun to slow down. 
   I feel the need to remind our colleagues on both sides of the aisle that the appropriations season is fast approaching and that we have several important items to consider between now and the Easter recess. For instance, I presume that by the latter part of next week the emergency supplemental appropriations bill will be ready for consideration, since the Appropriations Committee reported it out unanimously yesterday; and, of course, we hope to go to the budget resolution and get it completed before we end the session at the end of March for the Easter recess. I believe there is a genuine interest on both sides of the aisle in completing both the Ed-Flex bill as well as the emergency supplemental, if that can be worked out, and the budget resolution which will be available, hopefully, within the next 10 days or so.

   Mr. LOTT. Again, Mr. President, it is my hope that the cloture vote will not be needed and that the Senate will be able to enter into some reasonable time agreement with respect to the Ed-Flex bill. 
   I know the Senator from Oregon has been working on both sides of the aisle, talking to his cosponsors, Senator FRIST and the chairman and ranking member of the committee, as well as leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle, and to the majority leader. He will continue to do that. I am hoping that he will find some way to get an agreement as to how we can proceed with amendments and get to a conclusion. But we haven't been able to get that worked out yet. 
   If we cannot get something worked out, then the cloture vote would occur on this cloture motion on Tuesday, March 9. 
   I now ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate has conducted its last vote for the week. 
   Several Senators, again, on both sides of the aisle, expressed concern that it was necessary to have votes on Friday. But I discussed this with Senator DASCHLE. We just are going to have to, in order to complete the work we need to do, have votes on Friday mornings and also sometime around 5 o'clock on Mondays. We will try to be as flexible as we can. But, as usual, we have Senators who would like us to be a little later or a little earlier. And it is very hard to find that narrow window. 
   But from now until the Easter recess, and probably in May and June, Senators should plan on having a vote on Mondays at 5 and in the morning on Fridays, but with those votes not occurring later than 12. There will be some Mondays or Fridays where that will not be the case because there is a conference on one side or the other or a conflict. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I will talk about that, and we will try to notify Members far in advance--hopefully a month or more--when a Friday or a Monday might be completely divided. 
   There was a cloture filed last night to the pending Ed-Flex bill. We are reminded that under the provisions of rule XXII all first-degree amendments must be filed by 1 p.m. today; all second-degree amendments by 4 p.m. on Monday in order to qualify under the cloture rule. 
   The Senate will now continue on the Ed-Flex bill for debate only for Members to make statements. 
   It is my hope that an agreement can be worked out on the Ed-Flex bill as we proceed. If we can, then the cloture vote could be vitiated on Monday, and we would have some other vote. 
   But around 5 o'clock on Monday will be the next recorded vote. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate continue with consideration of S. 280, the Ed-Flex bill for debate only until 12 noon. I further ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon the Senate begin a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate has now been debating the pending education flexibility bill for approximately a day and a half. There has been some good debate. A number of Senators have been able to speak on behalf of this very important bipartisan legislation that is supported by the President and supported by the bipartisan National Governors' Association. I am pleased that we have it up early in this session, and I am pleased that we made some progress. 
   But while progress has been made on this vital piece of legislation, I am beginning to sense now that there is a feeling of gridlock on the part of our Democratic colleagues, if they are not successful in offering nongermane amendments or if they are not able to offer them in the way they would like to. I hope this is not true. 
   I know there is a genuine effort on both sides of the aisle to work through a way we can get to completion of this legislation in a reasonable time next week, so that we can move on to the next bill that will be considered, including the emergency appropriations supplemental bill which was, I believe, reported out of the Committee on Appropriations this afternoon.

   I know Members from both sides of the aisle will be working on this. If progress is not made, then we will go forward with cloture. If something can be worked out--and I think it can; I hope it will be--then certainly we can take action to vitiate this cloture vote.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today Miss Ruby McGilvray Bryant of Jackson, Mississippi, was recognized by the Mitsubishi USA Foundation and PBS Television's ``To the Contrary'' as one of America's four Unsung Heroines. 
   ``Miss Ruby,'' as she is lovingly called, has served her Mississippi community for the better part of three decades. She has been instrumental in creating a number of programs to help physically and mentally challenged children and adults. 
   It all started thirty years ago when Miss Ruby looked for a way to give disabled children and adults a camp experience similar to the one other campers were enjoying. Working with the Mississippi State Park system, she created a one-week summer camp program full of activities including a beauty pageant where everyone wins--everyone gets his or her moment in the spotlight. With the help of Dream Catchers, a volunteer organization serving the disabled, campers also get to experience the thrill of horseback riding. Miss Ruby even went the extra mile by helping to raise the money needed to send a number of children and adults to this special camp. However, her efforts did not stop there. She also organized a number of other activities throughout the year such as hayrides and banquets. 
   Miss Ruby also fostered the development of the ``the Mustard Seed,'' a local residential home in Brandon, Mississippi, for disabled persons to live when their parents have passed away. The Mustard Seed teaches ``life skills'' so the disabled can be what they want most, independent and productive individuals. 
   She was also the driving force behind ``Calvary Care,'' a program that provides all-day activities for the physically and mentally challenged in a safe and loving environment. Participants are taken on field trips to such places as the zoo or the museum. They also have an opportunity to share fun and fellowship, to experience the small things in life that many of us take for granted. This program also helps parents and other loved ones gain some much-needed time for themselves. ``Calvary Care'' attracts families from as far as 100 miles away because there is no similar program. 
   ``Lady Talk,'' another of Miss Ruby's successful programs, is aimed at women who have little or no contact with the outside world. Many of its participants are former residents of mental institutions who have been long forgotten or abandoned by family members. Miss Ruby takes these women to a church facility for a day full of activities and social interaction. She makes sure that each woman is well fed and clothed and that each woman has someone to listen to their needs and problems. 
   As the director of the Sunday school special education program at Calvary Baptist Church since 1969, Miss Bryant has ensured that mentally and physically challenged individuals learn the Bible's teachings and play an active role in the ministry. Here, the children refer to her as ``Sweet Momma.'' 
   Miss Ruby is an inspiration to us all. She teaches us that kindness, love, and patience are strong virtues. That self sacrifice is its own reward. That all of us, regardless of our abilities, are God's children and deserve respect and dignity. Most importantly, Miss Ruby is a shining example of how one person truly can make a positive difference in the life of so many others. 
   Miss Ruby is a heroine for Mississippi and heroine for America--for everything she has accomplished on behalf of the disabled and everything she will continue to do. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Miss Ruby McGilvray Bryant for her thirty years of dedicated service to the physically and mentally challenged, and their families, and for being recognized as an Unsung American Heroine.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on March 25, 1999, Barry Wolk, who has faithfully served the United States Senate for nearly 24 years, will retire. Barry began his career in September 1975 as Technical Advisor to the Secretary of the Senate. In January of 1983, he was appointed Director of Printing Services, and in November 1996, Barry assumed the responsibilities of Director of the newly created Office of Printing and Document Services. 
   Since 1996, the Office of Printing and Document Services has served as liaison to the Government Printing Office, managing all of the Senate's official printing. The office assists the Senate by coordinating the preparation, scheduling, and delivery of Senate legislation, hearing transcripts, committee prints and other documents to be printed by GPO. In addition, the office assigns publication numbers to each of these documents; orders all blank paper, envelopes and letterhead for the Senate; and prepares page counts of all Senate hearing transcripts in order to compensate commercial reporting companies for the preparation of hearings. The Office of Printing and Document Services is also responsible for providing copies of legislation and public laws to the Senate and general public. 
   I commend Barry Wolk for his dedicated service to this institution and wish him many years of health and happiness in his retirement.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on February 26, 1999, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) completed its rulemaking to implement the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. The regulatory framework for the liner shipping industry is now in place and ready for the May 1, 1999, start date. 
   The 1998 Act signals a paradigm shift in the conduct of the ocean liner business and its regulation by the FMC. Where ocean carrier pricing and service options were diluted by the conference system and ``me too'' requirements, an unprecedented degree of flexibility and choice will result. Where agency oversight once focused on using rigid systems of tariff and contract filing to scrutinize individual transactions, the ``big picture'' of ensuring the existence of competitive liner service by a healthy ocean carrier industry to facilitate fair and open maritime commerce among our trading partners will become the oversight priority. 
   Mr. President, as FMC Commissioner Ming Hsu recently told a large gathering of shippers and industry representatives, ``This has been not only a long journey, but a long needed journey *.*.* With the passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the FMC's new regulations, I believe the maritime industry will be far less shackled by burdensome and needless regulations *.*.* I believe we can now look forward to an environment which gives you the freedom and flexibility to develop innovative solutions to your ever-changing ocean transportation needs.'' I couldn't agree more. 
   The FMC regulatory process bore some resemblance to the legislative process that preceded it. A few early steps started to head off in the wrong direction, but through honest dialogue among the industry and the government parties, the course was corrected and the intent of the 1998 Act was embodied in the regulations. Now the FMC faces the challenge of implementing the new regulations in a manner consistent with Congressional intent. 
   Mr. President, through the 1998 Act, the Congress directed the FMC to spend less effort attempting to regulate the day-to-day business of ocean carriers and spend more effort on countering truly market distorting activities. This shift is made possible by giving exporters and importers greater opportunity and ability to use the marketplace to satisfy their ocean shipping requirements through less government intervention. 
   Recent efforts by some countries to protect their domestic maritime industries by imposing restrictive trade practices indicates that this shift in emphasis is well-timed. I am particularly concerned about China's efforts to impose greater regulatory control over the ocean shipping industry as the rest of the world is heading in the opposite direction. While the Maritime Administration seem to be nearing an agreement eliminating unfair practices by Brazil, continued vigilance is required. As we are seeing with Japan's port practices, the problem can remain long after such an agreement is reached. 
   Mr. President, I should point out that paradigm shifts are often painful, but enlightening, for involved organizations. To its credit, the FMC met the challenge of promulgating the new regulations by the March 1, 1999 deadline. Now, I recognize that Congress issues many deadlines for the Executive Branch, sometimes with little success. But I want to personally congratulate the FMC for its tremendous effort and responsiveness to complete these regulations on time. Not only did the FMC deliver its rules on time; the FMC's rules are clearly within the intent of Congress. I feel good about that. 
   I want to express my gratitude to the four FMC Commissioners, Chairman Hal Creel, Ming Hsu, John Moran, and Delmond Won, for their leadership and wisdom during this process. This band of four challenged the staff to think ``outside the box'' of the previous regulatory system and develop innovative methods to monitor the industry in a less intrusive manner. Also, I want to recognize the efforts of the FMC staff members who worked long and hard to meet Congress' deadline: George Bowers, Florence Carr, Jennifer Devine, Rachel Dickon-Matney, Bruce Dombrowski, Rebecca Fenneman, Vern Hill, Christopher Hughey, Amy Larson, David Miles, Tom Panebianco, Austin Schmitt, Matthew Thomas, Bryant VanBrakle, Ed Walsh, and Ted Zook. Their hard work and sweat will truly benefit this Nation by enabling industry and its customers to prepare for this new era of ocean shipping. 
   Mr. President, just as it took several years for the legislative process to bear fruit, I urge patience before evaluating the results of this rulemaking. I will continue to monitor the transition process for this fundamental change. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act can't fix international economic imbalances and uncertainties, but it will give the industry and its customers much-needed flexibility to work through many difficult situations. 
   Mr. President, The health of our Nation's economy depends on a healthy system for international trade, and therefore, a dependable ocean shipping industry. The FMC rules will provide the necessary certainty in a manner consistent with Congressional intent. Again, I salute the FMC for being responsive.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to once again express my appreciation to the leaders on the subject matter just passed overwhelmingly. The Senator from Utah, Senator BENNETT, and the Senator from Connecticut, Senator DODD, have done outstanding work.  
   I think they have served not only the Senate but the country well by highlighting the problems in this area with Y2K, but doing it in a way that does not cause undue alarm or panic. But it has been very helpful to Senators to hear what they have had to say, both in the closed session and also here on the floor this afternoon. I believe they have contributed mightily to the prospect of us dealing much more with the problems adherent in this area and getting some results before we face the turn of the century. So I commend them for their fine work.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the last Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act. it was not an easy process, and compromises were reached. In the end, the debate resulted in a bill which made a good law. It calls for a 3-year moratorium on new taxes. This was important, Mr. President. The Internet is not only a new tool of communication and information but is fast becoming the most vibrant new marketplace as America goes into the next millennium. Having said that, I am aware of the concerns expressed by those on main street as well as mayors--from Greenwood to Belzoni to Shuqualak, Mississippi--and in towns all across America.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is correct. Congress did recognize that an examination of e-commerce was needed to fully understand the ripple effects of taxing access to or transactions conducted on the Internet. During Senate deliberations on the bill, my colleagues and I listened intently to varying viewpoints. Consequently, the statute created a national Commission reflecting the stakeholders who would provide recommendations to Congress. Mr. President, the balance required by the statute has yet to be achieved. The Congressional leadership involved in the selection is taking another look at the current makeup of the membership and considering options to resolve the impasse.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have a unanimous consent request to propound, and I know we would, then, be prepared to go to a recorded vote. But before we do that, I want to take a moment to commend the distinguished Senator from Arkansas for the work he has done and the fact that he has been joined by the Senator from Minnesota in addressing this very important issue. I know they have been joined by a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   This is not something new with the Senator from Arkansas. Senator HUTCHINSON has been trying to emphasize his concerns about the terrible human rights policies in the People's Republic of China ever since he has been in the Senate. I know he worked on it last year. He has been trying to make the point this is a serious problem, and I think the justification for this serious expression is the fact that it is still not what it should be. He has been talking about it for quite some time, as have others, and there continue to be terrible human rights violations. 
   So I think it is appropriate that the Senate, in its second legislative action of this year, would express its very strong concern regarding this human rights situation in the People's Republic of China. I have read the resolution. I think it is well stated. And the timeliness is also very important. As we now are about to have the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, for the Senate to go on record taking a stand for this human rights position, I think, is very commendable. I am glad I have been able to work with Senator DASCHLE and both sides of the aisle to make it possible for us to consider this separately, to highlight the fact that we are not just sticking this on as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in a bill, this is a Senate resolution that states clearly our concern and our position. I am very pleased to be supportive of my colleague's efforts. 
   I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we go to the yeas and nays, let me propound my unanimous consent request. We have worked this out on both sides of the aisle with the chairman of our select committee with regard to the Y2K issue and the ranking member, Senator DODD. This will be the schedule, then, for the balance of this week and Monday and Tuesday of next week. 
   I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 a.m. on Monday, March 1, for a pro forma session only. Immediately following the convening on Monday, I ask that the Senate then adjourn over until 9:30 on Tuesday, March 2, and proceed immediately to consideration of S. 314, providing for small business loans regarding the year 2000 computer programs, and that there be 1 hour of debate to be equally divided between Senators BOND and KERRY of Massachusetts, with no amendments or motions in order. 
   I further ask that the vote occur on passage of S. 314 at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, and that paragraph 4 of rule 12 be waived. 
   I also ask that, immediately following the passage of that bill, Senator BENNETT be recognized to make a motion to recess the Senate in order to allow the Senate to hear confidential information regarding the Y2K issue in S-407 of the Capitol, and I further ask the Senate stand in recess for the weekly party caucuses between the hours of 12:30 and 2:15 on Tuesday, March 2. 
   I further ask at 2:15 on Tuesday, the Senate immediately proceed to S. Res. 7, having discharged the resolution from the Rules Committee, and there be 3 hours of debate, being equally divided between Senators BENNETT and DODD, with no amendments or motions being in order, and a vote to occur on adoption of that resolution at the conclusion or yielding back of that time.

The Senate will debate the Y2K loan program bill on Tuesday morning, with a rollcall vote on passage at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Therefore, the next rollcall vote will be at 10:30 on Tuesday. Following that vote, the Senate will proceed to the briefing in S-407. I want to encourage Senators to attend this briefing because it does involve very important, classified information with regard to the Y2K issue. 
   At 2:15, the Senate will proceed to the funding resolution for the special committee on the year 2000 technology and related issues, for up to 3 hours.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have not spoken on the bill pending before us, so if I need to have time yielded, I would like to speak on this issue. 
   Mr. President, S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 is a much needed first step in fixing the problems of a military that I fear has been in a death spiral, quite frankly, after continued years of underfunding by the two previous administrations, both this one and the previous one. It started some 10 years ago, slowly, in the aftermath of the wall coming down and the Soviet Union being broken apart. But it has been a continuing slow process that has really started having a profound impact. 
   Now, I must say we finally got the title correct--Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, because I referred to it early on as the Soldiers' Bill of Rights, and I quickly heard from the marines and the airmen and the others that it is for all of our military personnel. I think this is a very important bill. It addresses key areas that really have negative effects on our military and on retention. 
   And so right up front I congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator WARNER, from the great Commonwealth of Virginia, for his leadership. This is a perfect example of one bill that, while we were involved in the impeachment process, we had committees at work having hearings, developing legislation and, yes, in fact reporting bills. This bill was actually reported, I think, about 3 weeks ago, and a lot of thought has been given to it. I know it has bipartisan support. I know that there are Senators, such as the Senator from Georgia, who have had input in this legislation. Senator ALLARD, the chairman of the subcommittee has been involved; Senator ROBERTS has been very supportive of this concept, so I want to commend them all.

   Mr. LOTT. Senator MCCAIN obviously has been involved, and Senator THURMOND. All of the Armed Services Committee members, and members that are not on the Armed Services Committee, have been following this very closely. 
   I know there are some who say, well, maybe we should have had more hearings or perhaps in some areas it goes too far. I just have to say I don't agree with that. 
   Budget considerations are important, always important. Finally, we have gotten to a balanced budget, perhaps to the point where we will have some surplus, and we want to keep it that way. We want to keep moving in that direction. We want to have enough of a surplus that we can return some of the overtax back to the people who earned that money, but we must keep our military strong. If we do not raise the pay for our military men and women, they will not come to the military. They will not volunteer. If we don't fix their pension problems, they will not stay; they will leave. The pilots will leave, but even more dangerously the chiefs will leave and the sergeant majors and the master sergeants, the people who really make the military do its job, not to diminish the administration and the generals or the newly enlisted. But those people who have been in there 10, 15 years, they are going to look at this pension system as it now stands, and they are going to say, It is not worth it; I can't do it to my family, and they will get on out. 
   This needs to be done. In my opinion, it is overdue. And at a time when we are asking more and more of our military men and women with less and less to do the job, it would be folly--in fact, it would be insanity--for us not to do this bill and do it now. We can work on some of the budget problems as we go along, but there is one thing that takes even a higher priority, in my opinion, than budgets, and that is the defense of our country. If we don't have good military men and women, good equipment, if they can't train properly, they are not going to be able to fulfill these missions that we have sent them off on 
   around the world--the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and then, of course, we may be faced with difficult situations involving Iran and North Korea, Kosovo. Who knows. And so this bill will begin doing some of the things that should be done. 
   It authorizes a 4.8-percent military pay raise. That seems to me to be the minimum we should do for them. It starts closing the 13.5-percent gap between military pay and the private sector wages. It reforms the military pay  tables effective July 1, 2000, by targeting midcareer commissioned and noncommissioned officers, skilled specialists considering a move from the military ranks and civilian life after years of training and investment by this country into the military. 
   Very importantly, I think it revises the military retirement system providing the option upon reaching 15 years of service of reverting to the pre-1986 plan which provided a 50-percent base multiplier and no cost-of-living allowance, COLA caps, or receiving a one-time $30,000 bonus and remaining under the REDUX plan. 
   Perhaps you think a 50-percent base multiplier is too high. I don't. I don't. What is our own retirement percentage here in the Congress? And so I think this is a solution that will be very important and will be welcomed by our military men and women. 
   It authorizes active duty military personnel to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. Once again, we do. Why shouldn't they be able to do that? It encourages savings so that when they do get out, if they don't have enough from their pension, at least they will have this little Thrift Savings that they have benefited from. 
   It has a special subsistence allowance for service members of the grade E-5, the ones I was referring to a while ago, and below who demonstrate the need for food stamps to support their families. People in America don't believe this. When I go around and I talk to constituents in my own State and tell them that once again we have the situation where we have E-5s and below in the military who are now having to go to food stamps, they don't believe it. They don't want to believe it. They want us to do something about that. 
   This allowance would provide $180 a month and remove thousands of enlisted families from the food stamp rolls. It revises benefits under the G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery GI bill, eliminating the $1,200 contribution required of members who participate in this program, and other benefits. And we will have to look carefully at the cost and how that is going to be handled. But I think the GI bill, when we got it back in place, meant an awful lot to our military men and women. And when we look at the past half century in this country, talk to the people who really turned this country into the strength or the power that it is, it was so many of those World War II veterans who came out, such as the distinguished Senator here from the Commonwealth of Virginia----

   Mr. LOTT. The GI bill--went to college, got an education and went out and built America. That is a great investment. Any time you encourage people, young people, or military retirees to go get an education, you get your money back manyfold over. 
   This bill requires an annual report on the impact of these programs on recruitment and retention. We don't want to just do it for the sake of doing it. We have a purpose here. We want to help these military men and women. We want to keep them in the military. 
   I wrote a letter last summer expressing my great concern about the situation and how dangerous I thought the military readiness was becoming. I wrote that letter to the President. And yet we have continued to have increased deployments with undermanned units, spare parts shortages, recruiting shortfalls, rising accident rates, and a mass exodus of pilots in particular. 
   So, I was expressing that concern, and hopefully it looks like it has had some impact. Because, while it really does not amount to very much, the administration has indicated they are willing to go along with some improvements, and I hope and believe the President will sign this bill when it gets to his desk. 
   Also, a hearing that was held last fall, on September 29, before the Armed Services Committee. The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator THURMOND at that time, had those hearings. The Chiefs came in and they acknowledged it. They gave the stories that really exist. They talked about the readiness shortfalls, about us having to beg and borrow for spare parts, and recruitment problems. So they signaled clearly that we had to do something. 
   I am not going to give the statistics about what is happening for the Army. They are not meeting their recruiting goals. In my own State we have one of the proudest National Guard activities anywhere in the country, I am sure, yet now the Mississippi National Guard is having to advertise in order to get the recruits into the Mississippi National Guard. 
   We have pilot shortages. We have ships steaming out--I believe it was the George Washington that steamed out to the Persian Gulf last May almost 1,000 sailors short of the 6,000 crew and air group personnel that are normally on board. We cannot allow these types of situations to continue. 
   In a letter to Senator THURMOND, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I also expressed these concerns. A series of hearings on military readiness were undertaken and quickly uncovered the range of problems that the military struggled to contain in an environment of austere budgets. On September 29, we witnessed an unprecedented baring of the collective defense soul, in which every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff detailed alarming anecdotes about readiness shortfalls, about having to take from readiness and modernization accounts to fund an expanding operational role, the difficulties of recruiting in the present environment, and about the disillusionment and exodus of servicemembers after years of perceived nonsupport. 
   In an all-volunteer force, if people don't want the job, you have a problem. This country cannot attract, and retain, the people we need to man our military today. Specifically: 
   The Army reduced fiscal last year's recruiting goal by 12,000, and was still short of its new goal continuing an under manning condition that has existed since 1993. Not only is quantity suffering, but quality also--the Army is well below its 84 percent High School graduate benchmark. 
   As I said, the Navy was thousands short of its recruiting target, and the aircraft carrier George Washington deployed to the Persian Gulf last May was ``almost 1,000 sailors short of the nearly 6,000 crew and air group personnel that it normally has.'' 
   Retention problems also are occurring in our Officer corps. The Air Force is suffering what some call a ``hemorrhaging'' of its pilot corps. Air Force pilot shortages will grow to 2341 by fiscal year 2002. Army pilot inventory is approximately 15 percent short of total requirements. Navy Surface Warfare Officer Department Head tours have been extended from 36 to 44 months due to retention shortfalls. 
   While many would attribute the current manning problems to the robust economy, I believe the situation is much more complex. We have had 3 different reviews of our national security strategy since the end of the cold war, and the end result of all these reviews has been to reduce the size of the force to where it is now--at its lowest level since before the Korean war. These reductions have not been carried out with a similar reduction in the number of missions and deployments. All of the missions performed during the cold war, be they the stationing of forces in Europe or Asia, or routine deployments at sea, are still being performed while we have had a significant growth in contingency operations. 
   While personnel tempo has increased significantly the pay and benefits to our men and women in uniform have decreased. The pay differential between the private sector and our military has continued to grow--now at 13.5 percent; there are three different retirement systems currently in place with each one providing less than the previous one; and the medical system does not provide medical benefits to all that have earned them. 
   Mr. President, the U.S. military is out of balance. We need to get the missions, manning, equipping, pay and benefits synchronized to enable us to continue with a quality force into the 21st century. 
   Today we have a very bright, talented all-volunteer force, yet we cannot attract the number of individuals required to adequately support our Armed Forces. Why? We are out of balance. Too few people are being asked to do more, and spend longer periods of time away from their families. 
   We also are mortgaging our future modernization efforts to keep readiness up. For example: ten years ago we talked about a 600-ship Navy. Today we are building only 6 to 7 ships per year  or enough to keep 150 ships alive. Flying hours, steaming hours, maintenance, and spare parts are all under continued stress because of continued deployments. 
   It all boils down to the fact that both the personnel and equipment are in a downward spiral. Our quality people are leaving and they are not being replaced. Similarly, the un-replaced worn out equipment is just becoming more worn out. The longer this spiral continues, the worse it becomes. 
   The problem can be fixed, but the solutions will not be easy and without pain. 
   First, it requires more discipline on part of the administration and the Congress--this country cannot continue sending our military men and women around the world on every humanitarian/peacekeeping mission--just because someone in the administration thinks it is a good idea. We have to change our approach to using the military as the world's police force. This is a philosophical problem. 
   Remember, the reason we have a military is to defend our interests around the world--by force of arms, if necessary. Right now, we are sending our military to the four corners of the globe for noble--but wrong--reasons. Passing out food and blankets is fine and good. But what if it costs us the ability to fight and defend our interests in places where it really counts? 
   In addition to being more disciplined, we need to add money to the defense top line for pay, training, operations, and equipment. In other words, we need a better balance between the missions, the manpower, the equipment and the defense budget than what we have today. 
   Congress has done--and continues to do--what we can to help solve the problem. The United States is the leader of the world--freedom-wise, economically, and militarily. Our military underwrites all the rest. My concern is that we are underestimating the need for our Armed Forces in today's world and that we are not preparing to deter in tomorrow's world. The answer: increase defense spending, balance short-term needs with long-term investment, and tune today's spending to the needs of the deploying forces. It is essential that we maintain our preeminent military, however, I see it threatened by the current downward spiral in morale, personnel, and equipment that I have described. 
   When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, their highest priority was the federal government's role in maintaining a strong national defense. They did not put a price tag on America's national security. They knew there was no way to predict future threats and national trends to our country's security. 
   If you look back at the history of our country, we have drastically reduced the size and strength of our military following a conflict. Each time we cut our defense, another trouble spot emerged and we had to build up to meet the challenge. Unfortunately, we are repeating the past, but this time it is happening on our watch. 
   So today, I am asking my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and the administration, to join me in passing S. 4 quickly. Lets joint together and send our men and women in uniform a message that we care about them. Lets joint together and have S. 4 ready for the President's signature on Memorial Day. 
   This bill represents substantive efforts to increase military benefits to help the recruitment, retention, and ultimately readiness problems faced by the military. I commend Senator WARNER, the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for holding his first hearing on this very important subject. The ongoing efforts by Senators ROBERTS and MCCAIN reflect much of the foundation of this bill. And Senator ALLARD, the newly named chairman of the Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, has shown his commitment to our uniformed servicemembers through his strong support. Senator CLELAND of Georgia also has provided substantive changes to this bill to make it better. 
   I've said it earlier and the Joint Chiefs have said it at the Readiness hearings--People form the backbone of the military. We must take care of them first. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 is the first step that the 106th Congress can take to achieving this goal. 
   So, I just wanted to come to the floor and take advantage of this opportunity to express my concern, to express my support for this legislation. I think this is the right way to begin this year as we look to the issues we want to address, to start off by making sure we are going to have adequate pay for our military men and women, and an adequate pension system, and begin to reduce the readiness shortfall. I think this is the proper thing to do. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, currently the House Commerce Committee is examining whether legislation is necessary to minimize the threat that a national, searchable electronic database of thousands of industrial ``worst-case accident scenarios'' will be posted on the Internet, available for searching from anywhere in the world. This information would be, as House Commerce Committee Chairman BLILEY put it, a blueprint for destruction. The FBI and other public safety agencies believe that allowing this information to be posted in a national electronic database would pave the way for terrorists seeking to attack buildings in American cities. 
   EPA has agreed not to post this data on the Internet and that private parties should not post the data, either. The issue is not whether this information is public: it is, and the FBI has suggested way to provide Americans with the information while minimizing the terrorist threat. The issue is selecting an information distribution system that does not create a targeting tool that terrorists can use to disastrous and tragic ends. However, environmental groups have threatened to use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the publicize the national database. Congress may have to act swiftly in order to address this issue before EPA receives the worst-case scenarios by the June 21 filing date. 
   Mr. President, this is not a environmental or right-to-know issue. This is an issue of national safety, and we must treat it as just that. Congress cannot be responsible for facilitating terrorist attacks on American cities. The safety of the American people should always be Congress' top priority.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is rare for both Houses of Congress to reach a unanimous agreement--fully bipartisan legislation. The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) was enacted in this manner in 1996. This new law eliminated the famed Delaney Clause for residues in raw and processed foods--replacing it with a scientific, rational standard of ``reasonable certainty of no harm.'' Food and agricultural interest, as well as the pesticide industry, saw the passage of FQPA as an opportunity to assure that sound science is paramount in EPA's determinations on use of crop protection chemicals. It is worth saying it again--a scientific, rational, sound and reasonable standard. 
   Mr. President, sound science is what the authors intended and expected. This is what Congress wanted--sound science as the rule's foundation. Further, the new law provided an additional safety factor to protect infants and children, and new ways of assessing pesticide benefits and risks. This is something Congress fully supported. Despite a unanimous Congressional vote, implementing the law at the regulatory level has been a very difficult and unnecessarily complex process. 
   In fact, only a few months after the law was passed, the entire FQPA implementation process broke down. Members of Congress voiced their concern. The problems were so great and concerns from America's agriculture industry so substantial that Vice President GORE sent a Memorandum to both the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency on April 8, 1998. This memorandum laid out the White House's plan for getting FQPA's implementation back on track. 
   The White House's plan for FQPA implementation contained four basic principles. It included sound science in protecting public health, regulatory transparency, reasonable transition for agriculture, and consultation with the public and other agencies. The Vice President's approach was supported by America's agriculture community. Everyone's hopes were high. 
   Mr. President, today, almost a year after the White House got directly involved in FQPA's implementation process, it is still off track. It is becoming clear to me that Congress may again have to revisit FQPA. 
   Mr. President, Congress wanted a law to eliminate the scientifically inadequate and outdated Delaney Clause. What Congress and the Nation got was much worse. In fact, the EPA has failed to provide scientifically sound guidance to the regulated community. The EPA approach follows a path toward great economic harm for both agricultural producers and urban users of these products--an EPA approach which is without scientific foundation. 
   Farmers, the food industry, pest control interests, and many others are understandably concerned. Americans want and deserve a fair, workable implementation of this bipartisan law. Americans want and deserve rules that are based on real information and sound science. Americans want and deserve rules that follow the Vice President's memo. Americans want and deserve rules which fit FQPA's requirements. 
   In order for these rules to be achieved EPA must: 
   Allow development of the best scientific methodology and data; 
   Base its decisions on actual pesticide uses rather than model assumptions; and 
   Operate in an open, transparent manner to establish uniform, scientific and practical policies. 
   Mr. President, this is simple and straightforward, and makes scientific common sense. This request is consistent with the intent of the unanimously passed law. This request is also consistent with the Vice President's memo of nearly a year ago. 
   The requirements of the law are achievable. I have confidence that EPA can do this right--EPA just needs to take the time, invest the effort with the proper focus. 
   EPA must recognize the problems that will be created if FQPA is improperly implemented. It is estimated that the economic impact for agricultural producers is tremendous. For just one class of chemicals being analyzed by EPA, estimates have shown a 55% yield loss in my state for corn if these products were eliminated. For cotton in Mississippi, the yield loss has been estimated at 8 percent. Crops across the United States would also be negatively impacted. 
   However, Mr. President, FQPA is not just about farming. Poor implementation of FQPA could also have consequences in the public health area. FQPA's passage was not just about reassessing old products, it was more about getting new, safer crop protection products on the market. FQPA's passage was bipartisan & unanimous because Congress also wanted new products and a rational scientific process. One such new product intended for use on cotton is currently under review by EPA. This new cotton insecticide, PIRATE, is extremely important to Mississippi cotton producers and we need full registration of this product before the growing season this year. 
   Mr. President, EPA must implement FQPA properly. EPA should not make any final decisions on important pesticide products until they have completely developed a clear and transparent process for implementing the law and have evaluated the impacts of product loss. With that done--FQPA will meet the expectations of Congress.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is another year older and another year stronger. As Congress recognizes the third anniversary this month, it now becomes appropriate to reflect on some of the Act's goals and on some of its accomplishments. 
   First, let me remind my colleagues that the Telecommunications Act was 10 years in the making. It took time for Congress to understand exactly what was needed to reach consensus and balance among all sectors of the industry and to update America's telecommunications public policy. Congress took a deliberate path to make sure that, at the end of the day, consumers would have new and real choices. Time is still needed before passing final judgment, but clearly the Act has produced positive, tangible results. 
   I am proud to say that I worked closely with Senator Pressler, then the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator STEVENS, Senator HOLLINGS, and others on the act. It took time, it took patience, it took compromise. But in the end, the act boldly embodied Congress' vision for competition and for choice. More choices and better choices in a new age of communication. 
   When the act was drafted, a number of delicate balances were struck to transform our monopolistic market into many competitive ones. The bottom line for Congress was based on a simple principle: consumers benefit from competition. As simple as this sounds, creating competition in the local telephone market is a fairly complicated process. Competitive carriers require things like collocation, dialing parity and unbundled network elements. Congress knew it would not be easy. That is why the act was structured to provide a centerpiece, a set of instructions on ways for opening the local markets to force competition. 
   Mr. President, the act is working. Americans are beginning to see the fruits of the seeds sown three years ago. 
   Many critics point to the lack of local competition or the absence of incumbent local carriers in long distance as the only way to measure or grade the bill. This is wrong. Consumer choices, new choices, and new technologies are the true tests of success. 
   As far as local competition goes, several state public utility commissions are working closely and collaboratively with incumbents and new entrants. A multitude of competitors have gained authority to provide local telephone service. This choice is a reality for businesses nationwide, and it will be a reality for residents too--not  just for basic dial tone but for advanced services such as broadband access to the Internet. It takes significant capital and commitment to build the necessary infrastructure, but numerous companies and Wall Street are answering the challenge by investing billions of dollars to build this foundation for competition. This level of resource deployment does not happen overnight, but it is happening, and in ways Congress intended--with cable television companies revamping their networks to provide two-way telephone service and with utilities and fixed wireless companies getting into the business. In fact, I would say this shifting of assets in under three years is a fitting testament to the act's ability to move America's telecommunications policy forward--a true commitment and investment by Wall Street. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe the act's goals of local competition and consumer choices will be fulfilled, and America will be better off. The best way to ensure that investment continues is to keep the law in full force. 
   When the act passed in 1996, Congress also knew that it would take a while to sort out the rules to produce local competition. More importantly, Congress knew that whatever rules the FCC adopted would be challenged in court. Congress was correct on both counts. This does not mean the law is flawed. To the contrary, this reflects the complexity of the issues and the intensity of the competition. Remember, it took a decade to write the law, and it will take time to implement it. I believe, though, that the majority of Members who worked on the act understand its success cannot be measured over a one or two year period. Courtroom battles did cloud the course toward local competition. This litigation did slow the pace for customer choice, but I am pleased to report that just 2 weeks ago the Supreme Court upheld most of the FCC's local telephone interconnection rules and affirmed that the local phone companies must open their markets in a meaningful way. It is my hope that opportunities for competition will now move forward swiftly and be afforded a proper chance to flourish in the marketplace. 
   Mr. President, Americans today are witnessing a convergence of technologies that was but a dream in 1996. Cable lines will provide American households with local telephone service and high speed Internet access. This is good. Traditional telephone companies will offer cable video service. This is good. More Americans are using wireless phones for personal and professional convenience. This is good. More Americans have personal computers with an ever-growing range of capabilities. This is good. The Internet is exploding as a means of commerce, research, or for just saying hello to a far-away friend. This is good. Television viewing will become an interactive experience with digital transmission, enabling consumers to personalize their own video programming or to go directly to a web site. This is good. 
   Mr. President, all of these significant and solid activities tells me something--Congress got it right 3 years ago. Patience will lead to other applications in the future that I, and some of my other colleagues, cannot even imagine right now. Mr. President, this is the kind of communications marketplace Americans deserve. 
   During this continued period of transition, it will be important for Congress to make sure that the Federal Communications Commission is properly structured. That it has the right tools to foster and further the ongoing evolution. Chairman Kennard's analogy--old regulatory models are a thing of the past, much like the old, black rotary phones--rings true. The FCC indeed must change, and Congress should start empowering the FCC rather than criticizing its individual decisions. 
   Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act is beginning to deliver the benefits of competition to the American consumer. The process of achieving the act's central goals is well on its way. I do not believe any of us want to turn back the clock to 1996 and take away all the new technologies, new companies, and new choices that have emerged and are now coming our way. Let's not put stumbling blocks on this path to progress. Let's keep America moving forward.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the outstanding work of the Honorable Sandra K. Stuart as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. After nearly five years in this position, Ms. Stuart is leaving government service to pursue other opportunities in the private sector. She definitely will be be missed by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   I have enjoyed working with Ms. Stuart on a wide range of matters affecting the Department of Defense. I always found her to be extremely knowledgeable and very effective in representing the Department's views. Despite the sometimes contentious nature of national security matters, Ms. Stuart always maintained a friendly and constructive approach to her work which served our Nation very well. 
   Ms. Stuart had the difficult tasks of coordinating the Department of Defense's legislative agenda. She has deftly balanced a wide range of Defense-related issues, including Bosnia, missile defense, health care, readiness, acquisition reform, and modernization. Because Ms. Stuart earned the trust and confidence of those with whom she worked, she was able to promote the Department's views very effectively in Congress. 
   Ms. Stuart's experience with the Congress predated her current position as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. Before joining the Department of Defense in 1993, Ms. Stuart served as Chief of Staff to Representative Vic Fazio of California who recently retired from Congress. In addition to managing his Congressional staff, Ms. Stuart handled appropriations matters before the House Committee on Appropriations. 
   Ms. Stuart's legislative experience also includes work as an Associate Staff Member of the House Budget Committee and as the Chief Legislative Assistant to Representative BOB MATSUI of California. 
   Ms. Stuart is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and attended the Monterey College of Law. She is the mother of two sons, Jay Stuart, Jr. and Timothy Scott Stuart. She is married to D. Michael Murray. 
   Ms. Stuart earned the respect of every Member of Congress and their staffs through hard work and her straightforward nature. As she now departs to share her experience and expertise in the civilian sector, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize her outstanding and dedicated public service and wish her all the very best in her new challenges.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Marine Corps officer, Lieutenant Colonel Chase Moseley, upon his retirement from the Marine Corps after more than twenty-one years of commissioned service. Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the Marine Corps and the Nation. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Moseley, a native of the State of Mississippi, graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant through the Platoon Leaders Class Program in 1978. Since then, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has spent his career patrolling the world's skies as a Naval Aviator. Following flight training, he began his service flying the F-4 Phantom in Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 531 in El Toro, California. After his tour in California, he reported to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 in Kaneohe, Hawaii, making two deployments to the Western Pacific and Far East. In 1985, he reported to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 101 in Yuma, Arizona for instructor duty. Completing F/A-18 training in 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley was again assigned instructor duty, now flying the F/A-18 Hornet. During this tour, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley was selected to attend the Naval Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) and in July 1989 was selected to join the Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron ``Blue Angels'' in Pensacola, Florida. In 1991, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley reported to Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242 in El Toro, California to assist in the squadron's transition to the new F/A-18 ``Delta'' (All Weather Night Attack) aircraft. During this tour, he completed two Western Pacific deployments serving as the Squadron Operations Officer and Executive Officer. 
   When not in the air, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has like-wise served with distinction. In 1994, he served on the staff of the 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendelton,  California as the Regimental Air Officer. In 1995, he was assigned to the Marine Aviation Department at Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. to serve as the Congressional Liaison Officer for the Marine Aviation Plans, Programs & Budget Branch. During this tour, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley was selected for a Federal Executive Fellowship in a national competition sponsored by the American Political Science Association and Johns Hopkins University for its 1997-1998 Congressional Fellowship program. Upon completion of the Congressional Foreign Affairs program at Johns Hopkins University, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley was selected to serve as the Military Legislative Assistant to Senator TRENT LOTT, U.S. Senate Majority Leader. Among Lieutenant Colonel Moseley's many awards and decorations are the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation with one star, the National Defense Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with 4 stars. 
   During his more than twenty one-year career, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has served the United States Marine Corps and our nation with excellence and distinction. He has been an integral member of, and contributed greatly to, the best-trained, best-equipped and best-prepared expeditionary combat force in the history of the world. Lieutenant Colonel Moseley's strong leadership, integrity, and energy have had a profound and positive impact on the United States Marine Corps and the Nation. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Moseley will retire from the United States Marine Corps on April 1, 1999, after twenty-one years and three months of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Lieutenant Colonel Chase Moseley ``fair winds and following seas.'' Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to see the Senate today approve the nomination of a fellow Mississippian, Wayne O. Burkes, to serve as a member of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Wayne is qualified to serve because he brings a wealth of experience and a depth of character to the STB. 
   Wayne Burkes comes to this position after serving as the Transportation Commissioner for the Central District of Mississippi for the past ten years. In this capacity, he supervised all modes of transportation in the state involving aviation, highways, public transit, and rail safety. Prior to that, he served for 14 years in the Mississippi Legislature as both a Senator and a Representative on the Highways and Transportation Committees. 
   Mr. President, Wayne Burkes brings a real multimodal background to the STB. He is a thoughtful, introspective, humble, and mature public servant. Wayne knows who he is and this will help him be an effective STB Member. Significantly, his experience, education, and training extend beyond the world of transportation. He understands the economics of business from his experience as an insurance underwriter and serving on the Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Baptist Medical Center. 
   Wayne Burkes answered our Nation's call to duty by serving in the Air Force and Mississippi's Air National Guard, including service in Vietnam. He rose to the rank of major general before retiring from the Air National Guard. His background includes over two decades as a pastor at his church, where he now serves as a deacon. He also volunteers his time and talents to assist the Boy Scouts of America. 
   Mr. President, our Nation can count on Wayne Burkes to diligently and faithfully execute his duties as a member of the STB. He is the one of the most decent and honest men you could hope to find. We wish him well as he embarks on another public service mission.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, later on today, the Secretary of the Senate will be putting at each Senator's desk something I think you will enjoy reading later. It is the prayers of the Chaplain during the impeachment trial. Subsequently, we plan to put it in a small pamphlet, because they truly have been magnificent. We thought you each would like to have copies. 
   The Senate will resume final deliberations now in the closed session. Thank goodness. At this point in the proceedings, there are approximately eight Members who still wish to speak or submit part of their speech into the RECORD. 
   Following those final speeches, the Senate will resume open session and proceed to the votes on the two articles of impeachment. I estimate that those votes will begin at approximately 11, 11:30. However, the exact time will depend on the length of the remaining speeches, and also we will have to have a few minutes to open the Chamber and the galleries so that our constituents and our families can enter the galleries if they would like to. 
   Following those votes, all Senators should remain at their desks as the Senate proceeds to several housekeeping items relating to the adjournment of the Court of Impeachment. So again, I emphasize, please, after the votes, don't rush out of the Chamber because we have some very important proceedings to attend to, and I think you will enjoy them if you will stay and participate. 
   Under the consent agreement reached last night, following those votes, a motion relating to censure may be offered by the Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN. If offered, Senator GRAMM will be recognized to offer a motion relative to the Feinstein motion, with a vote to occur on the Gramm motion. Therefore, Senators may anticipate an additional vote or votes following the votes on the articles. 
   I thank the Senators. And I believe we are ready to proceed to the closed session.

   Mr. LOTT. I would like to clarify one other matter. Senators will recall the motion approved February 9, 1999, which permitted each Senator to place in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD his or her own statements made during final deliberations in closed session. 
   I ask unanimous consent that public statements made by Senators subsequent to the approval of that motion, with respect to his or her own statements made during the closed session, be deemed to be in compliance with the Senate rules. This would permit a Senator to release to the public his or her  statement made during final deliberations in closed session, except that, in doing so, a Senator may not disclose any remarks of the other Senators made during deliberations, without the prior consent, of course, of that Senator. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that Senators have until Tuesday, February 23, 1999--that would be the Tuesday after we come back--to have printed statements and opinions in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, if they choose, explaining their votes. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Secretary be authorized to include these statements, along with the full record of the Senate's proceedings, the filings by the parties, and the supplemental materials admitted into evidence by the Senate, in a Senate document printed under the supervision of the Secretary of the Senate, that will complete the documentation of the Senate's handling of these impeachment proceedings.

   As our Presiding Officer during most of the last 5 weeks, you have brought to our proceedings a gentle dignity and an unfailing sense of purpose, and sometimes sense of humor. 
   The majority leader realized when it was time to take a break and not to take a break when the Chief Justice said let's go forward. 
   By placing duty above personal convenience and many other considerations, you have taught a lesson in leadership. Your presence in the chair of the President of the Senate, following the directives of our Constitution, gave comity to this Chamber and assurance to the Nation. I would like to close with our traditional Mississippi parting: Y'all come back soon. But I hope that is not taken the wrong way, and not for an occasion like this one. 
   So instead, as you return to your work on the Court in the great marble temple of the law right across the lawn from this Capitol, we salute you, sir, with renewed appreciation and esteem for a good friend and good neighbor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call my colleagues' attention to a recent Associated Press article on the Gulf of Mexico ``Dead Zone'', a large area that suffers from hypoxia, a lack of oxygen in the water. The article states that researchers attending the national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science say that fertilizer runoff, which is rich in nitrogen, into the Mississippi River may contribute to this oxygen deprivation. 
   Now, I do not know the extent to which this may be true. However, I am proud to say that the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi is working on a high technology system that may hold the key to reducing farm nitrogen runoff while improving crop yield. The NASA Commercial Remote Sensing Program Office at Stennis, in concert with the local farming industry, are developing a new technique known as precision farming. It is, in real-time, bringing space age technology down to earth. Precision farming uses emerging space-based instruments to monitor farmers' soil content and computer technology to target fertilizer level to maximize crop yield. It will replace the widely used practice of fertilizing the entire crop to the same degree. Precision farming allows the farmer to give the land only what it needs. 
   Mr. Kenneth Hood of Perthshire Farms, in the Mississippi Delta town of Gunnison in Bolivar County, which is about 25 miles north of Greenville, monitors the health and soil consistency of his farm through NASA hyperspectral imaging techniques. This technique allows Mr. Hood to add fertilizer as needed in specific portions of his acreage. It also helps him detect crop stress, before it can be seen through the human eye. Stennis Space Center's goal is to help Mr. Hood use less fertilizer, lower his costs, and improve his crop yield. 
   This is a win for the farmer and a win for the environment. Most importantly, this technology may yield a private sector incentive to voluntarily reduce farm fertilizer runoff, a far better solution than imposing regulatory burdens or subsidizing inefficient and less productive fertilizer limits. 
   NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing Program Office at Stennis Space Center should be congratulated for developing practical and productive commercial uses of this technology. This imaging technique, I believe, has application in other areas as well, such as in highway planning, environmental monitoring, resource exploration, coastal zone management and timber management. 
   Mr. President, I encourage all of my colleagues with an interest to contact Mr. David Brannon of the Stennis Space Center's Commercial Remote Sensing Program. I am sure many of my colleagues have farmers such as Mr. Hood who want to improve crop yield, decrease costs, and be good stewards of the environment. All they need to do is call Stennis and learn about what Mississippi has to offer.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as many of our colleges may be aware, Mr. David G. Marcos, who has served as the Senate's Executive Clerk for the last four years, has recently retired. Under David's supervision, the Office of Executive Clerk processed all of the executive business of the Senate. This includes the preparation of the Executive Calendar and processing hundreds of nominations and treaties to which the Senate gives its advice and consent each year. This effort requires a great deal of attention to detail. The Senate requires the staff of this office to work long and hard into the night after the Senate closes its floor proceedings. Dave Marcos was one of the uncomplaining individuals who put this Senate first and worked hard to make sure the Senate's ``advice and consent'' responsibility was accurately documented and recorded. 
   Before becoming the Executive Clerk of the United States Senate, Dave worked as the Assistant Executive Clerk, the Keeper of Stationery and in other responsible posts. His career in the Senate spanned 39 years. 
   Mr. President, I extend my best wishes to Mr. David G. Marcos in his well deserved retirement and wish him many years of health and happiness.

   Mr. LOTT. This morning the Senate will resume final deliberations in closed session. Our best guess, at this time, leaves approximately 37 Senators still intending to speak. It is possible that we could conclude and have the final votes this afternoon or late this evening, but I don't think that is going to be possible at this time. When we do approach that point, I would like to do it in an orderly fashion, that Members and those who are interested will be given notice. We have some business we would have to conclude, also, after all the deliberations have been complete. I will confer throughout the day with Senator DASCHLE to see how it is going, and as soon as we can see clearly when we would want to actually move to the final vote, we will notify all the Senators. 
   We will also take a lunch break sometime today between 12 and 12:30, and we will have, of course, some breaks throughout the day to take some refreshments. 
   I yield the floor to allow the Chief Justice to close the session.

   Mr. LOTT. I agree with my colleague from Montana. As our nation continues to seek ways to improve environmental quality and to reduce the need for imported energy, several new technologies run the risk of not being developed if Congress does not act to provide incentives to develop clean alternative fuels. 
   These technologies provide two significant benefits to our nation. First, the use of alternative fuels reduces our reliance on foreign energy sources. Second, the technologies provide cleaner results for our environment. 
   For these reasons, I want to assure my colleague from Montana that I will make a priority of addressing the need for tax incentives to produce clean alternative fuels.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this month is the centennial anniversary of the First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport, Mississippi. 
   The First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport has a rich history serving the Lord and the Gulfport community. It was organized on February 17, 1899 by the New Orleans Presbytery. On January 30, 1904, the original frame church building was dedicated and a year later, Reverend F.L. McFadden was installed as the church's first Pastor. Reverend H.A. Jones was installed in December 1909 and served until his death in January 1915. Reverend A.C. Armond ministered to the church until World War I. Dr. Charles Newman followed, faithfully conducting worship for fourteen years. Reverend J.N. Brown served the Presbyterian Church during the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict. 
   Installed in 1954, Dr. Richard L. Summers led the ministry until September 1986. It was during Dr. Summer's thirty-two year tenure that the present church at 1214 24th Avenue was dedicated and a number of important programs were instituted such as a week-day kindergarten. 
   The congregation joined the Presbyterian Church of America in 1982 and was received in May 1983 by Grace Presbytery, P.C.A, at the First Presbyterian Church of Hattiesburg. 
   In July 1987, Reverend Danny Levi was installed, serving through December 1991. Reverend William R. Lyle was ordained in January 1991 and served as an Assistant Pastor until December 1992. 
   The First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport is now blessed to have Reverend Marshall D. Connor, a graduate of the University of South Carolina and the Reformed Theological Seminary, as its current Pastor. The father of seven children and the grandfather of two, Reverend Conner and his wife Linda have served the church since March 1993. 
   As the First Presbyterian Church reaches this significant milestone, it is appropriate to look back and reflect on the many lives touched by this institution. The thousands of worshipers who have achieved spiritual fulfilment. The children who received a strong religious education based on devotion to faith, family, and freedom and the biblical principles of integrity, conviction, and moral fiber. The sons and daughters who entered into the sacred bond of matrimony. The many devoted followers who regularly attended Sunday service, and who, in the Christian tradition, sought and received redemption. And the friends and family members who prayed for their loved ones and those in need. 
   The First Presbyterian Church has remained a center for community life and spiritual well-being for a century. This history will serve as a beacon for Gulfport as our nation moves forward into the next millennium. 
   For one hundred years, and with nine ministers, this congregation has stood as a strong testament to its glorious teachings. I am proud and honored to commemorate this historic achievement. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport, Mississippi, and to wish the church and its many followers a joyous centennial anniversary.

   I further ask that immediately following the reporting of the Gramm motion by the clerk, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Gramm motion, immediately, all without any intervening debate or action. 
   I further ask that following the vote, if two-thirds of the Senate fail to defeat the motion to postpone, then the motion to suspend is withdrawn and that no further motions relative to censure be in order prior to this week's adjournment of the Senate. 
   I finally ask that following that vote there be up to 2 hours of morning business to be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. 
   And before the Chair puts the question on the unanimous consent request, I just want to advise my colleagues on both sides, this has been cleared on both sides of the aisle, by the sponsor, Senator FEINSTEIN, and by Senator GRAMM on the other side. I believe this is a fair way, all things considered, to deal with this matter.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, in a few moments, the Senate will resume the closed session in order to allow Members to continue to deliberate the two articles of impeachment. Members are reminded that the motion adopted yesterday allows for a RECORD to be printed on the day of the vote on the articles which could contain Senators' final statements if they choose to have them printed. 
   Also, Senator DASCHLE was just noting that while Senators have been careful not to comment on the discussion in closed session, we still should use a lot of discretion in going out and talking to the media about the details of what is happening here. I don't think there have been any violations, but use a lot of discretion. I would prefer we not even talk about which Senator spoke or how many spoke. I think we need to be careful in doing that. 
   I expect the Senate will be in session until approximately 6. We will confer with the Senators, the leadership, and the Chief Justice, and see how the discussions are going, and the speeches, how many are being made. Perhaps we would wrap it up before that. It would just depend on how much endurance we have today. 
   We will have a break from 12 until about 1:15, one hour and 15 minutes for lunch to allow the Chief Justice some time to return to the Supreme Court and then come back. 
   I expect the Senate to convene again tomorrow at 10 a.m. in order to try to conclude the debate and vote on the articles if at all possible by 5 o'clock on Thursday. If we are still having speeches, if we can't do it, we would certainly just go over until Friday, but I think we need to talk about that goal of 5 o'clock on Thursday.

   Mr. LOTT. This afternoon, the Senate will begin final deliberations on the articles of impeachment. However, pursuant to S. Res. 30, a Senator may at this time offer a motion to suspend the rules to allow the final deliberations to remain open. That motion is not amendable and no motions to that motion may be offered. Therefore, I expect at least one vote to occur shortly. Following that vote, if the motion is defeated, I will move to close deliberations. If that motion should be adopted, the Senate will begin full deliberations, with each Senator allocated 15 minutes to speak. And I note that that will be true whether it is in open or closed session, although Senator DASCHLE and I may have some further comments to make about that later on. 
   I note that if each Senator uses his or her entire debate time, the proceedings will take 25 hours, not including breaks and recesses. Therefore, I remind all Senators that Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address in less than 3 minutes and Kennedy's inaugural address was slightly over 7 minutes. But certainly every Senator will have his or her opportunity to speak for up to 15 minutes, if that is their desire, and, of course, we would also need to communicate with the Chief Justice about the time of the proceedings. 
   I expect that we will try to go until about 6 or 6:30 this afternoon. I want to confer with Senator DASCHLE, but I think maybe we will try to begin earlier tomorrow and go throughout the day into the early evening. Again, we do have to take into consideration the fact that about 7 or 8 hours will be the absolute maximum we will probably be able to do in a single day. We will talk further about that and make an announcement before we conclude today. 
   I now yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, for the purpose of propounding a unanimous consent request.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I have discussed this with the Democratic leader, and there is no ironclad rule. You know, in our other closed session when we sort of got on a roll, we yielded additional time to each other, and then at some point we started to have a round robin. The Chief Justice probably thought it was all completely out of order, but he allowed us to go forward. I think we will have to deal with that when we get there. I think, as has been the case all the way along, we will be understanding of each other and try to make these deliberations genuine deliberations. I think it would benefit us all in the final result.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to talk about America's used car buyers. They are looking to this Congress to take prompt action on legislation that will curtail the fraudulent practice of ``title washing.'' A deceptive scheme that costs consumers and the automobile industry over $4 billion annually and places millions of structurally unsafe vehicles back on America's roads and highways. 
   Last week I brought to your attention a January 8, 1999, Washington Post article entitled ``Wrecked Cars, On the Road Again.'' This is scary--government crash test cars--deliberately destroyed cars--are being rebuilt and sold to unsuspecting consumers as undamaged vehicles. One of these crash cars could have been next to any one of us on the way to work today. 
   I ask my colleagues to think about how they would feel if their son or daughter unknowingly purchased a NHSTA crash test car. Aside from the significant monetary loss, buyers of these previously totaled cars or trucks are also unwittingly risking life and limb. As well as everyone with whom they share the road. 
   As my colleagues are well aware, Senator Ford and I coauthored legislation in the 105th Congress with the intent of putting dishonest rebuilders out of business. Our bill would have provided greater disclosure to potential used car buyers by establishing national uniform definitions for salvage, rebuilt salvage, nonrepairable, and flood vehicles. As everyone knows, especially the crooks and charlatans who prey on unsuspecting victims, that it is the lack of uniformity and the inconsistencies in state automobile titling procedures that allows title laundering to flourish unabated. 
   Mr. President, the provisions of the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act mirrored the recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee. This congressionally mandated committee, overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation, included State motor vehicle officials, motor vehicle manufactures, dealers, recyclers, insurers, salvage yard operators, scrap processors, federal and state law enforcement representatives, and others. While I would like to claim credit for authoring the definitions in the title branding legislation, they were in fact based on the knowledge and experience of the Salvage Committee and the recommendations offered in their final report. So these are not my definitions, they are the expert advisory committee's definitions. 
   Mr. President, too often Congress lets recommendations from commissions we mandate sit on a shelf gathering dust. 
   Mr. President, I do not want this to happen here. Title washing is a pervasive problem. The salvage advisory group provided a wealth of information and recommendations to address this national problem. Congress needs to act. 
   Aside from promoting the use of uniform definitions, the bill requires rebuilt salvage vehicles to undergo a theft inspection in addition to any required state safety inspection. These vehicles would also have a decal permanently affixed to its window and the driver's doorjamb to provide even greater disclosure. Equally important, the vehicle's brand would be carried forward to each state where the vehicle is retitled. And, the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) of irreparably damaged vehicles would be tracked to prevent automobile theft. 
   Contrary to the misrepresentations about this bill, it allowed states to adopt disclosure standards beyond those provided for in the bill. In fact, states would have had broad latitude to provide almost unlimited disclosure to their citizens. This important legislation merely created a basic minimum national standard while allowing states the flexibility to adopt more stringent regulations. It also did not create a federal mandate on the states as some had proposed. As my colleagues will recall, the Supreme Court held in New York v. United States [505 U.S. 144 (1992)] that states cannot be forced by Congress to execute programs that should be administered by the U.S. government. 
   Mr. President, Congress came very close to enacting title branding legislation last year. The original measure received the formal support of 57 of our colleagues in this chamber and a similar bill passed the House of Representatives with a vote of 333 to 72. Throughout the legislative process, a number of significant changes were made to the bill to address the concerns expressed by consumer groups and some state attorneys general. In a good faith effort, the following changes were included in the modified version of the bill. 
   The percentage threshold for defining a ``salvage vehicle'' was lowered from 80 percent to 75 percent. 
   The final bill included a provision allowing states broad latitude in determining which vehicles would be designated as ``salvage.'' The compromise permitted a state to maintain or establish a lower percentage threshold for defining a ``salvage vehicle.'' So if a state set its percentage threshold below the 75 percent level, it would still have been in compliance with the bill. Some consumer groups and state attorneys general advocated that states be able to set their thresholds as low as they desired. This bill would have allowed any state to do just that. 
   A new provision was added that allowed states to cover any vehicle, regardless of age. This is referred to as ``older model salvage vehicle.'' 
   Another new provision in the legislation granted state attorneys general the ability to sue on behalf of consumers who are victimized by rebuilt salvage fraud and to recover monetary judgments for damages that citizens may have suffered. 
   The bill's section on ``prohibited acts,'' replaced the House's ``knowingly and willfully'' standard with a ``knowingly'' standard. 
   Two new prohibited acts were included--one related to failure to make a flood disclosure and the other related to moving a vehicle or title across state lines for the purpose of avoiding the bill's requirements. 
   In the original bill, conforming states were prohibited from using synonyms of terms defined in the legislation (i.e. reconstructed, unrebuildable, junk) in connection with a vehicle. The modified bill deleted this restrictive language, giving states increased flexibility to provide additional disclosures to their citizens regarding the damage history of vehicles. 
   The compromise bill added a provision making it clear that nothing in the legislation would affect any private right of action under existing state laws. Let me say again that a citizen's ability to pursue private rights of action would have continued under the legislation. 
   At the request of Senator SLADE GORTON, the proposed federal criminal penalty provision was removed from the bill. As a former state attorney general, Senator GORTON was concerned that creating new federal penalties would unnecessarily increase the burden on an already stressed federal court system, especially in instances where existing state civil and criminal remedies would adequately address violations of the bill's titling requirements. Senator GORTON's concerns were recently buttressed by Chief Justice Rehnquist who recently complained about Congress' ``trend to federalize crimes that traditionally have been handled in state courts.'' While  the proposed criminal penalty was dropped, a provision authorizing civil penalties was retained. 
   At the request of Sen. ERNEST HOLLINGS, a new provision was added concerning the Secretary of Transportation advising automobile dealers of the prohibition on selling vans as school buses. 
   Again, these were significant changes aimed at achieving consensus and balancing the need for uniformity with the desire to provide states with reasonable and appropriate flexibility. 
   It is also important to point out that the final title branding bill that passed the House with a bipartisan majority last October was strongly supported by state motor vehicle administrators. These are the very people responsible for implementing titling rules and procedures. If there is anyone that Congress should listen to on this topic, it is the state DMV directors. They have the most commitment to and significant knowledge and experience dealing with titling matters. Since they are on the front lines, these administrators know what works and what will not. Their only vested interest is to ensure that the people they serve in their states have an effective titling system. To that end, they have been working with the Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice to develop a National Motor Vehicle Title Information System that would provide titling offices around the country with accurate, reliable, and timely registration information. 
   As I have said repeatedly, title branding legislation would significantly improve disclosure for used car buyers. It would close the many loopholes that exist by establishing uniform definitions. It would create national standards that would protect the safety and well-being of consumers and motorists across America. Enacting this legislation would allow our sons and daughters to buy a used car without fear that they may be purchasing a totaled and subsequently rebuilt vehicle. 
   For these reasons, I intend on introducing the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act as it passed the House last October. I have also solicited technical corrections from a number of interested and affected sources including the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to safeguard our friends and families from title fraud by formally supporting this legislation. 
   With your help, Congress can put thousands of chop-shop owners and con-artists out of business and keep millions of structurally unsafe vehicles off our nation's roads and highways. Let us take quick action to keep our constituents from buying wrecks on wheels.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my commitment to make the Nuclear Waste Storage Bill an early priority during the 106th Congress. More than 15 years ago, Congress directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to take responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste created by commercial nuclear power plants and our nation's defense programs. 
   Today there are more than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel that must be dealt with. One year has now passed since the DOE was absolutely obligated under the NWPA of 1982 to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from utility sites, and DOE is no closer today in coming up with a solution. This is unacceptable. The law is clear, and DOE must meet its obligation. If the Department of Energy does not live up to its responsibility, Congress will act. 
   I am encouraged that the House of Representatives has begun to address this issue. A bill introduced by Representative FRED UPTON and ED TOWNS of the House's Commerce Committee would set up a temporary storage site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for this waste until a permanent repository is approved and built. It is good to see bipartisan cosponsors for a safe, practical and workable solution for America's spent fuel storage needs. This solution is certainly more responsible than leaving waste at 105 separate power plants in 34 states across the nation. There are 29 sites which will reach capacity by the end of 1999. All of America's experience in waste management over the last twenty-five years of improving environmental protection has taught Congress that safe, effective waste handling practices entail centralized, permitted, and controlled facilities to gather and manage accumulated waste. 
   Mr. President, the management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize on this knowledge and experience. Nearly 100 communities have spent fuel sitting in their ``backyard,'' and it needs to be moved. This lack of storage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of several nuclear power plants. These affected plants produce nearly 20% of the United States' electricity. Closing these plants just does not make sense. 
   Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future, and must remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to maintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity at the same time the nation addresses increasingly stringent air quality requirements. Nuclear power is one of the best ways America can address those who say global warming is a problem--a subject I'll leave for another day. 
   Both the House and the Senate passed a bill in the 105th Congress to require the DOE to build this interim storage site in Nevada, but unfortunately this bill never completed the legislative process. I challenge my colleagues in both chambers of the 106th Congress to get this environmental bill done. The citizens, in some 100 communities where fuel is stored today, challenge the Congress to act and get this bill done. This nuclear industry has already committed to the federal government about $15 billion toward building the facility. In fact, the nuclear industry continues to pay about $650 million a year in fees for storage of spent fuel. It is time for the federal government to live up to its commitment. It is time for the federal government to protect those 100 communities. 
   To ensure that the federal government meets its commitment to states and electricity consumers, the 106th Congress must mandate completion of this program--a program that includes temporary storage, a site for permanent disposal, and a transportation infrastructure to safely move used fuel from plants to the storage facility. 
   Mr. President, this federal foot dragging is unfortunate and unacceptable, so clearly the only remedy to stopping these continued delays is timely action in the 106th Congress on this legislation.

   I was deeply saddened by the news of the death of King Hussein--a true patriot and long-time friend of the United States. His bold leadership and personal courage serve as a model to all of us. I know I speak for my colleagues when I say, our thoughts and prayers are with his family and with the people of Jordan during this difficult time. 
   It is worth noting that the long-standing ties between our two governments are built upon a solid bedrock of respect and shared values. Even as we consider the profound contribution King Hussein made to peace and security the Middle East, it is vitally important for both our nations to take concrete steps to strengthen those relations, for the benefit of all our peoples. That is just as King Hussein would have wanted it. 
   In this regard, I am pleased to not that the resolution before us expresses support and best wishes for the new government in Jordan under King Abdullah. The King has signaled his desire to maintain a high degree of continuity for Jordan, for Middle east peace, for the region, and for U.S.-Jordanian relations. This includes a strong commitment to the Jordan-Israel peace treaty. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution, as it represents a modest but important signal of the degree to which we honor the courageous life and lasting legacy of King Hussein. I thank my colleague from South Dakota for joining me in offering this resolution and I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, our Senate family grieves today and our hearts are heavy as a result of the tragic loss of Scott Bates. Senators come and Senators go, but Scott has been a fixture in this great Chamber for 30 years and the last 8 years as our legislative clerk. His familiar voice was a pillar of our continuity and tradition. He was not just a coworker; he was a friend, really a great guy. Even as we conduct our business today, we will be grieving, but those who knew him well know that that is exactly what he would want us to do, to continue with the work of the Senate to which he devoted his life. He was an example of public service at its finest, never claiming the spotlight, never seeking a headline, but always working for the good of this institution and for the country we are here to serve. 
   We pray for the recovery of his wife, Ricki. We ask that the Lord keep her and their three children always in His care. Before I ask for a moment of silence by the Senate, I yield to Senator DASCHLE for his comments.

It would be our intention to have a break around noon so we will have an opportunity for lunch, and also it may be necessary to have one break, a brief break, before that time. 
   Following today's presentation, the Senate will adjourn over until 1 p.m. on Monday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, if I could take just a moment to outline how the proceedings will go this afternoon, I think that would answer any questions that Senators may have. We will, of course, continue with the consideration of articles of impeachment. I am not aware of any objections made during the depositions which require motions to resolve. Therefore, I believe the House managers are prepared to go forward with a motion that would have three parts. The first would allow for the introduction of the depositions into evidence. The second would call Monica Lewinsky as a witness. And the third part would allow for a presentation period by the parties for not to extend beyond 6 hours. This motion would be debated by the House managers and the White House counsel for not to exceed 2 hours. 
   In addition, it is my understanding that Senator DASCHLE intends to offer a motion that would provide for going directly to the articles of impeachment for a vote.

   Mr. LOTT. Consequently, four votes, then, would occur in the 4 p.m. timeframe today with respect to these four motions. 
   We will take at least one break--maybe two--between now and then, and that would determine exactly when that series of votes would occur--once we begin the process of offering and debating the motions. And we will make a determination as to exactly when those provisions would occur. 
   In addition, if the motion for additional presentation time is agreed to by the Senate, it would be my intention to adjourn the trial after today's deliberations over until Saturday for the parties to make their preparations, then to present their presentations of evidence on Saturday, and the trial would then resume on Monday at 12 noon for the closing arguments of the parties. 
   Again, I remind all of my colleagues to please remain standing at their desks when the Chief Justice enters the Chamber and leaves the Chamber. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. I believe we are ready to proceed, Mr. Chief Justice.

We will do that Friday during the day so that an orderly presentation can be made by both sides on Saturday. I believe we are seeing a problem here where there may not be one.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to turn our attention to an exciting and worthwhile project for America's young people: the Children's Scholarship Fund. 
   Last June, two great Americans, concerned about the state of education in America, particularly about the way in which children of low-income families are often without educational options, founded the Children's Scholarship Fund with their own substantial private investments. I speak of Ted Forstmann of Forstmann-Little and Company and Gulfstream Aerospace and of John Walton of Wal-Mart Stores. Based on their firm belief that a child should not be denied educational opportunity because of his or her family's financial situation, these two citizens are improving the education of young Americans, and thereby improving the lives of all Americans. 
   When Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton announced the creation of the Children's Scholarship Fund in June 1998, they began with programs in five cities. The demand and enthusiasm with which they were greeted was so overwhelming that scarcely three months later they joined with donors around the country to make scholarships available in forty three cities and three entire states. Now, only eight months after the launch of the Children's Scholarship Fund, low-income children throughout the entire United States are eligible for scholarships. As of today, the Children's Scholarship Fund is nationwide, and will provide approximately 40,000 scholarships worth nearly $170 million. All low-income families throughout this country with children entering kindergarten through eight grade next fall may now be eligible to receive scholarships. 
   On April 22nd, the names of the Children's Scholarship Fund scholarship recipients will be selected in a random drawing. Families must have submitted their completed applications no later than March 31st to be eligible. I urge my colleagues to make a note of these important dates. 
   In the meantime, I commend Ted Forstmann and John Walton and everyone associated with the Children's Scholarship Fund for the invaluable contributions they are making to improve the lives of so many of our young people. They set an example for all of us. The enormous public response to the Children's Scholarship Fund serves as an important reminder to those of us in Congress of the need to creatively expand educational opportunities for all of our citizens.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all of our colleagues--obviously, they have already received the word by the fact that they are not all present--but we are still attempting to reach an agreement with respect to the remaining procedures for the trial, particularly with regard to how and when the depositions will be taken. 
   We have been making progress, but it is something we need to be careful about. Hopefully, we will be able to reach an agreement yet today. If agreement is reached, I expect it very likely that a rollcall vote would be requested on that agreement and, therefore, all Members should be aware of that. We will notify them via the hotline system as the voting schedule becomes clear. Certainly we will keep the Chief Justice informed of our deliberations and when we anticipate the need to reconvene.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, in an effort to get an agreement on how to proceed, it is very important that all parties are aware of the procedures that we are outlining and that those include Senators on both sides of the aisle, the House managers, the White House, the attorneys for the witnesses. So it does take time. 
   Just as we were prepared to come in at 2 and move to a resolution, questions were raised about a couple specific points. We feel like those questions need to be clarified for certainty. Rather than continue to recess hour to hour, which I know is not fair to the Chief Justice, I think it would be better at this point to make sure Senators are aware that we are working to get an agreement on this procedure, and we need to get that done today so the depositions can get underway with the attorneys consulting with their clients Friday and Saturday, and hopefully, the depositions will begin on Sunday and Monday, and hopefully, completed  by Tuesday. But we are working on the details of that. 
   This still could very well require a vote or two today or even tomorrow. But we will make that announcement once it is clear that it is going to take a recorded vote of one or more and exactly how that would work. 
   So, we will keep the Chief Justice notified of the expected timeframe, and as information becomes available as to exactly when we will come back into session, and whether or not or how many votes will be required. We will get that information to Senators.

   Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
   I thought we were ready to proceed. I see Senator DASCHLE is not on the floor. He should be back momentarily. Maybe I can explain a few details. He is returning now. We may still need a little more time. 
   We thank you for your patience, and our colleagues on both sides for their patience, as we have tried to work through the details of these resolutions and how to proceed with the depositions. There are a lot of details to it and everybody needs to be relatively comfortable they understand how that will work. That is why it has taken this additional time. 
   I think we are to the point where we are ready to proceed. I believe the way it will proceed is that we will have a resolution that I will send to the desk, followed by a substitute from Senator DASCHLE. Then Senator DASCHLE has indicated that they may want to have a motion to go straight to the articles of impeachment. That would require three votes. Then we also, at that point, would make it clear the depositions would begin on Monday, the 1st. It is our intent to then go to those three votes. I also understand that both sides are willing to waive--the parties--willing to waive the debate time on these issues. 
   With that explanation, I begin that process.

   So there could be three votes now, in order, without intervening debate. After that, Senator DASCHLE and I will formally lock in the beginning time for the depositions. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LOTT. Now, I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Democratic leader is prepared to agree that the depositions will begin on Monday, February 1, and with this having been decided, and the vote we just took, we have discussed the schedule for the remainder of the week. In view of the fact that at this point the parties will begin to prepare for depositions and the depositions will begin on Monday, Members will not be expected to be here for any business before Wednesday, but we could be required to have a session Wednesday afternoon. 
   I want to emphasize that as the deposition material becomes available, we will have the Sergeant at Arms have it in a room for Members to begin to review. So beginning Tuesday, Senators who would like to begin reviewing the depositions, the material in the depositions, it will be available in installments as it becomes available on Tuesday. So you would have that opportunity Tuesday and Wednesday. Not  later than Thursday, then, we would go to the next phase of our agreement that we have voted on. 
   At this time, we are notifying the Members that there will be no further recorded votes and no further business while we await returning of the depositions through Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, but Members should expect to be here on Wednesday and they would need to be here on Wednesday, in order to begin to make sure they have had time to review the documents, the deposition material, so that we can proceed, then, on Thursday.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, in a moment we will begin two consecutive votes. The first will be on the motion to dismiss. That will be followed by an immediate vote on the motion to subpoena. Following those votes, there will be an opportunity to describe how we would go forward from there with the depositions. I have discussed this with Senator DASCHLE. 
   It is likely that we would take a break at that point so that we could have further discussions with our conferences to make sure we understand how that subpoena and deposition process would go forward. I have a resolution prepared. We have some simpler ones that we can consider. But we would want to discuss those with each other during the vote, and perhaps even after the two votes occur, depending on what the results are. 
   The idea is that we have now before us Senate Resolution 16, which has brought us to the point to these two votes. We need to give some consideration to making sure we understand how the process will go forward to a conclusion after that. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. I believe we are ready for the votes, Mr. Chief Justice.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, as I indicated earlier, we are attempting now to clarify exactly how this will proceed and to reach agreement with regard to the remaining procedure and the beginning of the deposition process. 
   We are acting in good faith, but we want to make sure we are at least going to try to think about all contingencies, and we are exchanging resolutions and suggestions between Senator DASCHLE and myself at this time. We may be asked to vote later on today on a procedure. We will let you know if that is necessary today. It could happen tomorrow. But we don't want it to go much longer than that because we need to make sure this procedure is going forward. 
   Of course, if we don't have a resolution, I presume we will begin to go forward anyway, but we would like to have some orderly procedure as we have had in the past. My thinking at this time is that we would just stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair while we talk this through. It may not be necessary to do anything further as far as a recorded vote but it may be. So we just wanted Senators to be on notice of that.

   Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
   First, I thank all the Members, all concerned, for their patience throughout this process. We have had a productive day, and I believe this recess that we have been experiencing has been helpful in allowing further discussions to occur and to clarify what the procedures will be from here through the subpoena and deposition process and, hopefully, even to a conclusion. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I have traded proposals which outline those procedures for the remainder of the trial, and although I won't go into detail at this time, I will say that both proposals bring us to a final vote on the pending articles of impeachment in an expeditious manner. We have been narrowing the questions that are involved, and we are now working on what I hope will be the final draft. But it is not going to be possible to complete that this afternoon. We hope to be able to do it when we reconvene at 1 p.m. on Thursday. 
   There will be conferences of the two parties in the morning so that we can go over this with all the Senators. It is not enough just that the leaders understand or agree; we have to make sure every Senator understands it and agrees with the procedure that we would go forward with.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for years the Administration has expressed a need for targeted legislation which will provide necessary, regulatory flexibility for successful clean up goals of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has unsuccessfully tried several times to address those needs through regulatory reform. While those efforts have attempted to speed cleanup and make more rational requirements, these attempts have repeatedly been met with legal challenges. These challenges severely limit the Agency's ability to effectively address this concern. Furthermore, a General Accounting Office (GAO) study concluded that EPA cannot achieve comprehensive reform through the regulatory process. GAO also believes that such reform can best be achieved by revising the underlying law. 
   Indeed, my colleagues and I have been working with the Administration and stakeholders for several years to try to give EPA the flexibility it needs. We recognize that Americans are fed up with ineffective environmental programs that do little for cleanup. Americans want their hard-earned dollars used wisely and effectively. 
   RCRA's goals are very important. RCRA involves cleanup of properties contaminated with hazardous waste, at more than the 5000 sites. Therefore, the barriers to cleanup are a great concern. The GAO report echoes these concerns, noting that EPA believes that current RCRA requirements can lead parties to select cleanup remedies that are either too stringent or not stringent enough--given the risks posed by the wastes. Ultimately these requirements can discourage the cleanup of sites. 
   The current RCRA cleanup program potentially affects all state cleanups, including the cleanup of ``brownfield sites.'' Brownfields are abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination. As Brownfield redevelopment activities have increased, it has come to our attention that the hazardous waste management and permitting requirements under RCRA either preclude the redevelopment of these properties all together or significantly add to the cost and time of their redevelopment. 
   Late last year, EPA attempted once more to address the need for regulatory flexibility to speed effective RCRA cleanups. This new rule, called the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule, addresses several of the disincentives to clean up. We applaud the Agency for its efforts. Nonetheless, EPA notes with certainty that additional reform is needed. 
   The Administration is sending a clear message. RCRA reforms are desired. EPA will do what it can, and should be commended for their most recent effort. However, legislative reforms are needed this year. 
   I commend Senators CHAFEE, SMITH, LAUTENBERG, BAUCUS, and BREAUX for their past efforts to address this problem. I have given them my full support in their plans to definitively fix the problem and given certainty to recent agency actions. Thank you for your leadership in recognizing the need for action. This effort addresses a real need, focusing on expediting clean ups. This need can be readily met if we continue to work in a bipartisan manner.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, we are now prepared to hear arguments regarding the subpoenaing of witnesses and the taking of their depositions. I understand the House managers will submit the list and begin their argument; the White House counsel will then state their arguments, with the House managers making the final closing statement. This period has been limited to 4 hours instead of the 6 hours that had been earlier indicated. 
   I also expect a motion may be offered again to close the session with regard to deliberations by the Senators. I need some further consultation with Senator DASCHLE to confirm that. It could be that we could work it out without having to do the recorded vote. Therefore, votes could occur this evening--probably between 4:30 p.m. and 5 o'clock. 
   As always, we expect to take a break after about an hour and a half in the proceedings, and it may be a little bit longer than usual, so that if Senators were not able to grab a quick bite, they might be able to grab a little something in the cloakroom during that first break. So it might be a little longer than ordinary. And I expect that will occur sometime around 1:30 approximately. 
   Before we begin, since I see that there are still a few Senators who are not in the Chamber, I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. Chief Justice.

   Mr. Chief Justice, again, just for the information of all Senators, what happens next is I believe that a manager will be recognized on behalf of the House to present a motion with regard to subpoenaing witnesses and then the presentations will begin first by the House managers and then by the White House counsel and then closed by the House managers to be spread over 4 hours, but that at approximately 1:30 we will take a break so that we can assess how to proceed the balance of the day, and perhaps even get a bite to eat if Senators hadn't had that opportunity. It won't be an extended break, but it will be longer than normal.

   I ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion of the arguments by the managers and the White House counsel today on the motion to subpoena witnesses, it be in order at that point only for Senator HARKIN or Senator WELLSTONE to make a motion to open that debate pursuant to his motion timely filed, and that the Senate proceed immediately to the vote, pursuant to the impeachment rules. 
   I further ask that following that vote, if defeated, it be in order to move to close the session for deliberations on the motion to subpoena witnesses, as provided under the impeachment rules of the Senate and proceed to immediate vote. 
   If we have any change in either one of these, certainly we would have to ask for consent on that and would notify Members to that effect.  
   I further ask that if the Senate votes to proceed to closed session, those deliberations be limited to 3 hours equally divided between the two leaders, notwithstanding the 5-minute allocation of time under the impeachment rule. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate concludes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, January 27. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that pursuant to S. Res. 16, the votes occur immediately upon convening on Wednesday, first on the motion to dismiss, and if defeated, the motion to subpoena witnesses without intervening action or debate.

   Mr. LOTT. As is obvious by the absence of the managers and counsel, and a number of the Senators, the two parties are still meeting in conference at this time. I believe we are close to reaching an agreement which would outline today's impeachment proceedings. It will probably be an hour or so before we can complete that because we need to explain it in detail to our respective conference, and also make sure that we reduce it to writing so we understand exactly what we are agreeing to. 
   I will in a moment ask that the Senate stand in recess until 2 p.m. I apologize for any inconvenience to Senators and the Chief Justice. But I think that what we are discussing in the long run would save some time and lead us to a fair procedure through the balance of the day and how we begin tomorrow.

   Mr. LOTT. I just want to observe, Mr. Chief Justice, that there are still some discussions underway. You will note that Senator DASCHLE is not here, and unless there is objection to what I just did, I am prepared to note the absence of a quorum so that we can have time for Senators to return to the Chamber.

   Mr. LOTT. I did. If I might respond, Mr. Chief Justice, there had been some discussion about coming in earlier, but because of a number of conflicts, I understand, from the House managers and concerns that we would need that time to continue to have discussions, we thought we would go ahead and come in at 1. But let me add that if during the process of the day there is a decision that we need to change that to either earlier or later, we could revise that request. This is just to move the process forward, as we have announced each day we would come in at 1 except on Saturday. But if there is a need to change the time, we will certainly be prepared to consider that request.

   Now I have a unanimous consent request that will allow us to have a clear understanding and an orderly procedure for the balance of the day. I have discussed this with my counterpart on the other side of the aisle, both conferences have had a chance to talk about it, and I think it is a fair way to proceed, where we would have a chance to discuss the issues that are before us and get us to a conclusion of this part of the impeachment proceedings in a logical way.

   I further ask that following that vote, if defeated, it be in order to move to close the session for deliberations on the motion to dismiss, as provided under the impeachment rules, and the Senate proceed to an immediate vote. 
   I further ask that if the Senate votes to proceed to closed session, that those deliberations must conclude by the close of business today, notwithstanding the 10-minute rule allocated under the impeachment rule.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, now, if I could, I will outline the result of our efforts there. I thank Senator DASCHLE and my colleagues on his side of the aisle and this side of the aisle for trying to come up with a process that is fair and that would give us an opportunity today to debate this important issue. It is never easy to get 100 Senators to agree on a method to proceed, so I think this was a good accomplishment. I thank one and all. 
   I understand that now Senator BYRD will offer the motion to dismiss. For the information of all Members, once that motion is offered, there will then be 2 hours for debate. The House managers will be recognized to open the debate, and following that will be the White House arguments. Then the House managers will be recognized again for closing remarks. At that point, the consent agreement would apply. 
   I anticipate taking our first break at the conclusion of the first 2 hours of arguments by the managers and White House counsel, unless there is an urgent need to do so earlier. Then we will go forward with this agreement, which will require a vote on the Harkin motion to open the debate; the vote on the amendment to close debate on the motion to dismiss; and then the debate which would go on, the 10-minute rule notwithstanding, until the close of business today. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Congressional and Administrative action is needed to strengthen the U.S. maritime industry and level the playing field in the international shipping arena. 
   This vital industry serves our nation's security by providing essential elements of our sealift capability--loyal crews and commercial ships. This sealift capability is required to project and sustain power abroad and preserve U.S. access to world trade. Two hundred years ago, protecting the U.S. merchant marine was one of the Navy's important missions. Today, the threat to the U.S. maritime industry is just as real. It may not come not from Barbary pirates, but the competitive disadvantages imposed by both this country and other countries are just as dangerous. 
   Mr. President, the U.S. maritime industry has been the world leader in innovation over the last 30 years. It had to be, because it competes in the world arena with one hand tied behind its back. International maritime trade has become increasingly dominated by foreign flags-of-convenience. A number of small countries have decided to generate revenue by creating ship registries and tax havens that impose few responsibilities or costs on their users. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in poor compliance with international safety standards and evasion of pollution liability. 
   America's fleet meets the most stringent safety standards and operates in a higher tax environment, and has steadily lost ground to these flag-convenience fleets. This situation is reaching the point where the U.S. commercial fleet's ability to meet our national security requirements may soon be in jeopardy. 
   Mr. President, the solution to this problem has two parts. First, we must hold other countries accountable for providing reciprocity in access to maritime trade and meeting international standards for vessel safety, crew training, and preventing pollution. The  United States places very few restrictions on the use of our ports to facilitate international trade. Some countries, such as China, however, have imposed unfair burdens on United States and other foreign vessels conducting business there in an effort to protect their own businesses. The FMC, under Chairman Hal Creel's leadership, appropriately moved to head off problems in Japan's ports during the 105th Congress and is increasingly concerned about the situations in China and Brazil. 
   While our Nation encourages open competition in the commercial maritime sector, America only demands that it be fair and meet minimum standards for protecting our environment and our citizens. However, as a January 3, 1999, New York Times article reported, flag-of-convenience ship are using their foreign status and the lax oversight of their flag states to escape punishment for their intentional dumping of oil in the ocean not far from our coast. America should not allow the unscrupulous operation of unsafe ships with ill-trained crews to threaten the oceans, our coastlines, or our citizens. 
   I challenge the Administration to aggressively combat these actions to the fullest extent of U.S. law. Under the leadership of Senators KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON and JOHN MCCAIN, the 105th Congress provided the FMC with increased authority to address unfair foreign shipping practices. I invited the Administration to work with the 106th Congress to provide increased legislative authority to counter attempts by foreign-flag ships to escape punishment for such unconscionable behavior. 
   Second, we must level the playing field for U.S. companies competing in the commercial maritime arena. On the financial side, U.S. shipping companies provide equal or higher quality service than their foreign competitors at a similar cost, yet foreign shipping companies are growing and U.S. shipping companies are shrinking. This happens because, unlike U.S. shipping companies, most foreign shipping companies pay little or no income taxes. In this capital intensive business, investments are flowing to those companies which provide a better return on investment, and the tax differential tilts this flow toward foreign shipping companies. This is why foreign shipping companies are buying their U.S. counterparts instead of the other way around. This Nation's tax policies should promote business growth, not stifle it. We need to level the playing field for U.S. shipping companies in the international marketplace. I look forward to working with Senator JOHN BREAUX to develop specific provisions. My colleague and friend shares an interest in maritime policy, and together we serve on both the Commerce Finance Committees. This provides us with an ability to shape maritime policy in the regulatory, tax, and trade environments. 
   Mr. President, U.S. shipping companies can compete and succeed in the world's international trade marketplace when competition is fair.

   Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, we are ready momentarily to begin with the questioning period again. I believe the first question will come through Senator DASCHLE. 
   I do want to say to our colleagues that any Senator is entitled to propound a question on both sides, and so we will give you every opportunity to do that. Again, it is our intent to go today not later than 4 o'clock, and if additional time is needed for questions, it will have to go over until Monday. We have some questions that have already been propounded that we would like to put to one side or the other, but at some point I think we will have a sense that maybe the basic questions have been asked. 
   So if any Senator on either side feels strongly about a particular question, he or she may want to be thinking about how and when they insist that it be offered. But I think a lot of ground has been covered. I hope that within a reasonable period of time the questions that Senators have will be given and we will have a response, and then we will make a decision on how to proceed from there. 
   I yield, Mr. Chief Justice.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I do have another question I will send to the desk momentarily, but I would like for the Senators to know that we have had some 104 or 105 questions now that have been asked. I believe that is correct--104. Senator DASCHLE and I conferred. We want to thank the Senators for their participation and their questions. We do want to make 
   it clear we are not seeking questions. (Laughter.) 
   So don't feel like you need to help us by sending them down. But under your rights as Senators, under the Senate Resolution 16 and the rules we are proceeding under, every and each Senator is entitled to submit a question if he or she feels it is important, but I hope that it will be one that you think really is essential that has not been touched on somewhere already in the answers to the questions and also would hope--and that the RECORD be made clear--that we, in a bipartisan way, have tried very hard to make sure that this proceeding here and the question period, and all we have done, has been fair both to the President's counsel and the House managers. And we will continue to work in that vein. 
   With that observation, and if we do need to continue going forward with questions, we would have to give some consideration of taking a break and going longer, although I had indicated I hoped we could quit at 4. Maybe after this question and, if necessary, one or two more, we could end for the day and then get together and see if we need more time on Monday for additional questions. 
   I send the next question to the desk.

   Mr. LOTT. This afternoon, the Senate will begin the question-and-answer period for not to exceed 16 hours, as provided in Senate Resolution 16. I have consulted several times about this procedure with Senator DASCHLE and others, and we have determined that the majority will begin the questioning process with the first question, and we will then alternate back and forth. 
   As I noted yesterday, this has not been done in quite a while, so we will just have to go forward in a way that we feel is fair and comfortable. We ask that you give the benefit of the doubt to us in how we send the questions up to the Chief Justice. Senator DASCHLE and I will try to make sure that the time stays pretty close to even as we go through the day. Of course, the Chief Justice, I am sure, will make sure the deliberations and the answers are fair. We hope the answers will be succinct and that they will respond to the questions. 
   One question that has arisen from Senators on both sides is, can we direct a question to both sides, the White House counsel and the House managers, simultaneously, and the answer is no. Under our rules, we will direct the question to one side or the other, and our questions for either side may go to either one of the parties, but only one can answer that question. 
   Of course, there is the possibility for a follow-up question that might be directed to one side or the other. We will just deal with that as we go forward. 
   I expect, for the information of all Senators, that we will go approximately 5 hours today. I don't know how many questions we can get done in an hour, but I suspect by 6 o'clock on Friday we will have exhausted a series of questions that will entitle us to a break at that point. But, again, we will just have to see how we feel about it. We would not stop, obviously, in the middle of a question. 
   We will resume again on Saturday at 10 a.m., alternating between both sides. The schedule at this point is undecided. We need to see how many questions are left that Senators really feel need to be asked and, again, we will have to see how the day progresses. 
   I did have Senators come up to me yesterday and talk to me about we need some reasonable limit on that. But I am thinking in general terms of not going beyond 4 o'clock on Saturday. We will converse and make those announcements after consultation as we go forward tomorrow or during the day even tomorrow.  
   I hope we can complete our questioning period by the close of business tomorrow, but if we go with the times I basically mentioned, we are talking about 10 hours, not 16. So we will have to consult and determine if we ask the basic questions or if we want to continue it later or even over on Monday. 
   I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that completed the explanation that I wanted to give at this time. 
   I do have the first question prepared to send to the Chief Justice, but I thought perhaps he had some further business he might want to address before I did that.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we have reached a point where we can take a break. I think we have had responses to approximately 50 questions today. Now we will have a chance to assess, on all sides, what additional questions might be needed to be asked tomorrow. I remind my colleagues that we are scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. on Saturday.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the nominations to the Office of Inspector General, excepting the Office of Inspector of the Central Intelligence Agency, be referred in each case to the committee having substantive jurisdiction over the Department, Agency, or entity, and if and when reported in each case, then to the Committee on Governmental Affairs for not to exceed 20 days. I finally ask unanimous consent that if not reported after that 20-day period, the nomination be automatically discharged and placed on the Executive Calendar.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the last Congress enacted legislation which protects our nation's vital underground infrastructure. Power cables, telephone lines, water mains and pipelines affect our daily lives, and it is essential that they are given the best protection possible. This legislation, based on S.1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act, does just that. It provides incentives for states to improve their notification systems--systems which provide for accurate marking of underground facilities, and systems which prevent damage during excavation. This bill became law as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA 21. 
   I am pleased to report that the response to the one-call legislation has been extremely positive. The truely bipartisan spirit that characterized Congress' approach to the legislation has been carried over into the cooperative spirit of the participants in implementing the bill. 
   The bill's first mandate convened a study on the best practices in one-call notification. This study will be submitted to Congress in June of this year, and is being carried out by the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) of the Department of Transportation. I have received reports that OPS has fully involved those affected by the law in all phases of the design and implementation of the best practices. This has proven to be an excellent model for conducting a cooperative effort between the public and private sectors. Mr. President, I am particularly pleased by the leadership the excavation community has shown in working with one-call center representatives, underground facility operators and others interested in underground infrastructure protection by moving this study process forward. 
   This study is a bottom-up effort with emphasis on letting those with hands-on experience play leading roles. After a public meeting last August to bring together interested parties, the participants formed nine teams covering various aspects of underground infrastructure protection: one-call center practices, excavation, mapping, locating and marketing, compliance, planning and design, reporting and evaluation, public education, and emerging technologies. The teams are currently gathering information, receiving and discussing any and all comments, and will produce the first drafts of the chapters for the final report. Team meetings are completely open to interested members of the public. Infact, schedules and minutes are being published on the OPS web page, http://ops.dot.gov, under ``damage prevention.'' 
   Mr. President, the affected parties have checked their differences at the door, have worked together with openness and goodwill, have solved a very important infrastructure problem, and, because there was real world input, it will improve practices in the real world. 
   Looking ahead, the second phase of the bill calls for the Secretary of Transportation to offer grants to states which encourage improvements in their states' one-call notification systems. I expect the best practices study to significantly help devise criteria for awarding these grants. I hope the President's budget proposal funds these grant activities from general revenues in full recognition of the broad public benefit that accrues from effective underground infrastructure protection. 
   Mr. President, the process moving forward within the Department of Transportation has enlightened federalism through a government-industry partnership. I congratulate the monitoring the additional steps in the inclusive process to implement the protection of our vital underground infrastructure.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to call our colleagues attention to an article that appeared in the January 8, 1999, edition of The Washington Post. It is important because it touched on a serious and growing problem plaguing our nation's consumers and motorists everywhere. Under the title, ``Wrecked Cars, On the Road Again,'' the Post writer detailed how easy it is for a person to unwittingly purchase a rebuilt salvage vehicle completely unaware of the car's previous damage history. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-lott-ms-2-19990122</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LOTT. In this case, the vehicle had been totaled as part of a government crash test. After being demolished by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the vehicle, which the Post called ``cannon fodder,'' was sold at an auto auction. It was then rebuilt and sold to a used car buyer in Wisconsin who had no way of knowing that he purchased a crash test car. Apparently, as the article suggests, he is not alone. There may be thousands of government crashed vehicles that have been returned to the road for normal highway driving. Think about that. Thousands of NHTSA crash-tested cars back on America's roads and highways. 
   This consumer, like millions of other used-car purchasers across the country, fell victim to the fraudulent practice known as ``title washing.'' In the Wisconsin case, a clean title was easily obtained bearing no indication of the vehicle's previous damage history. Since the vehicle's checkered past was concealed, the buyer ended-up paying thousands of dollars for a structurally unsafe car that posed a threat not only to his well-being, but to the safety of everyone with whom he shares the road. 
   Mr. President, during the last Congress, Senator Wendell Ford (D-Ky.), and I co-authored The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Protection Act to begin closing the dangerous loopholes that allow unscrupulous rebuilders to take advantage of used car consumers. The Act would have dramatically improved public disclosure by requiring that totaled vehicles be designated ``salvage vehicles.'' It also required that rebuilt salvage vehicles be inspected to ensure that stolen parts were not used in the repair. Additionally, ``rebuilt salvage vehicles'' would have a decal permanently affixed to the driver's side door jamb. The bill also contained a provision requiring all previous brands on a vehicle to be carried forward to each state retitling the vehicle. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the practice of selling rebuilt salvage vehicles as undamaged used cars costs consumers and the auto industry nearly $4 billion annually. It is estimated that every year, as many as one million vehicles are ``totaled,'' rebuilt, and placed back into used car commerce. In some states, as many as 70 percent of all ``totaled'' vehicles may return to the roads after being purchased by unsuspecting citizens. While most states require some type of disclosure on a vehicle's title to indicate its history, the requirements vary from state to state, and it is the resulting hodgepodge of conflicting state laws that allows dishonest rebuilders to obtain ``clean'' titles.  
   When a title has been laundered, all future purchasers are deprived of important information alerting them to potential problems with the vehicle. These later buyers may include private purchasers or automobile dealers. Dealers typically purchase used vehicles from auctions and from their customers as trade-ins, and then sell them to used car consumers. In such cases, both parties are victims. 
   Congress acted on this problem by adopting legislation in 1992 directing the creation of a task force to examine the problems associated with salvage vehicles. The task force included a diverse group of stakeholders who concluded that the lack of uniformity in state laws allows unscrupulous rebuilders to easily wash titles and to subsequently sell rebuilt vehicles as undamaged. It also noted that rebuilt vehicles could be a risk to the driving public. Among the task force's recommendations was the development of federal legislation to create uniform definitions and procedures for titling salvage vehicles. 
   The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Protection Act was based largely on the task force's recommendations. I do not want the recommendations of a federal task force to collect dust. All too often, Congress does not follow through with the recommendations of commissions it creates. Here is one of those instances where Congress wants to implement them--a majority of both chambers want to enact them. A widely diverse bipartisan group. 
   This much needed legislation received the formal support of 57 Senators, including the distinguished Minority Leader, TOM DASCHLE, Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, HARRY REID, and other colleagues from both sides of the aisle. It also garnered broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives which approved similar title branding legislation by a vote of 333 to 72. Even though this non-partisan consumer-friendly legislation was widely supported by both chambers of Congress, it fell victim to a steady stream of misrepresentation. Throughout the legislative process in both chambers, a number of significant changes were made to address the concerns of state attorneys general and consumer groups. Unfortunately, even after these changes were adopted, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a direct contributor to this national problem, opposed this modest but important bill as a bargaining chip for its own agenda. 
   Mr. President, it is my intention to reintroduce auto salvage legislation during this session. I have given NHTSA the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed bill. I welcome NHTSA's input and I am hopeful that the Administration will join with us, and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the experts on titling matters, to foster national uniform titling requirements. 
   It is time to put politics aside to protect the public from the practice of title washing and the greed of dishonest rebuilders.

   Mr. LOTT. Today, we will conclude the presentation of the White House counsel. I understand that the presentation will last approximately 4 1/2 hours. As we have done previously, we will take periodic breaks throughout the proceedings, with the first one coming in approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. I believe that will be approximately midway in the presentation of Mr. Counsel Kendall. Then we would probably take at least one more break so that the Senators and Chief Justice would have a chance to stretch and so we will have some logical break in the presentations. As a reminder, we will convene tomorrow at 1 p.m. to resume consideration of the articles. 
   At this point, I ask the indulgence of the Chief Justice and all Senators as we take up some routine matters before we resume consideration of articles. These have been precleared.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that that concludes the White House presentation. I remind all Senators that we will reconvene tomorrow beginning at 1 p.m. On Friday, under the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, we will begin the question and answer period for not to exceed 16 hours. The majority will begin the questioning, and as we go forward in that process, we will alternate back and forth across the aisle. I have discussed this proposition, obviously, with Senator DASCHLE, and we have discussed it in our conferences. We looked at a number of other alternatives, but we thought that this would be a fair way to proceed, that we would begin from this side with a Senator who will be named, and go to the other side, back and forth. 
   We think this provides fairness and I hope all Members will entrust the Chief Justice to be fair during this portion of the deliberations, and for the managers and counsel to, of course, be succinct in their answers and respond to the question that is actually asked. 
   At this time I would anticipate approximately 5 hours of questions and answers being used tomorrow, Friday. We would then reconvene on Saturday at 10 a.m., and again resume questioning, alternating back and forth. We have not set any definite time for Saturday. We will need to see how the questions go. We don't really know whether we will need 5 hours or 10 hours or the full 16. But if we reach a point on Saturday where we need to conclude the day's proceedings and we feel there are still more questions that would need to be asked, then after communication on both sides of the aisle we would decide how to go forward. 
   It is my hope that we can complete this questioning period during the day Friday and Saturday and conclude it Saturday. I hope the Senators will be thoughtful in their questions. They must be in writing. Please be brief with your written presentation. Dissertations would not be appreciated in writing at this point. And we will do our best, Mr. Chief Justice, to deal with the question of repetition or redundancy, and try to have some process that Senator DASCHLE and I will use to get the Senators' questions to the Chief Justice. 
   I thank all Senators for their attention during the past 2 weeks, both in the presentation of the case by the House managers and the presentation by the White House counsel. Obviously, the Senators have been here, attentive. We have listened. I think we have learned a great deal, and I appreciate the way the Senate has conducted itself.

   Tom began working in the Senate as the Senate press liaison. In 1977 he began work in the Office of Daily Digest, where he has served as editor since 1989. I would note that there are only four original Senators serving in this body since Tom began working in the U.S. Senate. I know I speak for all Senators in thanking Tom for his loyal service to this institution and we wish him all the best as he tends to his horses at Brookhill Farm.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Gus Owen, the immediate past Vice Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board (STB), for his outstanding service to the nation. Gus Owen completed his term of service on the STB on December 31, 1998, after more than four years of public service. It is most fitting that we recognize Mr. Owen's service because he met the challenge at a critical time in the history of railroad regulation. 
   As the last Commissioner sworn in to serve on the Interstate Commerce Commission, Mr. Owen was instrumental in shaping the direction of the STB, the ICC's successor. Mr. Owen's vision of a more streamlined deregulated transportation industry is reflected in his many accomplishments while serving on the ICC and the STB. As the 104th Congress began consideration of overhauling Government oversight of the surface transportation industry, Mr. Owen prepared a ``Blueprint for Further Deregulation of the Surface Transportation Industry.'' This plan contained a 34-point analysis of the industry that endorsed market-based solutions over government regulation. Much of Mr. Owen's plan served as a basis for the ICC Termination Act of 1995, which authorized the replacement of the ICC with the more streamlined STB.  
   In his capacity as STB Member, Mr. Owen reviewed and voted on cases involving complicated antitrust, service, competition, environment, and labor issues, including the three largest railroad mergers in the history of the United States. These were the 1995 Burlington Northern-Santa Fe merger, the 1996 Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger, and the 1998 CSX-Norfolk Southern-Conrail merger. Mr. Owen's insight, judgment, and expertise were key to the Board's successful adjudication of these incredibly complex cases. 
   Gus Owen has returned to the private sector and his family in California after an extremely successful four years of public service. The Nation has lost a talented, pragmatic, and respected STB Member, whose work with the transportation industry will have a significant and beneficial impact on that industry and our economy. We take pride in his record and wish him well in his return to private life.

    Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress begins its legislative process this week, I want to first take a moment and recognize a very special Mississippian. 
   We have all heard stories about individuals who give generously or leave the bulk of their estates to causes and charities that are dear to them. This story is yet another example that the kindred American spirit is alive and well. 
   Mr. Phillip Cunningham of Tupelo worked hard all his life, doing what he loved to do best--gardening. His profession provided a modest living, but most certainly a rewarding one. Working with his hands in the garden was very important to Mr. Cunningham who, for over 25 years, was a personal gardener for a local Tupelo family, Bill and Doyce Deas. In his ``spare'' time, he was caretaker for the school district. ``I've always been interested in growing things'' was his personal motto. 
   Over the years, Mr. Cunningham accumulated savings. He recognized that a college education is important, and wanted others who shared his calling to have the chance to cultivate their green thumbs. This unselfish commitment led to the ultimate establishment of an endowed scholarship fund bearing his name--the Cunningham Scholarship Fund--to do just that. His gift of $38,000 will support students at Mississippi State University majoring in lawn-care related fields. Here was a modest man who made a significant contribution. 
   Not only was this 85-year-old a skilled gardener with, as some affectionately would say, ``the midas touch'', but also a dear friend. According to Mrs. Deas, he was ``part of the family and a wonderful role model to our children. He enriched our lives in many ways.'' In fact, Mrs. Deas' late father's foundation, the L.D. Hancock Foundation, will match the generous gift. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for letting me share this inspiring story and pay tribute to this fine gentleman. The landscapes he worked on will ``bear fruit'' for years to come, and so will the students who benefit from his scholarship. They, too, will blossom.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in recent weeks, I have made clear that the Senate would proceed, full speed ahead, with the people's business. Today's legislative action is an important part of that business. 
   Today, by mutual agreement of Members on both sides of the aisle, we begin the actual introduction of bills and resolutions. Following tradition, Republicans will introduce the first five bills. Senator DASCHLE will then introduce the following five bills. 
   Of course, this is an occasion, not just to introduce major legislation, but for both parties to explain to the American people the principles behind their bills, and the values that shape them. That is what I would like to do today. 
   Today's Americans want the same things our people have always sought. They want a better life for themselves and for their children--better, not just in personal economic or financial  terms, but also in terms of their community. They want a healthier environment, and decent neighborhoods where children can play without fear or danger. 
   They want to be able to plan for their own future, while ensuring for their elders the security they want for themselves. 
   They want a just social order. That means a society that rewards labor and thrift, punishes those who harm others, and cares for those who cannot care for themselves. 
   Those goals form the great common ground on which the American people stand united. Whatever our many differences and disagreements, we share a commitment to opportunity, to security, and to personal responsibility. 
   Put the three of those together--opportunity, security, and responsibility--and you have the formula for freedom. 
   Freedom, after all, is the one overarching concept for which our country stands. It is what the word ``America'' has meant from the very beginning--and not only to those who were blessed enough to live here, but also to the millions of people around the world who lived, and often died, in the hope that someday they might share in that freedom. 
   But freedom is not a negative commodity. 
   It is not just the absence of oppression that allows every individual to do whatever he or she wants to do. True freedom is a positive force that turns responsibility into a creative energy that can empower individuals, lift their families, and improve their communities. 
   That is why the starting point for the Senate Republican agenda is freedom. Not as a slogan, but as the sum total of everything the American people, day by day, work for and hope for: broader opportunity, enhanced security, and stronger personal responsibility. 
   From that starting point come the first five bills of the 106th Congress. They address both educational opportunity and economic opportunity, because the two are really interdependent. And they deal with issues of security--retirement security, community security, and national security--as fulfillments of our ideal of freedom. 
   Our first bill deals with one of the most pressing concerns of the American people: Social Security. We are strongly committed to preserving and protecting Social Security for future generations. 
   Many in the Senate, like RICK SANTORUM and JUDD GREGG, have shown great leadership on this issue. We want this bill to carry the symbolic title of S. 1, even though its substance will not be introduced today. We will hold the number for a while. That is a highly unusual procedure, and I should explain why we are using it in this case. 
   Over the last several weeks, I have repeatedly urged the President to submit to the Congress and the Nation his own bill to save and strengthen Social Security. 
   I repeated that plea as recently as this weekend, in a joint letter that Speaker HASTERT and I gave the White House. In that letter, the Speaker and I promised to arrange an unprecedented joint meeting of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to receive and hold hearings on the President's bill. 
   I have made clear that, if the President will give us his proposals in legislative form, I will introduce his bill here in the Senate. Today, I pledge to honor the President's bill by introducing it as S. 1. 
   But first, he must send us his bill. That is the way Presidents do business. It is part of presidential leadership. It is part of his job. 
   I continue to hope that the job will get done. And as a token of our good faith in the Senate, and our willingness to work in a bipartisan spirit, to make sure that Social Security is there for both our parents and our children, I will withhold introducing of S. 1 and reserve that title for the President's bill on Social Security. I hope he will send it to us soon. 
   The second item on the Republican Senate agenda is education. 
   Here we have a dilemma: an overabundance of great ideas. Starting today, and in the weeks to follow, Republican Senators will be introducing many bills dealing with education. They will all have one common goal: To make sure this country has the world's best schools. 
   I won't attempt to offer a comprehensive list of those proposals, because there are so many of them. One consistent theme is to shift decision-making out of Washington and back to parents, teachers, and local officials. In short, the folks who know the kids best--and who know what our schools need to succeed. 
   That's the principle behind Senator BOND's ``Direct Check,'' Senator HUTCHISON's ``Options for Excellence,'' Senator HUTCHINSON's ``Dollars to the Classroom,'' and Senator GORTON's stalwart campaign to renew and empower State and local education systems. 
   The same princple--that excellence in education begins at the State and local level--has shaped what will be one of the most important bills of the 106th Congress. It's called Ed-Flex, for Educational Flexibility, and it is not a partisan initiative. It has been jointly advanced by Senators FRIST and WYDEN.  
   It is strongly supported by all the Nation's Governors. It should be something we can consider and pass quickly. 
   If we want the 106th Congress to be known as the Education Congress, Ed-Flex is a great way to start. Right off the bat, with virtual unanimity, we can give the States the leeway they need to use their share of federal dollars to meet the needs of students. Around this flag, we should all rally. 
   A second principle of Republican education reform is consumer choice. 
   We believe that what is right and productive in every other sector of the economy is equally right--and will be equally productive--in schooling. So we renew our commitment to consumer rights and choice in education: whether through Senator COVERDELL's tax-free education savings accounts, or Senator MCCONNELL's expansion of tuition savings plans; or through Senator SESSION's Class Act extending those plans to non-government colleges; or through Senator KYL's plan to provide parents financial breaks to supplement their children's educational needs; or through the Emergency Scholarships and other lifelines we should extend to low-income families. 
   A third principle of Republican education reform is equality teaching. Senator MACK's bill on teacher testing leads the way in that regard, along with our other proposals for teacher training and merit pay. 
   Those three principles, and the issues to which we apply them, come together in the largest education bill that will come before the 106th Congress: the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, universally known as the E.S.E.A. 
   In the cafeteria fare of education bills, this one is pizza with the works, even the anchovies. Over the last 33 years, we have spent more than $120 billion through the ESEA. Its reauthorization during the 106th Congress will be our opportunity to assess what has gone right, or wrong, in that process--and to adjust the ESEA to meet the challenges of a changing society in a new century in an unpredictable world. 
   Senator JEFFORDS, chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, will introduce the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as the second bill of the 106th Congress. 
   Our third bill, S. 3, is a tax cut, introduced by Senator GRAMS, Senator ROTH, and others. To be precise, a 10-percent reduction in personal income tax rates. Hence the bill's title: the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act. 
   Whatever justification this may need in the Congress, it requires no explanation to the American people. They are overworked and overtaxed to meet the demands of government. Senate Republicans want them to keep more of what they earn. 
   We believe it is wrong--morally wrong--to make the American family pay more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing, housing, and transportation combined. So we propose to reduce their tax burden while making government smaller, smarter, and more efficient.  
   Our fourth bill, S. 4, is the Soldiers' Bill of Rights, to be introduced by Senator WARNER and his Republican colleagues on the Armed Services Committee. This bill represents the determination of Senate Republicans to rebuild America's national security by restoring the readiness and morale of our Armed Forces. 
   In other words, it is a small symbol of an enormous commitment. 
   At the end of the last Congress, the administration proposed to deal with military retirement by robbing the military's readiness funds. That was a terrible idea. It made no sense to offer our servicemen and women a little better retirement while depriving them of the wherewithal to defend themselves and their country. So we blocked that dishonest ploy, and we promised to address the problems of inadequate military pay and retirement early in 1999. Enactment of this bill, S. 4, will fulfill that commitment. 
   I caution, however, that this legislation must be only the beginning of a larger effort to reverse the decline our Armed Forces have suffered under the current administration. That's going to be a tough job, and a long one, both in the appropriations process and in authorizing legislation. But we owe it to our country--and we owe it to the men and women in uniform--to start that job now, in the 106th Congress, so that America can enter a new century with renewed strength and security. 
   Crucial to that effort will be the actual deployment of a missile defense system that will protect this country from attack. 
   President Clinton's opposition frustrated our efforts on this in the 105th Congress. This time around, I hope he will work with us to enact Senator COCHRAN's National Missile Defense Act. 
   The fifth bill on our agenda, S. 5, deals with the personal safety of the American people. But in this case, the threat to their security comes from within. 
   The danger is the plague of narcotics. It has become a clear and present danger to our families, our neighborhoods, and even to the security of our Nation. 
   To combat that danger, Senators DEWINE, ABRAHAM, ASHCROFT, GRASSLEY, and HATCH will introduce the Drug Free Century Act. That title says it all. Our goal is nothing less than laying the groundwork for the day when our country will be free of the curse of drugs. Some will think that is too high a goal, and that Senate Republicans are unrealistic in pursuing it. We are not unrealistic; we are undaunted. 
   For more years tan I like to recall, the federal government has tried to reduce the drug plague. And indeed, there was some success, specifically during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. 
   But its one thing to trim the claws of the narcotics monster, and quite another thing to break its loathsome back. 
   That is what we propose to do, step by step, with a bill that deals with virtually every aspect of both the domestic and the international fight against drugs. It will impact the operations of most of the federal government, from the Justice Department to the Pentagon, from the State Department to the Coast Guard. It addresses some of the most pressing questions on national drug policy, including the sentencing differential between powder cocaine and crack. 
   Drug traffickers and their allies in certain foreign countries will not like this bill, nor will the creeps who peddle drugs to school kids. But parents, teachers, and law enforcement officers will cheer it. For its passage will be a clear signal, throughout this country and around the world, that we are serious about winning the war on drugs. 
   Mr. President, these five pieces of legislation--four introduced today, and one awaiting a draft from President Clinton--lead the Republican agenda for the 106th Congress. But they are not the whole story. 
   They set the foundation I mentioned earlier--the foundation of opportunity, security, responsibility, and freedom--and we are going to build on that foundation in many ways. 
   Along with the Drug Free Century Act, we will be moving against juvenile crime, following the lead of Senator HATCH and his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. And in tandem with the House, we should consider legislation that will prevent Federal judges from turning loose hardened criminals in violation of their own sentences. 
   On another front, we will soon--by March 1 at the latest--receive the recommendations of our Bipartisan Medicare Commission, and we hope to act on that report. 
   Even sooner, I will bring to the Senate floor the first major reform of the budget process since it was established in 1974. Our reform package will put an end to the threat of Government shutdowns and stop the abuses of what is dubiously called ``emergency spending.'' 
   We hope to schedule early action on a vital piece of legislation, the Water Resources Development Act, under the leadership of Senator CHAFEE, chairing our Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
   We will move ahead with a Patients' Bill of Rights that will protect individuals without undermining the integrity and efficiency of our health care system. 
   And we will continue to uphold the right to life, by advancing again a ban on partial-birth abortions, as proposed by Senator SANTORUM and the Child Custody Protection Act, proposed by Senator ABRAHAM. 
   To the legislation I have already outlined must be added a score of other matters, from bankruptcy reform and financial services reform to export expansion and trade reform, especially with regard to agricultural products. 
   And we intend to build upon our landmark welfare reforms by strengthening families, communities, and religious institutions. We should undertake nothing less than the renewal of civil society. 
   It will take both compassion and common sense to revitalize those areas of our country where the American dream has been no more than a slogan. One approach is to foster the public-private partnerships that can best address the real needs of our communities and enable them to overcome crime, drug abuse, poverty, and educational decay. 
   That is an agenda of hope and dignity that acknowledges that the solutions to America's problems will ultimately come, not from the Congress or the White House, but from the people. 
   Granted, the renewal of civil society will be a heroic enterprise, but Americans are equal to it. Today, on behalf of the Republican Members of the Senate, I pledge that we will do our part to make the 106th Congress, not so much the finale to the troubles and trials of the 20th century, but the threshold to a new American era.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last year the Senate passed S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998. The Ford Act promised to bring much needed air service to under served communities throughout the Nation through policy changes and market-based incentives. Unfortunately, the Ford Act was not passed into law by the last Congress. I believe that Congress has an obligation to enhance the development of America's smaller air service markets. That is a promise that this Congress can fulfill. It is a promise that this session of Congress will fulfill. 
   The First Session of the 106th Congress will prove to be critical for our Nation's air passengers. The top aviation policy priority remains a full FAA reauthorization--not just a quick extension of this important agency and the Airports Improvements Program (AIP). A full reauthorization--money plus policies. Commerce Committee Chairman MCCAIN's aviation legislation, submitted this morning, reflects the bipartisan, fundamental provisions for rural air service built in the Ford Act. 
   Last year, the FAA bill's informal conference was able to reach a consensus on almost all issues. I encourage my colleagues to continue the good work in addressing aviation policies by resuming where the 105th Congress left off. If the provisions that were agreed upon late last year are adopted, Congress will be able to clear this bill before the March 31 deadline and guarantee a smooth, clean continuation of AIP funds. 
   Mr. President, there is talk of an increase in airline user fees through the passenger facility charges (PFCs). I'm  not a fan of user fees and I hope this mechanism is not used for aviation services. These are taxes, period. The goal of this Congress is to cut taxes, not increase them. 
   Last year, tens of thousands of Mississippians used the skies to travel. Many of these passengers were new customers that chose air travel as a result of greater air service, options and lower fares from a new entrant. These changes allowed the jackson Airport to make several upgrades. I believe that a PFC increase will force passengers to reconsider their travel plans. An increase in the cost of air service, shouldered by the customer, will only serve as a detriment to the commercial airlines, airports and passengers. 
   Mr. President, increasing regional jet competition and flight service to smaller markets is my focus. Most Americans do not live in hub cities and thus do not benefit from the range of choices through the concentration of air service options. I look forward to working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and especially on the Commerce Committee to insure that rural and under served communities receive improved flight service options and more affordable airline tickets. 
   Because Chairman MCCAIN understands the needs of under served markets, and fully appreciates that adequate and affordable air service is a vital economic development issue for smaller cities and rural areas he has been a tremendous help. I am pleased that the chairman has crafted this year's FAA bill according to the principles as set forth in the Ford Act. He too wants to improve the quality and quantity of flights going to and from small airports. He also understands the bipartisan and constructive efforts that went into last year's FAA bill and the need for a full reauthorization. 
   In addition to the leadership of Chairman MCCAIN, two more of my colleagues have played a vital role in the advancement of this policy. Senator SLADE GORTON of Washington, chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, has provided pivotal guidance and has been instrumental in bringing focus to the many aspects of aviation. Senator BILL FRIST proved to be a great asset and a very effective advocate for the rural aviation community during this past session. His hard work and passion brought small and under served communities closer to receiving much needed public policy changes for flight service improvements. I look forward to again working with them this year. 
   Aviation policy changes always affect the management and administration of our local airports, and this makes many of our airport executives nervous. I rely on their wisdom, because these are the managers who deal day-to-day, face-to-face with Mississippians. Mr. Dirk Vanderleest of Jackson's airport has counseled me on the needs of small and under served markets. His conference in 1998 was key to may aviation thinking, and his efforts to push Mississippi's aviation priorities are appreciated. 
   I also rely on Mr. Gene Smith of the Golden Triangle Regional Airport in Columbus. He is a patriot who served our Nation during the Vietnam war and for more than 20 years has worked to ensure the east central pocket of Mississippi is involved in commercial aviation. He served as a member of the National Civil Aviation Review Commission where he again distinguished himself. 
   It is my hope that the recommendations from this commission are not overlooked by this Congress. I implore my colleagues to seek out their Dirk or Gene to find out what their states need. 
   Mr. President, this Congress does not need a year for aviation policy--it needs 3 months and the work left from the last Congress. Quality air service for all Americans must be the focus of any aviation legislation. Never forget that not everyone lives near a hub. Quality air service is essential for economic development. Quality air service will enable rural Americans to be competitive and spur economic development to under served communities in the 21st century.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my colleagues, Senators LANDRIEU, MURKOWSKI and SESSIONS, in introducing the Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act. 
   Mr. President, since the inception of the oil and gas program on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), States and coastal communities have sought a greater share of the benefits from development. And why shouldn't they? These communities provide the infrastructure, public services, manpower and support industries necessary to sustain this development. 
   Currently, the majority of OCS revenues are funneled into the Federal Treasury where they are used to pay for various Federal programs and to reduce the deficit. While funding programs and reducing the deficit is certainly important, I believe that some percentage of the revenues should be reinvested in the affected region. 
   Our bill does just that. The Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act diverts one-half of the OCS revenues from the Federal Treasury to coastal States and communities for a multitude of programs: air and water quality monitoring, wetlands protection, coastal restoration and shoreline protection, land acquisition, infrastructure, public service needs, State park and recreation programs and wildlife conservation. 
   This bill allows States and communities to use these funds. These States will effectively use the funds for local needs. In Pascagoula, for example, authorities might choose to restore and secure the shoreline where years of sea traffic have taken their toll. Further north in Vancleave, they may choose instead to refurbish the roads and bridges that carry the heavy machinery coming and going from the coast. This bill provides a framework within which these localities can make the right decisions for their citizens and their environment. 
   Mr. President, I have been working on this issue for many, many years. As a ``coast dweller myself,'' I know the impact that the oil and gas industry can have on communities and the importance of reinvestment in these areas. This is not to say that the industry mistreats the States; on the contrary, they work very hard to comply with stringent environmental regulations and to take care of the community as best they can. The OCS Policy Committee said in 1993 that, despite the oil industry's best efforts, ``OCS development still can affect community infrastructure, social services and the environment in ways that cause concerns among residents of the coastal States and communities.'' 
   I know that there is no way to totally eliminate this impact on coastal communities. I also know that, while the benefits of a healthy OCS program are felt nationally, the infrastructure, environmental and social costs are felt locally. Our bill would put money back into the communities that need it most. 
   It would also put money back into the environmental resources of the area. Exploration for non-renewable resources and stewardship of coastal resources are not mutually exclusive, but must be carefully balanced for both to be sustained. It is important that wetlands, fisheries and water resources are taken into consideration. Affordable adequate protection is possible. 
   In addition to supporting up the States and coastal communities, our bill also provides funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). More than 30 years ago, Congress set up this fund to address the American public's desire for more parks and recreational facilities. This bill makes the program self-sufficient, providing a secure funding source from the OCS revenues. This is an investment in our future--our land, our natural resources and our recreational enjoyment. 
   Mr. President, our bill makes yet another investment with these OCS revenues--an investment in fish and wildlife programs. With the inclusion of OCS revenues, the amount of money available for State programs would nearly double. This is money that can be used to increase fish and wildlife populations and habitats. It could even be used for wildlife education programs. 
   Mr. President, this bill was carefully crafted to strike a balance between the needs and interests of the oil and gas industry, the States, and the environmental and conservation groups. It's a good package that will benefit all Americans, not just those who live and work in coastal areas. It will benefit hunters and anglers. It will benefit bird watchers and campers. It will benefit all Americans who take solace in the fact that the oil industry is taking care of the communities that support it. 
   I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues and look forward to advancing this important legislation in the 106th Congress.

In addition to these matters, I would like to state for the information of all Senators that, pursuant to S.

As the printing of the rest of the volumes of the record is completed over the next few days, they will also be placed on the Senators desks for their convenience.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as all Members are aware, I have been working for some time on various rules changes that would ensure a more efficient process by which the Senate considers appropriations bills. One of our concerns has been reinstating rule XVI with respect to legislation on appropriations bills. I believe that many of the extraneous items that have been added to appropriations bills over the past few Congress would have been ruled out of order if the Senate still had the ability to raise a point of order against legislation on appropriations bills formerly contained in rule XVI. 
   Other rule abuses occurred during the closing days of the 105th Congress. Consequently, I will shortly introduce five Senate resolutions regarding rules and budget process changes and will ask for their proper referral. Once the resolutions have been referred to the appropriate committee, it is my hope the chairmen of the committees will begin swift committee work on the resolutions so the committees can act on the changes as early as possible in the 106th Congress. I urge Senators to consider these resolutions and hope when the Senate votes on these measures they will receive huge bipartisan votes.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, during the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, the Senate limited access to the Senate wing of the Capitol, the Senate floor, and the Senate galleries to those with official business and those with tickets to the proceedings. 
   Over the Christmas holidays, staff of the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, including the Parliamentarian, legislative clerk and others, and staff of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, and others, have reviewed the historical precedents but also considered what we could do to facilitate the public's access to the proceedings while taking into account contemporary security requirements and the flow of business here in the Chamber. Staff have recommended some restrictions to the access of the Senate wing, floor, and galleries coupled with a ticketing system that will make as many seats in the gallery available to the public and others as is possible for us to do. 
   Accordingly, in a few minutes I will ask unanimous consent be given to a set of policies that reflect the staff recommendations which will confine access to the Senate floor and galleries and to the second and third floors of the Senate wing of the Capitol during the consideration of the articles of impeachment and at all times the Chief Justice is presiding. 
   I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his efforts and his cooperation in this matter. We have been very careful to make sure we reviewed all the precedents, all the rules; that he has had a chance to check off on these rules, as I have. And I wish to thank all staff who researched the precedent and evaluated current conditions to develop these recommendations. Before seeking unanimous consent, however, I will now yield to the assistant Democratic leader.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that access to the Senate wing, the Senate floor, and the Senate Chamber galleries, during all proceedings involving the exhibition or consideration of the articles of impeachment of the President of the United States, and all times that the Senate is sitting for trial with the Chief Justice of the United States presiding, be in accordance with the allocations and provisions on the documents I now send to the desk.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that many Members will want to comment on the impeachment proceedings in the Senate. Others will want to comment on the fact that this is their first day as Senators, and perhaps even discuss what they hope to achieve in the year ahead. Others will want to talk about agenda items. With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the next 2 hours be equally divided between the two leaders, or their designees, for statements only regarding impeachment or other general business of their desire, and following that period, the majority leader, or his designee, be recognized by the Chair.

   Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to welcome all the Senators to the 106th Congress. We have had an all too brief and somewhat overwhelming interlude since the last day of the 105th Congress in October. That interval turned out to be dramatic and eventful in more ways than one, and because of events that occurred therein, the Senate's agenda for this year will be more important than ever. 
   We will soon be considering charges brought by the House of Representatives against the President of the United States. I cannot think of a more serious subject. Yet the Senate has its well-established procedures to deal with this situation. While it is not exactly routine, neither is it totally unique. 
   We have our responsibilities under the Constitution, and we will meet those responsibilities in an orderly fashion. That is why I have met several times and talked by phone other times with Senator DASCHLE, the Democratic leader, and why the two of us have met with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, whose duty it is to preside over a Senate trial involving the President. We have both consulted and are still very actively involved in consulting with fellow Senators, with constitutional scholars, with officers of the Senate, in terms of the law and the rules of the Senate. 
   Our duty is clear: To demonstrate anew our national commitment to justice and fair play. That is what the public expects from us, regardless of their individual opinions concerning the President. That is why I am confident that is what they will receive. No Senator in this Chamber needs to be reminded that we are here first and foremost to serve the American people. Americans today look to the future with the same hopes that have inspired and sustained this country for more than 200 years. They want a better life for themselves and, more importantly, for their children. Not just economically, but also in terms of a decent future and a just and caring society. 
   I want to emphasize now that I have not gone to the media and outlined exactly how this impeachment process will go forward because no final conclusion has been made. This is not something that can be reported in an evolutionary way because there are too many things that have to be considered, too many different parties--Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, House Members, the White House--and we have had to continue to consider the opinions of all to try to develop a fair way to have an expeditious trial that gets justice based on the rule of law. I think that it is more important that we hear from all parties and come to, hopefully, a conclusion that sets an outline of how we will proceed from beginning to end than it is to always be reporting on the current developments. 
   Never before have I had so much reported about what I was thinking, doing, or saying when I have said so little. I have been accused of being ``holed up'' in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS. Where would you expect me to be during the holidays? How about at home with my family and with my constituents, enjoying that precious season of the year. 
   However, I had no moss growing under my feet. I was talking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, listening and thinking and developing and evolving a process that I think will get the job done. I believe we can very well achieve that goal within the next 24 hours--one that neither the House nor the White House will necessarily think is wonderful--giving all parties a fair chance to make the case and reach a conclusion that is equitable. We will get that done. And we will get it done, hopefully, in a relatively short period of time, without limiting it to a day or 3 days, or 3 weeks for that matter. It could very well take longer than that. But it will be a fair trial. 
   Then we have other very serious responsibilities that we must deal with. It has been said as long as we are dealing with this issue that we can't deal with any other substantive issue in the Senate. Wrong. 
   We have responsibilities that go forward, and we will do our very best to have a dual track. Now, we may not be having debate and votes on the floor of the Senate on bills or on changes in the budget procedures around here, but we will begin to prepare. We will have our committee assignments all completed today. There will be committee hearings this week before the Judiciary Committee, before the Armed Services Committee, before the Education and Labor Committee--although it has a different name here in the Senate, I prefer to call it the Education Committee because it has that very important jurisdiction under its responsibilities. 
   We will begin the process and have hearings and meetings. Depending on how this process goes forward, and realizing that we have to understand the Supreme Court has a schedule that it has to comply with, which might give us some time to do some business, we will do our very best to get prepared for the regular legislative process while we are doing our duty with regard to impeachment. 
   But the goal that I hope we will move to immediately after the completion of the impeachment process, whenever that may be, is to develop some constant themes we want to work on during the 106th Congress. I think they can be described in words like these: security, responsibility, opportunity, and freedom. Now, those are not conflicting goals; they complement and support one another. Security, after all, enables responsibility; responsibility gives purpose to freedom; freedom ensures opportunity; and opportunity fosters security. When I talk about security, I think about security for my mother, security for my son and my daughter and my grandson. I think about health security, Social Security, national security, security in our neighborhoods. So that word encompasses an awful lot. 
   Our task is to advance on all four fronts this year: To enhance security, promote responsibility, strengthen freedom, and foster opportunity for all. In doing so, we face a tight schedule. We always do, but it is a manageable one if the Senators will help the leadership do our jobs. There are matters that we can consider promptly before our legislative committees even begin reporting major bills that must compete for a place and time on the Senate schedule. 
   One of the first matters we should take up is a clarification of Senate rules, to restore this institution's position regarding the consideration of authorizing legislation on appropriation bills. It is out of hand. The biggest fight now in all the appropriations bills occurs not on the appropriations but on amendments that are legislating on appropriations bill. I believe we can accomplish that change back to the way  it was in a bipartisan fashion. I certainly hope so. 
   I hope we can do the same thing regarding our budget process, although I may be erring on the side of optimism in that regard. This is priority legislation, I think, that is required to restore public confidence in the budget process. Do any of us feel that the process at the end of the last year was a good one? I don't think so. In the end, it is going to require will and determination by Senators and House Members to do their jobs on time and on schedule. There are some changes in the process that will help facilitate that. It will enable us to prevent Government shutdowns. It is ridiculous that there is even that possibility. It will control emergency spending. 
   It has reached the point where we have not one super or extra special emergency bill each year, now we have to have two. And it makes a requirement that we take a long, hard look at how that is paid for and at current budget rules. 
   Important as budget reform is, rebuilding America's national security is even more pressing. Press reports have indicated that the administration will propose some increases in defense spending. That is good, and the Senate will take a very close look at that in committee and in the full Senate. I worry that those proposals are not sufficient or maybe the way it would be done is not the best way in trying to address the questions of pay and pensions and readiness for our military. But we should give that a very high priority. We have been losing ground in this area. This Congress must stop that erosion of our readiness and the morale of our military if we are going to be able to preserve our own national security and protect peace wherever our interests are in the world. 
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. Democrats say it is important and it will be a high priority. Republicans say it is a high priority. This past Congress passed not one, not two, but five major education bills, and we got very little credit for it. There was everything from some additional funds for IDEA to vocational education, higher education, and other things in between. 
   For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important. Since its enactment more than 30 years ago, that legislation has been the channel through which tens of billions of dollars have flown from the taxpayers to Washington and back to the school districts again at the local level. In retrospect, perhaps that has not been the most productive system that we could devise, to put it mildly. I think we need to look at ways to cut out some of those stops along the way, the distance between the taxpayers, parents, and government, and how we improve our schools. 
   We need to find more ways to get more dollars back to the schools and especially back to the classrooms. We need to strengthen local decisionmaking so the parents and teachers--the people most involved with their children--can act in the best interest of those youngsters. 
   We should foster quality teaching and promote family choice in education, especially for poor families whose kids are stuck in dead-end schools that are dangerous and drug infested and where they are not learning. We should not, on the other hand, presume to dictate to parents and educators what their priorities should be and how they should spend their tax dollars. So, clearly, this is something on which we will spend a lot of time. 
   We must continue to address the question of oppressive taxation. Most people will acknowledge that Americans are paying a heavy burden in taxes now. It affects the way they think and act as a family or how they save or invest. One of the most crushing tax burdens in this country is the payroll tax; it is a high percentage. That is the one in everybody's check at the end of the work week and they say, gee, this FICA tax is the one that is nailing me. Congress needs to look at that. We need more tax relief for working families so they can keep more of their own money. We need to have a tax code that is pro growth, pro investment, and pro jobs, so that we don't just give people a tax break but we give consideration to how the changes or tax reductions would lead to improvement in lives and jobs all across this country. 
   Tax simplification is a continuing need. We need to think about how we can get lower insurance premiums for the taxpayers, whether it is for their automobile insurance or their health insurance. We need to promote regulatory reform and relief across the board, but especially for small businesses. 
   Nothing this 106th Congress might do--whether in education, tax policy, or environmental protection--would mean as much to the American people as a long-term solution to the problems of Social Security and Medicare. So from the first day of this Congress right up to the last day toward the end of the year 2000, it will be my goal to see if we can find a broad, bipartisan agreement in those two crucial areas. 
   The Congress can't do it alone, though. The President has to provide leadership. It is not enough to just have conferences and talk about options. What is the solution? What are we going to be able to do to resolve the problems on Medicare? Will the Medicare Commission that reports back in March have a report we can act on or not? Or will it decay in partisan disagreement? Can we find a way to act in good faith on Social Security? 
   To show my good faith, I have said that if the President will send us a proposal he would like for us to consider, I will introduce his bill and we will begin hearings the next day in the Senate Finance Committee and see if we can go forward. Or if that is not the way it can be done, I am willing to look at other ways that we can accomplish that goal. It is too important to just set it aside because it is too tough. 
   There are a lot of other issues we will deal with in the regular order. For example, bankruptcy reform, liability reform for charities, charitable choice in Federal programs, to end discrimination against faith-based organizations, prohibition against partial-birth abortions, as well as child custody protections to safeguard family rights, and modernization of financial services. I have spoken with Senator GRAMM and encouraged him, as the new chairman of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction, to pick up the legislation and see if he can forge an agreement that we can move forward on so that we will have broader choices and better service for consumers. 
   In due time, we will deal with all of those and a great many other subjects. During the next few weeks, I realize that the news media will be focused on one thing. My remarks here will be little noted or remembered--other than the part on the impeachment proceedings. But the record must begin to be made now that we have other very important priorities that are the people's priorities back in our respective States. 
   This Senate was designed by the Framers of the Constitution to be the steady element in Government, 
   the place where passions are cooled and judgments come slowly. 
   It serves us well when we take our time and we make sure that the process is fair and the result is equitable. 
   I expect that to happen in the days ahead. No one can predict the outcome of the deliberations on impeachment, but everyone can expect the calm and careful exercise of our duty under the Constitution. That will not conflict with our role as legislators. It will rather confirm that we are more than mere lawmakers. As Members of the Senate, we are guardians of the rule of law and defenders of the rights of every American. That is our most important role, our most solemn charge, and our most enduring honor. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President. I observe the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will convene then at 9:45 a.m. 
   The majority leader will be recognized in order to begin a live quorum. Following that live quorum at approximately 10 a.m., the Senate will prepare to receive the managers from the House of Representatives for the purpose of exhibiting Articles of Impeachment. 
   In addition, it is expected that at 1 p.m., the Senate will commence with the swearing in of the Chief Justice of the United States and all Senators. 
   Mr. President, just one further note, if I might. I know that Senators, members of the media and the American people are anxious to know how we plan to proceed. I think I should say at this point I think we had a very productive day. A lot of activities have been going on in a bipartisan way between Republicans, among themselves, and with the Democrats in the Senate and in the House. There is, in fact, a meeting underway right now with a bipartisan group of the Senate meeting with a group of managers from the House. 
   We intend to continue to try to narrow the list of questions and come forward with a proposal that would provide for an early beginning, an appropriate time for briefings to be filed, for a full trial to be provided for, and votes on Articles of Impeachment at the end of the process. There are a lot of gaps around what I just said, but I think that there is a sincere bipartisan effort and a nonpartisan effort to do it in a way that is fair and that would get us to a conclusion on this matter which has been presented to us or will be presented to us by the House of Representatives. 
   We have a duty. We will do our very best to carry it out in a way that the American people will feel is appropriate for the Senate and that is dignified and fair.
