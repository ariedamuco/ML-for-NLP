   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has passed, H.R. 2598, the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000, a bill which combines a number of critical bills improving the health of our citizens. 
   Title I of this measure contains a bill which passed the Senate Health, Education and Pensions Committee on June 14, 2000, the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000. This important legislation, which I drafted with my colleague, Senator KENNEDY, is the culmination of three hearings and forums and a GAO report over the last two years which demonstrated the need to improve our public health infrastructure and address the growing threats of antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. 
   The conclusion is clear: we need to improve our public health infrastructure to be able to respond in a timely and effective manner to these and other threats. For too long, we have not provided adequate funding to maintain and improve the core capacities of our nation's public health infrastructure. As the GAO report found, many State and local public health agencies lack even the basic equipment of a fax machine or answering machine to assist in their work and improve communications. 
   Besides improving our core public health capacity, this Act addresses two specific problems faced by the nation: antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. 
   The first, antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health problem. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I know all too well that the most common cause of death after the transplantation of a heart or lung is not rejection, but infection. One hundred percent of transplantation patients get infections following surgery. Infection is the most common complication following surgery, the leading cause for rehopitalization, and the most expensive aspect of treatment post-transplantation. Antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment, yet we are seeing increasingly resistant bacteria which are not killed by most first-line antimicrobials. 
   The second issue addressed by this act, bioterrorism, poses a significant threat to our country's strategic well-being. As a nation we are presently more vulnerable to bioweapons than other more traditional means of warfare. Bioweapons pose considerable challenges, different from those of standard terrorist devices, including chemical weapons. 
   The mere term ``bioweapon'' invokes visions of immense human pain and suffering and mass casualties. Pound for pound, ounce for ounce, bioagents represent one of the most lethal, but also covert, weapons of mass destruction known. Victims of a covert bioterrorist attack do not necessarily develop symptoms upon exposure to the bioagent as the onset may be delayed for days after the bioweapon is dispersed. 
   As a result, exposed individuals will likely show up in emergency rooms, physician offices, or clinics with nondescript symptoms or ones that mimic the common cold or flu. Physicians and other health care providers will likely not attribute these symptoms to a bioweapon. If the bioagent is communicable, such as small pox, many more people may be infected in the interim, including our health care workers. As Stephanie Bailey, the Director of Health for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County pointed out in our hearing on bioterrorism, ``many localities are on their own for the first 24 to 48 hours after an attack before Federal assistance can arrive and be operational. This is the critical time for preventing mass casualties.'' 
   If experts are correct in their belief that a major bioterrorist attack is a virtual certainty, then it is no longer a question of ``if'' but rather ``when''. In fact, my home town of Nashville last year joined an ever-increasing number of cities to receive and respond to a package suspected to contain anthrax. Thankfully, this was a hoax. 
   The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act provides greater resources and coordination to improve our public health infrastructure and bolster our preparedness against antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. 
   To strengthen public health infrastructure's ability to fulfill its core functions and respond to emerging threats and emergencies, the bill authorizes the establishment of voluntary performance goals for public health systems, grants to public health agencies for assessments and core capacity building, and funding to rebuild and remodel the facilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. 
   To combat antimicrobial resistance, the bill authorizes a task force to coordinate Federal programs related to antimicrobial resistance and to improve public education on antimicrobial resistance; National Institutes of Health (NIH) research into new therapeutics against and improved diagnostics for resistant pathogens; and grants to detect, monitor, and combat antimicrobial resistance. 
   To prevent and respond to bioterrorism, the bill authorizes: two interdepartmental task forces to address the joint issues of research needs and the public health and medical consequences of bioterrorism; NIH and CDC research on the epidemiology of bioweapons and the development of new vaccines or therapeutics for bioweapons; and grants to improve the ability of public health agencies, hospitals, and health care facilities to detect, diagnose, and respond to bioterrorism. 
   We must act now to improve our basic capacities to address all public health threats, including antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. This legislation provides State and local public health agencies the necessary resources so that we better protect the health and well-being of our Nation's citizens. 
   The Public Health Improvement Act also improves our nation's medical research infrastructure through two bills that I co-authored: the Clinical Research Enhancement Act and the Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act. 
   As a physician, I am aware of the need to translate laboratory discoveries into advances in patient care, but I was troubled by numerous reports and analyses showing insufficient support for patient-oriented research in the United States. The ``Clinical Research Enhancement Act,'' which I also drafted with Senator KENNEDY, addresses this issue by establishing intramural and extramural clinical research fellowship programs and a continuing  education clinical research training program at the NIH. In addition, the bill provides grants for the establishment of general clinical research centers, which provide the infrastructure for clinical research, including clinical training and career enhancement. 
   The ``Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act,'' which I drafted with Senator HARKIN improves our research infrastructure that is central to our continued leadership in medical research. Unfortunately, many research facilities are outdated, and future increases in federal funding for the NIH must include support for the renovation and construction of extramural research facilities and the purchase of state-of-the-art laboratory instrumentation. To renovate biomedical and behavioral research facilities, the bill authorizes grants or contracts to public and nonprofit private entities to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or construct new research facilities, including centers of excellence. In addition, it provides grants to public and non-profit private entities for the purchase of high-end, state-of-the art laboratory instrumentation. 
   The ``Public Health Improvement Act'' also includes important public health bills such as the ``Cardiac Arrest Survival Act,'' the ``Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act,'' the ``Lupus Research Act,'' the ``Prostate Cancer Research and Protection Act,'' as well as important critical pieces of legislation improving organ donation and procurement. 
   The ``Cardiac Arrest Survival Act,'' which Senator GORTON introduced, allows the Secretary of HHS to make recommendations with respect to placing automated external defibrillators, AEDs, in federal building and to expand liability protection to persons or organizations who use AEDs. The ``Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act,'' which Senator COLLINS introduced would improve access to AEDs in small communities and rural areas to boost the survival rates of individuals in those communities who suffer cardiac arrest. In many small and rural communities limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency services can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices problematic. This legislation is intended to increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for smaller towns and rural areas where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs. With more than 700 people dying of sudden cardiac arrest each day, up to 30 percent of which could be saved through immediate medical attention, including defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is my hope this provision will lead to increased placement and use of this life saving equipment. 
   Senator BENNETT introduced the Lupus Research Act, to require the Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases to expand and intensify research and related activities of the Institute regarding lupus. Lupus is a disorder of the immune system that affects between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans. Many with the disease are either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. Lupus is often life threatening and is nine times more likely to affect women than men. The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they are sporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed properly, the majority of lupus cases can be controlled with proper treatment. This measure will increase research into this disease so that it may be more effectively diagnosed and treated. 
   Title VI of the Public Health Improvement Act contains the Prostate Cancer Research and Protection Act, which I introduced last year. Each year an estimated 37,000 American men will die, and 179,300 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. Cancer of the prostate grows slowly, without symptoms, and thus is often undetected until it's in its most advanced and incurable stage. It is critical that men are aware of the risk of prostate cancer and take steps to ensure early detection. The ``Prostate Cancer'' bill expands the authority of the CDC to carry out activities related to prostate cancer screening and overall awareness and surveillance of the disease. The bill also extends the authority of the NIH to conduct basic and clinical research in combating prostate cancer. 
   Finally, I would like to talk about provisions of great personal significance to me relating to organ procurement and donation. Last year, more than 21,000 lives were saved through transplantation in the United States. However, the demand for transplants has more than tripled in the past ten years, and 16 people die each day before they can receive a transplant. As a transplant surgeon, I can't express enough to my colleagues and the nation how important organ donation is. That is why the ``Public Health Improvement Act'' includes a resolution recognizing the need for increased organ and tissue donation and the important role that families play in the process. The resolution designates November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' and to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members. It encourages families to use the time of Thanksgiving, a time dedicated to spending time with one another, to discuss this critical life-saving issue among themselves so that they may make informed decisions should the occasion to donate arise. Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on our blessings, and it represents the perfect opportunity for family members to discuss this simple act that can give life to those most in need. 
   The bill also includes the ``Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act,'' which was drafted by Senators COLLINS and DODD. Organ Procurement Organizations, OPOs, approach families regarding organ donation and arrange transportation of organs and transplant surgery logistics. They must currently be recertified every two years by the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, in order to qualify for Medicare reimbursement. This bill requires HCFA to change the standards for recertification to account for variation in the number of potential donors in a given state and extends the current certification cycle from two to four years. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed this bill, which represents the work of many Senators which I have mentioned in my remarks. I am thankful to all my colleagues for their support and willingness to help improve the public health of this nation. I would especially like to thank Senators JEFFORDS and KENNEDY and Representatives Tom BLILEY, MICHAEL BILIRAKIS, JOHN DINGELL and SHERROD BROWN, and their excellent staffs for all the hard work and dedication that has gone into negotiating this package of bills. I would also like to thank Mr. Bill Baird and Ms. Daphne Edwards of the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel, for their tireless work and great expertise in drafting this bill. I would like to thank my Staff Director of the Public Health Subcommittee, Anne Phelps, and my Health Advisors Dave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson for their work in making this bill possible. Finally, I would like to thank the many groups who have worked on the various provisions in this bill for their support, and I look forward to enactment of this bill this year. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the record a summary of the Public Health Improvement Act and letters of support for the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, which is incorporated in the Public Health Improvement Act.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 incorporates provisions that I originally introduced with my colleague, Senator KENNEDY, as the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act. The Act reauthorizes and amends Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. This Section reauthorizes the ``Public Health Emergency Fund,'' from which the Secretary of Health and Human Services may expend funds in the event of a public health emergency. The Public Health Emergency Fund is a separate and distinct fund from the existing Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, which is now used to fund other programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. It is our intent that the provisions of Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act apply to the Public Health Emergency Fund, and not to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. 
   Since public health emergencies may present unanticipated costs, the sponsors of the Act did not specify a dollar amount in authorizing appropriations for the Public Health Emergency Fund. However, we believe that a fund should exist from which expenditures can be made in the event of a public health emergency and appropriations made accordingly, so that monies need not be diverted from existing programs when emergencies arise, as is often now the case.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support passage of the Older Americans Act (OAA) Reauthorization. This Act has been providing a wide range of services, such as a community service employment program, nutrition services, and research, training, and demonstration activities since 1965 for older persons, especially those at risk of losing their independence. 
   One such service is the Act's nutrition program, which provides millions of meals to older persons in congregate settings, such as senior centers, and to frail older persons in the comfort of their homes. The nutrition program is the Act's largest program providing meals to people who are generally older, poor, and living alone. Most significantly, this program is often the most important source of a balanced, nutritious meal for its elderly participants. While these seniors need some assistance securing adequate meals for themselves, through OAA they don't have to give up living on their own to ensure they have proper nutrition.  
   In an effort to expand other home-based services, this bill authorizes $125 million in appropriations for a National Family Caregiver Support Program. The new caregiver program which will provide grants to support families and other providers of in-home and community care to older individuals, to develop innovative approaches to caregiving, and to link family support programs with programs for persons with mental retardation or related developmental disabilities and their families. This provision will help not only our seniors, but their families who are struggling to care for them in a home environment rather than a nursing home. 
   Another example of how OAA helps seniors keep their independence is through the senior community service employment program, which provides opportunities for part-time employment in community service activities for unemployed, low-income older persons. One goal of this program is to increase the income of these persons, however the broader goal is to assist them obtain jobs and become more self-sufficient. While the program supports over 61,500 jobs for elderly Americans, we all benefit from its efforts. Its participants are enthusiastic additions to our labor force, eagerly taking on jobs in community service that might otherwise go unattended. The participants are eager to enter the workforce and are often hired into other jobs outside of the program because of their strong work ethic. 
   In my home state of Tennessee, 1,224 positions have been established for the senior community service employment program through 1999. During that same year, 547 older Tennesseans were placed into the workforce outside those positions, which means that Tennessee has a rate of 45 percent for transitioning these subsidized part-time jobs into employment outside the program. Of the four senior community service employment program grantees operating in Tennessee, Green Thumb is the oldest and largest, serving 744 elderly Tennesseans during 2000. Green Thumb is currently transitioning 65 percent of elderly Tennesseans from their training program into the workforce, or in other words, at a much higher rate than the national average. 
   In Tennessee, the seniors served by the senior community service employment program are typically destitute women, with little to no job experience and the inability to pay for food and other basic needs. I recently heard the story of 83 year old Nell Taylor of Trenton, Tennessee. Ms. Taylor has worked at the Department of Human Services in Trenton since 1987 after starting with Green Thumb in 1985. As a result of her experience in the program, she wrote, ``I am so thankful to know I have a job in DHS for it makes me feel like I am wanted and I am important.'' 
   Other stories illustrating the success of this program are those of Elizabeth Powell and Marion Perry. Elizabeth Powell is a teacher's assistant, who also tutors individuals in the ``English as a Second Language class,'' at the Rhea County Adult Education program in Dayton, Tennessee. At 69 years of age, Ms. Powell inspires students having received her own GED at age 58 and knowing personally how the lack of a diploma or GED hinders job opportunities. Marion Perry of Etowah, Tennessee, is a 57-year-old, part-time school bus driver who needed a second job to support his family, which includes several adopted and foster children of various nationalities. Within a couple of weeks, Green Thumb assisted Perry in securing a job as a security guard with a local company. 
   These few programs I've mentioned today, together with the many other services and activities established by OAA, are providing our elderly Americans with needed services, helping them maintain their independence, and affirming the valuable role they play in our community. I would like to thank Senator JEFFORDS and Senator DEWINE for their leadership on this issue. I would also like to thank Senator KENNEDY for his work and dedication to this issue.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. Every day, through personal experience or the news, we are reminded of the tremendous scientific advances that have been made in medicine; but unfortunately, millions of Americans still experience serious disparities in health outcomes as a result of ethnicity, race, gender, or a lack of access to health care services. 
   Recent studies have demonstrated that minority populations, in addition to having lower rates of health care access, exhibit poorer health outcomes and may have higher rates of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant mortality, death from cancer and heart disease, and other health problems. For example, when compared to whites, the mortality rate for prostate cancer is nearly twice that for black men; and while African Americans make up only 13 percent of our nations's population, they represented 49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998. Further, compared to whites, the prevalence of diabetes in Hispanic individuals is nearly double. In my home state of Tennessee, African Americans have an infant mortality rate nearly three times that of white Tennesseans, and Tennessee's African Americans suffer from heart disease at one and a half times that rate of whites and are twice as likely to suffer a stroke. 
   The Jackson Sun recently published an investigative report, ``What's Killing Us?: The Color of Death 10 Years Later,'' which analyzes health data specific to West Tennessee. The report highlighted that, ``[African Americans] in West Tennessee die at a much higher rate--370 percent higher for hypertension for example--than whites with the same diseases,'' and made it clear that we have failed to close the gap between death rates for black and white citizens over the last ten years. West Tennessee is a snapshot of what is happening around the country, and the lessons apply broadly. The report provides key lessons to improve health that are applicable to all Americans including the need for targeted research, improved education and public awareness, increased prevention measures, and better access to care. 
   However, health disparities are not limited to minority communities. Medically underserved populations located in rural Appalachia, which include significant portions of my home state of Tennessee, exhibit health disparities consistent with minority populations. In rural Appalachia, where only one doctor exists for every 1,025 patients, white males between 35 and 64 are 19 percent more likely to die of heart disease than their counterparts elsewhere in the country, and white Appalachian women are 21 percent more likely to die of heart disease. Moreover, barriers to care are undermining thee health of many communities, including rural areas where poverty and the lack of a health care infrastructure often inhibit the ability to prevent or treat health care conditions. 
   In order to address the issue of health disparities, in June of this year the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it began the administrative process to elevate the current NIH Office of Research on Minority Health to a center. In July, I held a Public Health Subcommittee hearing, ``Health Disparities: Bridging the Gap,'' to focus on how to address minority health 
   disparities and what measures we should take to improve minority health. 
   During this hearing, the Subcommittee examined health care disparities among minorities, rural and underserved populations, and women. Witnesses ranging from the Administration to experts representing the minority and underserved communities testified that a Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities is needed to focus national attention on this unrelenting problem. My friend and fellow Tennessean, Dr. John Maupin, President of Meharry Medical College of Nashville, said it best when he testified that ``ethnic minority and medically underserved populations continue to suffer disproportionately from virtually every disease and we can no longer sit idly by without addressing this national crisis.'' 
   Today, I am pleased to introduce the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000, with Senators KENNEDY and JEFFORDS. The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act will expand research and education for the biomedical, behavioral, economic, institutional, and environmental factors contributing to health disparities in minority and medically underserved populations. 
   This legislation establishes a National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities at NIH; a grant program through the new Center to further biomedical and behavioral research, education, and training; an endowment program to facilitate minority and other health disparities research at centers of excellence; and an extramural loan repayment program to train members of minority or other health disparities populations as biomedical research professionals. 
   This bill also directs the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to conduct and support research to identify populations for which there is a significant disparity in the quality, outcomes, cost, or use of health care services or access, as well as the causes and barriers to reducing health disparities. Additionally, AHRQ is able to identify, test, and evaluate strategies for reducing or eliminating health disparities; develop measures and tools for the assessment and improvement of the outcomes, quality, and appropriateness of health care services; and increase the number of researchers who are members of health disparity populations, or the health services research capacity of institutions that train such researchers. 
   Furthermore, this Act provides resources under the Health Resources and Services Administration for research and demonstration projects for the training and education of health professionals in reducing disparities in health care outcomes. A national campaign to inform the public and a plan for the dissemination of information and findings under all Titles of the Act is also established under the bill. 
   Health disparities may be the result of many factors, including limited access to prevention and treatment services, poverty and socioeconomic factors, exposure to environmental toxins, and even cultural factors. Turning our back on these disparities would be a national failure. Every Tennessean and every American deserves the best quality of health regardless of their race, ethnicity, sex, or where they live. With the concerted efforts of those supporting this bill, I'm certain that we can take the necessary steps to reverse our nation's health disparities. 
   I am pleased that the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act is supported by Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee; East Tennessee State University (ETSU) in Johnson City, Tennessee; Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia; and the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools. Dr. Ronald Franks of ETSU wrote of his support for this legislation because it identifies ``health populations as a priority in the nation's health agenda and the recognition of the health disparities in the Appalachian region.'' 
   Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. John Maupin of Meharry Medical College, and Dr. Ronald Franks and Dr. Bruce Behringer of East Tennessee State University for their dedication to helping the minority and medically underserved populations in Tennessee and for their counsel and assistance on this legislation. I would also like to thank my colleagues for their work and dedication to this issue, and I look forward to the enactment of the bill this year.

   Mr. FRIST. Amidst all of the proposals and discussions and objections and debate that has gone on here on the floor, I rise to talk about a bill that has been very positive, which demonstrates the best of what this body is all about--a pulling together and working together across the aisle in a bipartisan way, all with the goal of making others' lives more fulfilling, both in the current generation and in future generations. This week, the U.S. Congress has sent to the President of the United States for his signing a comprehensive bill that very much forms the backbone of efforts to improve the safety and health of America's children. 
   This bill that has been sent to the President focuses on our children's health, the Children's Health Act of 2000. It was more than a year ago that Senator Jim JEFFORDS and I reached out across the Capitol to Chairman BLILEY and Representative BILIRAKIS to work together in a coordinated way on a whole variety of issues and bills that are critical to children's health and safety. These included such issues as maternal and infant health, day-care safety, pediatric research, pediatric health promotion, and efforts to fight drug abuse and provide mental health services for young people today. I am 
   delighted that both the House and the Senate have passed this bill, that it has been sent to the President, and that we were successful in achieving our goal. 
   The bill addresses a range of issues. Just to give some flavor of this bill and what it can achieve, what it will achieve, what it does achieve in its language, let me comment on a few. 
   Day-care safety. Currently, there are more than 13 million children 6 years of age and less who are enrolled in day-care centers. Almost a quarter of a million are in Tennessee. One provision in this bill, the Day-Care Safety Act, recognizes the need to make these settings safer, improving the health and public welfare of children in day care. Parents should simply not be afraid to leave their children in the morning when they drop them off in these day-care settings, fearing that a licensed  day-care facility is not safe over the course of that day. This bill helps ensure that our childcare centers will be safer. 
   Secondly, children's health. Provisions included in this bill, the Children's Public Health Act of 2000, some of which were introduced July 13 of this past year--that I introduced with Senators JEFFORDS and KENNEDY--address a number of children's health issues, including maternal and pediatric health promotion and research. 
   Thirdly, traumatic brain injury. Traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death for every age group between 1 and 19 years of age. This bill strengthens the traumatic brain injury programs at the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. 
   Fourth, birth defects: Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and are responsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric admissions. 
   This bill focuses on maternal and infant health. The legislation establishes a national center for birth defects and developmental disabilities at the CDC, the purpose of which is to collect and analyze and distribute data on birth defects. 
   Fifth, asthma. The bill combats some of the most common challenges, problems, and public health issues in children today. In terms of asthma, it provides comprehensive asthma services and coordinates a wide range of asthma prevention programs in the Federal Government to address this most common chronic childhood disease. 
   Mr. President, I am delighted that this bill has passed both of these bodies with this body working together in a bipartisan way. 
   I understand that we are about ready to begin on the conference report. Therefore, I will terminate my comments at this point, and later in the day, during morning business, will extend my comments on this very important bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to acknowledge the final Senate passage of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 today, which follows the actions of House of Representatives earlier this morning. This important bill forms a unique partnership between federal, local, and state governments; non-profit community organizations, health care and supportive service providers. For the last decade, this Act has successfully provided much needed assistance in health care costs and support services for low-income, uninsured and underinsured individuals with HIV/AIDS. 
   Through programs such as the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP, which provides access to pharmaceuticals, the CARE Act has helped extend and even save lives. Last year alone, nearly 100,000 people living with HIV and AIDS received access to drug therapy because of the CARE Act. Half the people served by the CARE Act have family incomes of less than $10,000 annually, which is less than the $12,000 annual average cost of new drug ``cocktails'' for treatment. The CARE Act is critical in ensuring that the number of people living with AIDS continues to increase, as effective new drug therapies are keeping HIV-infected persons healthy longer and dramatically reducing the death rate. Investments in enabling patients with HIV to live healthier and more productive lives have helped to reduce overall health costs. For example, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the nation has seen a 30 percent decline in HIV related hospitalizations, producing nearly one million fewer HIV related hospital days and a savings of more than $1 billion. 
   During the 104th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with Senator Kassebaum on the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 to ensure that this needed law was extended. Senator JEFFORDS, who has done a terrific job in crafting this bill, has already outlined some specifics of this legislation, however, I would like to conclude by discussing a specific provision which I am grateful Senator JEFFORDS included in this reauthorization. 
   This bill contains a provision, under Title II of this Act, addressing the fact that the face of this disease is changing as AIDS moves into communities which have not been impacted as great as several Title I grantees. One important aspect of this provision is the creation of supplemental grants for emerging metropolitan communities, which do not qualify for Title I funding but have reported between 500 and 2,000 AIDS cases in the last five years. For cities that have between 1,000 and 2,000 AIDS cases this provision would provide cities, including Memphis and Nashville, at least $5 million in new funding to divide each year, or 25 percent of new monies under Title II, whichever is greater. For cities with 500 to 999 AIDS cases in the last five years, at least $5 million in new funding each year will be divided, or 25 percent of new monies under Title II, whichever is greater. This provision will be implemented as soon as the appropriation level for Title II, excluding the ADAP program, is increased by $20 million above the FY2000 funding level. Once implemented, this program would remain in place every year after the initial trigger level is met with at least $10 million coming from the Title II funding to support this needed effort. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this issue, and Sean Donohue and William Fleming of his staff for all their expertise in drafting this bill. I would also like to thank Senator KENNEDY and Stephanie Robinson of his staff for their work and dedication to this issue. And finally I would like to think Dave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson of my health staff for their work on passage of this bill.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss and share with my colleagues very good news, some news that is bipartisan, that reflects what is the very best of what the Senate is all about. 
   It has to do with a bill called the Children's Health Act of 2000, a bill that is bipartisan, that reflects the input of probably 20 to 30 individual Senators on issues that mean a great deal to them based on their experience, their legislative history, what they have done in the past, their personal experiences, and responding to their constituents. This bill passed the Senate last week and passed the House of Representatives last week and will be sent to the President of the United States sometime either later tonight or tomorrow. 
   The Children's Health Act of 2000, is a comprehensive bill, a bill that forms the backbone of efforts to improve the health and safety of young people today, of America's children today. But equally important, it gathers the investments to improve the health, the well-being of children of future generations. 
   It is fascinating to me because it was about a year or a year and a half ago that Senator JEFFORDS and I, after working on this particular piece of legislation for a couple of years, reached out directly across the Capitol to Chairman BLILEY and Representative BILIRAKIS to work together to address a  whole variety of children's health issues, including day-care safety, maternal, child, and fetal health, pediatric public health promotion, pediatric research, efforts to fight drug abuse, and efforts to provide mental health services for our young people today. 
   The good news, with all of the other debates that are going on and the partisanship going back and forth, is that we in the Senate, as the Congress, we as a government have been successful in accomplishing this bipartisan, bicameral effort. 
   The bill that Congress now sends to the President includes two divisions or two parts. The first part, part A, addresses issues regarding children's health. The second part, part B, addresses youth drug abuse. 
   I would like to take a few moments to outline not the entire bill, but a number of the provisions in this bill, because I think it reflects the care and the thoughtfulness with which this bill was put together. 
   The first is day care safety. Perhaps the most critical section of the first part of this bill relates to day care health and safety. We based it on the bill which was called, the Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement Act, a bill that I introduced, again, in a bipartisan way, with Senator DODD on March 9 of this year. 
   Currently, there are more than 13 million children under the age of 6 who, every day, are enrolled in day care. About a quarter of a million children in Tennessee go to day care. The day care safety bill recognizes that it is our responsibility as a society, as a Government, to make sure that these day care facilities are as safe as possible, such as the health of children in child care is protected, so that when a parent, or both parents, drop that child off at day care, they can rest assured that the child will be in a safe environment throughout the day. 
   The danger in child care settings recently has become evident in my own State of Tennessee, again drawing upon how we learn and listen in our own States and bring those issues together and discussing them on the floor of the Senate and then fashion them into a bill. Tragically, within the span of just two years, in one city in Tennessee, four children died in child care settings. In addition, one in five child care programs in another city in Tennessee were found to have potentially put the health and safety of children at risk during the year 1999. 
   But this isn't just a Tennessee concern. It affects parents and day care centers and children nationwide. According to a Consumer Product Safety Commission Study in 1997, 31,000 children, ages 4 and younger, were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries they sustained while in child care or at school. More than 60 children have died in child care settings since 1990. The statistics are startling. They are unacceptable. The thousands of parents dropping their children off and leaving them in the hands of child care providers every day deserve the reassurance that their children will be safe throughout the day. 
   A recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics reinforced this need further when it reported a disturbing trend among children with SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. They looked at SIDS infants in day care. There were 1,916 SIDS cases from 1995 through 97 in 11 States and they found that about 20 percent, 391 deaths occurred in these day care settings. Most troubling was the fact that in over half of the cases the caretakers placed children on their stomach, where those same children at home were put to sleep on their backs by their parents. Parents and advocates who are dedicated to helping to eliminate the incidence of SIDS have urged that child care providers be required to have SIDS risk reduction education. When you hear these statistics and read these reports, you will agree. That is why I included a provision in this bill to carry out several activities, including the use of health consultants to give health and safety advice to child care providers on important issues, including SIDS prevention. 
   Overall, our bill authorizes $200 million to States to help improve the health and safety of children in child care settings. The grants can be used for all sorts of activities, including child care provider training and education, inspections in criminal background checks for day care providers; enhancements to improve a facility's ability to serve children with disabilities; to look at transportation safety procedures; to look and study and provide information for parents on choosing a safe and healthy day care setting. 
   This funding could also be used to help child care facilities meet the health and safety standards, or employ health consultants 
   to give health and safety advice to child care providers. Many of us in this body have grandchildren or children. Our highest concerns are for the safety of those children and grandchildren. I understand the fears that so many parents have. Parents should not be afraid to leave their children in the care of a licensed child care facility. This bill, very simply, helps ensure that our child care centers will be safer. 
   A second portion of the first part of this bill includes provisions called the Children's Public Health Act of 2000 which, again, had been introduced in a bipartisan way by myself, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator KENNEDY on July 13 of this past year. The purpose of this bill is to address a whole variety of children's health issues, including maternal and infant health, including pediatric health promotion, including pediatric research. Senator ORRIN HATCH, whose name was mentioned on the floor a few minutes ago, has been a real leader in another area of traumatic brain injury. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death in the age group between 1 and 19 years. It is those unintentional injuries that is the number one cause of death. In fact, more than 1.5 million American children suffer a brain injury each year. Therefore, in this bill we strengthen the traumatic brain injury for the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. 
   Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and are responsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric admissions. This bill also focuses on maternal and infant health. This legislation establishes for the first time a National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC, to collect, analyze and distribute data on birth defects. 
   In addition, the bill authorizes a program called Healthy Start, a program to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve those perinatal or those outcomes around the time of birth, by providing grants to areas with a high incidence of infant mortality and low birthweight. To address the fact that over 3,000 women experience serious complications due to pregnancy and that two out of three will die from complications in their pregnancy, this bill develops a national monitoring and surveillance program to better understand the maternal complications and mortality to decrease the disparities among various populations at risk of death and complications from pregnancy. 
   Asthma has an increasing incidence in this country and we don't know why. This bill combats some of the most common ailments. For instance, it provides comprehensive asthma services and coordinates the wide range of asthma prevention programs in the Federal Government, to address the most common childhood diseases. Asthma is a disease that affects over 5 million children in this country today. 
   Obesity is another problem. Again, we don't fully understand it, but it is a problem that is increasing in magnitude. Childhood obesity has doubled in the past 15 years and produced almost 5 million seriously overweight children in adolescence. It is an epidemic. This bill addresses childhood obesity and supports State and community-based programs promoting good nutrition and increased physical activity among American youth. 
   Lead poisoning prevention. As I look at problems across Tennessee, I was concerned to learn that in Memphis over 12 percent of children under the age of 6 may have lead poisoning. Such poisoning, we know, can contribute to learning disabilities, loss of intelligence, to hyperactivity, to behavioral problems. 
   In this bill, we include physician identification and training programs on current lead screening policies. We track the percentage of children in health center programs, and conduct outreach and education for families at risk for lead poisoning.  
   The Surgeon General's report of May 2000 noted that oral health is inseparable from overall health, and that while a majority of the population has experienced great improvements in oral health disparities affecting poor children and those who live in underserved areas represent 80 percent of all dental cavities in 20 percent of children. 
   Our bill encourages pediatric oral health by supporting community-based research and training to improve the understanding of etiology, pathogenesis diagnoses, or the why of the disease progression, the diagnosis of the disease prevention and treatment of these pediatric oral, dental, and cranial facial diseases. Behind all of those is pediatrics research. 
   Our bill strengthens pediatric research. It does it in such a way by establishing a pediatric research initiative within the National Institutes of Health. It will enhance collaborative efforts. It will provide increased support for pediatrics biomedical research and ensure that opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations and care for children are realized. 
   I should also mention childhood research protections, children who are involved in research, and how they are protected. 
   Included in this bill are provisions to address safety initiatives in children's research by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review the current Federal regulations for the protection of children who are participating in investigations. It will address issues such as determining acceptable levels of risk and obtaining parental permission. They will report to Congress on how to ensure the highest standards of safety. 
   This year the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health, which I chair, held two important hearings relating to gene therapy trials and human subject protections. We discovered a lapse of protection for individuals participating in clinical trial research. In the next Congress, we intend to make the further review in updating of human subject protections a major priority of this subcommittee. 
   The second part of this bill, division B of the bill, contains provisions which address very specifically the curse of pediatric or youth drug abuse. 
   The 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reported that 10.9 percent of youth ages 12 to 17 currently use illicit drugs. They further estimated that 11.3 percent of 12- to 17-year-old boys and 10.5 percent of 12- to 17-year-old girls used drugs in the past month. 
   Just as discouraging is the growth in youth alcohol abuse. These same reports reveal that 10.4 million current drinkers are younger than the legal drinking age of 21 and that more than 6.8 million have engaged in binge drinking. 
   Sadly, all of these numbers detailing youth substance abuse have risen since 1992. 
   We addressed this tragedy again head on by incorporating the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which in a bipartisan way was introduced by myself and Senator KENNEDY last spring which was first passed in the Senate in November of 1999. 
   This youth drug bill addresses the problem of youth substance abuse by authorizing and by reauthorizing and improving and strengthening the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This bill puts a renewed focus on youth and adolescence substance abuse and mental health services. At the same time, it gives flexibility, and it demands greater accountability by States for the use of Federal funds. 
   Created in 1992 to assist States in reducing substance abuse and mental illness through these prevention and treatment programs, 
   the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provides funds to States for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and activities, as well as mental health services. Its block grants account for 40 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of all substance abuse and community mental health services. 
   In my own State of Tennessee, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Act provides more than 70 percent of overall funding for the Tennessee Department of Health, Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse. 
   This bill very quickly accomplishes six critical goals. It promotes State flexibility by easing outdated or unneeded requirements and governing the expenditure of Federal block grants. 
   Second, it ensures State accountability by moving away from the present system inefficiencies to a performance-based system. 
   Third, it provides substance abuse treatment services and early intervention substance abuse services for children and adolescence. 
   Fourth, it helps local communities treat violent youth and minimizes outbreaks of youth violence through partnerships among schools, among law enforcement activities, and mental health services. It ensures Federal funding for substance abuse or mental health emergencies. 
   And six, it supports and expands programs providing mental health and substance abuse treatment services to homeless individuals. 
   I will close by basically stating, once again, how excited I am about this particular bill as we send it to the President. Over the next several days during morning business, I look forward to the opportunity of coming back and discussing this bill further with my colleagues who have participated so directly in this particular bill. 
   I wish to respond very briefly to some comments that were made prior to me beginning my comments and the discussion on the floor in the hour preceding my comments that centered on prescription drug plans, the modernization of Medicare, and who has the best approach. The debate was very much between the Bush proposal and the Gore proposal. Let me very quickly summarize the objections that seniors have to the Gore proposal and the prescription drugs. I can do this very quickly. It really boils down to one sentence. 
   Under the Gore proposal, seniors will have only one choice, and they will only have one chance to make that choice. Then there is no turning back. No. 1, the Gore prescription drug proposal is centered around a Washington-run drug HMO. 
   Why does that bother seniors? Because an HMO ultimately, and often we see it too commonly today, sets prices, determines access, and can deny that access without any choice. 
   No. 2, the Gore proposal has a $600 access fee. That means if you do not use prescription drugs today, you are going to be paying $600 more today for getting nothing further; $600 access. That is before you buy any drugs whatsoever, a $600 access fee. 
   Our seniors are asking: Am I going to be one of the 13 million people who do not even have $600 in prescription drug requirements a year? If so, if I join that plan, I automatically am going to be paying more for what I get today. 
   That is for 13 million seniors. Seniors are asking: Am I going to be one of those 13 million? 
   Just one example: Under the Gore prescription drug proposal, if you have $500 a year in prescription drugs, and you joined his plan, you are going to have to pay $530 for $500 worth of prescription drugs today. 
   That is why seniors are going to object. That is why the Gore plan really, as I see it, has absolutely no chance for passage. 
   One other thing on the access fee: Let me tell our seniors very directly, if this bill were to pass today, if the Vice President were successful in getting this bill through today, as a 
   senior your Medicare premiums, how much you pay every month, is going to double from what it is today. Your Medicare premium for what you pay today for Medicare is going to double. It will go from $45 to $90 within 2 years, if you join this plan. 
   The third I said is one choice; one chance; no turning back. You have one chance under the Gore proposal. If you are 64 1/2 you either get this prescription drug benefit or you don't. 
   The problem is that a lot of heart disease doesn't develop until you are 65, or 67, or 70, or 75, or 80, or 85 years of age. At 64 1/2 , if you didn't go into these prescription drug programs, you have no chance to go into it in the future. You have only one chance; that is, when you are 64 1/2 . 
   People say you only live 65, or 67, or 77 years of age. If you live to be 64 1/2 ,  you are likely to live to 80 or 85 years of age. You have one choice--a Washington HMO; one chance when you are 64 1/2 and no turning back. 
   I make it very clear to our seniors what we are talking about when we talk about the prescription drug plan proposed by Vice President GORE.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, two years ago this revered but relatively insulated complex we affectionately call Capitol Hill was rocked by a lone gunman who shot his way through two security checkpoints and, in a rampage, not only terrorized tourists and staff but took the lives of two dedicated U.S. Capitol Police officers who died defending them and the institution in which we all serve. 
   As a trauma surgeon, I am used to blood and death, but it is one thing to treat the result of violence in a hospital; quite another to walk straight into its midst in a place you'd never expect. That day brought home not only at what great risk these dedicated police officers serve, but also how much we take their service--and their courage--for granted. 
   But the U.S. Capitol Police are not the only ones who deserve our respect and support. Every officer, in every city and town across America, who walks a beat, patrols a street, intercepts a drug push, responds to the call of an angry neighbor or spouse, or even pulls over a speeding motorist, runs the same risk of death or serious injury from spontaneous violence that Officers Chestnut and Gibson faced that day. Each of those officers deserve our thanks and admiration, but most of all, they deserve our support. 
   That is why I have consistently fought for more Federal block grant funds for local police departments, as well as the flexibility to use those funds wherever they're needed most--not just to hire more police officers, but to purchase the equipment or training they need to protect not only the lives of our citizens--which they are more than willing to do--but their own lives as well. 
   Three weeks ago, I had the honor of meeting with the Board of the Memphis Police Association in Memphis, Tennessee--a hard-working group of law enforcement officials who represent the 1,800 police men and women who respond to over 800,000 calls annually, protecting lives and property in Tennessee's largest city. 
   As always, they offered many constructive suggestions about how Congress might address a variety of law enforcement issues, including the issues of recruitment and quality of life. As the people who man the front lines in the war against crime and see first-hand the challenge that faces all of us, their perspective is invaluable, and I hope to translate some of their ideas into legislation for the Senate's consideration next year. 
   One of the advantages of being a U.S. Senator is the opportunity to undergo  extraordinary experiences one would otherwise never have. Getting to spend time with the men and women who have made law enforcement their life's work--the officers, the sheriffs, and others--is one such extraordinary experience, and it always humbles me to witness their courage and dedication up close. They work long hours away from their families, often at great personal risk, and endure low salaries and years of stress at work and at home to make our lives safer and easier. And I, for one, wish to acknowledge the men and women of the Memphis Police Department, and all law enforcement personnel in Tennessee and across America, for the selfless work they do. 
   We who work every day in this symbol of democracy are fortunate, because we get to know the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police on a personal basis. We greet them every day, we witness their dedication to duty, they inquire after us and our families, they become our friends. Long after Officers Gibson and Chestnut were laid to rest, we remember still their warmth and their many kindnesses, their lives and their heroic sacrifice. Unfortunately, other officers with just as much courage and dedication to duty are not known by the people they protect. But that does not mean they should be appreciated any less. 
   And it is not just the people of their communities who should appreciate them. As the representatives of those people in Washington, we also must recognize America's police men and women for what they are--American heros--and do whatever we can to support their efforts on our behalf.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed today, H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, a comprehensive of several important children's health bills on which I and the rest of the Senate have spent a great amount of time over the past year and a half. These bills address a wide variety of critical children's health issues, including day care safety, maternal and infant health, pediatric public health promotion, pediatric research, and efforts to fight youth drug abuse and provide mental health services. Collectively, this comprehensive bill will form the backbone of efforts that will improve the health and safety of America's children well into the coming years. 
   The bill which passed the Senate today includes two divisions, with Division A addressing issues regarding children's health, while Division B addresses youth drug abuse. 
   Perhaps the most critical section in Division A of this bill are provisions relating to day care health and safety, which were included in S. 2263, the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement Act,'' which I introduced with Senator DODD on March 9, 2000. These provisions recognize that while more than 13 million children under the age of six spend some part of their day in day care, including 254,000 children in Tennessee alone, evidence suggests a need to make these settings safer and improve the health of children in child care settings. 
   The danger in child care settings has recently become evident in Tennessee. Tragically, within the span of 2 years, there have been 4 deaths in child care settings in Memphis, and 1 in 5 child-care programs in the Nashville area were found to have potentially put the health and safety of children at risk during 1999. But this isn't just a Tennessee concern. It affects parents nationwide. 
   For example, according to a Consumer Product Safety Commission Study, in 1997, 31,000 children ages four and younger were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school settings. Since 1990, more than 60 children have died in child care settings. This is unacceptable. The thousands of parents leaving their children in the hands of child care providers each day deserve reassurance that their children are safe. 
   Further evidence of day care health and safety concerns were made clear in a recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics which showed a disturbing trend among infants and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in day care. The study examined 1,916 SIDS cases from 1995 to 1997 in 11 states, and found that about 20 percent, 391 deaths, occurred in day care settings. Most troubling was the fact that in over half of the cases where caretakers placed children on their stomach, the children were usually put to sleep on their backs by their parents. 
   Parents and advocates who are dedicated in helping to eliminate the incidence of SIDS have urged that child care providers be required to have SIDS risk reduction education. I agree, which is why I included provision in the bill to carry out several activities, including the use of health consultants to give health and safety advice to child care providers on important issues like SIDS prevention. 
   Overall the bill provides $200 million to states, including $4.2 million for my state of Tennessee, to help improve the health and safety of children in child care. The grants could be used for a number of activities, including child care provider training and education; inspections and criminal background checks for day care providers; enhancements to improve a facility's ability to serve children with disabilities; transportation safety procedures; and information for parents on choosing a safe and healthy day care setting. The funding could also be used to help child care facilities meet health and safety standards or employ health consultants to give health and safety advice to child care providers. 
   As a father, my highest concern is the safety of my three sons, and I understand the fears that so many parents have. Parents shouldn't be afraid to leave their children in the care of a licensed child care facility. This bill helps ensure that our child care centers will be safer. 
   The major portion of Division A are provisions which were included in the ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' which I introduced on July 13, 2000 with Senators JEFFRODS and KENNEDY. Provisions in the ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' address a wide range of children's health issues including maternal and infant health, pediatric health promotion, and pediatric research. 
   Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for every age group between 1 and 19 years of age, comprising 26 deaths per 100,000 children aged 1-14 and 62 deaths per 100,000 children aged 15-19. More than 1.5 million American children suffer a brain injury each year. Therefore, the bill reauthorizes and strengthens the Traumatic Brain Injury programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 
   Because birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and are responsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric hospital admissions, the bill also focuses on maternal and infant health. This legislation establishes a National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC to collect, analyze, and distribute data on birth defects. In addition, the bill authorizes the Healthy Start program to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes by providing grants to areas with a high incidence of infant mortality and low birth weight. 
   Furthermore, over 3,000 women experience serious complications due to pregnancy. Two out of three will die from complications in their pregnancy. Therefore, the bill develops a national monitoring and surveillance program to better understand maternal complications and mortality, and to decrease the disparities among populations at risk of death and complications from pregnancy. 
   The bill also combats some of the most common childhood diseases and conditions. For instance, it provides comprehensive asthma services and coordinates the wide range of asthma prevention programs in the federal government to address the most common chronic childhood disease, asthma, which affects nearly 5 million children. 
   We also focus on childhood obesity, which has doubled in just the past 15 years, and produced 4.7 million seriously overweight children and adolescents ages 6-19 years. To address this epidemic, the bill supports state and community-based programs to promote good nutrition and increased physical activity among American youth. 
   In examining the problems affecting children across the nation and in Tennessee, I was very concerned to learn that in Memphis, over 12 percent of children under the age of 6 may have lead poisoning. Such poisoning can cause a variety of debilitating health problems, including seizure, and coma, and even death. Even at lower levels, lead can contribute to learning disabilities, loss of intelligence, hyperactivity, and behavioral problems. This bill includes physician education and training programs on current lead screening policies, tracks the percentage of children in the Health Centers program who are screened for lead poisoning, and conducts outreach and education for families at risk of lead poisoning, 
   The May 2000 Surgeon General's report noted that oral health is inseparable from overall health, and that while a majority of the population has experienced great improvements in oral health, disparities affecting poor children and those who live in underserved areas represent 80 percent of all dental cavities in 20 percent of children. This bill encourages pediatric oral health by supporting community-based research and training to improve the understanding of etiology, pathogenesis, diagnoses, prevention, and treatment of pediatric oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases. 
   Finally, the bill strengthens pediatric research efforts by establishing a Pediatric Research Initiative within the NIH to enhance collaborative efforts, provide increased support for pediatric biomedical research, and ensure that opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations and care for children are realized. 
   I also want to highlight the critical issue of childhood research protections. Included in this bill are provisions to address safety issues in children's research by requiring the Secretary of HHS to review the current federal regulations for the protection of children participating in research, which address such issues as determining acceptable levels of risk and obtaining parental permission, and to report to Congress on how to ensure the highest standards of safety. Also, the provision requires that all HHS-funded and regulated research comply with these additional protections for children. During this year, the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health, which I chair, held two important hearings relating to gene therapy trials and human subject protections. The Subcommittee discovered that there was a lapse of protection for individuals participating as subjects in clinical trial research. Next Congress, I intend to make the further review and updating of human subject protections a major priority of the Subcommittee. 
   Division B of the bill contains provisions which address the scourge upon children of drug abuse. The 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), reported that 10.9 percent of youths age 12-17 currently use illicit drugs. It further estimated that nearly 11.3 percent of 12-17 year-old boys and 10.5 percent of 12-17 year-old girls used drugs in the past month. But just as important is the growth in alcohol abuse among our youth, as SAMHSA reports that 10.4 million current drinkers are younger than the legal drinking age of 21 and that more than 6.8 million engaged in binge drinking. Tragically, all of these numbers among youth substance abuse have risen since 1992. 
   To address the tragedy of drug use by our children, the bill incorporates the ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act,'' which I introduced with Senator KENNEDY last spring and was first passed the Senate on November 3, 1999. 
   The ``Youth Drug'' bill addresses the problem of youth substance abuse by reauthorizing and improving SAMHSA through a renewed focus on youth and adolescent substance abuse and mental health services, in conjunction with greater flexibility and new accountability for States for the use of federal funds. 
   Created in 1992 to assist States in reducing the incidence of substance abuse and mental illness through prevention and treatment programs, SAMHSA provides funds to States for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and activities, as well as mental health services, with its block grants accounting for 40 percent and 15 percent respectively of all substance abuse and community mental health services funding in the States. In my own State of Tennessee, SAMHSA provides more than 70 percent of overall funding for the Tennessee Department of Health's Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services. 
   This bill accomplishes six critical goals: (1) promotes State flexibility by easing outdated or unneeded requirements governing the expenditure of Federal block grants; (2) ensures State accountability by moving away from the present system's inefficiencies to a performance based system; (3) provides substance abuse treatment services and early intervention substance abuse services for children and adolescents; (4) helps local communities treat violent youth and minimize outbreaks of youth violence through partnerships among schools, law enforcement and mental health services; (5) ensures Federal funding for substance abuse or mental health emergencies; and (6) supports and expands programs providing mental health and substance abuse treatment services to homeless individuals. 
   The bill also includes a number of other important provisions, including those to address how to treat individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders the proper and safe use of restraints and seclusions in mental health facilities, and important ``charitable choice'' provision that permits Federal assistance for religious organizations providing substance abuse services. We know that no one approach works for everyone who needs and wants substance abuse treatment and that faith-based programs have strong records of successful rehabilitation. This provision will allow faith-based programs to continue to offer their assistance and expertise. 
   The ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act'' provides Tennessee and other states needed funds for community based programs helping individuals with substance abuse and mental health disorders, dramatically increasing State flexibility and ensuring that each State is able to address its unique needs. The bill provides a much needed focus on the troubling issue of drug use by our youth and helps local communities deal with the issue of children and violence. 
   I would also like to highlight the ``Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999,'' which is sponsored by Senator ASHCROFT and included in this comprehensive bill. This bill address the plague of methamphetamine which has severely impacted Tennessee, other  southern states, the Mid-West, and Rocky Mountain states. Under these provisions, criminal penalties are increased for individuals who manufacture methamphetamine. The provisions also increase funding for law enforcement training and target high intensity methamphetamine trafficking areas. 
   Finally the bill also tackles another devastating drug which has shown signs of increased use in our youth, the drug known as ``Ecstasy.'' In short, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Ecstasy guidelines to provide for increased penalties to reflect the seriousness of the offenses of trafficking in and importing Ecstasy and related drugs. 
   Mr. President, this legislation which has passed the Senate today is a comprehensive, multifaceted attack on the numerous threats to our children's health. I am thankful for all my colleagues for their support and willingness to help the children of this nation. I would especially like to thank Senators JEFFORDS and KENNEDY and Representatives TOM BLILEY, MICHAEL BILIRAKIS, JOHN DINGELL and SHERROD BROWN, and their excellent staffs for all the hard work and dedication which has gone into this bill. I would also like to thank Mr. Bill Baird and Ms. Daphne Edwards, of the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel, for their tireless work and for their great expertise in drafting this comprehensive bill. I would also like to personally thank Mr. Joseph Faha, Director of Legislation and External Affairs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration as well as other member of the Department of Health of Human Services. Finally, I would like to thank my Staff Director, of the Public Health Subcommittees, Anne Phelps and my Health Policy Advisor, Dave Larson. Finally, I would like to thank the may groups advocating on behalf of children and parents and families who have worked so hard to bring this bill to fruition. I look forward to swift action in the House on this measure and it's enactment into law.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on an issue which has been talked about on the floor of the Senate this morning, and that is prescription drugs. 
   We all hear the critical cry--I say ``cry'' because it is almost that--as we talk to seniors across this country who say: We need some help; these drugs cost too much; they are out of our reach; we need help. 
   What is interesting is this is not heard from everybody. It is principally from a group of people who don't have access to affordable prescription drugs, and now we are charged as a body to develop a policy to ensure, to guarantee that coverage and getting it as quickly as we can to those people who need it, who are crying out now. 
   This past year I received over 3,000 letters or e-mails from seniors in Tennessee on this very topic. What did I hear? One elderly couple from Kingsport, TN, wrote:  
   We are requesting that you do not support any big government drug scheme. Government does not do things better than individuals. Please protect seniors' choice of private coverage. One size does not fit all. We do not want the bureaucrats interfering with our doctor-patient prescription drug choices.  
   A widow from Tennessee who had a liver transplant writes:  
   I'm against the big government plan. I have certain medications I must take and want to be able to get whatever medicines I need.  
   These letters speak volumes. They, first of all, point out the importance of health care security for our seniors that prescription drugs do provide but also the importance of having a right to choose what is best for one's individual needs. 
   I mention these letters because I do believe this body should respond as government should, in the broader sense, with a health care proposal, prescription drug plan, that gives affordable access to all seniors, making it a part of health care security. The plans we have heard talked about in the press today are the Bush Medicare plan and the Gore prescription drug plan that have been contrasted on the floor earlier today by a colleague from the other side of the aisle. 
   I want to comment on those. It is useful for this body because, in essence, Governor Bush's proposal looks at two bills on this floor. One is Chairman ROTH's bill, which gives an immediate helping hand to those seniors who need it today, working predominantly through the States; the second component of the Bush proposal is modeled on the same concept as Breaux-Frist, the bipartisan plan that is based on the way we get our health care as Senators today. 
   On the Gore side--and that is why this contrast is useful --is the Clinton-Gore proposal, which is also on this floor in terms of prescription drugs. Although we use Governor Bush and Vice President GORE, they both represent bills that are currently on the floor of the Senate. 
   Looking at Governor Bush's Medicare plan, it has two parts. One is overall modernization, long-term strengthening of the overall Medicare plan, the health care plan for our seniors and individuals with disabilities. The second part offers immediately, right now, the help that seniors are crying out for today. You simply cannot ignore those low-income and middle-income individuals who can't afford the drugs, who really are choosing between putting food on the table and buying those 
   prescription drugs. 
   The two-part plan has its overall goal to strengthen Medicare and to get that prescription drug coverage to all seniors. It is based on this bipartisan plan, this Breaux-Frist type principle. 
   The primary focus of Governor Bush's proposal is a universal prescription drug proposal that includes this comprehensive modernization. It does several things. No. 1, it lets seniors choose. Beneficiaries can stay in traditional Medicare, what they have today, or they can choose a plan such as Senator BILL FRIST or Senator ROTH or President Clinton has, a model called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. Under Governor Bush's proposal and under the Breaux-Frist proposal, all current Medicare benefits are preserved. 
   The real advantage is that seniors for the first time are given a real option to choose among plans that might better be able to meet their individual needs. One plan might have more preventive care. Another plan might have vision care--not in Medicare today. Another plan might have dental care--not in Medicare today. 
   No. 2, Governor Bush's proposal, and the Breaux-Frist proposal in the Senate, provides all seniors some prescription drug coverage access. Yes, there is a 25-percent subsidy of the cost of those premiums for everybody with a 100-percent subsidy for those people under 150 percent of poverty.  
   All seniors under Governor Bush's proposal have a limit, a cap on how much is spent out of pocket, not only for prescription drugs but for all health care--visits to the physician, visits to the hospital, prescription drug coverage. Once your out-of-pocket expenditures get above $6,000, it is covered by the Government 
   Fourth, this proposal is based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. I think that is very important because seniors understand if that care is really good enough for President Clinton or Senator FRIST, health care will be good enough for me. 
   No. 5, Governor Bush has said yes, this is going to take more money. It is going to take about $110 billion in more money. Why? Because that modernization in bringing things up to date, that better coordination of services, is going to require an investment. That is in real contrast to the Clinton-Gore proposal which, when we first heard about it, was going to cost $167 billion; that is when it was introduced last year. Right now, the figure touted by the Gore campaign is $250 billion. The Congressional Budget Office says no, it is not $167, it is not $250 billion, but in truth it is about a $337 billion plan. 
   So, taxpayers, watch out. Seniors, watch out. This plan has already doubled in size, in how much it costs, in the last 12 months, the plan of the Clinton-Gore team. No. 6, and most important, I think, in the short term, is seniors deserve this coverage now, not 2 years from now, not under the Clinton-Gore plan which phases in over another 8 years--actually they don't fully implement it until the year 2010. Our seniors need health care now. 
   I would like to briefly turn at this point to S. 3016 and S. 3017, introduced by Senator ROTH. What this bill says--which complements, supplements, and parallels very much what Governor Bush has said, and Governor Bush did it through his helping hand--since we have a problem now, let's reach out right now and get the money to the neediest people, the low- and moderate-income people who need it right now; not to be phased in later. 
   What this Roth bill does is it makes grants immediately available to those people who need it the most. It will extend prescription drug coverage immediately, recognizing it is a transition program, until we modernize Medicare through the Breaux-Frist or Governor Bush approach. It immediately extends prescription drug coverage to about 85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. 
   It serves as a bridge to overall Medicare modernization, overall reform. 
   This is not the answer. This is the short-term answer to plug that hole that everybody agrees is there, whether Democrat or Republican. That hole is created because true modernization is going to take 12 months or 24 months or 36 months. So let's start that modernization program now, but, in the meantime, let's get help to the people who need it, who are out there making that choice between putting food on the table, buying those groceries, or buying prescription drugs. Let's help them in 6 months, not 10 years from now, not 5 years from now. That is where the Roth bill moves right in. 
   Let me point out that 22 States already have taken action. Remember, all 50 States right now are administering prescription drug programs. That mechanism is there right now. It is not in HCFA, it is not in the Federal Government now, and that is why, under Chairman ROTH's leadership, we can get that aid to the people who need it most. 
   I will talk more about the Clinton-Gore plan later, but let me just close by saying all I said sharply contrasts it. 
   No. 1, the Gore plan forces seniors to wait 10 years before it is fully implemented. It doesn't even start offering any drugs or drug coverage for at least 2 years. 
   No. 2, it doesn't give seniors any choice. They can choose one time, at 64 1/2 years. They choose one time, and that is it. Contrast that with the Breaux-Frist plan or Governor Bush's plan, which allows choice at any point in time. 
   No. 3, the Clinton-Gore plan does nothing to strengthen Medicare. It is a 50-percent copayments for drugs. It does nothing to modernize or strengthen Medicare long term. 
   No. 4, it does nothing to benefit, to improve that underlying benefit package in terms of preventive drugs, preventive care, in terms of vision care, in terms of dental care. The flexibility is simply not there in the Gore plan. 
   I close by saying our debate about the various plans is an exciting one for me. Our goal must be health care security for seniors. Governor Bush and our plans, through Breaux-Frist and the Roth proposal, do just that. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators CONRAD, THOMPSON, BRYAN, and DEWINE this afternoon to introduce the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This bipartisan legislation takes important steps to assure both the quality and availability of outpatient dialysis services for Medicare patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
   Almost 30 years ago, Congress recognized the pain and suffering patients with end-stage renal disease face, and thus moved to provide coverage for dialysis treatment to this population under the Medicare Program. Today, approximately 300,000 patients nationwide live with this disease and receive services through Medicare. Presently, there are 3,423 dialysis facilities throughout the Nation that serve the Medicare population, 93 of which are in my home State of Tennessee. 
   However, I fear that a lack of proper reimbursement may adversely impact the quality and availability of dialysis care for Medicare beneficiaries. As the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) noted, the payment rate for the critical dialysis services received by Medicare beneficiaries was established in 1983, and had never been updated. 
   Last year, Senator CONRAD and I sought to remedy this situation by introducing S. 1449, the Medicare Renal  Dialysis Fair Payment Act of 1999, which provided an update to the Medicare reimbursement rate for dialysis services for Fiscal Year 2000. Thus, I was pleased to see the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) include a provision increasing the payment rate by 1.2 percent for Fiscal Year 2000 and 1.2 percent for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   However, the BBRA represented only the first step toward securing access to dialysis services for Medicare patients and ensuring they receive the highest quality of care. The legislation we are introducing today takes the necessary additional steps, as recommended by MedPAC this year, to assure proper reimbursement levels for dialysis services. 
   Specifically, the ``Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000'' provides a 1.2 percent increase in the payment rate for FY 2001, in addition to the 1.2 percent update included in the BBRA, providing a 2.4 percent total increase. This follows MedPAC's analysis of dialysis center costs that concluded that prices paid by dialysis centers would rise by 2.4 percent between Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001. 
   Second, the legislation ensure proper reimbursement in future years by requiring the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to develop a market basket index for dialysis centers that measures input prices and other relevant factors and to annually review and update the payment rate based upon this index. 
   Overall, the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000 will ensure that dialysis facilities receive the proper Medicare reimbursement to continue to provide high quality dialysis services to the ESRD population. 
   I am grateful to the National Kidney Foundation, the American Nephrology Nurses Association, the Renal Physicians Association, the National Renal Administrators Association, and the Renal Leadership Council for their support of the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical measure.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to very briefly continue a discussion that was held earlier on the floor today addressing an issue that means not only a great deal to me but also to about 35 million seniors in this country as well as 5 million individuals with disabilities. That is the issue of Medicare. 
   Our obligation, I believe, is to modernize Medicare and give those seniors and those individuals with disabilities what they deserve; that is, health care security as we know it is or should be in the year 2000, not the sort of health care security that was appropriate for 1956, back when Medicare began. 
   The challenge before us today as a body and the challenge before the American people is really pretty clear; that is, how to best implement a real plan for real people, those seniors and those individuals with disabilities--not just a piece of legislation but a real plan that will modernize Medicare in a way that will give them real health care security. 
   A lot of individuals with disabilities and a lot of seniors out there don't really realize how antiquated and out of date the current Medicare system is. I would like to make several points. 
   First of all, I believe modernization of Medicare today where it can truly offer health care security is really a moral obligation that we have to our seniors. 
   Second, under the leadership of Clinton/Gore, we have had really 8 years where a lot of opportunities have been squandered, and they simply have not led, if we look at this field of Medicare modernization. 
   Third, we have to ask ourselves in terms of how best to modernize. If we have an old jalopy that still is 
   running along and still gets us from point to point, do we just want to put new gas in that car--we know it is going to eventually fail--or do we want to go ahead and modernize that car so that it will still get us from point to point but it will do so more efficiently and effectively in a way that will give us security and not just get us there but get us there with the very best quality? 
   First of all, modernization of health care is a moral obligation. Why do I say that? 
   If we look back to 1965 when Medicare began, Medicare was constructed to give health care security--inpatient care and some outpatient care--in a very effective way. For acute-care models, if you had a heart attack, you were taken care of essentially in the hospital. Prescription drugs were important but not nearly so important as they are today. We simply didn't know very much about preventive medicine in 1965 and 1970. But all of that has changed. Now we know prescription drugs are critically important to health care security. We know issues such as preventive health care can not only save money but, most importantly, improve the quality of life--not just longer lives but a higher quality of life. 
   The sad thing is that people don't know Medicare today has very little preventive care in it. I talk to seniors all over the State of Tennessee in town meeting after town meeting. I say it has a little preventive care. They say: We didn't know that. When I talk about prescription drugs, it is surprising to many people today; not only seniors but others do not know that Medicare does not include prescription drugs. 
   I ask an audience of seniors or individuals with disabilities: How much do you think the Federal Government is helping you with your health care in terms of costs? If you are paying several thousand dollars a year for your health care, how much does the Government actually pay? They say 80 percent, initially, or they say 70 percent, or 60 percent. But in truth, on average, for seniors' health care costs, only about 53 cents on the dollar is paid for by the money they have paid in--by the Government and by the taxpayer. They are responsible and end up paying about 47 cents on the dollar in spite of the fact they paid into this Medicare trust fund over their lives. 
   Thus, I think we have a moral obligation if we are committed to health care security and to modernization of a system that we know will be modern, that will include preventive care and prescription drugs. 
   That leads me to the second point. If that is the case and the facts--and it is--where has our leadership been? Where has Vice President GORE been? Where has President Clinton been? They squandered an opportunity over the 6 years I have been in this body, and over the last 8 years, to modernize that system; that is, that Medicare is built on a 1965 model, 35 years ago. It is outdated; it is antiquated; it is a car that is still moving and getting the care but not nearly as efficiently or as comprehensively as our seniors deserve. 
   The squandering of the opportunity is a pretty tough term to use, saying that our leadership, through President Clinton and Vice President GORE, squandered this opportunity. Run down the list. We had a National Bipartisan Medicare Commission that I had the opportunity to serve on with JOHN BREAUX, a Democrat, BILL FRIST, Republican. We were pretty evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. We had the private sector and public sector involved. In essence, the administration, under President Clinton and Vice President GORE, walked away from the Commission's recommendations that were built on over 40 open hearings with access to the very best experts in the United States of America. At the last minute, they walked away from the proposals which had bipartisan support. A majority of the Members supported it. An opportunity squandered. The purpose of that Commission was to modernize Medicare, to bring it up to date, to give our seniors the health care they deserve. 
   As to the Balanced Budget Act of 2 years ago, the Budget Committee in this body, the U.S. Congress, said: Yes, we need to slow Medicare down, make it fiscally responsible, make sure it is around 20 and 30 years from now. The way it was implemented under President Clinton and Vice President GORE, $37 billion less than we budgeted was spent--$37 billion less. 
   What has that resulted in? It has resulted in facilities closing down, over 200 hospitals--some urban hospitals serving the poor, some rural hospitals in Tennessee, and around the country--have closed. 
   As many as 20 percent of all Medicare-providing nursing homes are either at risk for bankruptcy or already have gone bankrupt because of this excessive cut in spending--not intended by the U.S. Congress--carried out by this administration. 
   We hear today there are hundreds of thousands of seniors who are losing access today to prescription drug coverage because they were in a plan called Medicare+Choice plans. Why are they leaving? Why are the plans not able to stay in business today? Because this administration, through the bureaucratic administrative load burden that sits on the shoulders of these plans--when placing the burden on the plans, it falls down to the doctors. Basically, they cannot participate any longer. Those are plans that are giving prescription drugs, making them available. Another squandered opportunity by this administration. 
   On top of all of that, we had this demographic shift because of the baby boom that we talk about. Yet because of a lack of leadership at the Presidential level and the Vice Presidential level, we squandered another opportunity. The demographic shift is the following: Over the next 30 years, the number of seniors will double compared to what it is today. The number of people paying into this trust fund  will continue to go down. That demographic shift results in catastrophe if we don't make the system more efficient. 
   Modernization is a moral obligation, No. 1. 
   No. 2, our leadership in the executive branch has squandered the opportunity over the last 8 years to do something about it. 
   No. 3--and this is the fundamental question--do we want new gas poured into an old car, an old jalopy percolating along, or do we want to have a modern car that can operate efficiently, in a way that guarantees that health care security, that would have different options, and the option might be preventive health care; it might be prescription drug coverage. 
   That is what we are faced with today. That is what we talked about a little bit on the floor today, and that is what the Presidential election is all about. 
   With a little more gas, a broken down jalopy is going to fail. Everybody agrees because of the demographic shift there is no way to continue. 
   We have the various options out there that we know our seniors deserve, thus the moral obligations that our individuals with disabilities deserve. 
   Having blocked fundamental reform on this jalopy out there, Vice President GORE and President Clinton now, in terms of prescription drugs, simply want to take off benefits and add them on to the system, without changing the system whatever. Using the old bureaucracy, the old broken down car, the Gore plan wants to take 8 years to pour the gas into that car. It will take 8 years before that prescription drug plan that the Vice President wants to add on to this antiquated, out-of-date Medicare system, to be fully implemented. Or do we want the new car, want Medicare modernized to include prescription drug coverage, to include a modern choice of plans. 
   I think we have a unique opportunity. Today, workers really can say, under a modern program, that every senior will be able to keep exactly the same benefits they have today. Under a modern program, every senior will be offered a choice of benefits that includes prescription drugs for the first time, that will include preventive care for the first time, and that every senior will be covered for catastrophic Medicare costs. 
   I do urge my colleagues in this body and all Americans to recognize and to call for real health care security, a real plan for real people.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, the description is very accurate. When I say that opportunities have been squandered, I put that first  and foremost because it very much demonstrates the bipartisanship, working together, not having roadblock after roadblock after roadblock placed in front of good ideas; working together. That serves real people, those seniors who are out there today. 
   Let me close and say the one other thing the leader mentioned, which is critically important--there can be all sorts of solutions proposed, whether for prescription drugs or to save Medicare long term. The one answer that was clear after a year of work on this bipartisan Medicare commission, one idea that repeatedly came forward from the experts all over the United States of America, and even people coming in from other countries, was that a one-size-fits-all system, dictated by Washington, DC, the beltway mentality, is the one thing that will be destructive to me delivering health care; whether it is BILL FRIST as a heart transplant surgeon or my father who practiced for 55 years, initially down in Mississippi and then back up in Tennessee. The one thing that will destroy quality is one-size-fits-all, which inevitably results in price controls, which destroy creativity, research, innovation, the hope for cures for Alzheimer's, for stroke, for heart disease. 
   One last component. There are things we can do now, now in the next 6 months, on prescription drugs. We don't have to wait forever. We don't have to wait for 8 years to have a program. The Gore proposal or Clinton proposal takes 8 years to phase in. We can act now and get prescription drugs to the people who need it most within 6 months, 8 months, or 9 months.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Millennium National Commission on Space Act. 
   The year 1999 proved to be very difficult for NASA. The Commerce Committee reviewed reports on such incidents as: 
   Workers searching for misplaced Space Station tanks in a landfill; 
   Loose pins in the Shuttle's main engine; 
   Failure to make English-metric conversions causing the failure of a $125 million mission to Mars; 
   Two-time use of ``rejected'' seals on Shuttle's turbopumps; 
   $1 billion of cost overruns on the prime contract for the Space Station with calls from the Inspector General at NASA for improvement in the agency's oversight; 
   Workers damaging the main antennae on the Shuttle for communication between mission control and the orbiting Shuttle; 
   Urgent repair mission to the Hubble telescope; 
   Approximately $1 billion invested in an experimental vehicle and currently no firm plans for its first flight, if it flies at all; and 
   The lack of long-term planning for the Space Station, an issue on which the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee has repeatedly questioned NASA. 
   It is the last of these items, the lack of long-term planning for the Space Station and the lack of long-term planning of NASA and the civilian space program, that is of a concern to me. I feel that the civilian space program is in need of some guidance. Just as the space policy of the 1980's had changed since the creation of NASA in 1958, the space policy of the New Millennium needs to change from the 1980's. 
   Space has become more commercialized. Today, the private sector conducts more space launches than the government. There are many more companies developing plans to implement other new and innovative commercial ventures. 
   I feel that the long term civilian space goals and objectives of the nation are in need of some major revisions. As I mentioned earlier, today's environment has changed drastically since the last commission of this type was assembled. 
   This bill proposes a Presidential Commission to address these points. The commission will do the ``homework'' that will form the basis for a revised civilian space program. The civilian space industry has proven to be a valuable national asset over the years. The goal of this bill will be to ensure that the U.S. maintains its preeminence in space. 
   This commission will consist of 15 Members appointed by the President based upon the recommendations of Congressional leadership. My hope is that today's new environment will be reflected in the make-up of the commission's members. For that reason, the bill sets limits on how many members shall be from the government and how many should serve on their first federal commission. Ex-officio members of the commission are also specified in the bill. Advisory members from the Senate and the House of Representatives are to be appointed to the commission by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   The final report of the commission is to identify the long range goals, opportunities, and policy options for the U.S. civilian space activity for the next 20 years. 
   As Chairman of the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, I will continue our oversight responsibilities at NASA. I look forward to working with other Members of this body to further perfect this bill. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to introduce this legislation which addresses these very important issues for the space community.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a bipartisan group of members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have today sent to the Senate for consideration a landmark legislative initiative to combat one of the great human tragedies of our time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 reflects the combination of many initiatives proposed by members of the Foreign Relations Committee. All initiatives share a common purpose of arresting the progress of the disaster and caring for the victims so far. 
   The initiative cannot come too soon. The cost in human life and productivity, as well as the potential societal and economic disruptions AID has and will cause assure us of one distinct possibility: All goals of the United States in Africa and the developing world--goals we share with them--will be seriously compromised, if not completely undermined, by AIDS. Growing trade, better education and health, stronger democracies, efforts toward peace--all will be undermined by a disease that is positioned to sap the life from the most promising and productive generations. 
   Two characteristics of this pandemic that distinguish it from the other great killers have impressed me the most and shaped the Senate's recent initiative to support the efforts to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide. 
   The first is the fact that AIDS affects the younger members of a community in their most productive years. It thus contorts and eventually turns on its head the already strained economic equation by effectively reversing the proposition of dependants to productive members of a family. In short, it has struck at the heart of the extended families, changing the breadwinners from a source of needed food or income to a burden. That is to say nothing of the grief, personal loss and often shame associated with death from AIDS.  
   The second is that the estimated number of orphans from AIDS in Africa, for example, already exceeds 10 million, and is expected to approach 40 million in coming years. Many of those children will themselves be HIV-positive. The prospect of 40 million children without hope, health and often without any support whatsoever is as dangerous as it is tragic. These children are susceptible to substance abuse, prostitution, banditry or, as we have seen so often on the continent, child soldiery. It will be an economic strain on weakening or completely broken economies, and an extremely volatile element in strained societies. 
   The human cost of AIDS is already alarmingly high, and the trends are increasingly terrifying--even apocalyptic. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. It is our greatest challenge. I have seen the effects of its ravages on the people of that continent firsthand. The potential is clearly written in the appalling statistics of the disease today. 
   According to December 1999 United Nations data, some 23.3 million adults and children are 
   infected with the HIV virus in the region, which has about 10 percent of the world's population but nearly 70 percent of the worldwide total of infected people. In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwean estimated 20 percent to 26 percent of adults are infected with HIV, and 13 percent of adults in South Africa were infected as the end of 1997. 
   An estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS, including 2.2 million who died in 1998. The overall rate of infection among adults in sub-Saharan Africa is about 8 percent compared with a 1.1 percent infection rate worldwide. 
   AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, and it kills many times more people than Africa's armed conflicts. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men. According to UNAIDS, women make up an estimated 55 percent of the HIV-positive adult population in sub-Saharan Africa, as compared with 35 percent in the Caribbean, the next highest-ranking region, and 20 percent in North America. Young women are particularly at risk. A U.N. study found girls aged 15-19 to be infected at a rate of 15 percent to 23 percent, while infection rates among boys of the same age were 3 percent to 4 percent. 
   The African AIDS epidemic is having a much greater impact on children than is the case in other parts of the world. An estimated 600,000 African infants become infected with HIV each year through mother to child transmission, either at birth or through breast-feeding. 
   At least 7.8 million African children have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS, and thus are regarded by UNAIDS as ``AIDS orphans.'' South Africa is expected to have one million AIDS orphans by 2004. An estimated 10 million or more African children will have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS by the end of the year 2000. In some urban areas of Africa, orphans comprise up to 15 percent of all children. Many of these children are themselves infected with HIV/AIDS and often face rejection from their extended families and from their communities. 
   In its January 17, 2000 issue. Newsweek projected that there will be 10.4 million African AIDS orphans by the end of 2000. UNAIDS reports that AIDS orphans, suspected of carrying the disease, generally run a greater risk of being malnourished and of being denied an education. 
   At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the National Intelligence Council estimates that the number of AIDS orphans worldwide will increase dramatically, potentially increasing three-fold or more in the next ten years, contributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in already volatile and strained societies. Children without care or hope are often drawn into prostitution, crime, substance abuse or child soldiery. 
   The majority of governments in areas of sub-Saharan Africa facing the greatest burden of AIDS orphans are largely ill-prepared to adequately address the rapid growth in the number of children who have no means of support, no education nor access to other opportunities. 
   Donors must focus on adequate preparations for the explosion in the number of orphans and the 
   burden they will place on families, communities, economies, and governments. Support structures and incentives for families, communities and institutions which will provide care for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, or for the children who are themselves infected by HIV/AIDS, will become increasingly important as the number of AIDS orphans increases dramatically. 
   By providing a knowledge, skills, and hope orphaned children might not otherwise have, education is an especially critical part of a long term strategy. Education is the key to providing opportunity and fighting poverty, and education is essential to winning the battle against the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
   The legislation does not focus solely on Africa, but reflects the fact that the grip of the disease is tightening around the developing world. Some of the mechanisms are new and yet untested. But in their design, their potential for being the most effective tools at our disposal is clear. 
   We need to be mindful that the United States can be a great force for good in the world. Certainly, Americans are very charitable and compassionate people, and the political will exists to take a more aggressive posture toward combating AIDS. 
   However, our job is to determine how best to use our limited resources to maximize their potential for good on the African continent. These are life and death decisions which cannot be addressed simply by allocating more funds, confident that we have thus done our part. How we direct or allocate those resources has the potential to significantly affect the situation. 
   Questions and issues involved in life and death decisions are not easy. They are decisions based on the understanding that you cannot help or save all in need in a situation, but must make decisions based on the best information and understanding of your strengths and limitations. 
   Over the next two years, the legislation authorizes $300 million per year for ongoing HIV/AIDS programs worldwide. That represents a significant increase in our commitment and is well above the President's request. The United States has been a leader in AIDS prevention programs and in AIDS treatment and programs to mitigate the devastating societal and economic effects of the epidemic. We should continue that leadership and even strengthen it. 
   Additionally, the legislation authorizes $100 million to the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative, know by its acronym, GAVI, which receives both public and private funding to provide existing vaccines to children worldwide, and to provide incentives for the development of new vaccines. Often, companies determine that it is not possible to commit the capital to research and development toward developing vaccines for diseases such as malaria. While the potential number of recipients is great, the potential number of purchasers is very small. By providing a clear purchaser for the future, GAVI addresses much of the questions involving the risks of investing in such research. 
   The legislation goes beyond incentives alone. Over two years, it commits $20 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, or IAVI, a group which is committed to developing the ultimate weapon against the continued spread of HIV: a vaccine. 
   The legislation does not seek to act unilaterally, but has two critical elements which will help use our leadership position to leverage greater cooperation to combat the epidemic. 
   First, it seeks to establish a global trust for programs to combat the transmission of HIV and to respond to the devastation of AIDS. Under the legislation, the United States can contribute up to $150 million per year for two years to capitalize the fund. Of that, $50 million annually is specifically targeted to address the great human tragedy and most daunting challenge of AIDS orphans. Undoubtedly, the initial generous contribution of the United States will spur many more commitments from other nations. 
   The legislation does not leave the question of orphans to the trust fund alone. It also directs the United States  to begin coordinating a global strategy to address the orphans crisis, especially in caring for them and educating them. This is in addition to the specific focus on education and care of orphans in Africa mandated in the initial authorization of ongoing programs and in the trust fund. Only education can provide the tools for these children to escape the poverty, violence and exploitation that they will often face. The strong emphasis on this explosive and frightening problem is one of the most forward looking approaches to international health yet considered by Congress. I cannot overemphasize the importance of these provisions. 
   The legislation also addresses the increasing threat of tuberculosis worldwide. The diseases' resurgence is a clear and direct threat to the United States' public health. Astonishingly, the World Health Organization estimates that one third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. With the increasingly drug resistant strains of the disease emerging yearly, the urgency of the initiative is critical. The legislation authorizes $60 million each year for two years for programs to combat the disease. That figure represents a substantial increase in our efforts to ensure our own safety and health and to combat the scourge worldwide. 
   Overall, this legislation represents a clear recognition of the importance to our own health and security to combating infectious disease worldwide. More significantly, though, it is a monumental new commitment by the United States to combat the death and suffering of our fellow humans. It is a great demonstration of America's generosity and our hope to improve the lives and potential of all people.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the American Revolution drew to a close in 1782, a Philadelphian turned to his friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush, and remarked, ``It looks as if the battle for independence has been won.'' 
   Dr. Rush replied, ``Sir, you are mistaken. The Revolutionary War may be over, but the battle of independence has just begun.'' 
   On the day before he died, as I had the opportunity to spend time with PAUL COVERDELL and his family, I thought about these words, and they have stayed in my mind over the last 48 hours because that idea--that only constant vigilance can keep the flame of freedom from being extinguished--is one that perhaps no one believed in more, at least since I have been in the Senate, or acted upon more decisively than PAUL COVERDELL. With his passing, America has lost one of its most principled leaders and freedom, one of its staunchest friends. 
   There will be a number of comments made today by people who have known Paul well, who have observed his commitment, his discipline, and his willingness to do jobs that most people leave to others, jobs he did in a way that was humble, gentle, and gave others the credit. We will hear again and again today because they were the hallmark of PAUL COVERDELL's work in this wonderful institution called the Senate. 
   As a Senator from the neighboring State of Tennessee, I had the opportunity to work side by side with PAUL COVERDELL as we addressed issues important to both our States. But if there is one idea, one word, that best summarizes PAUL COVERDELL, his commitment to public service, to family and community, the word is ``freedom.'' PAUL COVERDELL was a relentless, tireless champion of freedom. 
   I first met PAUL 6 years ago when I was still BILL FRIST, the physician who wanted to be a United States Senator. PAUL sat down, and talked to me about freedom. He came to help me with a campaign event in Chattanooga, TN, and his whole talk--while saying, ``Yes, people, come out and support this new guy on the block, BILL FRIST''--was about freedom. 
   And since I have been in the Senate, he continually fought for freedom. He fought for the rights of individuals to raise, educate and provide for their families free of government intervention and excessive taxation. He fought to protect the privacy of individual tax returns. He fought to free local education from too much federal control. Believing freedom to be under genuine attack from the corrupting influence of drugs, he fought to increase funding for law enforcement, especially along our borders, and created a program to coordinate resistance to drugs among parents, teachers and communities that became a model for the nation. Understanding, as Jefferson did, that a well-educated citizenry is the surest foundation for freedom and happiness, PAUL COVERDELL fought to ensure that all children, regardless of income, receive the very best education from kindergarten to college. 
   Perhaps it was his service with the U.S. Army in Okinawa that fanned the flames of freedom that never seemed to diminish in his heart. Perhaps it was his parents' ability--and I got to know his mom over the last 48 hours--to turn a small family business into a successful nationwide enterprise that strengthened his belief in the power of the individual to achieve the American Dream. Perhaps it was his experience with emerging democracies as President Bush's Director of the Peace Corp that deepened his resolve to ensure that freedom, once planted, has everything it needs to survive. President Bush and I spoke about that shortly after PAUL was admitted to the hospital. Or perhaps it was his beloved wife, Nancy, who is going through such a difficult time right now, who helped him realize that love and freedom are the great gifts God has planted in the human heart, and so we must do all we can to preserve them. 
   Whatever the reasons, PAUL COVERDELL believed in freedom, and he believed in America--the greatest expression of freedom next to man himself. He fought for both America and freedom because he understood, as Justice Brandeis once wrote, that ``liberty is the secret of happiness, and courage, the secret of liberty.'' 
   Over the past few years, I had the honor and the privilege of seeing PAUL COVERDELL's courage up close--in the Senate Republican Working Group on Medicare, where his commitment to our seniors was very apparent; in the Foreign Relations Committee, where he specialized in areas of the world not addressed by others; a commitment that obviously grew out of his work with the Peace Corps; in Republican strategy sessions, where his expert guidance helped us ensure that the American people, as well as our colleagues, understood the importance of the issues before us. It was a quiet courage, characterized not by bluster, but by humility and respect for others.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the underlying amendment to allow reimportation of prescription drugs. I have been following the debate for the last couple of hours. I want to bring up a new issue, an issue which I believe is a fundamental issue but which has not been discussed, to the best of my knowledge, at all over the last 2 hours--and that is safety. 
   The problem has been very clearly identified; and that is, cost. The situation of prescription drugs costing too much in this country, causing people to drive to Mexico and Canada, is a real problem. It has been vividly described. It has been described accurately by almost everybody who has talked today, holding up the bottles and the descriptions on the charts. Today a senior who goes into a drugstore must pay full retail price for a drug because Medicare does not include prescription drug coverage, versus traveling on a bus to Canada, and buying it there for much less. 
   The answer--and this is absolutely critical--is not reimportation. The answer is not, to my mind, price controls. Price controls get cloaked in all sorts of ways in policy and in various proposals. But the answer is, I believe, not in the amendment we are talking about today but through improved access by offering coverage and utilizing the large purchasing power to provide affordable prescription drugs. 
   The issue that most bothers me is that fundamentally I believe the underlying amendment puts at risk the safety of these drugs. I say ``puts at risk'' because clearly the authors of this bill  have tried to construct a bill that has safety first and foremost. But let me just say, having read the bill and having a pretty good understanding of the capability of the Food and Drug Administration today, they simply cannot police the world in making absolutely sure these are not counterfeit drugs coming back in and because of this, I find it very hard to support the underlying bill. 
   If you take a look at the history of reimportation, from 1985 to 1987 in the U.S. Congress, there were a series of nine hearings and three investigative reports regarding this whole concept of reimportation of pharmaceuticals. It is interesting, if you go back and look at what happened and also at what the findings were. As a result of these hearings and investigations, in 1987 the Prescription Drug Marketing Act passed. It was designed to specifically protect Americans' health and safety against the risk of adulterated or counterfeit drugs from being imported into the U.S. Let me quote one of the conclusions from the committee report:  
   Reimported pharmaceuticals threaten the American public health in two ways. First, foreign counterfeits, falsely described as reimported U.S.-produced drugs, have entered the distribution system. 
   Second, proper storage and handling of legitimate pharmaceuticals cannot be guaranteed by U.S. law once the drugs have left the boundaries of the United States.  
   I believe, we are obligated to go back and address these two critical concerns, because we are talking about the potential for counterfeit or adulterated drugs. We are talking about life-or-death issues. We are talking about the ability to thin one's blood to prevent a heart attack or a stroke, and if that drug has been altered, if it is counterfeit, it means life or death to the people who are listening to me today. 
   What they have tried to fashion in this bill is to have the Food and Drug Administration oversee and be responsible for these laboratories which are not in the United States of America. Remember, this is a Food and Drug Administration that, right now, admits they are unable to even inspect the food coming into this country. I argue, whether it is tomatoes or lettuce coming in, the inspection of drugs coming in is much more important to the health 
   of Americans. It is partly because I am a physician, so I deal with patients and I know for the most part patients believe it is much more important as well. 
   Is the Food and Drug Administration equipped? If you ask the people who have run the FDA you will find the following. Dr. David Kessler, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, in a letter to Representative DINGELL this past year, stated the following when we talk about reimportation. I quote Dr. David Kessler:  
   In my view, the dangers of allowing re-importation of prescription drugs may be even greater today than they were in 1986. For example, with the rise of Internet pharmacies, the opportunities of illicit distribution of adulterated and counterfeit products have grown well beyond those available in prior years. Repealing the prohibition on re-importation of drugs would remove one of the principal statutory tools for dealing with this growing issue.  
   We know the cost of prescription drugs is a problem. But ultimately you don't want to do anything that jeopardizes the safety of these drugs and ultimately the health and welfare of patients. 
   Let's turn to Dr. Jane Henney, who is the current Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. In front of the Senate appropriations committee March 7 of this year, she said, in expressing severe reservations regarding the importation of drugs:  
   The trackability of a drug is more than in question. Where did the bulk product come from? How is it manufactured? You're just putting yourself at increased risk when you don't know all of these things. 
   Her words--``increased risk.'' 
   It is the risk of this legislation that bothers me in terms of safety for our seniors. The question is whether the FDA is equipped to implement the safety precautions necessary? Right now we are hearing from the leaders they cannot be responsible for the safety and efficacy of reimported pharmaceuticals. Let me point out what is going on today in terms of how effective their inspections are. 
   Of the 6,030 foreign manufacturers shipping bulk drugs to the United States since 1988, approximately 4,600 were never inspected. When we see people holding up these two bottles and one bottle was reimported from overseas and you are depending on the FDA--which clearly does not have the capability to guarantee the safety of these pills--and then you put that pill in your mouth, I believe, based on at least the leaders at the Food and Drug Administration today and in the past, that pill could very well be unsafe and not only cause severe illness, but even death. 
   I mentioned the food issue, but as you recall, the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for overseeing the safety of food in this country. In our hearing at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee last month, some said: We can safely import lettuce from other countries, so why can't we do the same for medicines? 
   The analogy of lettuce versus medicine is, as a physician, very hard for me. Last year, I joined Senator COLLINS in introducing the Imported Food Safety Improvement Act because of all of the outbreaks of illness associated with imported food products. 
   We introduced the food safety bill predominantly because of the FDA's own admission--just like I believe the FDA is admitting today in terms of reimportation of drugs--that they cannot insure the complete safety of food coming into this country. If we cannot insure the safety of food coming into this country, as a physician, as someone who has that doctor-patient relationship, who has taken an oath of doing no harm--I cannot promise my patients that the prescription medicines they may be taking are guaranteed to be safe and effective, especially when I have the leadership of the FDA telling me they are ill-equipped and cannot guarantee the drugs have not been altered. 
   Again, the authors of this legislation basically said it is going to be safe because the FDA can do it. I will take it one step forward and say based on current evidence, I do not believe the FDA can do it. 
   Former Carter FDA Commissioner Dr. Jere Goyan said it best:  
   I respect the motivation of the members of Congress who support this legislation. They are reading, as am I, stories about the high prescription drug prices and people which are unable to pay for the drugs they need. But the solution to this problem lies in better insurance coverage for people who need prescription drugs, not in threatening the quality of medicines for us all.  
   The underlying amendment, although well-intended, is inadequate in assuring the safety of potential recipients, beneficiaries, and patients who receive pharmaceuticals that have been reimported. Therefore, I will not vote to repeal the important consumer safety legislation that we put in place over 10 years ago without much further investigation to answer that critical question of safety. 
   Medicines today are affordable when there is coverage for them. I believe we have to do something to help those unfortunate seniors across the country who do not have good prescription drug coverage today. 
   Senator BREAUX and I have worked aggressively to develop a bipartisan prescription drug coverage plan and have introduced such a plan. 
   This plan is above politics and it is above partisanship. It is time to take the very best minds, the very best doctors, the very best health care experts, and elected representatives and 
   bring them together to deal with these challenges facing Medicare in offering affordable prescription drug coverage. 
   The Breaux-Frist 2000 plan, known as the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000, takes the necessary first steps to provide universal outpatient prescription drug coverage and strengthen and improve the Medicare program overall. First, it restructures the 1965 model of Medicare by establishing a competitive Medicare agency to oversee competition under Medicare+Choice and the addition of a new drug benefit. 
   It establishes voluntary universal outpatient prescription drug coverage which I believe is the answer to the cost issue. 
   It provides comprehensive prescription drug benefits. 
   It guarantees catastrophic protections so a senior is protected from paying high drug costs out of their own pocket beyond $6,000.  
   It guarantees price discounts off prescription drugs so seniors never pay retail prices for prescription medicines again. 
   It guarantees affordable drug coverage by offering all beneficiaries a 25-percent subsidy off their premiums. 
   It protects low-income beneficiaries by providing beneficiaries with incomes below 150 percent of poverty subsidies for premiums and copayments for prescription drug benefits. 
   Finally, it improves benefits and health care delivery under Medicare by stabilizing the Medicare+Choice program and introducing much needed reforms. 
   The Breaux-Frist 2000 bill addresses the cost issue. Reimportation of drugs does not. I urge my colleagues, for the safety of health care and health care delivery today, to defeat the underlying amendment on reimportation of drugs. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, since the end of the Second World War, the United States has provided billions of dollars in development assistance worldwide--foreign aid. The goal of that aid has been to bring recipient countries out of poverty. 
   That is an admirable goal, but in those 40 years, aid has failed to even come close to meeting it. 
   The most telling regional example is sub-Saharan Africa, home to the greatest number of aid recipients. The countries of the region have received over $200 billion in aid from donors since 1980 and $27 billion from the United States alone in the past 40 years. 
   As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the average of current aid recipient countries in the region far exceeds that of the beneficiaries under the Marshall Plan--the intellectual basis for modern development aid programs and a resounding success for recipients and donors alike. Those percentages are 13.2 percent to 2.5 percent, respectively. 
   Yet almost every country in Africa that has received aid--some of them since the early 1960s--are no better off now than when they began an aid program. Some are considerably worse off than at any time since their independence. Clearly, no positive link exists between foreign aid--even massive amounts of foreign aid--and bringing recipient countries out of poverty and off dependence on foreign donations. 
   We must come to the uncomfortable but obvious conclusion that, although very well intentioned in most cases, aid has neither ended poverty on a reasonable scale nor has it supported our policy goals. 
   But why such a difference in results? 
   The World Bank itself has concluded that development aid can be effective only in an environment of sound economic policies and good economic management. Economic freedoms, rule of law, and governmental and regulatory transparency are essential elements in providing an environment in which aid can reasonably be expected to promote economic growth. 
   While many internal and external factors contribute to poverty and quality of life for the people in recipient countries, the governments of those recipient countries determine the degree of economic freedom, economic management, and regulatory and transparency which dictate whether development assistance can reasonably be expected to help promote sustained economic growth. 
   Foreign assistance can improve the lives of individual recipients and institutions to which it is directly applied, unless it brings about necessary changes in the bigger picture, the economy and welfare of the recipients will not change on a nationwide scale to any meaningful degree. 
   Recipient countries which do not provide economic freedom, sound management, and regulatory transparency do not provide an environment where development assistance can be expected to eliminate poverty and promote economic growth. In some cases, it can even constitute a ``moral hazard,'' where it weakens pressures for necessary changes by supporting institutions or governments that should otherwise be allowed to collapse and clear the way for real reform. 
   Thus, the provision of development assistance into unreceptive environments does not promote United States' interests nor the people of recipient countries' welfare. Those efforts and funding would thus be more effectively committed elsewhere, or to programs which, over time, will help the intended beneficiaries (the citizens of the countries) change their governments and other factors that contribute to the perpetuation of poverty and support American goals of democracy, economic development and peaceful coexistence. 
   Congress must be frank and recognize that well-intentioned aid has not worked, and that special interests and those who depend on aid programs for contracts and employment are a great barrier to necessary change. 
   In recognition of the fact that foreign development aid has not reduced poverty and has not made reasonable progress toward America's goals overseas, I will today introduce legislation which aims to end our spending on programs which, over 40 years, have achieved too little. 
   The legislation directs the Secretary of State to establish an index of recipient countries which evaluates their degree of economic freedom. The index will be based on trade policy, including the level of tariffs and other barriers to foreign goods and services as well as the extent of corruption in their customs service; taxation policy, including individual and corporate earnings tax rates; the degree of government intervention in the economy; the country's monetary policy; the degree to which the recipient country allows foreign investment, including foreign ownership of business, land, etc., and the extent to which it allows the investor to use the earnings outside the country; the recipient country's banking policies; whether the country has price controls; the degree of property rights and rule of law and whether the government retains ``rights'' to seize property without just cause and due process; the regulatory environment and whether it is just and truly designed to protect consumers, the environment, and economic freedom; and the state of the black market and the response by the recipient government. 
   The index will rate economic freedom for each country and sets a timetable to phase out or terminate accordingly to governments who do not provide a free environment for economic development. It is constructed to provide incentives for reform and ends support for the undemocratic and predatory governments which often benefit from our assistance. 
   In addition, Mr. President, the Secretary will also have to provide a description of the total amount of assistance the country receives from all foreign sources; the total revenues from all sources; the total of its own revenues each recipient government spends on eliminating poverty; and the total they spend on military expenditures and whether a legitimate security threat warrants them. From this and the index, Congress will be able to clearly judge the viability of countries as recipients and the degree to which the recipients share our priorities in combating poverty. 
   This legislation will allow for a degree of honesty about heavily defended aid programs. It will allow Americans to use those resources for other national priorities we know to be effective, or to simply relieve the burden on taxpayers overall. It will set the stage for testing new strategies to combat  poverty and pursue American interests across the globe. After 40 years, it's an idea whose time has come.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, DODD, DEWINE, REED, MURRAY, BOND, HATCH, GORTON, ABRAHAM, and DURBIN to introduce the Children's Public Health Act of 2000. 
   This bill is the result of months of close collaboration begun last fall between members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and in discussion with Congressmen BLILEY and BILIRAKIS to begin an effort to address children's health issues this Congress. 
   I am pleased that the House has already passed a companion bill to the one which we introduce today, and I look forward to working with the House to ensure that we enact this needed bill by the end of the year. 
   The Children's Public Health Act of 2000 has four overriding themes represented in its four titles: Injury Prevention, Maternal and Infant Health, Pediatric Health Promotion, and Pediatric Research. I view these four themes as critical to ensuring that we are able to promote the health of our Nation's children. 
   In the first title we address the critical problem of unintentional injuries. According to the CDC, unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for every age group between 1 and 19 years of age. Unintentional injuries comprise 26 deaths per 100,000 children aged 1-14 and 62 deaths per 100,000 children aged 15-19. In addition, more than 1,500,000 children in the United States sustain a brain injury each year. To help address this problem, the bill would reauthorize and strengthen the Traumatic Brain Injury programs at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 
   The bill also includes a provision which I originally introduced with Senator DODD in March of this year, to address the issue of child care health and safety. In my own state of Tennessee, there have been 4 deaths in the past 3 years in child care settings, and 1 in 15 child-care programs in the Nashville area were found by state inspectors to have potentially put the health and safety of children at risk during 1999. In addition, in 1997, 31,000 children aged 4 and younger were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school settings across this nation. Therefore, the bill contains child care safety and health grants to assist states to fund specific activities to increase safety and health in child care settings. 
   To address the tragic fact that birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and are responsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric hospital admissions, the second title of the bill focuses on maternal and infant health. According to the CDC, an estimated 3,000 birth defects have been identified, of which 70 percent have no known cause. To provide national leadership to combat birth defects, the bill would establish a National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC, which is strongly supported by the March of Dimes and 
   other birth defects groups, to collect, analyze, and distribute data on birth defects. In addition, the bill authorizes the Healthy Start program for the first time, which is designed to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes by providing grants to areas with a high incidence of infant mortality and low birth weight. This bill also contains folic acid education programs to spread the knowledge of the positive health effects of folic acid in the diet of pregnant women. 
   To address the fact that over 3,000 women experience serious complications due to pregnancy and that 2 to 3 of these women will die from pregnancy complications, the bill would develop a national monitoring and surveillance program to better understand the burden of material complications and mortality and to decrease the disparities among populations at risk of death and complications from pregnancy. 
   The third title addresses the promotion of pediatric health by focusing on screening and prevention programs to combat some of the most common childhood diseases and conditions. This bill helps to combat asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting nearly 5 million children under the age of 18 in the United States, by providing comprehensive asthma services to children and to coordinate the wide range of asthma prevention programs in the federal government. 
   We also focus on childhood obesity, which has increased by 100% among children in just the past 15 years, and has resulted in 4.7 million children and adolescents ages 6-19 years becoming seriously overweight. To address this obesity epidemic, the bill provides programs to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of state and community-based programs to promote good nutrition and increased physical activity among American youth. 
   In examining the problems affecting children across the nation and in Tennessee, I was very concerned to learn that in Memphis, Tennessee, over 12 percent of children under the of age of 6 have screened positive for lead poisoning. At high levels, lead can cause a variety of debilitating health problems, including seizure, coma, and even death. At lower levels, lead can contribute to learning disabilities, loss of intelligence, hyperactivity, and behavioral problems. This bill includes physician education and training programs on current lead screening policies, tracks the percentage of children in the Health Centers program who are screened for lead poisoning, and conducts outreach and education for families at risk of lead poisoning. 
   This bill also targets pediatric oral health, which was recently highlighted by the May 2000, Surgeon General report which focused on the fact that oral health is inseparable from overall health, and that while there have been great improvements in oral health for a majority of the population, there are disparities that primarily affect poor children and those who live in underserved areas of our country, with 80 percent of all dental cavities found in 20 percent of children. This bill would support community-based research and training to improve the understanding of etiology, pathogenesis, diagnoses, prevention, and treatment of pediatric oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases. In addition, the bill would provide state grants to increase community water fluoridation and to provide school-based dental sealant services to children in low income areas. 
   The last title of this bill is a focus on strengthening pediatric research efforts in the country. To give us a fuller understanding of how we can help promote the health of our children we establish a Pediatric Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health to enhance collaborative efforts, provide increased support for pediatric biomedical research, and ensure that opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations and care for children are realized. The bill would also expand research into autism, which affects 1 in 500 children, establish a long term Child Development Study at the NIH to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on human development.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my amendment fully funds the Department of Education's share of the Interagency Education Research Initiative, IERI, which is a collaborative joint research and development education effort between the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 
   Quality education depends on quality research. We need to know the answers, if our goal is accountability and student achievement, on what works and what does not work. As we all know, advances in education, as in other fields, depend on knowing what works and what doesn't. If you look at our past investments in research in the field of education, pre-K through 12,  our efforts have been woefully inadequate in terms of dollars and in the quality of the research that has been produced in the past. 
   This is a joint collaborative effort, where we link three agencies together and demand accountability, credibility, good science, and the exactness of science in determining what works and what does not work. The primary objective of this joint program is to support the research and development and the wide dissemination of research-proven educational strategies that improve student achievement from pre-K all the way through 12 in the key areas of reading, mathematics, and science. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this very worthwhile investment in our children's education.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier this week we received tremendously exciting news in that we essentially had completion of the mapping of the human genome. It is tremendously exciting to me, both as a policymaker but also as a physician, as someone who has spent his life taking care of thousands of patients because it introduces a whole new way of thinking that in the history of mankind we just simply have not had. Now there will be whole new ways of thinking. 
   I think we should salute both Craig Venter from Celera and Francis Collins for pioneering, for leading this great effort, which will totally change the way we do such things as engineer drugs, the so-called gene drugs. Now and into the future, we can begin to think how we use our own genes, our own proteins, our own metabolites in such a way that they become the pharmaceutical agent instead of a manufactured drug. 
   It changes the way we will think about organ replacement. Before I came to the Senate, I would make an incision, remove a diseased heart, and have to put in a new heart. Hopefully, 10 years from now, or 15 years from now, when we transplant kidneys or a pancreas, or other organs, we will be able to engineer them based on what we have uncovered. 
   A third area which this human genome project opens up, as we look to the future, is that of genetic testing. We have been talking about and debating the issue of genetic testing over the last couple hours. That is where you can take a swab, and by rubbing that swap over an array, a pattern of DNA that is lined up, you will be able to predict that a person has a 75-percent chance of getting prostate cancer 10 years from now or a 90-percent chance a person will have breast cancer. 
   The potential good is the change in behavior, the change in lifestyle, the change in the intervention that can come about to preempt, preclude, stop the progress of cancer. 
   Unfortunately, as has been laid out and debated today, there are potential dangers, potential harm, if that information is misused. Should policymakers address this potential abuse of genetic information in the workplace? There is no question; yes, we have a responsibility. 
   Technology has given us new tools which give us new ways to think about gene therapy, organ replacement, genetic testing, and the treatment of cancers and heart disease. We are obligated to make sure the barriers are lowered to take the good in the development of science but also minimize whatever harm there might potentially be. 
   But to do that, what is our responsibility? Not to have a knee-jerk reaction and accept a proposal which very few people in this body have even read, much less studied, discussed, and debated. But first, we should focus on the issues that we have studied, that we have addressed in committee, that we have debated, including the input we have solicited from doctors, physicians, scientists, and consumer groups, with both sides of the aisle coming to certain agreements. 
   Let us start there and systematically address these ethical-type issues which have been introduced by this new 
   science just 3 days ago. Let's not have a knee-jerk reaction until every Senator can ask the important questions. 
   I agree 100 percent that we should not discriminate in any way using predictive genetic information in the workplace. That needs to be put first. I think it is unfair for the other side to say we are for discrimination in the workplace by genetic testing. It is just unfair. It is just unfair because we are against that. 
   But to address the policies, in looking at this amendment that has been offered today by Senator DASCHLE and his colleagues, there is a health insurance section. I have read most of that because I have had several hours to do that. I read a little of the employment section. The genetic privacy is very complicated. I can tell you, we need to discuss that a lot more. 
   As to the various definitions of what a predictive genetic test is, I would have to say, the genetic tests they are talking about, where they are actually talking about metabolites, I don't know, I will have to go out and talk to the real experts, but they may go too far. 
   So I do not want to pass a major reform bill that will potentially totally underwrite or change the way we treat people in the workplace based on definitions that I do not fully agree with now. But I do not know enough about it until we can talk to people broadly. 
   This whole expansion of penalties in the fourth section of the bill, I do not know exactly what we are penalizing, if it is just that one statement of penalizing people who use genetic information. First of all, it depends on what that definition is--which I do not agree with--but if it goes beyond that--and I don't know whether it does--I need to know that. 
   I say all that because this amendment Senator DASCHLE has offered simply has not been vetted. It has not been discussed. I have been involved in the genetic debates with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--some initial discussions--but I can tell you, we have not gone into any sort of detail on this whole issue of expanding penalties in this expanded, complicated field of genetic privacy and employment. 
   The one area that has been mentioned is that of health care quality and the use of genetic information in health care, in the health insurance arena. 
   It is very clear that patients need to be free to undergo genetic testing because that can influence, in a positive way, the outcome of their health care. If they receive information that there is an 80-percent chance they will develop breast cancer, that is likely to change how many times they do self-exams a week, how often they go to the doctor, how often they get a mammogram. That information should be used. There should be no chance that information will be used by an insurance company to discriminate against them in denying them insurance. 
   It can change lifestyle. If there is a test with an 80-percent chance that you will develop lung cancer, you will want to know that. Why? Because it can change lifestyle. 
   We have a bill we have debated extensively since 1996 which does just that. Our bill, the Jeffords-Frist bill, prohibits health insurers from requiring patients to undergo genetic testing and prohibits health insurers from using genetic information to deny coverage or set rates for currently healthy individuals who may be at risk for a future disease. 
   Again, this issue has been vetted through the process, has been vetted through Chairman JEFFORDS' committee. Discussion has gone on. In 1995, the debate in the markup of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was extensive in numerous areas. 
   Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to adopt the amendment Chairman JEFFORDS has offered.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles bill a little bit hesitantly--not my support--because of a conference which is underway which pulls together bills passed by the House of Representatives and by the Senate wherein progress is being made so that we can assure the American people of a real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   This process seems to be interrupted time and time again, if not with bills brought to the floor, with press conferences day after day. You haven't seen that from this side. You have seen us working on a very aggressive, daily basis, in a bipartisan, bicameral way to put together a Patients' Bill of Rights--a real challenge because of the number of interests, the number of patient protection issues such as scope and liability. We are making progress. 
   Because of the political theater that seems to be the name of the play put forth on the other side, we have our response tonight. I am very excited about it. I am very excited because we are putting on the table a real Patients' Bill of Rights which has the objectives of returning decisionmaking back to that doctor-patient relationship, of getting HMOs out of the business of practicing medicine but not having the unnecessary mandates which needlessly drive the cost of health insurance so high that people lose their health insurance. 
   The alternative bill on the other side of the aisle--one that was defeated last year, a very similar bill defeated 2 weeks ago--we know would drive about 1.8 million people to the ranks of the uninsured. 
   I can tell the Senate, as a physician, as a policymaker, somebody who has now spent more than 2 years on this bill, we are obligated to the American people to present a bill which is a Patients' Bill of Rights that does not unnecessarily drive people to the ranks of the uninsured by driving up cost. That process is underway. It is interrupted once again tonight. 
   Tonight, for the first time, we are going to be able to put a new bill that reflects this bicameral, bipartisan work of the conference on the table. I would like to concentrate a few minutes on the actual ten or so patient protections that are in the bill that Senator NICKLES has put forward. 
   We heard a little bit from the Senator from Florida on a Florida Patients' Bill of Rights and patient protections. We will come back and talk about the scope of the bills a little bit more, but in Florida there are a total of 44 mandates that have already been passed by the legislature and are law in Florida today. The simple question is, Why do we in this body think we can do a better job when the State has jurisdiction already in putting forth mandates? 
   For example, in 1997, the State of Florida passed a comprehensive bill of rights, now 3 years ago. For ER services, emergency room services, 4 years ago they passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. They passed consumer grievance procedures; breast reconstruction in 1997; direct access to OB/GYNs passed in 1998 in Florida; direct access to dermatologists, 1997; external appeals, 1997. 
   It comes down to the basic premise that we believe we should write a bill in terms of scope, in terms of the ten patient protections that apply to those people under Federal jurisdiction, and not come in and say we know better than the Governor of the Assembly of Florida or Tennessee or Arkansas. 
   Very briefly, I will talk about the patient protections. 
   No. 1, emergency care: Under the Nickles bill, plans must allow access to emergency service. This provision guarantees that an individual can go to the nearest emergency room regardless of whether the emergency room is in the network, in the plan or outside of the plan. It is the nearest emergency room. So these press conferences where you see pictures of people skipping to different emergency rooms, it is not in the bill. In this bill you go to the nearest emergency room. 
   No. 2, point of service: In this bill all beneficiaries covered by a self-insured employer of 50 or more employees must have a point of service option regardless of how many different closed panel options an employer offers. 
   No. 3, access: Specialists such as an obstetrician/gynecologist, under the Nickles bill, patients receive a new right for direct access to a physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecological care for all obstetrical and gynecological care. 
   No. 4, access to pediatricians: Under our plan, a pediatrician may be designated as the child's primary care provider; that is, if a plan requires the designation of a primary care provider for a child. 
   No. 5, continuity of care: Under the Nickles bill, when a provider is terminated from the plan network, patients currently receiving institutional care, if they are terminally ill, may continue that treatment with the provider for a period of up to 90 days. 
   No. 6, access to medication, a real issue for physicians and for patients, this whole idea of a formulary: under the Nickles bill, health plans that provide prescription drugs through a formulary are required to ensure the participation of physicians and pharmacists in designing the initial formulary and in reviewing that formulary. 
   If there are exceptions from that formulary and a nonformulary alternative is available, then the patient has access to that nonformulary alternative. 
   No. 7, access to specialists: As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, this is something I believe is absolutely critical and very important to have in the Patients' Bill of Rights. With the Nickles bill, patients will receive timely access to specialists when needed. 
   No. 8, gag rules: Under the Nickles bill, plans are prohibited from including gag rules in providers' contracts or restricting providers from communicating with patients about treatment options. 
   No. 9, access to approved cancer clinical trials: Again, this is very important. We have heard a lot about the human genome project today and the great advances. That is good because it gives you the ``phone book.'' We have to figure out what it means. In the same way, if you have new pharmaceutical agents, or treatments for cancer, you have to figure out whether or not they work; therefore, access to approved cancer clinical trials. The Nickles bill provides coverage of routine patient costs associated with participation in approved cancer clinical trials sponsored by the NIH, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Defense. 
   No. 10, provider nondiscrimination: Under the Nickles bill, plans may not exclude providers based solely on their license or certification from providing services. 
   No. 11, after breast surgery, mastectomy length of stay, and coverage of second opinions: Plans are required, under the Nickles bill, to ensure inpatient coverage for the surgical treatment of breast cancer for a time determined by the physician, in consultation with the patient.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, emergency room provisions are a good case in point. It comes up all the time. It is important that people have the right to go to emergency rooms. Emergency room provisions are important. The Senator is exactly right. For the 51 million people who the Federal Government regulates, we have a responsibility to put emergency room provisions in there. That is what the Nickles bill does for the States. 
   The other people the Senator is talking about--does he know how many people already have specific emergency room provisions legislated for managed care? We do. It is not 10 States or 20 States or 30 States or 40 States. I don't have the exact number. I know more than 43 States have taken care of the emergency room provisions.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very quickly, a vote for the Nickles amendment is a vote for patient protection, emergency room access to obstetricians, pediatricians, specialists, and clinical trials. 
   A vote for the Nickles amendment is a vote for a strong internal appeals process. If the HMO rejects the appeal of the doctor, you can go internally. If it is rejected again, you go to an external appeal process. The decision made by the external appeals process is made by an independent physician not bound by how the plan may define ``medical necessity.'' If the external appeal overrules the plan, and the plan does not comply, you go to court. This new ability to go to court, which is what many people believe is so important, is a new right to sue in Federal court. 
   Lastly, the access provisions have not been mentioned. 
   In closing, all of these mandates are going to drive up the cost of health care. 
   Access provisions in the bill include an above-the-line deduction for health insurance expenses, a 100-percent self-employed health insurance deduction, expansion of medical savings accounts, and deductions for long-term care. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise tonight to offer an amendment that I think goes to the heart of so many of our debates here on the Senate floor regarding education. My amendment would fully fund the Department of Education's share of the Interagency Education Research Initiative (IERI)--a collaborative effort of the Department of Education's research arm--the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI)--the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The primary objective of the IERI is to support the development and wide dissemination of research-proven, technology-enabled educational strategies that improve K-12 education. 
   We debate many new program ideas here in the Senate that have little to no research to back up them up. Members offer new program after new program in a mad attempt to cure what ails American education. I ask my colleagues, ``wouldn't it be better to know what works before we spend billions of dollars trying out things that may, in fact, not only not work, but harm student achievement?'' Reading is a good example of this. We tried many fads before the scientifically-based research evidence came in that you've got to have phonics. 
   As we all know, advances in education, as in most other areas, depend in no small part on vigorous and sustained research and development. Indeed, state and local policymakers, as well as school level administrators, are clamoring for information about ``what works'' to guide their decisions. However, historic investments in such educational research have been woefully inadequate, and the small federal investments that have been made through the Department of Education have not always resulted in the high-quality, scientifically credible research that we have come to expect from many other research agencies. Much of research that has come out of the Department of Education in years past has been politically driven and not always of the highest quality. IERI is a first step on the road to changing that. Teaming up with highly respected research institutions like NSF and NICHD, OERI is improving its research processes. In the 1997 PCAST ``Report to the President on the Use of Technology to Strengthen K-12 Education,'' an advisory panel of technology, business, and education leaders strongly urged that a significant Federal research investment be undertaken in education, with a focus on educational technology. The report pointed out that in 1997, we invested less than 0.1 percent of the more than $300 billion spent on K-12 public education each year to examine and improve educational practice; by contrast, the pharmaceutical industry invests nearly a quarter of its expenditures on the development and testing of new drugs. In addition to the President's 1997 Technology Advisory Report, the Budget Committee Task Force on Education's Interim Report, and this year's Republican Main Street Partnership Paper on ``Defining the Federal Role in Education, A Republican Perspective.'' both call for more spending on Education R&D. At our Budget Committee Task Force on Education hearing on education research, we learned that one of our main Federally funded research institutions was operating with a budget that was 
   smaller than what a seed company expended in a facility devoted solely to breeding petunias down the road. 
   Dr. Robert Slavin, the Co-Director of the Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed At-Risk (CRESPAR), one of the Department of Education's research centers, likened our current expenditures in federal education research to health research that was limited to ``basic research and descriptions of how sick people are, but never produced any cures for anything.'' Additionally, another proponent of education research warns that ``poor research often leaves us with inadequately tested and replicated fads, masquerading as innovations, penetrating the system, frustrating the teachers, administrators, parents and, most importantly, the children, and leaving us all worse off than before.'' Unfortunately, it is often difficult to discern good research from bad. 
   The precursor to the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) was the National Institute of Education (NIE). Modeled after the National Institutes of Health, which is widely respected, the NIE never realized the same success as its role model. A Budget Committee Education Task Force heard in 1998 that progress at OERI was stymied by inadequate peer-review processes and a lack of good quality control measures. Recognizing these problems, OERI--most recently under Dr. Kent McGuire's leadership--has embarked on a number of promising reforms, including an overhaul of its peer review system in partnership with NIH. However, it is clear we must do more. 
   In response to the calls of practitioners and experts, the Federal government launched the Interagency Education Research Initiative (IERI) in FY1999. The ultimate objective of the IERI is to accelerate the translation of robust research findings into concrete lessons for educators to improve student achievement in preK-12 reading, mathematics, and science. To achieve this goal, the National Science Foundation, Department of Education, and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development are supporting a fundamentally new character of research in education that builds on the research portfolios of each agency while filling a gap no one agency could address alone. This research features interdisciplinary collaborations across learning-related disciplines, is substantively focused on key aspects of preK-12 education, and is conducted on a scale large enough to learn generalizable lessons about what works and why. Witnesses at hearings related to educational research in both the Senate and the House over the past year (e.g., June 1999 in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and October 1999 in the House Basic Science Subcommittee) have urged the Congress to build upon and support the IERI model. 
   Calls for all levels of the educational system to be accountable for student learning are escalating at the same time that technologies offer exciting new ways to help all students meet high standards of excellence. Now more than ever is the time to elevate the role of rigorous, peer-reviewed educational research--with a focus on technology--in addressing the urgent challenges of educational reform. With $30 million in FY1999 funds, the IERI team has already laid the groundwork for this innovative research program with 14 new research awards averaging $2 million per year. Another joint program solicitation for $38 million in FY2000 funds has recently been released. My amendment will fully fund the Department of Education's share in order to continue to grow the IERI to leverage potentially vast gains in student achievement with a relatively modest investment in finding out ``what works.'' 
   Education R&D is a young discipline. While the taxonomy for medicine has been in development for millennia, engineering for centuries, and biology for a few hundred years, the widespread public education of children has occurred for barely more than a century. Consequently, education R&D is even younger than that. 
   The Interagency Education Research Initiative will help expand our knowledge base and will be money well spent. 
   The amendment is fully offset, and I urge my colleagues to support this very worthwhile investment in our children's education.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to join Senators Breaux, Kerrey, Bond, Santorum, Landrieu, Ashcroft, and  COLLINS in introducing the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000''--a truly bipartisan effort to address the real need to provide seniors the prescription drugs they deserve and strengthen and improve the Medicare program overall. 
   Last fall, I introduced the ``Medicare Preservation and Improvement Act of 1999'', with Senators Breaux, Kerrey, and  Hagel. This was the first bipartisan attempt to comprehensively reform Medicare in the program's 35 year history. When Medicare was first enacted in 1965, it had the goal of providing seniors necessary acute health care that would otherwise have been unaffordable. However today's health care delivery systems are far more advanced than the program's creators  ever imagined. Our goal over the past year was to create an atmosphere for further discussion on ways to strengthen and improve the Medicare program, including proposals for an outpatient prescription drug benefit. Today, we take the first step in the right direction--a direction to bring Medicare in line with the benefits and delivery systems commonplace in the 21st century today. 
   Building on last year's bill and the findings of the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'' takes the first steps towards long-term Medicare reform while adding a much needed outpatient prescription drug benefit to the program. Unlike in 1965, prescription drugs are integral to the delivery of health care and treating diseases prevalent among the elderly population. We must include a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare system. However, we must also address some of the other problems facing Medicare. 
   For instance, we must recognize the need to update the total benefit package and increase the flexibility of the program. Today's Medicare coverage is inadequate, covering only 53 percent of beneficiary's average health costs, and still does not include coverage for many preventive services, eyeglasses, or dental care, much less prescription drugs. 
   Medicare is also facing a doubling of beneficiaries over the coming decades. Today, there are 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, but within the next 10 years, 77 million baby boomers will begin entering the program. Our ability to effectively respond to this increased demand is further limited by the declining number of workers paying payroll taxes, which fund Medicare obligations each year, as the number of workers per retiree has continued to decline, from 4.5 in 1960 to 3.9 today. This figure is expected to further decline to 2.8 in 2020. 
   We all know that Medicare spending consumes much of the federal budget. But this will only get worse. Currently absorbing nearly 12 percent of the federal outlays, Medicare will balloon to 25 percent of the federal budget by 2030. The program, which relies on general revenues to pay for close to 40 percent of total program expenditures today, will continue to use an increasing share of general revenues, leaving fewer and fewer federal dollars available to support other federal programs. 
   Finally, with over hundred thousand pages of HCFA regulations governing Medicare, the program has become so bloated and heavily micro-managed that it cannot adopt to the daily advances in medicine and health care delivery. Even when life-saving diagnostic tests become available, such as a breakthrough prostate cancer-screening test that came on the market in the early 1990s, it takes years before they can be approved. Medicare has only recently begun reimbursing for prostate screening and only because a new law was passed to allow it. 
   The very fact that Congress must past such laws illustrates perfectly the problem with a heavily micro-managed system. No government program can possibly keep up with the increasingly rapid rate at which new drugs and technologies are brought to the market. As a physician, I know that today, more than ever, access to lifesaving drugs and technology as they become available is the key to providing quality health care, and we must modernize Medicare to meet these demands. 
   The need to modernize Medicare has never been more apparent. The measures included in the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'' will provide seniors the option to choose the kind of health care coverage that best suit their individual needs, including enhanced benefits, outpatient prescription drug coverage, and protections against high out-of-pocket drug costs. 
   The ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'' establishes that Competitive Medicare Agency (CMA), an independent, executive-branch agency to spearhead an advanced level of Medicare management and oversight--leaving behind the intransigent bureaucracy and outdated mindset infecting the program and instead guaranteeing seniors choice, health care security, and improved benefits and delivery of care. Modeled after the Social Security Administration, the CMA functions in a manner similar to the Office of Personnel Management, which has a 40-year track record of success in providing quality comprehensive health coverage for the millions of federal employees and their families through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
   Vital to this bill is the Prescription Drug and Supplemental Benefit Program that provides beneficiaries outpatient prescription drugs and other additional benefits through new Medicare Prescription Plus plans offered by private entities or through Medicare+Choice plans. The drug benefit will provide, at a minimum, a standard prescription drug package consisting of a $250 deductible, 50 percent cost-sharing up to $2,100, and stop-loss protection at $6,000. Seniors are guaranteed this minimum benefits, but also have the choice of other drug benefit packages. I recognize more than anyone that a one-size-fits-all approach to health care does not work. It is important to pass along the same choices we, as members of Congress, have, Seniors deserve no less. 
   We ensure that low-income beneficiaries receive necessary drug coverage by providing premium subsidies. Beneficiaries below 135 percent of poverty, beneficiaries receive a 100 percent premium subsidy and 95 percent of all cost-sharing. Beneficiaries between 135% and 150 percent of poverty receive premium subsidiaries on a sliding scale from a much as 100 percent to no less than 25 percent, and all beneficiaries, regardless of income, will receive a 25% premium subsidy. Since 39 percent of 
   beneficiaries below 150 percent of poverty have no drug coverage, this provision alone will provide comprehensive drug coverage for over 5 million seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
   We also address the high costs of drugs by ensuring that no beneficiary will ever pay retail prices for prescription drugs again. We do this through a prescription drug discount card program that passes on price discounts negotiated between pharmaceutical companies and insurers to beneficiaries. For example, today a senior may pay $100 for a particular drug. Under the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'', this senior would have access to the insurers negotiated rate of $70, but then would also receive an even further discount through coinsurance, reducing the total price of the drug by over 60 percent down to just $35. 
   The ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'' modernizes Medicare by establishing a new competitive system under Medicare+Choice where plans bid for the costs of delivering care and compete with traditional Medicare based on benefits, price, and quality so that beneficiaries receive the highest-quality, affordable health care possible. Under this new system, plans are allowed maximum flexibility to reduce current beneficiary Part B premiums and cost-sharing as well as offer new and additional benefits to beneficiaries, including outpatient prescription drug coverage. 
   Finally, the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'', for the first time in Medicare's history provides lawmakers and the public a better measure for evaluating Medicare's financial health and establishes strong reporting requirements for the Medicare program as a whole. 
   Medicare must be modernized to provide seniors integrated health care choices, including outpatient prescription drug coverage. This afternoon my colleagues and I have moved beyond the demagoguery and disinformation campaigns and have come together to propose bipartisan legislation that balances the very real need for outpatient prescription drug coverage with the need for meaningful modernizations. By moving forward on this legislation, I believe we can truly provide choice and security for our Medicare beneficiaries to ensure their individual health care needs are met, today and well into the future.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my understanding that USAID obligates most of its money for Zimbabwe through agreements with the Government of Zimbabwe. Notwithstanding this obligation procedure, it is my intention that the prohibition on assistance for the Government of Zimbabwe not cut off all assistance to Zimbabwe but only that assistance that would otherwise have been provided for the benefit of the government. Under the limitation contained in my amendment, assistance provided through nongovernmental organizations may continue, even though the initial obligation of funds may have been with the government. Such assistance may only marginally benefit the government through, for example, the necessary use of providing assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. This has particular relevance to microenterprise programs which, I believe, would not be affected by the limitations in my amendment.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I just want to make a couple of points. 
   No. 1, prescription drugs, I believe--I say this not only as a Senator but also as a physician who has personally taken care of thousands and thousands of Medicare patients--that prescription drugs absolutely must be a part of our Medicare program and system if we are going to really provide health care security for our seniors. 
   The challenge we have is that, indeed, prescription drugs replace the surgeon's knife--which I have used my entire adult life--and replace the hospital bed, which are important dynamics of health care. 
   But the real challenge we have is including that new additional benefit--which, traditionally, over the last several years has been 17 to 18 percent a year--into a rigid, inflexible, outdated Medicare program that we have not been able to reform. 
   The challenge before this Congress is to very thoughtfully incorporate prescription drugs coupled with true Medicare reform, to bring it up to date, to modernize it in a way that we can truly guarantee health care security to our seniors. 
   This particular amendment has not gone through the committee process. I can tell you that I for one, having spent the last 7 hours working on health care in an adjacent room off this Chamber, have never seen this particular amendment nor had the opportunity to read this particular amendment. So I 
   absolutely am going to oppose this particular amendment, which is brought to the floor outside of the committee process and outside of my having had the opportunity even to read the amendment. 
   I have been working on prescription drugs with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion for the last 2 years. I was on the national bipartisan Medicare commission, where we talked about prescription drugs. There are other proposals being debated in the House. 
   We have not had the opportunity to see this particular amendment. It has not gone through committee. It should not be introduced tonight, I believe, and hopefully it will be defeated tonight.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), Senator JEFFORDS, in introducing today a critical piece of legislation that will take needed steps to improve the quality of health care delivered in this country. The goal of our legislation today is to improve patient safety by reducing medical errors throughout the health care system. 
   The Institute of Medicine Report (IOM), released last November, sparked a national debate about how safe our hospitals and health care settings actually are for patients. The scope of the problem identified in the findings were shocking. The IOM found that each year an estimated 44,000 to 98,000 hospital deaths occur as a result of preventable adverse events. This makes medical errors the 8th leading cause of death, with more deaths than vehicle accidents, breast cancer or AIDS. These errors cost our Nation $37.6 billion to $50 billion per year, representing 4 percent of national health expenditures. 
   Despite the recent IOM findings, this is not a new debate. Many experts have told us that the health care industry is a decade or more behind in utilizing new technologies to reduce medical errors. Just last year, the HELP Committee took initial steps last year to reduce medical errors through the reauthorization of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), revitalizing this agency as the  federal agency focused on improving the quality of health care in this country. Part of the core mission of AHRQ is to further our understanding of the causes of medical errors and the best strategies we can employ to reduce these errors. The legislation authorized the Director of AHRQ to conduct and support research; to build private-public partnerships to identify the causes of preventable health care errors and patient injury in health care delivery; to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate strategies for reducing errors and improving patient safety; and to disseminate such effective strategies throughout the health care industry. 
   The legislation we introduce today builds upon the further recommendations of the IOM report and reflects the culmination of testimony received throughout the past several months in a series of hearings held by the HELP Committee. 
   The central goal of this legislation is quality improvement throughout the health care system. We heard over and over throughout our hearings that we need to develop our knowledge base about the best mechanisms to reduce medical errors. This can only be achieved if we build a system where errors can be reported and understood to improve care, not to punish individuals. We need to create a ``culture of safety'' in which errors can be reported, and analyzed, and then change can be implemented. 
   I will not go into the details of this legislation, which Senator JEFFORDS has already outlined, I would simply outline the three main goals of this legislation, the creation of a national center for quality improvement and patient safety at the AHRQ, the creation of a voluntary reporting system to collect and analyze medical errors, and the establishment of strong confidentiality provisions for the information submitted under quality improvement and medical error reporting systems. 
   I am very supportive of the goals of this legislation and will continue to examine the best ways to reduce medical errors in our health care system. It is essential that we pass medical errors legislation this year. We will continue to seek input from patients and provider groups as we work to pass this legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce the ``Public  Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' with my colleague, Senator, KENNEDY, to improve our public health infrastructure and to address the growing threats of antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. 
   Over the last two years, we have held three hearings and forums on these topics, and I also commissioned a GAO report on antimicrobial resistance. The outcome of all this research is clear; we need to improve our public health infrastructure to be able to respond in a timely and effective manner to these and other threats. 
   For too long, we have not provided adequate funding to maintain and improve the core capacities of our nation's public health infrastructure. As the GAO report found, many State and local public health agencies lack even the most basic equipment such as FAX machines or answering machines to assist their workload and improve communications. 
   We face a myriad of public health threats everyday, and besides improving our core public health capacity, this act aim addresses two problems in particular: antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. 
   Antimicrobial resistance is a pressing pubic health problem. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I know all too well that the most common cause of death after transplantation of a heart or lung is not rejection, but infection. One hundred percent of transplantation patients contract infections following surgery. Infection is the most common complication following surgery, the leading cause for rehospitalization, and the most expensive aspect of treatment post-transplantation. Antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment, yet we are increasingly seeing resistant bacteria which are not killed by most first-line antimicrobials. 
   In fact, the New England Journal of Medicine has reported that certain Staphylocci, which are a common cause of post-surgical and hospital acquired infections, are showing intermediate resistance to vancomycin, an antibiotic of the last resort. Just recently in mid-April, the FDA approved the first entirely new type antibiotic in 35 years. 
   How did we reach this point? For most of human history, infections were the scourge of man's existence causing debilitating disease and often death. Antibiotics, when initially discovered more than 50 years ago, were heralded as miracle drugs and quickly became our most lethal weapon in the crusade against disease-causing bacteria. Antibiotics were widely dispensed and, in the 1970's premature optimism lead us to declare the war on infections won. 
   Unfortunately, we discovered that bacteria are cagey, tenacious organisms that swiftly developed resistance to antibiotics and adapted to drug-rich environments. In addition, the art of medicine evolved, creating new opportunities for bacteria to cause infection from invasive procedures using catheters to organ transplant recipients who are treated with immunosuppressive agents to prevent rejection. As a result, we are both seeing more invasive, life-threatening infections that require concurrent treatment with several antibiotics to control and infections that were on the decline, such as Tuberculosis, re-emerging in an antimicrobial resistant form. 
   While infections have plagued man's existence for most of human history, throughout civilization, bioweapons have been strategically deployed during critical military battles. For example, in 1344, the Mongols hurled corpses infected with bubonic plague over the city walls of Caffa (now Feodossia, Ukraine). During World War I, the Germans hoped to gain an advantage by infecting their enemies horses and livestock with anthrax. 
   Bioterrorism is a significant threat to our country. As a nation we are presently more vulnerable to bioweapons than other more traditional means of warfare. Bioweapons pose considerable challenges that are different from those of standard terrorist devices, including chemical weapons. 
   The mere term ``bioweapon'' invokes visions of immense human pain and suffering and mass casualties. Pound for pound, ounce for ounce, bioagents represent one of the most lethal weapons of mass destruction known. Moreover, victims of a covert bioterrorist attack do not necessarily develop symptoms upon exposure to the bioagent. Development of symptoms may be delayed days long after the bioweapon is dispersed. 
   As a result, exposed individuals will most likely show up in emergency rooms, physician offices, or clinics, with nondescript symptoms or ones that mimic the common cold or flu. In all likelihood, physicians and other health care providers will not attribute these symptoms to a bioweapon. If the bioagent is communicable, such as small pox, many more people may be infected in the interim, including our health care workers. As Stephanie Bailey, the Director of Health for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County pointed out in our hearing on bioterrorism, ``many localities are on their own for the first 24 to 48 hours after an attack before Federal assistance can arrive and be operational. This is the critical time for preventing mass casualties.'' 
   If experts are correct in their belief that a major bioterrorist attack is a virtual certainty, that it is no longer a question of ``if'' but rather ``when.'' In fact, my home town of Nashville last year joined an ever-increasing number of cities to receive and respond to a package that was suspected of containing anthrax. Thankfully, this was a hoax. 
   To address these concerns about our public health infrastructure and improve our preparedness for the threats of antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism, I have joined with Senator KENNEDY to provide greater resources and coordination to address these issues. 
   The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, which we introduce today, will provide needed guidance, resources, and coordination to increase the core capacities of the nation's public health infrastructure. This Act will also improve the coordination and increase the resources available to address the threats of bioterrorism and antimicrobial resistance. 
   Strengthening capacities to ensure that the public health infrastructure is adequate to respond to carry out core functions and respond to emerging threats and emergencies, the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act authorizes: the establishment of voluntary performance goals for public health systems; grants to public health agencies to conduct assessments and build core capacities to achieve these goals; and funding to rebuild and remodel the facilities of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   To strengthen public health capacities to combat antimicrobial resistance, the Act authorizes: a task force to coordinate Federal programs related to antimicrobial resistance and to improve public education on antimicrobial resistance; the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support research into the development of new therapeutics against and improved diagnostics for resistant pathogens; and grants for activities to improve specific capacities to detect, monitor, and combat antimicrobial resistance. 
   To strengthen public health capacities to prevent and respond to bioterrorism, the Act authorizes: two interdepartmental task forces to address joint issues of research needs and the public health and medical consequences of bioterrorism; NIH and CDC research on the epidemiology of bioweapons and the development of new vaccines or therapeutics for bioweapons; and grants to public health agencies and hospitals and care facilities to detect, diagnose, and respond to bioterrorism. 
   Mr. President, this Act is necessary. We must take steps now to improve our basic capacities to address all public health threats, including antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. I am hopeful this legislation provides State and local public health agencies the resources to improve their abilities so that we better protect the health and well-being of our Nation's citizens. 
   I want to thank Senator KENNEDY for joining me in this effort and for the work of his staff. I would also like to thank Dr. Stephanie Bailey, the Director of Health for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County for her assistance and input on this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Daschle-Kennedy amendment for a number of reasons, but basically it has been already debated and defeated by this body after a week of discussion and debate. And it will be defeated today. 
   I do wish to make three points over the next several minutes. No. 1, the offering of this amendment today, I do believe, all of a sudden, puts it in political theater, almost in a stunt-like environment as an election issue. No. 2, this amendment is underlying, I believe, a bad bill that could very negatively influence the quality of care in this country, and for sure it will drive people to the ranks of the uninsured. No. 3, the bill is inadequate, as has already been mentioned. 
   It doesn't address the basic rights of patients. The right of access to care is not addressed. 
   First, I hope this is not just political theater, but I tend to think it is. It makes me believe some people simply don't want a bill. They want to politicize it by introducing today an amendment on a totally unrelated, underlying bill. We will see how it plays out over the next couple of hours. 
   To me personally, as a physician, as a Senator, as one who believes we must, can, and will, because the American people expect us to, produce a strong Patients' Bill of Rights, what is most disappointing to me is I am afraid what is happening is the good faith efforts being made by this Congress, where we are spending, as Senators, hours every day, not just over weeks but months on this bill, that this is going to destroy, poison, the good-faith efforts and progress that are being made in the conference where we take a Senate bill that has already passed through this body and a House bill that has passed that body and, in a bipartisan, bicameral way, develop a bill that can and will be passed this year by the Congress. 
   We are making real progress in merging a 250-page bill on this side and a 250-page bill on the House side. I am afraid today's action, the introduction of this bill, is playing politics with an issue that, to me, as a physician, translates down to affecting the care of individuals, of children, of families. By doing so, we are gambling with the lives and the health of those individuals, many of whom are barely scraping by, barely able to afford the insurance they have, much less able to afford increased premiums which this bill, the amendment, will clearly do. Our goal must be, ultimately, when someone needs care, to get the care they need and deserve in a timely way. 
   A second goal, a goal in the conference that we discuss in each of our meetings, is to get the HMOs out of the business of practicing medicine; with a third goal being a corollary of that, to have the decisionmaking back in the hands of physicians working with their patients. That can be achieved in the very near future if we forget this stunt, this political theater of introducing amendments to be debated over a couple of hours that we already debated with the bill already defeated 6 months ago. 
   Why is this bill so bad? Why is the amendment before us so disappointing to me? There are many reasons; I will address two. 
   No. 1, let's come back to the individual patient. It just may be that you fall into that category where your chances of getting your hypertension treated are less under this bill or your diabetes managed or your cancer diagnosed or the leukemia of your child treated. Why? Because under this amendment, under this bill which has been introduced today, probably somewhere around a million people are likely to lose their health insurance today by this single amendment. Will it be you, or will it be a constituent back home? We need to look them in the eye and say: Are you going to be one of those million people who, because of the amendment voted upon today, are going to lose their health insurance? 
   How can I say that so definitively? Because we know this amendment will cost four times what the Senate-passed bill will cost in terms of an increase in premiums. The estimated increase in premiums under the bill which passed this body is about 1 percent. Under the bill that was initially proposed by Senator KENNEDY, it would go up around 4 percent, four times 
   what is provided in the underlying bill. Ask your constituent back home: How do you feel about possibly being one of those people who no longer can afford their insurance and, therefore, go without health care? 
   No. 2, if you think your child is getting the care he or she deserves today and if you decide that they are not, what do you really want? What you want is to be able to take that child to a doctor and have them say, yes, we will treat the child now. If they say, no, you want to go to a quick appeals process, not in some courtroom 3 years later but today, shortly. If you disagree, then you want to go to another physician unaffiliated with the plan. That is what our underlying conference bill does. 
   Unfortunately, the bill being introduced today by Senators DASCHLE and KENNEDY has these perverse incentives that, instead of going through that process of internal appeals and external appeals and an independent physician making a final decision, you are encouraged, through incentives, to go directly to the courtroom and file a lawsuit. We need to ask: Do you want the care you deserve when you need it or when your child needs it or would you rather spend your time in a courtroom weeks, months or years later?  
   In the conference bill, we have strong internal appeals, strong external appeals, an independent physician making a final decision. We address quality of care for you and your family right now. We address access to the care you need now. We address timely decisionmaking in the underlying conference bill. We have those disputes settled by independent physicians, doctors making the final decision. They are the ones with the best science, the best medical evidence out there deciding medical necessity, not what is in the original plan. 
   My third and final point is that this bill is inexcusably and embarrassingly inadequate. It does not cover the provision which will be in the conference bill, and that is access. Right now, there are 44 million people without health insurance. Since President Clinton has been in office, 8 million people have lost their health insurance net. It has gone from 36 million to 44 million while President Clinton has been in office. We must address that.

   Mr. FRIST. The underlying conference bill addresses many issues which go well beyond the amendment being introduced today. By voting for the Daschle amendment today, we are basically saying these issues, which are in the original Senate bill and are being discussed in conference today, are not important: Access; provisions such as the above-the-line deduction for health care insurance costs; accelerating the 100-percent self-employed health insurance deduction; expansion of medical savings accounts; a new above-the-line deduction for long-term care insurance; a new additional personal exemption for caretakers, all of which make those 44 million people more likely to have insurance in the future. 
   Genetic discrimination: The prohibition of having genetic testing be used against you when you apply for insurance, it is not in the Daschle-Kennedy bill today. It is in the conference bill, the underlying bill passed by the Senate. 
   We have heard over the last several months that 80,000 people a year die because of medical errors or lack of patient 
   safety concerns. That is going to be in the conference bill because it was in the underlying Senate bill which did pass this body. A vote for the amendment today is a vote that these issues should not be part of the basic Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Let us not play politics. Let us continue to do what we have been doing over the last several weeks and months; that is, advance, taking the 250-page bill passed here, the 250-page bill passed in the House of Representatives, bringing them together in a bipartisan, bicameral approach that comes back to looking that patient in the eyes and saying: We are going to improve the quality of care you receive, not decrease that quality of care.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the last hour and a half, we have been talking about the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It comes down to a question of should we allow the normal course of events in this body and in the House of Representatives to proceed--the conference report, which is our challenge. It is a challenge because we are taking a 250-page bill passed in the Senate and merging it with a 250-page bill passed in the House of Representatives on issues that will affect the quality of care of millions of people. Our challenge is to allow that process to continue. 
   How much progress has been made? Clearly, from the other side of the aisle, an attempt has been made over the last hour and a half to say that progress is not being made, that there is a stalemate, that we won't see a bill. In 1 minute, let me review what has happened. 
   On July 15, the Senate passed a bill. The amendment being proposed today is looking backward because that is the very bill we defeated last year on this floor for very good reasons, and it will be defeated again today. On October 6, the House of Representatives passed a Patients' Bill of Rights which included some very important access provisions. Conferees were named and we have addressed it as conferees, and we essentially have agreement on many of the issues we have talked about. That is progress. 
   Access to emergency care: If you are injured, you can go to the closest emergency room. 
   Direct access to a pediatrician: If you have children, they have a right to have access to somebody who specializes in that care. That has been agreed to. That is progress. 
   Direct access to specialists: An example was given about a pediatric cardiologist, or a cardiac surgeon. You will have access to those specialists. That has been agreed to. 
   Continued care from a physician: In the event there is a pregnancy and there is a loss of your insurance plan, you can continue with that physician through your pregnancy, or with a terminal illness. 
   Direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists. 
   That is true progress. A Democratic offer was made to the Republican conferees on May 23. That is progress--the fact that the proposal has been made. 
   I should say that very few concessions were made from the original bill. That is progress, though. A Republican response was given and a Republican proposal on June 4. That is progress. Again, as has been pointed out, a number of concessions, trying to pull those two bills together, have been made. Again, that is progress. 
   The sponsors of the amendment today again are taking a bill that was introduced 6 or 7 months ago, debated on the floor, and they are looking backward. That bill has been debated and defeated in this body after careful deliberation. We are looking forward with the progress that we have put out. 
   I urge defeat of the proposed amendment so the conference can continue with the underlying business.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on its surface, the turmoil and death toll of Zimbabwe's brutal farm invasions is an economic and racial battle. At its core, it is an engineered effort to distract from the government's assault on a besieged democratic opposition movement. The crisis in Zimbabwe has profound implications for Africa far beyond the killings and lawlessness necessary to sustain it. It has the potential to fundamentally compromise the future of the entire region and the United States' most basic interests there. But it is a crisis which we are ill-prepared to address, and time is not on our side. 
   President Robert Mugabe's orchestration and blessing of the invasions of predominantly white-owned commercial farms--the backbone of Zimbabwe's export economy--by so-called war veterans is actually a shrewd maneuver to disguise behind the veil of a racial drama his relentless attack on the democratic institutions and rule of law in Zimbabwe. By successfully casting the issue as one of race rather than his own lawlessness. President Mugabe has paralyzed the very forces which should otherwise call his bluff. 
   Most notable among the paralyzed are other African heads of state--and Kofi Annan. The deliberate introduction of a racial element to the controversy has left them in an untenable position: if they dare criticize behavior they find outrageous or even dangerous, they would seemingly side against black Africans on behalf of ``colonial'' whites. Thus neighboring heads of state--some of whom have shown great commitment to democracy and racial reconciliation in their own countries--are unhappily muted, even seemingly compelled to support President Mugabe's antics. 
   Yet the near paralysis of the United States is of greatest concern. Over 10,000 Zimbabwean troops from the thin green line which keeps Laurent Kabila in power in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The volatile Kabila, in turn, determines whether or not the war in Congo ends peacefully--a goal to which the administration has staked considerable political capital during ``the month of Africa'' at the United Nations. Thus, President Mugabe has presented us with a ludicrous choice between support for democracy in Zimbabwe and the chance to prevent Kabila from plunging Congo back into full scale war. The United States is frozen lest we provoke them. 
   Relatively small Zimbabwe's ability to direct the fate of Congo and the entire central African region is testament to its weight on the continent and why its internal chaos is reason for great concern. Zimbabwe can be a force for good or bad in southern Africa, the region which will in turn, drive either the progress or further demise of the entire continent south of the Sahara. Zimbabwe is currently a driving force for its demise. The best chance to reverse that is through support for the democratic forces challenging a leader whose increasingly destructive acts imperil the continent. The United States' policy imperative in Zimbabwe could not be clearer, but we are seemingly unprepared to take the necessary steps to aggressively defend democracy and our national interests. 
   First, the United States must be willing to ``decouple'' our support for democracy in Zimbabwe from the war in Congo. As in any hostage situation, you never let the captor dictate the terms. 
   That will require commitment of considerable political capital and diplomatic muscle. It will require taking some necessary risks. 
   Second, the United States should not wait until after ballots are cast for parliament on June 24 and 25 to declare whether the elections were ``free and fair'' or even ``flawed but representative.'' The government's attempt to steal the election now through violence, intimidation, and brazen manipulation of procedures are in daily news reports. Silence on that point makes us accomplices in its attempts to maintain its grip on power and false pretense of democracy. More insidious, the world is helping to pave the way for the same deception and violence in the critical 2002 presidential elections by essentially demonstrating how little we expect when it comes to democracy in Africa. It stands in shameful contrast to our expectations and actions in South Africa in 1994. 
   Third, we must explicitly link international financial support and cooperation with Zimbabwe to the fate of its democratic institutions. With the virtual end of support from international lending institutions and economic aid, we have precious few ``sticks'' at our disposal. The ``carrots'' are real, through. We must use them to communicate that democracy brings immediate benefits and to entice and generously shore up any gains made, including progress on real land reform. In the 20 years since independence, land reform, which is broadly supported in Zimbabwe and among donors, has been slow and has benefitted ruling party insiders. 
   It is critical that the United States be clear about its support for peaceful democratic transition in Zimbabwe. That fact must be communicated to the Zimbabwean government in no uncertain terms, and to the Zimbabwean people. They should know that we back them in their struggle for democracy. 
   But it must be more than just words. The United States should be prepared to meet the needs of those fighting for democracy, and to be there to assist them should they have the opportunity to govern. 
   Mr. President, to that end, Senators FEINGOLD and HELMS have joined me in introducing the Zimbabwe Democracy Act. The legislation contains several critical democratic support mechanisms which we should act quickly to put in place. 
   First, it unequivocally states the policy of the United States is to support the people of Zimbabwe in their struggles to effect peaceful, democratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic growth, and restore the rule of law. 
   It suspends bilateral assistance to the government of Zimbabwe; suspends any debt reduction measures for the government of Zimbabwe; and instructs the U.S. executive directors of the multilateral lending institutions to vote against the extension of any credit or benefits to the government of Zimbabwe until rule of law and democratic institutions are restored. 
   It includes explicit exceptions for humanitarian, health and democracy support programs. 
   It authorizes a legal assistance fund for individuals and institutions which are suffering under the breakdown of rule of law. The legal fees for torture victims, independent media supporting free speech and other democratic institutions challenging election results or undemocratic laws can be paid from the funds. 
   It provides new authority for broadcasting of objective and reliable news to listeners in Zimbabwe. 
   It doubles next year's funding for democracy programs in Zimbabwe. 
   It expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should support election observers to the parliamentary and presidential elections. 
   It prepares the United States to act decisively to support democracy. If the President certifies to Congress that rule of law has been restored, freedom of speech and association is respected,  free elections have been conducted, Zimbabwe is pursuing an equitable and legal land reform program, and the army is under civilian control, a series of programs to support democratic transition and aggressively promote economic recovery are initiated: 
   Suspended assistance is restored. 
   The Secretary of Treasury is directed to undertake a review of Zimbabwe's bilateral debt for the purposes of elimination of that debt to the greatest extent possible. 
   It directs the U.S. executive directors at the multilateral institutions to propose and support programs for the elimination of Zimbabwe's multilateral debt, and that those institutions initiate programs to support rapid economic recovery and the stabilization of the Zimbabwe dollar. 
   It allocates an initial US$16 million for alternative land reform programs under the Inception Phase of the Land Reform and Resettlement Program--including acquisition and resettlement costs. 
   It directs the establishment of a ``Southern Africa Finance Center'' in Zimbabwe which will serve as a joint office for the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade Development Agency to pursue, facilitate and underwrite American private investment in Zimbabwe and the region. 
   Mr. President, the future stability of Zimbabwe is in the United States national interest. That future is dependent on the viability of the democratic legal and economic institutions in Zimbabwe which are currently under assault. It is clear that the United States must support those individuals and institutions, both during the current assaults and especially if they gain in elections. 
   This legislation offers clear support for democratic institutions and the rule of law now, and it provides aggressive future United States economic and institutional support for a transition to democracy, including real land reform based on equitable distribution and title to the land. 
   In the end, President Mugabe may simply dismiss all international and internal pressure. He has both the power to do so and increasingly seems to have the inclination, despite the costs. Even so, the United States cannot be intimidated or compromised. We must act decisively and quickly to support the democratic institutions upon which he is waging war. It is upon the fate of those institutions and individuals which so much of Africa's future depends.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, many of us associate cardiovascular disease with men, but the American Heart Association estimates that nearly one in two women will die of heart disease or stroke. Unfortunately, most women do not realize that they are at such high risk for cardiovascular disease because of its historically male stereotype. In fact, cardiovascular diseases kill nearly 50,000 more women each year than men. Even more alarming is a recent survey reported by the Society for Women's Health Research which revealed that not all physicians know that cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death among American women. 
   Each year nearly half a million women lose their lives as a result of heart disease and stroke. Since 1984, fortunately, men have experienced a decline in deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, while, unfortunately, women have not. Tragically, many of these deaths could have been prevented. Had these women known they were at risk  for cardiovascular disease, they could have taken preventive measures by not smoking, lowering their cholesterol or blood pressure, or by eating more nutritiously, and perhaps prevented becoming a victim of heart disease or stroke. For many women, prevention is truly the only cure, since it has been reported that as many as two-thirds of women who die from heart attacks have no warning symptoms of any kind. 
   Cardiovascular diseases kill more American females each year than the next 14 causes of death combined, including all forms of cancers. Over half of all cardiovascular deaths each year are women, and in 1997 alone heart diseases claimed the lives of 502,938 women. My home state of Tennessee has the second highest death rate from heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in the nation and the 13th highest ranking state in women's heart deaths. In 1997, 10,884 Tennessee women died from these two cardiovascular diseases alone. According to the CDC, women in the rural South are more likely to die of heart disease than those in other parts of the country. An even more disturbing disparity is that the age adjusted death from coronary heart disease for African-American women is nearly 72 percent higher than that of white women. 
   Fortunately, some preventive measures, such as physical activity and better nutrition, can be taken by women to reduce their risk for cardiovascular diseases, as well as other preventable diseases, such as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, affecting one out of every two over 50, is also a preventable disease that American women are facing. Furthermore, osteoporosis is a health threat for roughly 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women. 
   In an effort to continue to draw attention and greater awareness to health issues among American women, particularly cardiovascular diseases, I am very pleased to introduce today the ``WISEWOMAN Expansion Act of 2000,'' with Senator HARKIN. Our goal in expanding this program is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and other preventable diseases, and to increase access to screening and other preventive measures for low-income and underinsured women. In addition to making cardiovascular diseases screening accessible to underserved women, this program will also educate them about their risk for cardiovascular diseases and how to make lifestyle changes thus giving them the power to prevent these diseases. 
   The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is an example of a successful program that has provided critical services to help prevent major diseases affecting American women. The NBCCEDP has done an outstanding job of bringing in low-income underinsured women and providing them with preventive screenings for breast and cervical cancers. The women who benefit from this program are generally too young for Medicare, unable to qualify for Medicaid or other state programs, and would otherwise fall through the cracks in our health system. 
   Our bill provides for the expansion of the WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women in Massachusetts, Arizona, and North Carolina) demonstration project, which is run by the CDC in conjunction with the NBCCEDP, to additional states. The WISEWOMAN program capitalizes on the highly successful infrastructure of the NBCCEDP to offer ``one-stop shopping'' screening and preventive services for uninsured and low-income women. In addition to these very important breast and cervical cancer screenings, WISEWOMAN screens for cardiovascular disease risk factors and provides health counseling and lifestyle interventions to help women reduce behavioral risk factors. The program addresses risk factors such as elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and smoking and provides important additional intervention and educational services to women who would not otherwise have access to cardiovascular disease screening or prevention. This bill also adds flexibility to the program language that would allow screenings and other preventive measures for diseases in addition to cardiovascular diseases, such as osteoporosis, as more preventive technology is developed. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank Judy Womack and Dr. Joy Cox of the Tennessee Department of Health for their counsel and assistance on this legislation and for their efforts in helping Tennesseans. 
   This bipartisan bill is supported by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the Society for Women's Health Research, the American Cancer Society, the National Osteoporosis Foundation, and the American Heart Association. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place the following letters of support in the RECORD.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the showdown in Sierra Leone between the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the United Nations peacekeepers they have taken hostage, robbed, killed and humiliated has enormous implications for the future of the United Nations. It is a sort of Midway Island for UN peacekeeping: a loss there could doom future operations across the continent, and possibly further afield. However, a frantic effort to salvage the UN operation there by reinstating the unjust peace accord may win the battle for peace keeping operations in the short run, but it could be devastating for the UN and for Sierra Leone in the long run. 
   The Clinton administration and the United Nations have staked an unusual amount of capital on a successful UN mission in Sierra Leone. After the UN's shocking withdrawal from Rwanda in the days before the genocide began, a success in African peacekeeping became a must for the embattled Kofi Annan, who oversaw that withdrawal and later became Secretary-General. 
   The Clinton administration's motives for backing a massive UN peacekeeping operation agreement is harder to understand beyond a history of making multilateralization itself a foreign policy goal. With an almost mantra-like regularity, they have touted ``African solutions for African problems.'' Yet two ``African solutions'' to the conflict in Sierra Leone were abandoned. In 1995-96, 300 South African mercenaries drove rebels from the capital and the major diamond fields, brought them to the negotiating table and set the stage for elections. Predictably, under donor pressure, they were forced to leave and the war resumed. Later, Nigeria led a West African intervention force and again restored peace by aggressively pursuing the sadistic but cowardly RUF. 
   Both of these ``African solutions'' were dropped because they conflicted with the dreamy notion that says a UN mission can end a war of unspeakable barbarity without getting its hands dirty. The West African regional force cost a fraction of the UN mission and actually brought a modicum of peace to Sierra Leone, yet the administration never even requested from Congress the $25 million needed to continue their presence. Instead, the Nigerians were given blue helmets and impotent rules of engagement then ``reinforced'' with Kenyan, Indian and Zambian troops that have been robbed of their weapons and taken hostage. The U.S. portion of the price tag for this disaster soared to $118 million for next fiscal year alone. 
   The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone and the frantic effort to salvage it now would be defensible if the Lom&#233; accord had ever been a viable peace. The agreement rewarded the rape, mutilation, forced conscription of children and killing campaign of the RUF with the vice-presidency, cabinet positions and exclusive domain over the diamond fields. Literally the only portion of the agreement implemented since it was signed in July of last year is the most outrageous and inexplicable: recognition of the RUF as a political party and a part of the government. 
   With the Lom&#233; accord the RUF was given the privilege of reaping both the benefits of peace and the benefits of war simultaneously. It was a tragic and shameful contradiction that was obvious from the beginning. Because a successful UN peace agreement and peacekeeping operation had itself become the goal, rather than stability for Sierra Leone and defeat of the RUF, the contradiction was ignored. It was this self-delusion that was the West's greatest disservice to Sierra Leone, far exceeding our refusal to send our own troops. 
   Because the potential failure of the UN in Sierra Leone has made it high noon for all peacekeeping in Africa, including Congo, we may be in the process of repeating the mistakes of Lom&#233; simply to win a short term battle for multilateralism. Making a deal with the devil once is unwise, making it twice is unforgivable. Trying to force the reality of the brutality and recidivism of the RUF and the failure of the Lom&#233; accord to conform to our sense of order and to our desire for ``clean hands'' verges on international sociopathy. 
   I am not suggesting that we end the peace mission in Sierra Leone, but we cannot repeat the mistakes of the Lom&#233; accord by again rewarding the RUF. To do so would set up a repeat of the current tragedy for Sierra Leone and indignity for the UN. Whether under the auspice of the UN or Nigeria, the rules of engagement in Sierra Leone must be realistic and aggressive. Most of all, we must seek accountability for the horrific war crimes committed there. It will be bloody and hard to watch, but not as horrific as the RUF has proven to be. For the sake of the suffering Sierra Leoneans we are supposed to be helping, accountability  for criminals and justice for their victims cannot again be sacrificed to our own intellectual impulses.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Mother's Day 2000, half a million mothers and others marched on Washington to demonstrate their fury at the number of children killed by gun violence last year. Their goal: to convince Congress to pass even more laws restricting citizen access to handguns. All in all, it was quite a spectacle. But while it reflects the modern American view that every ill can be remedied through the power of law, it seems to me the real--and only--question to be answered is will more laws actually produce the result we all seek? 
   Before we can answer that question, Mr. President, we must examine this one: is the recent spate of gun violence involving children the result of rising levels of crime and escalating gun ownership, or something else? 
   Let's look at the facts: 
   During the 1060s, 1970s, and 1980s, gun violence increased dramatically. During the 1990s, however, the numbers actually began to decline, with school violence of the type exhibited at Columbine falling precipitously to the point where kids today are probably the safest they've been in decades. 
   In 1996 (the last year for which statistics are available), 1,134 Americans died in accidental shootings--the lowest level ever recorded. Only 42 were under the age of 10. Yet more than 2,400 10-year-olds died that year in motor vehicle accidents, another 800 were drowned, and well over 700 died from fire. As for the danger of guns in homes, only about 30 people each year are accidently killed by homeowners who believe they are shooting an intruder, as opposed to 330 who are accidentally killed by police. 
   So why are the numbers declining? While there could be lots of reasons--tougher judges, stiffer penalties, and little mercy for repeat offenders--it's also interesting to note that the decline in murder and violent crime has paralleled an increase in gun ownership. 
   Mr. President, today about 80 millions Americans, or 40 percent of the population, own almost 250 million firearms, as compared with about 27 percent in 1988. And in states like Texas where citizens are allowed to carry concealed weapons, the number of murders, assaults, and burglaries has dropped dramatically. Significantly, in 15 states with tough gun control measures including the trigger locks and ``safe storage'' laws moms on the Mall were rallying for, there were--accordingly to Mr. LOTT--3,600 more rapes, 22,500 more robberies, and 64,000 more burglaries. Could it be that criminals are smart enough to know where they're likely to encounter resistance and where it's easiest to operate? 
   Mr. President, there is nothing more tragic than losing a child. And nothing more wonderful than mothers fighting to keep their children safe from harm. But before any war can be won, we must understand the enemy and develop a strategy to defeat him. In the war against gun violence, the enemy is not the weapon, but the criminal who uses it. Making it easier for him to win by restricting those who could thwart his evil act, or deter it in the first place, is not the answer. 
   Marching on the Mall is stirring spectacle, but ending the tragedy of gun violence requires a much more serious solution. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Youth Smoking Reduction Act, along with my colleague, Senator MCCAIN. The purpose of this bill is to diminish the number of children who start to smoke or use other tobacco products, while at the same time trying to reduce the risk such products pose to adults who make the ill-advised--but legal--choice to use these products. 
   Mr. President, each day, more than 3,000 kids become regular smokers. That's about one million per year. Currently more than 4 million children 12 to 17 years old smoke. Sadly, more than 5 million children alive today will die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses, unless current trends are reversed. 
   Adults almost always start smoking as children. According to a 1994 Surgeon General report, nearly 90 percent of adults who smoke took his or her first puff at or before the age of 18. Moreover, youth smoking is on the rise! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that smoking rates for students in grades 9 through 12 increased from 27.5 percent in 1991 to 36.4 percent in 1997. In my own state of Tennessee, 38 percent of all high school students smoke compared to just 26 percent of Tennessee adults. 
   Mr. President, we should all be alarmed by these statistics. Before my election to the United States Senate, I was a heart and lung transplant surgeon. I have held hundreds and hundreds of lungs in my hands that were ravaged by years of smoking. I've performed hundreds of coronary artery bypass heart operations to repair damage accelerated by smoking. When you've seen the damage that cigarettes can cause to the human body, it is a powerful motive to find a way to try to prevent children from ever starting the habit. After all, as the statistics suggest, if you keep a child from smoking, he'll probably never start as an adult. 
   Many factors account for a child's decision to smoke. One concerns the easy access of tobacco products to our nation's youth. For too long, cigarettes have been readily available to those who are too young to purchase them legally, whether through vending machines or by pilfering them from self-service displays. 
   Another heavily-researched factor is the role that advertising has in stimulating children to smoke. According to a 1995 study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, teens are more likely to be influenced to smoke by cigarette advertising than they are by peer pressure. In 1994 the CDC determined that 86 percent of children who smoke prefer Marlboro, Camel and Newport--the three most heavily advertised brands--compared to only about one-third of adult smokers. When advertising for the ``Joe Camel'' campaign jumped from $27 million to $43 million, between 1989 and 1993, Camel's share among youth increased by more than 50 percent, while its adult market share did not change at all. 
   There have been efforts made during the last decade to curb and eliminate children 
   smoking. In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration promulgated a rule which would have reduced youth access to tobacco by banning most cigarette vending machines and requiring that retailers verify the age of all over the counter sales. The rule would also address advertising to children by restricting advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds, restricting outdoor ads and ads in publication with a significant teen readership to black and white text only. 
   The rule was controversial, particularly some of the advertising restrictions. It was made even more controversial by the fact that many in Congress did not believe that FDA had ever been given the authority to regulate tobacco. 
   During the 105th Congress, Senator MCCAIN introduced S. 1415, the tobacco settlement bill, which was a comprehensive response to the landmark tobacco settlement of 1997. As part of that bill, I drafted provisions which set up a framework for the FDA to regulate tobacco. The tobacco settlement bill did not pass the Senate, which killed my effort during the 105th Congress to have FDA regulate tobacco in an attempt to keep the product away from children. 
   Thus, Congress has never delegated to the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco. On March 21, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that FDA lacked any authority to regulate tobacco  products. It was obvious to the Court that Congress never intended for the FDA to treat tobacco products as drugs subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
   The National Youth Smoking Reduction Act, which we introduce today, would for the first time give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. 
   This authority would not flow from treating nicotine as a drug and tobacco products as drug delivery devices. That's what the FDA has already tried to do, by trying to force tobacco products under Chapter 5 of the existing Act. To me, this is like taking a square peg and trying to put it in a round hole; it just doesn't fit. Chapter 5 calls on the Secretary to determine whether the regulatory actions taken will provide reasonable assurance of the ``safety and effectiveness'' of the drug or the device. Well, clearly, tobacco is neither safe nor effective, as those terms are understood in the Act. We know that tobacco kills. That has clearly been demonstrated over the last 35 years. You can talk about the effectiveness of a pacemaker or a heart valve or an artificial heart; you can talk about those devices as being safe and effective. You really cannot apply that standard to tobacco. Therefore, instead of taking tobacco and ramming it through the drug and device provisions, I felt it was important to look at the unique nature of tobacco, and regulate it under a new chapter, which we designate as Chapter 9. This gives FDA the flexibility to create a new standard that was appropriate for tobacco products. 
   Chapter 9 requires manufacturers to submit to the FDA information about the ingredients, components and substances in their products. It empowers the FDA to set performance standards for tobacco products, by which FDA can try to reduce the risk posed by these products. It gives FDA the power to regulate the sale, distribution, access to, and advertising of tobacco products to try to prevent children from smoking. It also gives the FDA the power to revise and improve the warning labels contained on tobacco product packages and advertising. Last, it gives FDA the power to encourage tobacco manufacturers--who probably know more about the products than even FDA's scientists--to develop and market ``reduced risk'' products for adults who are regular users of tobacco. 
   In short, our bill represents a powerful, initial grant of authority to the FDA to regulate tobacco. 
   We think the bill, as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the need to promote the public health and the recognition that adults may legally choose to smoke. I very strongly believe that, should Congress act to give FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, this legislation will be the template. 
   Six years ago, I was saving lives as a heart and lung surgeon. I saw the ravages of tobacco in the operating room. The people of Tennessee elected me to use common sense to advance the public good. I submit that crafting a comprehensive approach to keep children from smoking is a chance for the Senate to save lives through the exercise of common sense.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lieberman amendment, although let me say right up front that there are several principles that are underscored in the amendment in which I believe wholeheartedly and that are reflected in the underlying bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The whole idea of being able to collapse programs into a manageable number and the emphasis on student achievement are two concepts which are very important as we look forward to how best to educate the current and future generations of children in areas in which we are failing. 
   I remain very concerned, though, with the specifics of the Lieberman amendment in terms of the formula, the impact it has on a number of districts in Tennessee. The focus on teachers, which I believe is appropriate, in terms of it being critical that we develop an opportunity for every child to be in a classroom with an excellent quality teacher is an important one, although maintaining this whole approach of 100,000 teachers and dictating that from above is something I simply cannot support.  
   We just voted on an amendment which I believe directs us in a much better, more optimistic, potentially more beneficial direction, and that is empowering teachers, attracting teachers, and recruiting teachers through the alternative certification process in that amendment. Careers to Classrooms is what it is called. 
   We have not had the opportunity to adequately explain the importance of this now-accepted amendment, but it is important to understand and for us to spend a few minutes on it because it does underscore the importance of having high-quality teachers, attracting teachers, keeping them in that position because of the demographics and the shift we are going to see in teachers and retiring teachers. 
   This careers-to-classrooms approach complements what is in the underlying bill, that part of the bill that applies to teachers and is called the Teacher Empowerment Act. I have worked carefully and closely with Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON from Texas in crafting this careers-to-classroom aspect of the bill. 
   As we look forward, it is important to understand the importance of that high-quality person, not just a person at the head of the classroom, but that high-quality teacher. 
   This aspect of the bill expands the national activities section of the underlying bill to allow additional funds for States that want, that wish, that choose to attract new people into the teaching profession through what is called an alternative certification process. 
   We have all heard about the impending teacher shortage. It is something that has been discussed on the floor. It is something that Americans today do understand. The Department of Education estimates we will need about 2.2 million new teachers over the next decade. That 2.2 million is necessary for two reasons: No. 1, because of enrollment increases and, No. 2, to offset the large number of teachers, the so-called baby boomer teachers, who will be retiring over the next several years. 
   It is interesting to note that the severe shortages tend to be in areas that are either the most urban or the most rural. Even more interesting is if you look at the alternative certification processes that have been in effect, for example, in New Jersey, where there has been such a program for 15 years, it is in those most urban areas and those most rural areas that the alternative certification process has had the most beneficial and the most powerful impact. The underlying focus in the bill, made stronger by this amendment, is that it is not only numbers of teachers but, indeed, it is the quality of those teachers we have in the classrooms. 
   This amendment, and now the bill, directs resources to strengthen and improve teacher quality. There is a professor at the University of Tennessee whose name is William Sanders. He pioneered this concept of a value-added system of measuring the effectiveness of a teacher. His research clearly demonstrates that it is teacher quality more than any other variable that can be isolated, including class size, including demographics, that affects student achievement. He says the following:  
   When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.  
   At the University of Rochester, Eric Hanushek has said, and I begin the quotation:  
   The difference between a good and a bad teacher can be a full level of achievement in a single year.  
   The research of the importance of the quality of the teacher goes on and on. Again, as the statistics have shown, we have 12th grade students in the United States ranking near the bottom of international comparisons in math and science; where today most companies that are looking for future employees dismiss the value of a high school diploma; where we know that high school graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed as college graduates. 
   The statistics go on and on. No longer can we afford as a society to have this increasingly illiterate population continue. 
   It comes back to having a good quality teacher in the classroom, and today too many teachers in America lack proper preparation in the subjects they teach. Tennessee, my State, actually does a pretty good job overall, I believe, because they say a teacher has to have at least a major or a minor in the subject they are going to teach. Therefore, when we have these gradings of States on how well they do, we always get an A in this category of having a major or a minor. 
   Even in Tennessee, 64 percent of teachers teaching physical science do not have a minor in the subject. Among history teachers, nearly 50 percent did not major or minor in history. 
   Other States do much worse. 
   Mr. President, 56 percent of those teaching physics and chemistry, 53 percent of those teaching history, 33 percent of those teaching math do not have a major or minor in the field they teach. We know this content is critically important to the quality of that teacher. 
   In closing, let me again say what this amendment does. It seeks to position a State, if they so wish, to have as good an opportunity as possible to recruit teachers. It actually helps States to recruit students and professionals into the teaching profession if they have not been in the teaching profession--both top-quality students who have majored in academic subjects as well as midcareer professionals who have special expertise in core subject areas. We want teachers teaching math to have majored or have an understanding of the content of math. We want teachers teaching science who have majored in and truly love science. It makes for a better teacher. 
   What this amendment does is help draw students and professionals into teaching, attracting a new group, a new pool of people into the field of teaching, different kinds of people, all through this alternative certification process. 
   We all know it is hard today, among our graduates, to attract the very best into teaching, given the barriers that are there, given the traditional certification process. Through this amendment Senator HUTCHISON and I have drafted, we provide resources to States that wish to offer these alternative certification programs to help them establish such new programs to recruit students, professionals, and others, into the teaching profession. 
   I am very excited that this amendment has strengthened the underlying bill. These alternative certification stipends will help provide a seamless transition for students and professionals who make that change, that movement from school or careers, and embark upon a new career in teaching. 
   Shortly, this afternoon, Senator HUTCHISON will come down and elaborate on this particular program. Again, I am very proud to be a part of helping this new generation of teachers and future teachers address the problems we all know exist in our education system today. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief remarks about an usual letter I received on behalf of forty-seven leaders of the nation's premier high technology companies, universities, and labor organizations. This is the first time in its history that the Council on Competitiveness, a non-profit organization dedicated to strengthening U.S. innovation, has sent such a letter to Congress on behalf of its outstanding membership. The message is loud and clear: substantially increased funding for R&D is necessary to continue our national economic success and our international leadership. 
   Michael Porter, noted professor at the Harvard School of Business stated, ``the key to U.S. competitiveness is innovation--the ability to deliver products, processes, and services that cannot be easily or inexpensively produced elsewhere. Data shows that the U.S. is strong, but that a number of other countries are successfully making the transition from imitator to innovator.'' Economists argue that such an investment in innovation, through its impact on economic growth, will not drain our resources, but will actually improve our country's fiscal standing. 
   Current economic expansion and growth, however, cannot be maintained if we do not provide the necessary funds and incentives to perform critical R&D throughout the scientific disciplines. During the 1990s, the funding for math has declined 20 percent, physics has declined 20 percent, chemistry has dropped by 10 percent and engineering has dropped 30-40 percent. These reductions have the combined effect of eroding the base from which new technologies can be derived. 
   The Government plays a critical role in driving the innovation process in the United States. The majority of the federal government's basic R&D is directed toward critical missions to serve the public interest in areas including health, environmental pollution control, space exploration, and national defense. Federal funds support nearly 60 percent of the nation's basic research, with a similar share performed  in colleges and universities. It is this fundamental research, combined with a strong talent pool, that ultimately drives the innovation process. 
   Throughout my career in the Senate, I have spent a considerable amount of time advocating for greater funding levels for civilian R&D. Together with many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I have been trying to educate others on the value of the federal government's role in funding merit-based and peer-reviewed programs. One only has to look at lasers, mechanical cardiac assist devices, and automatic internal defibrillators to find an examples of prudent federal investments in R&D. 
   The Federal Research Investment Act, which I authored with Senators ROCKEFELLER, DOMENICI, and LIEBERMAN, passed the Senate last July for the second year in a row. Yet it has unfortunately languished in the House. The bill would double the amount of federally-funded civilian R&D over an eleven year period, while at the same time, establishing strong accountability mechanisms. I believe that a balanced portfolio of research across all scientific disciplines will enable our national economy to continue to grow and to raise our standard of living. 
   We rally around increased federal funding for basic R&D, yet we are faced with daunting prospects each year of drastic cuts in the federal investment. Somehow, we are stuck in the same position each year of trying to convince Congress of R&D's necessity to the well-being of our nation, as we confront very real budgetary limitations. We must set priorities. While I strongly believe that Congress must strive to stay within the budget caps, I also firmly believe that funding for R&D should be allowed to grow in fiscal year 2001 and beyond. 
   As a result of the current fiscal environment in Congress and the desire to utilize the surplus prudently, I am confident that investing in basic R&D, and in turn the technological innovation of the future, is a proper use of the federal taxpayers dollars. This pivotal need for a resurgence in basic R&D investments is evident when we further consider our nation's increased dependency on technology and the global competition that threatens our sustained leadership position. R&D drives the innovation process, which in turn drives the U.S. economy. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the nation's future prosperity. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank the Council on Competitiveness again for it poignant statement and strongly encourage each of my colleagues to consider its message as we continue to make budgeting decisions this year.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Democratic alternative because I believe it inadequately addresses the issues and the things which we feel so strongly about--flexibility, innovation, and creativity at the local level; strong accountability; a child-centered education program, focusing on the child, not the system in Washington DC; flexibility, accountability, high standards, and, again, child-centeredness. 
   We have an opportunity, over the course of the next several days, to continue to build on themes that we debated, I believe, very effectively, last year on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act--Ed-Flex, as it came to be known. Ed-Flex was a bill that was signed by the President, which stresses flexibility, accountability, local control, and stripping away the Washington redtape. Over the last several days, we have heard statistics quoted again and again about how we are doing better in education today and citing new programs that have been introduced and new money spent in the  traditional old ways, to explain that we are doing better. 
   I think it is absolutely critical that we in this body and people around the United States recognize we are not doing better. American 12th graders rank 19th out of 21 industrialized countries in mathematics achievement. In science, my own field--remember, math and science serve so much as the foundation of what is going to occur in our economy, in job creation and global competitiveness, as we work to the future. In science, we are not 1st, or 5th, or 10th, or 15th in the world; we are 16th out of 21 nations. If you look at physics or advanced physics, we are dead last when we compare ourselves to other nations. 
   If we look at 12th graders, those people you would think were best positioned to enter the world of this new economy, since 1983 over 10 million Americans reached the 12th grade without having learned to read at a basic level. Over 20 million have reached their senior year unable to do basic math. We have heard that in the fourth grade--although we have made slight improvements--77 percent of children in urban, high-poverty schools are reading below the basic level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
   So as we hear the debate unfold, basically saying that progress is being made, this is the foundation, these are the facts, and this is where we are today: Little or no progress has been made. If you look longitudinally at how we are doing in various fields in the last 30 years, when you compare us internationally, that flat curve of not doing better has to be compared to the fact that other countries around the world, competitors, other members of the global economy, are doing much better. That lack of achievement, that lack of accountability, that lack of progress is really what we are debating today. For whom? For our children. For that next generation. 
   I mentioned Ed-Flex. The purpose of Ed-Flex was basically to begin that process, that debate, of getting rid of the Washington redtape. We heard again that the Federal programs account for about 50 percent of the bureaucratic redtape that our teachers at the local levels, back in all of our local communities, suffer under each day. They want to teach, and they want to have that individual child become better educated. Yet in another Federal program, we have another set of regulations and we layer more and more redtape on their activities each day. 
   It is time for us to cut the redtape and remove these overly prescriptive--yes, well intentioned--programs that we see in the Democratic alternative just presented. It is well intended, but there are more programs, more of the same, cutting out that opportunity to capture an educational reform movement that is going on around the country today. If we look at what our schools and 
   principals and teachers want to do, the opportunity we have today in the underlying bill is to promote that innovation, that creativity, to take off those handcuffs, and capture that innovation of educational reform. 
   The bill that was just laid down--the Democratic alternative--is simply more of the same: more programs which cut out and reject the innovation and creativity which has the opportunity of accomplishing what the real goal must be, which is to take care of that individual child in a way that he becomes better educated. 
   Flexibility, combined with accountability, has to be our objective. The end result of the debate on education modernization, I call it, absolutely must and should be innovation--rewarding what works, and what doesn't work, putting it aside. That is captured in the underlying bill. 
   I had the opportunity on the Budget Committee--I serve on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee from which this bill has been debated and has emerged. I have had the opportunity also to serve on the Budget Committee, where we had a task force on education. For 6 to 8 months, we had a whole range of hearings and witnesses, both Democrats and Republicans, who came forward with a pretty uniform, simple, well-understood message after about the third or fourth witness, and that is that we have today in education, Federal education programs, almost a spider web of duplicative programs, oftentimes conflicting, each with their own bureaucracies, all trying to do something good, but resulting in this sprawling--like a spider web, behemoth, and it is hard to decipher what the incentives are to do better. 
   There has been no streamlining, no coordination over all these programs, which have been layered one on top of the other over the last 30 years. We have heard it again and again. This sort of spider web of responsibilities and conflicting programs--some people say there are 280 programs; some say there are 750 programs. The point is, there are a lot of programs, all aimed at that individual child, resulting in inefficiencies and waste and loss of focus on student achievement that is so apparent. 
   The sad part about that is, it ultimately gets translated into punishing our children today instead of helping our children today. There is a lack of educational progress, resulting in the international data I mentioned. Once again, instead of truly developing the full potential of the individual students, thousands, tens of thousands, are not being well educated in our schools today. 
   We filed a report based on our task force, and the No. 1 recommendation--because we heard so much again and again about the redtape, the burdensome regulations, tying hands of the individual teachers--the No. 1 recommendation out of the Budget Committee Task Force on Education was:  
   In light of the continuing proliferation of Federal categorical programs, the task force recommends that Federal education programs be consolidated. This effort should include reorganization at the Federal level and block grants for the States. The task force particularly favors providing States flexibility to consolidate all Federal funds into an integrated State strategic plan to achieve national educational objectives for which the State would be held accountable.  
   That is the No. 1 recommendation that came from this Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education. 
   This need for consolidation really could not be more clear. We had this backdrop of stagnant student performance, in spite of different statistics and studies that have been brought forward and purport to show minimal progress. We have to come to the general agreement that student performance has been stagnant--because it has been stagnant. In spite of that, we find not what you would think would be a very streamlined focus to the Federal effort, but a sprawling, unfocused effort that really is driven by a lack of the question, What works? 
   Let's support what works, and what doesn't work. Let's no longer feed, as we have done over the last 20 or 30 years and would continue in this Democratic alternative bill, things that do not work. The Democratic alternative unfortunately feeds, yes, some good things that work but also continues this institutionalization of things that do not work. 
   Our bill, we have heard, contains a very important demonstration project called Straight A's. It is a demonstration program. Earlier, Senator GREGG, again, drove home a very important point on the floor, within the last hour, that we are not in this demonstration program and in our underlying bill forcing anybody to do anything; that they have a choice. If a local school district or a State is unsatisfied with this duplicative Federal effort and the categorical programs that have redtape tied to them, under our bill they can, if they want to but don't have to, continue with the same programs. But they have other options. 
   In Straight A's, we give schools in school districts the flexibility if they want it. I can tell you that many of them want it based on the hearings we have had in our committee, or based on the budget task force. Their goal is to increase achievement. If they say it can be best achieved in a local community in Nashville, TN, or Alamo, TN, or Soddy-Daisy, TN, requiring them to make decisions and giving them the flexibility to accomplish that achievement to educate the children, then they, for the first time, will have choice under our bill. But under the Democratic alternative they will not have that flexibility to innovate and to create. 
   Under our bill, States don't have to, but they may elect to partner with the Federal Government to consolidate those elementary and secondary education funding sources. A State may  choose to remain just where they are today under our bill in the categorical program, but they will have a choice for the first time. 
   Under the Straight A's demonstration project, States that participate could choose to spend that Federal money in the way that is best for them. The contrast will be the Democratic approach that says: No, we in Washington, DC, can best judge what works best. In Soddy-Daisy, TN, at the school that is serving the hundreds of kids in Soddy-Daisy, basically Republicans say no; that the school should be able to make the choice on how to use those funds. Why? Because, in Soddy-Daisy, they might need textbooks and not another teacher, for example. They have already reduced class size, per se. They may need to hook up that computer to the T-1 line, to the fiber-optic cable, that comes a block away so they can take advantage of that access. Or they may need an afterschool program. They are the ones--not us in Washington, DC, and not those of us in this Chamber--who are in the best position to make those decisions. 
   State and local school districts, I mentioned earlier, are attempting to be innovative today. They recognize that things are not working. I think it is, without question, based on the data we have listened to as we go back to our districts and in our various hearings, that it is the local school districts and the States that are the real engines for change, that recognize the needs, and are responding to those needs with innovative programs. They are yelling and crying out to take away these regulatory handcuffs and this excessive regulatory burden and redtape that strangles them and keeps that innovation from bursting forth. 
   It is teachers, it is parents, it is principals, and it is local communities who are demonstrating on a daily basis their enthusiasm and desire calling for this choice and increased flexibility. 
   Although the Federal Government--both the Congress and the President--is prepared to assist in improving America's schools, I think it is for all of us to remember that there are limitations. 
   We have heard it on this floor. There are limitations in terms of the Federal role in education. In Tennessee, funding for education in our local schools is about 9-percent Federal funding and 91-percent local, community, and State. 
   There are not Federal teachers. There are not Federal classrooms. There are not Federal principals. Virtually all learning in America is occurring in classrooms and in homes outside of the purview of the Federal Government. But the Federal Government, tied to that 9 percent in Tennessee or 7 percent nationally, has this excessive regulatory burden which strips resources out of our local communities. 
   The Federal Government clearly plays an important role. Since we are failing so miserably, I argue, nationally, and thus, we are failing internationally in this increasingly global world, I believe the Federal Government must provide the leadership to identify the problems of education in K through 12 in this country as one that is clearly worthy of the collected energy and the attention of all Americans. 
   Yes, incremental resources both at the local and the national level are likely to be required and to be increased over time. But it is absolutely essential, along with the resources we provide today, that we give the States and the local communities the freedom to pursue their own strategies for implementation in how to identify the needs and thoughts of local communities. 
   State strategic plans are something that we, as a Federal Government, should support. It is allowed under our bill. It is encouraged under our bill. In fact, under such a plan the States would establish concrete, specific educational goals. 
   As we address this whole issue of accountability of what they do in return for this flexibility, they would also establish at the State level or at the local level very specific standards for accountability, and timetables for achievement. In return, they would be allowed to pool the Federal funds from all of the categorical programs that we built here in Washington, DC, and spend those consolidated resources in States on locally established priorities. Accountability is absolutely critical. Traditionally, accountability in the Federal perspective has been very much on quantitative measures rather than qualitative ones. 
   We talk about how many students are being served by title I. Everybody knows by now that title I is the Federal program with $8 billion aimed at disadvantaged students. But we have not asked how well those students are doing. Again, is it child-centered? That is so important in the underlying bill. Is it child-centered and focused on how well that student is doing? How much is that student learning? How much is that achievement gap narrowing? We haven't asked that question. Now is the time. The underlying bill links that flexibility to accountability and to asking those fundamental questions. 
   The issue of partisanship comes forward again and again. Although both sides of the aisle say, yes, education is important, and, yes, we need to do better, the partisanship is interesting because people are painting the Straight A's component as partisan. 
   Again, the Straight A's demonstration project, flexibility, accountability, local control, choice--not forced choice but the free choice, is a partisan measure. 
   During a budget education task force meeting, it was fascinating for me to hear from the Democratic officials from the Chicago school system, who said the most important thing is flexibility. They credit much of their progress in reforming the system which they adopted to the so-called block grants, the block grants which the other side is attempting to vilify. If you talk to Chicago, which is really a model in terms of flexibility and accountability, they attribute much of their success to the use of block grants that allow flexibility to rise forth to capture the innovation and the creativity that emerges once you take away these regulatory handcuffs. 
   The Chicago officials were clear:  
   We know the system and we believe we know the things that it needs to have in order to improve. So, the more flexibility we have with Federal and State funds, the easier it is to make those changes.  
   The partisanship we should put aside. Effective education policy absolutely should not be bound by party lines. We can have disagreements. We will say more flexibility, more local controls, child-centeredness. The other side may say another government program is the answer. That is a legitimate debate. But let's set the partisanship aside. 
   The Florida Commissioner of Education said:  
   We, at the State and local level, feel the crushing burden caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures and mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to administer inflexible categorical Federal programs that divert precious dollars away from raising student achievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the misguided one size fits all command and control approach.  
   The concept of command and control clearly is one that we believe and believe strongly has not worked in the past and is something we should no longer rely upon as we march into the next century, recognizing the importance of a foundation of strong education for our children. 
   The Department of Education, when they testified before our task force, in many ways agreed there needs to be simplification. We have so many categorical programs. Testifying before the task force, Secretary Riley said the Department had eliminated 64 programs. Then just several weeks later, we had the General Accounting Office tell us the Department still oversees 244 programs. 
   Seeing the Department recognizes the importance of streamlining and consolidation leaves me a bit perplexed as to why the Department opposes the principles in our underlying bill. Under our bill, we allow choice between the current system and a more consolidated approach--not forcing consolidation, but a choice for consolidation. 
   If we were doing so well today, as we have heard again and again from the other side, I do wonder why they fear all the States will choose to participate in our Straight A's demonstration program, if they really think the categorical system is working so well. 
   I understand why the administration opposes our proposal. We do say we should not be micromanaging K-through-12 education for all of the 80,000 public schools out there out of Washington, DC. It means, for example,  if the administration has an agenda item, it would be increasingly difficult to impose that on a local community if the local community says you are wrong. That is not what is needed. That does not meet the needs we have identified based on our experience in a local community. 
   In the last several days, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that Straight A's does not have any guarantee that the money will be spent the way ``it is intended.'' We have heard it again and again. I ask that fundamental question, the way ``who'' intended it be spent? Do we really think we in the Senate with the range of issues that we deal with, with the distance of being in Washington, DC, can speak for each individual school and the individual needs identified by that local school? Or is it the local teachers and administrators and educators who have been in the education business for years. Do we really think we know better than they what schools need to be successful? Are we so arrogant and think so much of our own thoughts to believe that without our individual programs that are targeted for specific purposes, our schools would not undertake specific efforts to reduce class size, to recruit quality teachers to the classroom, or 
   to modernize their schools? 
   We have heard in the last several days from Democrats who have called the Straight A's demonstration project a blank check. Anybody who has read the bill or who has studied what Straight A's is all about simply cannot call it a blank check. For the first time, we are actually requiring States to show results. This bill looks at results, student achievement. It must be documented. We are requiring States to show for the first time how they are helping disadvantaged students reduce the achievement gap. 
   An editorial today in the Washington Post was interesting. It decries Straight A's for removing targeting requirements on Federal dollars. The editorial says:  
   It makes no sense that States somehow need the right to shift funds away from low-income schools in order to narrow the achievement gap between the lowest and highest achieving students.  
   Apparently, the editorial board encourages us to vote Straight A's down to protect the flow of money to the poorest schools. 
   It misses the point. The point is this Federal flow of money has done nothing for children in the poorest schools except to make us feel good; to say, yes, we are doing something. If you look at the objective results, we have done nothing. Report after report shows our poorest students are getting further and further behind. If you go back to our bill, you will see why we stress measurable results in reducing the achievement gap, linking it to the devotion and the investment of resources. 
   It requires you send the money to poor schools. In the underlying bill, S. 2, we have infused the fact that new responsibilities must be coupled with ensuring that students are actually learning, that standards are increasing, that we are doing what education is all about, and that is educating those individual students. 
   States must have measures in place to ensure that all children, poor and nonpoor, meet proficient levels of achievement within 10 years. What better catalyst for reform is there? What better way to ensure that poor children receive the same quality of education as their wealthier counterparts than requiring--which is what our bill does--that States demonstrate their poor children are achieving? 
   School districts should be allowed to use the Federal funds in the most effective way to reverse the trends I opened my comments with, trends which show us falling further and further behind as we compare our students in the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades internationally. 
   In the First in the World Consortium schools located outside of Chicago, administrators poured significant amounts of money into improving teacher quality through intensive professional development. The results, unlike the rest of America in the statistics which I quoted from the Third International Math and Science Study, which show we are falling behind, were just the opposite in the consortium than what we are seeing nationally. They saw improvement. 
   Last week, I heard from innovative State superintendents from Texas and Georgia that several of their school districts discovered that their reading teachers did not know how to teach children to read so they invested significant dollars in retraining all of them in the research-proven, the documented methods of reading instruction. This is local control, local flexibility, local identification of needs; not mandating what districts need out of Washington, DC. It is reinforced when you think some districts may want to offer programs on a district-wide scale to entice better teachers into the school system and into some of the poorest performing schools. The funds might not be sent directly to those poor schools, but the quality teachers would. Because we know a high-quality teacher is the most important determinant of a student's achievement level, that would be good. It would be a wise use of those funds. Our bill allows the use of funds in those ways. 
   Isn't it possible that this approach might just be more effective than simply throwing money at a poor school? Demanding that accountability while giving the flexibility to use those funds in that way? 
   Radical changes in flexibility and accountability, I believe, are precursors to the sort of reforms we are witnessing at the local level in selected pockets. I mentioned Chicago. Many of us have quoted the reforms that have gone on in Texas. In 1988 and 1995, the Illinois State Legislature enacted sweeping reforms. The 1988 law gave unprecedented discretion to individual Chicago schools. The 1995 law gave the mayor an unprecedented role. In addition, the State legislature in Illinois has allowed the use of block grants for much of the funding for Chicago's schools. 
   According to Chicago school officials:  
   Most of our initiatives are locally-based, locally-funded, locally-developed by people who have been working in Chicago for many years. We know the system and we believe we know the things it needs to have happen in order to improve. So, the more flexibility we have with Federal and State funds, the easier it is for us to make those changes.  
   Remember, Straight A's is a demonstration project. It is not being forced on anybody. The school district, the State, can choose whether or not they want that increased flexibility or accountability. That is the beauty of the underlying Republican bill. 
   For the first time, Straight A's focuses on what matters most--the accountability, the achievement levels of the children who need the help the most. Under Straight A's, a State may do almost anything with the Federal money but--and the ``but'' is what you don't hear from the other side--but it has to prove it has increased the academic achievement of all of its students in the end. Poor kids, clearly, will be better served under this proposal. 
   Again, for the first time the object of the Straight A's Program is for States to focus on closing the achievement gap between those students who excel and those who do not, between rich and poor, between black and white; the achievement gap is to be closed. 
   The debate centers on flexibility, accountability, on child-centeredness, on local control. I have risen today to speak in opposition to the Democratic alternative which basically says those are not the principles, those are not the themes for the American people. The themes are another Federal program to add to the 760 programs that are out there. 
   The theme on the Democratic side is: We know what is best in Washington, DC. Republicans are basically saying: No, we do not know what is best. The people who know best are the people who are closest to our children, who do know their names and their faces, who are at the head of the classroom every day, teaching; those with the commitment, the teachers and the principals and the school superintendents and the parents--the parents, again, who understand, who see, whose input is so necessary as we answer that question of what works and what does not. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Madam President, it is a great opportunity we have as we debate over the next several days the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which makes fundamental improvements to education programs that are long in need of such reform. 
   Declining student performance, especially as we compare the performance of our students in public schools to the performance of students internationally, simply demands a new response. Our students deserve better. It is time to change our Federal education programs to ensure that school districts, schools, States, and parents have the tools they need to provide a high-quality education for all children. 
   As we look back over the last 30 or 40 years, there have been waves of education reform, but each of these waves seems to have been washed away as shifting sand, leaving little trace of permanent improvement in public education in this country. Even as funding has increased over time, performance has fallen, as we compare our students internationally, leaving teachers and parents to wonder if anything can be done to reclaim those years of lost potential. 
   There is, however, a new movement of education reform sweeping the United States of America. Because of it, we have a unique opportunity to significantly and permanently improve education in this country. We have the opportunity to see to it that every child in every public school in America is, indeed, challenged by standards as high as those hopes and those promises of his or her parents, and it is an opportunity we cannot and should not waste. 
   We must face today that schools that do not educate, 
   schools that do not teach, and will not change must in the future be held accountable. The diminished hopes of America's children as a result of our deteriorating public education--again most notable as we compare our schools and the performance of our students internationally--are sad and serious, and no longer can we ignore these diminished hopes. 
   We have an opportunity to and we must raise the academic ambition of every school. There are practical things we can do, such as lifting the burden of Federal bureaucracy by giving each school the opportunity, the flexibility, to change, all along demanding they be held accountable to high standards. 
   Mired in bureaucratic mediocrity, Government today has become almost an obstacle, a barrier, not an ally, and it is time for us in Washington to acknowledge that the Federal role in education is not just to serve the system but to actually serve the child. 
   Yes, Washington must realize that no longer can we attempt to micromanage the day-to-day activities in our schools. We in Washington must realize and must be wise enough to recognize that schools require more flexibility; they require more innovation; they require more freedom to be innovative. Washington must be strong enough to insist on improving performance in return for this flexibility.  
   All of us know the tremendous change that is occurring in the 21st century. We see it around us each and every day, and amidst this change we all know deep inside that the future is ultimately decided by how much our kids learn. Education is the key that will unlock the future for our children, and that positive, strong education, that preparation, must begin in those earliest years--kindergarten, 8th grade, 12th grade. Only successful learning will truly equip our children for this changing world, and it is time--and we do it in this bill--we begin to think boldly about this vision for education. 
   We need to ask the questions: What doors will we open for our children? What pictures are we going to paint for their future? Will we increase their capacity to learn and to explore or are we going to go back and continue to create and enforce barriers that have only failed us in the past, that are holding them back as our international counterparts continue to learn and pass them by? 
   Education is, as we will hear again and again, the most important gift we can give our children, but the foundation for all lifetime learning is established in these early years of K-12, where we are--and we must admit it--where we are today failing. More of the same is simply not the answer. 
   We have a choice: We can either turn a blind eye to the problems of education today and say, well, let's just add another Federal program, or let's accept mediocrity, or let's ignore accountability, or we can do what is bold, what is built into this underlying bill, and that is, give schools the flexibility to be innovative, give States the freedom to regulate, and give parents, who care the most about their children, the right to choose what is best for their children. 
   We have to admit it is going to take a lot more than the power of Washington to fix education in this country. We need the power of people at the local level--the parents, the teachers, the principals, the school superintendents--to help us discover and apply what works. Once they do, we must give them the freedom to apply what they learn. 
   I mentioned accountability. How can we get schools which are failing our children, not educating our children, to change, to improve? Yes, by giving them the resources they need, but also holding them accountable for their failure. Schools that succeed in educating children should be rewarded. Schools that fail again and again must be held accountable. We know that rewarding failure only produces more failure, condemning our children to a whole lifetime of low expectations. The issue is about excellence. 
   Today every child does have access to a public school, but not every one of those schools provides an adequate or quality education. 
   The issue of student performance: If we look at where we are today and just face the facts, it is absolutely critical that we recognize we are not doing as well as our children deserve. 
   In America, 12th graders today rank not 1st, not 5th, not 10th, not 15th, but 19th out of 21 industrialized countries in math achievement. 
   In the field of science, we are not 1st, or 5th, or 10th, or 15th, but we are 16th out of 21 nations. 
   If we look in the field of advanced physics, our students rank dead last. 
   Since 1983: 
   Over 10 million students have reached the 12th grade without learning to read at a basic level; 
   Over 20 million students have reached their senior year unable to do basic math; 
   Almost 25 million students have reached the 12th grade not knowing the essentials of U.S. history; and 
   Over 6 million Americans have dropped out of high school altogether.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the revolutionary idea that tomorrow might be better and that man can do something about it is distinctly American. At the heart of self-improvement is a quality education. 
   The purpose of a system of public education is to give every child an equal opportunity for success in life whether his parents are rich or poor, black or white. In order to ensure that every student has a solid base of knowledge from which to build, we must have high expectations and hold schools accountable for the performance of their students. 
   The American people and most members of Congress are in agreement that America's schools are not meeting this challenge. In fact, the longer our students attend school the further behind they fall in performance. More federal programs are not the answer. During the past three decades while student performance has stagnated, federal programs have proliferated. Today, our schools deny our children the basic principle of opportunity because they fail to adequately equip them for the future. 
   What we need is the courage to change. America has always met the challenges posed to it with innovation, creativity and ingenuity. So far, in the education debate, we have been denied the opportunity to tap into this resourcefulness. As a consequence, our students have been short-changed by the focus on a top-heavy education establishment rather than on the quality of their education. Business-as-usual is failing our children. 
   Unfortunately, for too long, our system of federal education programs has failed to provide all students with the opportunity for a quality education. We have left generations of students behind while we focused on inputs and rode the wave of education trend after education trend. 
   First it was ``whole language,'' which has now been repudiated as a singular method for teaching reading. Unlike other subjects, we have firm, scientific evidence on how children learn to read and what techniques teachers can employ to ensure that children learn how to read by the 3rd grade. Instruction grounded in phonics has been shown to be the most effective means of reading instruction. 
   The newest trend, the ``new, new math'' programs that the Department of Education has endorsed, have been repudiated for their ``serious mathematical shortcomings'' by 200 mathematicians and scientists, including four Nobel laureates. 
   And all this because the federal government knows best. 
   The response to stagnant test scores and a widening gap in achievement levels between poor and non-poor has been to spend more and more money on more and more programs--each targeted to address a specific purpose that the federal government has deemed most important. 
   I learned through my work as the chairman of the Budget Committee Task Force on Education that there are approximately 552 federal education programs. The Department of Education administers 244 of these programs, and even if you count only those ``providing direct and indirect instructional assistance to students in kindergarten through grade 12,'' the GAO found that there are still 69 programs. 
   Among these programs, overlap is pervasive. In my office, we call 
   this chart the ``spider web chart.'' This chart, prepared by the GAO, shows that 23 federal departments and agencies administer multiple federal programs to three targeted groups: teachers, at-risk and delinquent youth, and young children. For early childhood, for example, there are 90 programs in 11 agencies and offices. In fact, one disadvantaged child could be eligible for as many as 13 programs. 
   In addition, the effectiveness of many of these programs is doubtful or unknown. The GAO has expressed concern that the Department of Education does not know how well new or newly modified programs are being implemented, or to what extent established programs are working. The efficacy of Title I also remains uncertain. 
   According to the National Assessment of Educational Programs, 77 percent of children in high-poverty urban schools are reading ``below basic.'' 
   Test scores of 12th graders in math, reading and writing have remained stagnant or declined over the last 30 years and our 12th graders score near dead last in international comparisons. 
   Fourth grade students in high-poverty schools remain two grade levels behind their peers in low poverty schools in math. In reading they remain three to four grade levels behind. Contrary to the original objectives the ESEA program was designed to address, the achievement gap is now widening. 
   Half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time, if at all. 
   Seven thousand schools are failing, according to current accountability standards. Many have been failing for 4 or 6 years, in some cases even 10 years. Despite their long history of failure, these schools continue to receive federal funds. 
   Lastly, it should come as no surprise that so many programs and so much  confusion comes at great cost. Critics of the education establishment note that although federal funds make up only 7 percent of their budgets, they impose 50 percent of their administrative costs. As one concrete example, Frank Brogan, Florida's Commissioner of Education, has reported that it takes 297 state employees to oversee and administer $1 billion in federal funds. In contrast, only 374 employees oversee approximately $7 billion in state funds. Thus, it takes six times as many people to administer a federal dollar as a state dollar. 
   Brogan went on to say:  
   We at the State and local level feel the crushing burden caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to administer inflexible, categorical Federal programs that divert precious dollars away from raising student achievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the misguided, one-size-fits-all command and control approach. Most have the requisite focus on inputs like more regulation, increasing budgets, and fixed options and processes. The operative question in evaluating the effectiveness of these programs in usually: How much money have we put into the system?  
   Cozette Buckney, Chief Education Officer, of the Chicago school system echoed the sentiments of many state and local officials:  
   Excessive paperwork is a concern. Too many reports, the time lines for some of the reports, the cost factor involved, the administrative staff just do now warrant that kind of time on task. That is taking from what we need to do to make certain our students are achieving and our teachers are prepared.  
   Today, we have the opportunity to reverse these trends and to fundamentally reform our federal education system. 
   Today, we are unveiling a plan that reflects the spirit of innovation. At the core of this innovative effort is the need to galvanize leadership at the state and local level and to hold this leadership accountable. 
   The bill that we have before us here today is a good first step in that direction. 
   We focus on student achievement, centering on children, quality teachers, school safety, flexibility, and local control. 
   One, instead of inputs, our focus is on outputs--student achievement. 
   We believe that federal programs should hold states and school districts accountable for closing the achievement gap that persists between low-income and non-low-income students and minority students and non-minority students. 
   Many blame the achievement gap that exists between groups on demographic and socioeconomic factors. This is the soft bigotry of low expectations. 
   Many schools and school districts with high populations of low-income students increased student performance. In San Antonio TX, over 75 percent of the students are from low-income families at the Terrell Wells Middle School. The School increased student performance by 40% in reading from 49.2 to 89.9 percent performing at proficient levels and by nearly 60 percent in math within just one year 19.1 to 76.2 percent. 
   Instead of sending states money year after year with no regard for results, we hold states and school districts accountable for the academic achievement of their students. Again, accountability is not focused on how schools and school districts spend the money, but how students perform as a result. 
   Schools that succeed in educating children should be rewarded. Schools that fail again and again must be held accountable. And parents deserve to know which schools are educating children and which are failing. 
   Accountability systems based on results raise the academic achievement levels of all students. Texas and North Carolina both have serious systems of accountability for teachers and schools, and not coincidentally, have been named two of the best performers in closing the achievement gap based on National Assessment of Educational Progress results. 
   There is no excuse for failure. Principals of low-income schools throughout the country are proving that poverty is no excuse for failure. 
   Two, S. 2 focuses on the child rather than the system. Parents, not school systems, should be empowered to make decisions about which school a child attends. 
   It is wrong to compel a child to attend a failing school. Needy children must be given the opportunity to attend a high performing public school. 
   In no other area of American society do we deny Americans the freedom to make choices that affect their well-being. Yet we require many parents to keep their students in schools which not only fail to educate them, but cannot even guarantee their safety. 
   According to Arthur Levine, President, Columbia University 
   Teachers College: ``..... to force children into inadequate schools is to deny them any chance of success. To do so simply on the basis of their parent's income is a sin.'' 
   We must empower parents to choose what is best for their children and, as a consequence, to reform our nation's public education system. 
   As John Dewey said, ``What the best and wisest parent wants for his child, that must be what the community wants for all its children. Any other ideal for our schools is narrow and unlovely; it destroys our democracy.'' 
   Children should no longer be trapped in failing schools. Parents of children in failing schools should have greater and more numerous opportunities to send their children to a higher performing school. 
   Under the Title I system of accountability, over 7,000 schools have been identified as failing and that number is expected to grow. Of those 7,000 schools, many have been identified as failing for 4 years, 6 years, some even for 10 years. Any and every child in one of those should be granted access to better schools. 
   Three, S. 2 reflects the importance of quality teachers. According to Tennessee's very own Bill Sanders, a professor at the University of Tennessee, teacher quality has a greater effect on student performance than any other factor--including class size and student demographics. ``When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.'' 
   Every child deserves to learn from a high quality teacher--a teacher who is competent in his/her subject area, cares about his/her students, and demands academic excellence. 
   Every child's teacher deserves expanded opportunities for additional training as education reforms raise the standards of achievement for students. We expect schools to ensure that all of their teachers are proficient in their subject areas and are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to help students meet high standards. 
   Currently, more than 25 percent of new teachers enter our nation's schools poorly qualified to teach. 
   In Massachusetts alone, 59 percent of incoming teachers failed the basic licensing exam. Forty-four percent of incoming teachers failed a 10th grade level competency test. 
   Fifty-six percent of those teaching physics and chemistry, 53 percent of those teaching history, 33 percent of those teaching math, and 24 percent of those teaching English do not have a major or minor in the field in which they teach. In inner-city schools, the statistics are even worse. Inner-city students have only a 50-50 chance of being taught by a qualified math or science teacher. 
   Four, school safety is another important component of our bill. Every child deserves an environment that is free of danger and distractions to learning, and where learning is the primary goal. When drugs and violence threaten the classroom, the first victim is learning. 
   Five, and perhaps most important, this bill recognizes the importance of flexibility and local control. Parents, community leaders, local and state governments, and not the federal government know best the education needs of their children. All across America states and local communities are implementing innovative solutions to our education challenges. 
   Indeed, in a recent editorial by an educator and a former Senate majority leader in the state of Maine, Bennett Katz decries the latest attempt by the administration to micromanage school spending priorities from Washington DC. With regard to the President's class size initiative, he says:  
   I would opt for [the money] to meet Maine's most pressing education needs as we see them--not as identified by Washington, D.C. politicians. That's the trouble with Washington people dreaming up wonderful programs to be paid for with our tax dollars. We know what our top needs are ..... ask our very savvy commissioner of education. If Washington's lofty thinkers are awash with  surplus dollars, they should not try to tell us how to spend them on their priorities. If the US Department of Education is so smart, take a look at how successful they are in running the schools in the District of Columbia.  
   States and local school districts are innovative. Without question, it is states and localities that today are serving as the engines for change in education. The groundwork for success is already in place at the local level--teachers, parents, principals, and communities demonstrate on a daily basis the enthusiasm and desire to succeed. However, flexibility at the state and local level is critical to the success of our schools. 
   But along with the resources, the federal government must also give states and localities the freedom to pursue their own strategies for implementation. With respect to education, tactics and implementation procedures are virtually dictated by the federal government. 
   Rather than working closely with the states, the Congress created 70 new federal education programs in the 1980's. President Clinton, thinking that 552 federal educational programs are not enough, suggested 14 more in his fiscal year 1999 budget proposal. The rationale for expanding an already overly large and burdensome federal education establishment is simply not discernible. Instead, the states should have the flexibility to put together state strategic plans under either the Straight A's program or the Performance Partnerships program. Under such a plan, the states would establish concrete educational goals and timetables for achievement. In return, they would be allowed to pool federal funds from categorical programs and spend these consolidated resources on state established priorities. 
   Paul Vallas, the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago school system, explained the crucial elements of the bold reforms that he and his colleagues have been making in Chicago. He didn't have more money to work with. What he had--and has made highly effective use of--was, in his words, ``flexibility with money and work rules, high standards and expectations, accountability from top to bottom ..... and a willingness to take advantage of options.'' 
   Vallas went on to say:  
   [Another] key to our success has been flexibility. We are fortunate to have a great deal of control over the allocation of resources. In Chicago, almost all of the tax levies for the schools are consolidated. The revenue comes right to us. In addition, our categorical grants from the state are consolidated into two block grants--one for regular education and one for special ed. We decide how all this money is spent. 
   *.*.* because the state has given us all our funds in block grants and has basically said, ``Here's your money--you decide how to spend it,'' I have been able to reallocate about $130 million into our classrooms and to generate about $170 million in other savings.  
   As we all know, there is no more important issue today than education. Some of my colleagues across the aisle have a whole array of programs that they think will solve the problem. Among their many amendments, I have counted at least 12 new programs that range from $50 million to $1.3 billion. For many of you, more money and more federal education programs are the answer to all our nation's education woes. Of course these programs sound good--but will they really do any good? More money or an additional program is often a surrogate for the structural reform that American education needs. Structural reform, change--this is what many in the education establishment fear. Instead, their response to crisis is more money and another federal program. 
   But, the last thing that we need is another federal program. The last thing that our schools need is more bureaucracy and federal intrusion. Instead, what Washington should and can do is to free the hands of states and localities and to support local and state education reform efforts. When localities find ideas that work, the federal government should either get out of the way or lend a helping hand. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act is a step in the right direction. Building on the bipartisan success of Ed-Flex, we have increased flexibility and empowered parents. I look forward to the debate that we will have about further empowering parents and children with the ability to choose where their children go to school. 
   I commend the chairman for his hard work and dedication to education. I think there are some very good provisions in this bill. 
   I strongly support both Straight A's and the performance partnership program that are in title VI. 
   I am pleased to see report card language in title I--I agree with the chairman that knowledge is power and that by empowering parents we are creating agents for positive change. 
   Unlike class size reduction proposals, which require States and local schools to hire new teachers, the Teacher Empowerment Act, TEA, provides maximum flexibility to states and locals in using $2 billion annually to develop high quality professional development programs, hire additional teachers, provide incentives to retain quality teachers or to fund innovative teacher programs, such as teacher testing, merit-based teacher performance systems and alternative routes to certification. 
   I applaud the chairman's rural flexibility initiative, and I am delighted that we have consolidated several different programs and titles. Although I wish we could have consolidated a few more programs and titles, we have made some progress. We used to have 14 titles, now we have 11. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear. This debate is not over money. It is not over who cares the most about our nation's school children. This debate is over who knows best--the federal government or the parents, teachers and administrators back home who interact with our children every day. The debate is over who do we trust? Federal bureaucrats or people back home who struggle under the weight of federal mandates to help children learn. 
   The federal government has a track record of failure despite many billions of dollars spent. States and localities, however, have shown the promise and the possibilities of success with innovative methods to raise student achievement and to reduce the achievement gap. 
   This bill will give states and localities the tools and the flexibility necessary to begin to restore American education to preeminence. To achieve educational excellence will take time. There is no simple solution and gimmicky short-term fads, like those offered by this Administration, will not lead to long-term success. The Republican party is dedicated to a sustained long-term effort to assure that every child in America receives not just an education, but a quality education. In our global economy, it is no longer good enough to be adequate. We must be outstanding.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on April 29 the Vanderbilt University community will honor Joe B. Wyatt, who will retire this summer after a long and distinguished career as Chancellor of that prestigious university. I rise today to pay tribute to Chancellor Wyatt. His significant contributions have not only benefitted the Nashville campus, but also have had a very positive impact on the State of Tennessee and, indeed, our entire nation. 
   Joe Wyatt's tenure as head of Vanderbilt, which extends back to 1982, has been marked by substantial growth at the University: new construction and renovation on campus; tremendous expansion of the renowned Medical Center; major increases in the levels of research grants; and a quantum leap in the university's endowment. 
   Today, Vanderbilt University and Medical Center is the largest private employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the state. It generates an estimated annual economic impact of more that $2.2 billion to the area. Among the 19,000 Vanderbilt alumni who live in Middle Tennessee are numerous leaders in business, government, law, education and medicine. And many of these young men and women were handed their diplomas by Joe Wyatt before moving on to make a mark in their chosen fields. 
   Equally important, Mr. Wyatt's stewardship has been marked by the academic and intellectual growth of the University. He has helped attract a world-class faculty that is consistently recognized nationally and internationally for its research and teaching excellence. In addition, he recognized, earlier than most, the potential impact of new technology on our society and education, and he facilitated the development of research programs that cut across various academic disciplines, reflecting changes in the real world and maximizing the University's academic resources. 
   Personally, in making my own decision of whether to come to Vanderbilt to join the staff at Vanderbilt University Medical Center as Assistant Professor in cardiothoracic surgery, it was Joe Wyatt's support of a vision of establishing a multi-organ, multi-disciplinary transplant center at Vanderbilt that encouraged me to come back to Nashville. His commitment to seeing that vision become a reality led to the establishment of the Vanderbilt Transplant Center which since that time has served thousands of patients throughout the Southeast. 
   During Joe Wyatt's 18 years of service at Vanderbilt, the university has evolved steadily from a highly regarded regional institution to a truly national institution, widely known for its excellence in a wide array of undergraduate and graduate fields. Today, it is among the top ranks of research universities in the United States, with a student body that represents all 50 states and more than 90 foreign countries. 
   Chancellor Wyatt is widely regarded today as a senior statesman of the research university community. His deep commitment to higher education issues is exemplified by his participation in, and leadership of, many national advisory groups and policymaking organizations. For example, he has served the last two years as chairman of the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable of the National Academy of Sciences. He also is the current chairman of the Universities Research Association and chairs a blue ribbon panel on quality standards for the non-profit organization, New American Schools. In addition, he serves on the Business Higher Education Forum, the Council on Competitiveness and the Advisory Committee of the Public Agenda Foundation. 
   Mr. President, Joe B. Wyatt has made contributions in many areas, but I think his greatest legacies will be in the following three areas: 
   First, he has fostered greater communication and cooperation among the three sectors most involved in our nation's unique research enterprise--universities, the federal government and industry. 
   Chancellor Wyatt is the Chairman of a group at NSF devoted to bringing government, universities and businesses together in a collaborative effort to improve our nation's research effort. 
   Second, he has promoted increased awareness of the great responsibility of our schools of education to ``teach the teachers'' who prepare America's youth for the challenges of tomorrow. 
   Chancellor Wyatt supported a controversial provision in the Higher Education Act of 1998 to hold colleges of education accountable for their students' performance as teachers. This provision, and Chancellor Wyatt's deep commitment to improving our nation's colleges of education, will have a lasting impact not just on higher education, but on our entire elementary and secondary school system. 
   Third, he has generated, through personal example, renewed commitment to volunteer community service by all members of the university community. 
   Today, Vanderbilt undergraduates are engaged in volunteer programs in unprecedented numbers. It was no accident that, when they recently came to say farewell to Vanderbilt alumni in the Washington, DC, area, Joe and Faye Wyatt spent the day at an inner-city elementary school, working alongside 75 alumni in a reading and storytelling program with local third-graders. 
   I include for the RECORD an article from the Vanderbilt Register On-Line. The article further details Joe B. Wyatt's many accomplishments over a span of nearly two decades as Chancellor of the University. Throughout this period, he has maintained a sharp focus on two things that really matter ..... two things that are enduring in our society: quality education of our nation's youth and service to the broader community. And he has done so with honor, decency and credibility. 
   We wish Joe and Faye Wyatt the very best, and give them heartfelt thanks for their service to Vanderbilt University.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address the underlying amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia and his colleagues which links our efforts to provide affordable access to outpatient prescription drugs for seniors to the issue of tax relief. I believe this amendment is unnecessary. 
   One of the highest priorities in the Republican-sponsored budget is to provide outpatient prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, something in which I, as a physician who has taken care of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries--individuals with disabilities and seniors--and my colleagues strongly believe is critical to the health care security of these beneficiaries. They need and deserve affordable access to prescription drugs, and that is an important part of our agenda. 
   We reduce the tax burden on hard-working Americans who today are being taxed more than at any time in the peacetime history of this country. 
   I simply cannot and will not support any amendment that pits these two goals, which are inherent and integral parts of this budget, against one another. It is unnecessary, and it is irresponsible. We can do both in our budget and we provide the means to do so. 
   It is a fascinating time in our history in terms of the evolution of health care. We are almost where we were in the early 1960s in our discussion of prescription drug coverage. Before Medicare, we did not have coverage for hospitals and physician services. In the early 1960s, we had the opportunity to shape health care security for seniors, and later for individuals with disabilities, in a way that has been very beneficial. 
   I say that as a health care provider who has been on the frontline. 
   In large part as a product of the tremendous research and development and the discovery of new drugs, and the application of those drugs in recent years, it is time that we in this Congress address Medicare for seniors in a modernized way. ``In a modernized way'' means that we must bring prescription drugs into Medicare in an integrated fashion to deliver a full set of comprehensive benefits to beneficiaries. That is why in this budget we address modernizing Medicare and setting aside $40 billion to strengthen the program and include an outpatient prescription drug benefit. 
   But something we do that is critical, that is not being addressed by these freestanding drug bills that are being proposed--both in the House and in the Senate--is that we link that inclusion of prescription drug coverage to the overall modernization of the Medicare system. 
   Although this is a budget discussion, it is not just a matter of only dollars and cents. We are talking about health care security for our seniors. The physician, the hospital, the health care facility, and the prescription drugs all must be a part of one seamless health care delivery program. 
   As good as Medicare is today, it is not as good as most people think it is, for lots of different reasons. 
   No. 1, it is a fragmented system. We have a Part A trust fund and a Part B trust fund. We have outpatient care and we have inpatient care. It is incomplete. The benefit package is outdated. There is even very little in the way of preventive services as part of Medicare today, services that seniors desperately need. 
   Preventative care, which is in private health care plans, has proliferated. We all know how important it is. Yet there is almost none of that in Medicare today. 
   Many people think Medicare is going to take care of our seniors later in their lives. It is a fact, of every dollar that is spent for a senior's health care, if you put it all together, only 53 cents is paid for by Medicare. The other 47 cents, that is paid for by that senior or that individual with the disability who has to reach out, scrape around, get another insurance policy, pay out of pocket, or ask for free care in order to cover health care expenses. We can do better. 
   Thus, we are absolutely committed to the principle of, yes, including prescription drugs into the system, but doing it in such a way that we can improve and modernize Medicare as the whole, to be a seamless system in the provision of high-quality care for our seniors. 
   I believe it is irresponsible--when you have a Medicare program that is threatened in terms of long-term solvency, when you look at deficits in cash-flow, when you look at the huge demographic shift that will be occurring with the baby boomers coming through the system, with a doubling of the number of seniors over the next 30 years, and a lessening of the people who are paying into the system--it is irresponsible, unless you address the overall health care system, to take a benefit, a very expensive benefit, and simply set it on top of a system that cannot be sustained long term. It is deceptive. It is just not right. Our seniors deserve better. 
   Thus, instead of trying to link tax relief to improving health care for our seniors, what we Republicans believe--expressed in this budget--is that the appropriate linkage is providing prescription drugs in an affordable way, but linking it inextricably to the modernization of the overall Medicare system. That is the most prudent, short-term and long-term approach to guarantee health care security for our seniors. 
   The principles of prescription drug coverage are, in my mind, pretty simple. I think all of us must recognize that a new drug benefit should not be modeled on Medicare's traditional, 
   out-of-date delivery model. We need a new model. The President's plan does not change the system at all, but instead places more financial burdens on an already fragile program, while at the same time placing Medicare beneficiaries' health at risk. 
   No. 2, such a benefit should be voluntary. Most would agree on both sides of the aisle including the President that it must be accessible to all. At the same time, we should not do anything that forces people into HMOs. We should not do anything that forces seniors today, who already have prescription drug coverage, to give up what they have. We should not force seniors today, who are already paying a certain amount for prescription drug coverage, to pay more than what they pay today. 
   The third principle is--this is important--something we have the responsibility to address in the short-term and the long-term; that is, that price controls in prescription drugs will not work. They will destroy the opportunity to develop that new drug, that new prescription, that new agent that can be lifesaving, that can treat illness and prevent disease. Price controls will wipe out drug innovation. 
   I believe those three principles must be a part of the drug package that we assimilate into a modernized Medicare system. Thus, the long-term goal--again, this linkage in this amendment of tax relief, or holding one hostage for the other--is not the right thing to do for our Medicare beneficiaries. 
   For the 35 million seniors and 5 million individuals with disabilities who are out there, why hold them hostage? Why not go to the underlying budget proposal, which I believe has the more responsible link; and that is, yes, prescription drug coverage--it has to be there--it is health care security but linking it to modernization, reform of our Medicare system. That should be our long-term goal. 
   Prescription drug coverage should be brought into the system alongside physician services, hospital services, facilities services, medical devices where you can consider them all, not as some freestanding plan saying drugs are over there. Those drugs are just as important as that surgical knife that I once wielded. We need a seamless system, a coordinated care approach. 
   On this issue, again, we are talking about the budget. But it is important for all of our colleagues to understand  this linkage that I believe is so important of bringing prescription drugs in, because it is this whole range of tools that physicians and health care providers need in order to guarantee affordable high-quality care. 
   Now is not the time to institutionalize freestanding plans which result in further fragmentation. If we pass a freestanding plan, it is likely to result in further fragmentation of the system when we need seamless, coordinated care. 
   We have moved today, in the year 2000, towards disease management and coordinated delivery of health care. We no longer operate under a model where a surgical procedure is performed and then the patient is sent to another doctor to treat the headache, and to another doctor to give a device or a pacemaker. We want that seamless management. That is why prescription drugs must be made a part of the overall, comprehensive reform of our Medicare system. 
   Less than 10 years ago, the Medicare trustees estimated that the Medicare Part A Trust Fund, otherwise known as the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, would be insolvent in 1999. Since then, the Trustees' solvency estimates of the Part A Trust Fund have fluctuated tremendously. As little as five years ago the Part A Trust Fund was expected to be depleted by 2002. In 1996 and 1997, insolvency was estimated in the year 2001, in 1998, it was projected for 2008, in 1999 for 2015, and in the year 2000, Medicare bankruptcy is projected for 2023. It might seem strange that insolvency dates could fluctuate so dramatically--a 21-year range--over a 5-year period. The reason for this is simple. The Medicare Trustees' reports are estimates--estimates based on assumptions regarding growth in expenditures in the Medicare program, economy, life expectancy, and the like, which are continually changing. Therefore, any interpretation of these reports must be made with the understanding that as early as the following year, program insolvency estimates may look dramatically different. History has shown us as much. 
   Equally important, the definition of ``solvency'' itself calls for further examination. The historic concept of Medicare's solvency is one that has been partially and inappropriately borrowed from Social Security and has never fully reflected the fiscal integrity of the Medicare program. Solvency in Medicare is not the same as solvency in Social Security. The Social Security Trust Funds are funded exclusively through payroll taxes, so it is relatively easy to determine when Social Security expenditures are projected to exceed income. 
   Medicare, however, is funded by a combination of payroll taxes, general revenue, and beneficiary premiums, divided between two separate trust funds--Part A and Part B. Additionally, the ratio of these revenue streams has changed over time such that a greater portion of Medicare expenses is now paid by general revenues through the Part B Trust Fund, and a relatively smaller portion is paid by payroll taxes and beneficiary premiums--than was originally intended when the program was first enacted. The payroll tax supporting the Social Security Trust Funds is limited both by its rate and the wage base on which that rate is applied. Medicare's funding has an unlimited taxable wage base and therefore no limit on the maximum tax. The Part A Trust Fund is funded by a payroll tax of 1.45 percent on all earnings in covered 
   employment and 2.9 percent for the self employed. In sum, the sources of funding for the Medicare program are numerous, unlimited and divided among trust funds, making the true test for program solvency much more complicated than Social Security. 
   Today, almost equal numbers of seniors and disabled, about 39 million total, are enrolled in both Parts A and B of the program. Part B spending represents nearly 40 percent of total program expenditures and that number will increase significantly, reaching 50 percent by 2020, as Part B spending continues to grow at twice the rate of Part A. So why is it that only 60 percent of program spending--the Part A Trust Fund only--is used to determine the financial health of Medicare as a whole? 
   Actually, the notion of Part A ``solvency'', or rather ``insolvency'', has been used as political leverage to shift more Medicare financing to Part B and draw on general revenues. This not only fundamentally alters the way the Part A Trust Fund is financed by moving away from payroll financing toward a formal commitment of future general fund revenues, but also sends a false sense of security to the American public regarding the true financial health of the program. 
   An example, in is the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, where Congress passed legislation that shifted a major portion of home health expenditures--approximately $80 billion--from Part A to Part B. By doing so, the fiction of Part A Trust Fund ``solvency'' was extended from 2002 to 2008. However, this shift increased the draw on general revenues tremendously. Worse, it continued to mask the financial instability of the program and made it easier to allow fiscal imbalances to go unnoticed. 
   In addition, although insolvency dates are often used to determine when the Part A Trust Fund can no longer sustain the program, there is another important element that must not be overlooked--that is trust fund assets. Long before the insolvency date is reached, the Part A Trust Fund must draw upon its assets to continue to fund the program. These assets are really a claim on the Treasury. When the trust fund runs a cash deficit, like the Part A Trust Fund has been doing since 1992, these securities are redeemed to pay for program costs. For instance, this year the Medicare Trustees Report indicates that the Part A Trust Fund will remain solvent until 2023. This only occurs, however, because securities are redeemed in order to pay for program costs, beginning in 2015. The reality is in 2015, the Part A Trust Fund will begin a deficit again where program expenditures will exceed income. To redeem the securities necessary to keep the program solvent until 2023, the government as a whole must come up with the cash by either increasing taxes, reducing spending or borrowing from the public. This is all in light of the fact that any small shift in the economy, program expenditures or health care costs could greatly affect not only the date in which the program falls into a cash deficit, but also when insolvency is reached. 
   The Congressional Budget Office reports that Medicare spending will grow at an annual average rate of 7.1 percent over the next 10 years. The Medicare Trustees report highlights the 38 percent growth in the Part B trust fund over the past 5 years, with these growth rates expected to continue and even increase. Clearly, addressing the 
   financial health of the Medicare program by looking at approximately one-half of the total program expenditures is not only misleading, but also a misrepresentation of the programs financial viability--to our nation's Medicare beneficiaries and the public at large. 
   Even the Medicare Trustees acknowledge that future operations of the Part A Trust Fund will be very sensitive to future economic, demographic, and health cost trends and could differ substantially from 2023 insolvency projections estimated this year. Medicare has never had a trust fund balance at the beginning of any year that could cover much more than one year's worth of expenditures. In 1996, the program was able to fund a little more than one year's worth of expenditures, the highest ratio yet, but in 1983 the Part A Trust Fund would have only been able to fund one-fifth of Medicare program expenditures--and in 1999 only 92%. 
   You see, we can continue to kid ourselves into believing that Medicare is financially stable. We can address only a fraction of the program and shift numbers until the program looks solvent on paper. But the truth is the Medicare program is in great financial trouble and fast approaching a financial crisis. Without addressing Medicare's fundamental programmatic and financial problems, combined with the huge demographic shift of baby boomers in a decade, Medicare will go bankrupt at the expense of Americans who need and deserve quality, affordable health care. As we continue to discuss the addition of a new entitlement to Medicare--outpatient prescription drugs--I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the fragile financial condition the program is in. 
   I believe there is consensus among many of us here this morning--much of which has been heard over the last twenty four hours--to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit in the  Medicare program this year. I agree completely. More than ever, as a physician, I understand the need to ensure our nation's seniors and individuals with disabilities have access to life-saving drugs. But I also believe that we all have a responsibility to ensure that Medicare is viable and can be sustained with any new benefit that is added. I want to be able to guarantee my fellow Tennesseans and every Medicare beneficiary health care security. This is not an easy task--and it is tempting to avoid the difficult discussions and decisions that must be made to address the overall programmatic and financial health of Medicare. But we owe it to our grandmothers and grandfathers, our children and even ourselves to be responsible in developing an outpatient prescription drug benefit to ensure Medicare will be available now and well into the future. 
   I thank the chairman for bringing forth a budget that sets aside funding specifically for Medicare and outpatient prescription drugs. And again I reiterate that the amendment put forth by Senator ROBB and his Democratic colleagues is unnecessary. The Republican-supported budget resolution sets aside $40 billion over the next 5 years for Medicare and the inclusion of an outpatient prescription drug benefit. In addition, it also provides relief to hard-working Americans who are being taxed at the highest rate in the peacetime history of this country. Both are high priorities--they are not mutually exclusive. We should not be pitting the health of our nation's Medicare beneficiaries against tax relief. It is unfair and it is irresponsible to do so. Both are critical to this budget and can be done--and we will continue to work hard to reach these important goals. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in less than a month's time, we will celebrate the first Memorial Day of the second millennium, our first opportunity in this new century to honor and salute the men and women who, through the decades, have sacrificed so gallantly to keep us free. It will be our first opportunity to thank them publicly for the sacrifice they made, the pain they suffered, and the trauma they endured to ensure that the flame of freedom would never be extinguished. 
   Each and every one of those patriots, Mr. President, those who died, those who returned, and those we are blessed to still have with us, shouldered squarely the highest responsibility of citizenship; remained dedicated to the survival of our Nation; were willing to pay the highest price to preserve peace and freedom. And they risked it all under the one symbol that summed up their strength and sharpened their courage--our bright banner of red, white, and blue. 
   We are a Nation of images and symbols, but that's not a 21st century phenomenon. It has always been so. Throughout our history, we have been captivated by scenes that seem to capture all the emotion of a particular event--George Washington's winter encampment at Valley Forge, Robert E. Lee's last ride to Appomattox along a path lined by ranks of Union troops standing at attention, JFK's funeral cortege making its way to Arlington across the Memorial Bridge. 
   But the most poignant image of all--the one that will live forever in the hearts and minds of all Americans--is the image of a handful of Marines braced against a whipping Pacific wind, raising the American flag over Iwo Jima. 
   That symbol of freedom that flies over the dome of the building in which we now stand, that adorns the flagpoles of our schools and communities, that graces the windows and doorways of our homes, that is draped in silent tribute over the coffins of our dead--that symbol deserves our protection. 
   It should not, under any--any--circumstances be desecrated. And that is why I support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ensure that this is so. 
   The Constitutional Amendment proposed by this resolution is surprisingly simple--astoundingly simple when compared to anything that emanates from Washington these days. It does not dictate a particular course of action to the states. It does not threaten the separation of powers. It does not set a complex set of rules and regulations that require a team of lawyers to interpret. It does not change the integrity of the Constitution. And it does not cost the taxpayers one cent. The entire amendment is contained in a single sentence: ``The Congress and the States shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.'' 
   To those who maintain that this amendment would be a violation of First, I quote perhaps the greatest proponent of First Amendment freedoms, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who stated, ``It passes my belief that  anything in the Federal Constitution bars making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.'' Let me repeat: ``It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.'' 
   Let us not let one more Memorial Day pass without clarifying and codifying that protection. Let us not let one more soldier, sailor, airman or marine nobly and unselfishly risk his life without honoring him and the ideals for which he is willing to die, without protecting the most sacred and visible symbol of his freedom. 
   Let us not let one more minute pass, without enacting into law, and sending to the states, this amendment to protect the flag under which so many--so many--were willing to, as one soldier-poet put it, ``taste death in youth so that Liberty might grow old.''

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are currently living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), of whom 280,000 have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). As of June 1999, there were 8,814 people in my home state of Tennessee living with HIV/AIDS. As a physician, I have seen first hand the deadly impact of  this disease on patients, and have also seen first hand what can happen if the prevalence of AIDS goes unchecked. On February 24, 2000, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, I held a hearing on the AIDS crisis in Africa. In Africa, this disease has reached truly pandemic proportions, causing cultural and economic devastation. Every day, there are 16,000 new infections globally, despite the great strides we have made in the treatment and prevention of this condition. 
   Ironically and unfortunately, the new advancements in treatment may have caused many to become complacent. A survey co-authored by Yale revealed that more than 80% of our youth do not believe they are at risk for HIV infections. However, the fact is that the number of new infections among adolescents continues to rise and it is rising disproportionally among minorities. AIDS remains the leading cause of death among African-Americans 25-44 years of age and the second leading cause of death among Latinos in the same age range. Furthermore, in 1998, African-American and Hispanic women accounted for 80% of the total AIDS cases reported for women nationwide. In my own state of Tennessee, 59% of the new AIDS cases were among African-Americans, who make up 45% of the total AIDS cases in the state. Since its original discovery, it is estimated that over 13.9 million have died worldwide and over 400,000 have died in the United States as a result of HIV/AIDS. Fortunately, over the last 15 years, we have doubled the life expectancy of people with AIDS, developed new and powerful drugs for the treatment of HIV infection, and made advances in the treatment and prevention of AIDS-related opportunistic infections. 
   Another important component in the struggle against HIV/AIDS has been the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which I am pleased to join with Senator JEFFORDS in supporting today. The Ryan White CARE Act, a unique partnership between federal, local, and state governments; non-profit community organizations, health care and supportive service providers. For the last decade, this Act has successfully provided much needed assistance in health care costs and support services for low-income, uninsured and underinsured individuals with HIV/AIDS. 
   Through programs such as AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which provides access to pharmaceuticals, the CARE Act has helped extend and even save lives. Last year alone, nearly 100,000 people living with HIV and AIDS received access to drug therapy because of the CARE Act. Half the people served by the CARE Act have family incomes of less than $10,000 annually, which is lower than the $12,000 annual average cost of new drug ``cocktails'' for treatment. The CARE Act is critical in ensuring that the number of people living with AIDS continues to increase, as effective new drug therapies are keeping HIV-infected persons healthy longer and dramatically reducing the death rate. Investments in enabling patients with HIV to live healthier and more productive lives have helped to reduce overall health costs. For example, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the nation has seen a 30% decline in HIV related hospitalizations, which results in nearly one million fewer HIV related hospital days and a savings of more than $1 billion. 
   During the 104th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with Senator Kassebaum on the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 to ensure this needed law was extended. Today I am pleased to join Senator JEFFORDS as an original cosponsor to the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000, which will further improve and extend this law. Senator JEFFORDS, who has done a terrific job in crafting this bill, has already outlined some specifics of this legislation, however, I would like to conclude by discussing a specific provision which I am grateful Senator JEFFORDS included in this reauthorization. 
   This bill contains a provision, under Title II of this Act, to address the fact that the face of this disease is changing and is moving into and affecting more rural communities. A recent GAO audit found that rural areas may offer more limited medical and social services than cities because urban areas generally receive more money per AIDS case. To help address this concern, this new provision will provide supplemental grants to States for additional HIV/AIDS services in underserved areas. One important aspect of this provision is the creation of supplemental grants for emerging metropolitan communities, which do not qualify for Title I funding but have reported between 1,000 and 2,000 AIDS cases in the last five years. Currently, this provision would provide 7 cities, including Memphis and Nashville, a general pot of money to divide of at least $5 million in new funding each year, or 25% of new monies under Title II, whichever is greater. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this issue, and Sean Donohue and William Fleming of his staff for all their expertise in drafting this bill. I would also like to thank Senator KENNEDY and Stephanie Robinson of his staff for their work and dedication to this issue. I would also like to thank Dr. Bill Moore of the Tennessee Department of Health and Mr. Joe Interrante of Nashville CARES for their counsel and assistance on this legislation and for their efforts in helping Tennesseans with HIV/AIDS.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today and be part of the first bipartisan, bicameral group to address the growing number of individuals and families without health insurance coverage in this country. 
   The problem has been made clear. America's uninsured population continues to rise. Despite the fact that we are enjoying strong economic times, the nation's uninsured population has grown to 44 million over the past decade. We know that the majority of the uninsured--32 of the 44 million--earn an annual income of under $50,000. We also know that the rising cost of health insurance is the single most important reason for not purchasing health care coverage. Many Americans simply cannot afford to buy health insurance. 
   The solutions are becoming clearer as well. A one-size fits all approach to expand health coverage and access to health care does not meet the various needs of the uninsured population. As a result, our proposal will take a multi-pronged approach that meets the needs of the uninsured and looks at innovative approaches to provide individuals greater ability to purchase coverage. We will seek to build upon the current employer-based system which continues to be the main source of health care coverage for most Americans. 
   Our goal is to fill the coverage gaps that exist in the current system. A central piece of our proposal is to provide a refundable tax credit for low-income Americans who are not offered a contribution for their insurance through their employer and do not receive coverage through federal programs such as Medicaid or Medicare. The legislation introduced today will help hard working Americans who cannot afford to buy coverage on their own. For example, the part-time worker who is not offered employer-sponsored health insurance will be offered a $1,000 tax credit to purchase health care coverage. The single mother with two children earning less than $50,000 a year, will be offered a $2,000 credit to purchase health insurance. 
   The legislation introduced today is the first of many steps that we will take to address the varying needs of the uninsured. Over the next several months, we will also explore a variety of options to assist individuals and their families in purchasing health coverage either through existing employer plans, the individual market, or through purchasing pools; seek ways to improve enrollment in existing federal programs, where approximately 5 million adults and 8 million children are eligible for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) yet are not enrolled; and finally, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health, I will work closely with my colleagues to explore ways to expand and sustain our safety net system to improve access to critical primary care services to the uninsured and medically underserved populations. 
   I especially wish to thank the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the Americans for Tax Reform, the BlueCross BlueShield Association, the Chamber of Commerce of the USA, the Citizens Against Government Waste, the Galen Institute, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the Health Insurance Association of America, the Hispanic Business Roundtable, the National Center for Policy Analysis, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Small Business Survival Committee for their support of this important legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce A Million Quality Teachers Act. Thomas Jefferson once observed that of all the bills in the federal code, ``by far the most important is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people.'' ``No surer foundation,'' he said, ``can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness.'' 
   Unfortunately, our current foundation of elementary and secondary education is grossly inadequate to enable American children of all income levels and backgrounds to best realize the ``American dream'' and the economic freedoms that the ``American dream'' encapsulates. 
   Most companies dismiss the value of a high school diploma. Twelfth grade students in the United States rank near the very bottom on international comparisons in math and science. The Third International Math and Science Study, the most comprehensive and rigorous comparison of quantitative skills across nations, reveals that the longer our students stay in the elementary and public school system, the worse they perform on standardized tests. 
   High school graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed as college graduates (3.9% vs. 1.9%). Moreover, the value of a college degree over a high school degree is rising. In 1970, a college graduate made 136% more than a high school graduate. Today it is 176%. Even more ominous are labor participation rates for high school graduates in an information economy. While labor force participation for adults is at an all time high in the American economy, this boom has masked a 10% decline in participation rates for high school graduates since 1970 from 96.3% to 86.4%. 
   Our children cannot afford to be illiterate in mathematics and science. The rapidly changing technology revolution demands skills and proficiency in mathematics, science, and technology. IT, perhaps the fastest growing sector of our economy, relies on more than basic high school literacy in mathematics and science. 
   The Senate has begun to consider the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I have worked hard to ensure that we change the current focus of our federal education effort from a confusing, duplicative, categorical system that relies on inputs to one that focuses on effectiveness and on increased student achievement as a result. 
   The bill that I introduce today is a good complement to the ESEA bill that we will soon debate on the Senate floor. We have all heard about the impending teacher shortage. The Department of Education estimates that we will need over 2.2 million new teachers in the next decade to meet enrollment increases and to offset the large number of baby boomer teachers who will soon be 
   retiring. Additionally, although America has many high-quality teachers already, we do not have enough, and with the impending retirement of the baby boomer generation of teachers, we will need even more. 
   the President and many Senate Democrats want to continue to devote significant resources to reducing class size, and the concept to hire more teachers isn't a bad idea. Studies have shown that smaller class size may improve learning under certain circumstances. But class size is only a small piece in the bigger puzzle to improve America's education system, not the catapult that will launch us into education prosperity. 
   My bill takes the class size reduction money and redirects it to strengthening and improving teacher quality. Tennessee's own William Sanders, a professor at the University of Tennessee, has pioneered the ``value-added'' system of measuring the effectiveness of a teacher. His research demonstrates that teacher quality has a greater effect on student performance than any other factor--including class size and student demographics. He goes on to say that, ``When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.'' According to noted education economist and researcher Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester, ``the difference between a good and a bad teacher can be a full level of achievement in a single year.'' 
   Unfortunately, there are too many teachers in America today who lack proper preparation in the subjects that they teach. My own state of Tennessee actually does a good job of ensuring that teachers have at lest a major or minor in the subject that they teach--well enough to receive a grade of A in that category on the recent Thomas Fordham Foundation report on teacher quality in the states. Even in Tennessee, however, 64.5% of teachers teaching physical science do not even have a minor in the subject. Among history teachers, nearly 50% did not major or minor in history. Many other states do worse. 
   Additionally, there is consensus that we are not attracting enough of the best and the brightest to teaching, and not retaining enough of the best of those that we attract. According to Harvard economist Richard Murnane, ``College graduates with high test scores are less likely to become teachers, licensed teachers with high test scores are less likely to take jobs, employed teachers with high test scores are less likely to stay, and former teachers with high test scores are less likely to return.''

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the second time in one week, I come to the floor of the Senate to bring attention to an atrocious and despicable act of brutality against innocent men, women, and children. 
   Just 8 days ago, the Government of Sudan bombed nine towns, hospitals and feeding centers in the areas of the vast country outside of their control. As I said a week ago, they did not hit key rebel facilities or strongholds. However, they did bomb the town of Lui and the only rudimentary hospital and a TB clinic for a hundred mile radius. 
   They killed, maimed, and injured dozens of innocent and infirmed civilians. 
   As I said last week, I know this ``target'' well. It is the very hospital where I served as a volunteer surgeon and medical missionary just two years ago. 
   One of the worst aspects of the bombings is that the Government of Sudan knew exactly what these targets were. There was no mistaking it. Rebel forces had even caught government army agents attempting to mine the airstrip earlier in the year. 
   Last Sunday, 4 days after the bombing, the old Soviet cargo planes, which have been converted into bombers, returned. They dropped no bombs, but inspected the damage of the earlier raid and, we suspect, continued selecting targets. 
   On Tuesday morning, just past 10 a.m. local time, the bomber returned. It dropped 15 more bombs on the Samaritan's Purse hospital it targeted last week. 
   The sad part of the story is that it is not surprising. For years the Government of Sudan has targeted the relief facilities of organizations it deems friendly toward the rebels. That is, those who operate exclusively in areas outside of government control or those who criticize the regime in Khartoum. 
   In the town of Yei, the hospital has been bombed so many times, bombings of the facility no longer necessary even makes it to wire reports. 
   On February 8 of this year, one of those routine bombings of civilian targets was especially horrific, when school children in the Nuba Mountains region--an isolated area especially devastated by government bombings and offensive--were killed as they took their lessons under a tree. At least a dozen students and two adults were killed by antipersonnel bombs pushed out the cargo doors of the converted cargo planes. These were schoolchildren. They were not rebels nor child soldiers, but children learning to read. 
   In that case, we have good reason to believe that the strike was retribution for the local Roman Catholic Bishop, who has been charged with treason for coming to the United States in an effort to publicize the atrocities of his government against its own people. It was a school run by his church and a location that he was known to frequent. 
   In general, the United States policy is pointed in the right direction with respect to Sudan: its primary focus is on ending the war through multilateral negotiations, and on aiding the areas of greatest food insecurity. 
   But the United States policy is not without serious flaws, the greatest of which is failing to use our full diplomatic and economic weight to change the political environment where the Government of Sudan can repeatedly and intentionally bomb civilian targets, including schools and hospitals, and not face a single substantial objection from any member of the United Nations Security Council--nor any member of the United Nations. 
   That includes the United States. We do not sufficiently use the international body to promote peace to even raise objections about the murder of innocent civilians. 
   This failure of the international community to forcefully act or to raise even routine objections in international fora in an effort to stop the most brutal and devastating war since the Second World War is as inexplicable as it is tragic. 
   It is also hypocritical when compared to any number of United Nations sponsored peace missions. 
   Why is the United Nations so unwilling or unable to act? Because it lacks the necessary leadership among its members. It lacks the type public exposure to the truth of the horrors in Sudan to cause sufficient shame and embarrassment to change inaction into action. 
   The United Nations and its members do not suffer from a lack of information about the war I have described as lurking on the edge of the world's conscience. The United Nations own Special Rapporteur for Sudan has submitted an extensive report detailing the atrocities and some common sense recommendations for the body to act upon. But nothing has happened. 
   It is behind this veil of obscurity that some of our closest allies' inaction has somehow instead become the United States ``isolation'' on the issue. It is behind this veil of obscurity and sense of this being an esoteric American issue that inaction has hidden and thrived. 
   That failure, that veil of obscurity, is the greatest tragedy of them all. The United Nations was formed to stop or prevent injustice such as what is happening in Sudan. But it has instead become a vehicle for obfuscation of responsibility. it has become the chosen forum for denial and the Sudanese government's charm offensive: a concerted and effective public relations effort which portrays them as simply ``misunderstood'' and the victim of undeserved American vilification. 
   The United Nations should be the forum to pull the war in Sudan from the edge of the world's consciousness, to the center of the world's attention. To fail to take every reasonable opportunity to use the United Nations to generate the necessary embarrassment and shame to drive our complicity and compel nations to act to end the war would be the greatest failure of our policy and a tragic loss of potential for good. It is our failure to fully use the United Nations as an effective instrument to end the war in Sudan which must become a major focus of the United States policy. 
   If the United Nations is not used as a forum for resolution of a conflict like this, and if we are not willing to assert American leadership within that forum, the unavoidable question becomes what, then, is the purpose of United Nations and our membership therein?

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each day, more than 13 million children under the age of 6 spend some part of their day in child care. In my home state of Tennessee 264,000 children will attend day care, and half of all children younger than three will spend some or all of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. With these large number of children receiving child care services, there has been some evidence to suggest that we need to work to make these settings safer while improving the health of children in child care settings. 
   The potential danger in child care settings has been evident in my home state of Tennessee. Tragically, within the span of 2 years, there have been 4 deaths in child care settings in Memphis, Tennessee. Overall, reports of abandoned, mistreated, and unnecessarily endangered children have been reported in the Tennessee press over the last few years. I salute the Memphis Commercial Appeal, for their in-depth reporting on day care health and safety issues which has helped bring this serious matter to public attention. 
   However, I would caution that this is not just a concern in Memphis or Tennessee; it is nationwide and it needs to be addressed. There is alarming evidence to suggest that more must be done to improve the health and safety of children in child care settings. 
   For example, a 1998 Consumer Product Safety Commission Study revealed that two-thirds of the 200 licensed child care settings investigated exhibited safety hazards, such as insufficient child safety gates, cribs with soft bedding, and unsafe playgrounds. 
   In 1997 alone, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school settings. And, quite tragically, since 1990, more than 56 children have died in child care settings nationwide. 
   Child care health and safety issues are regulated at the state and local levels, which work diligently to ensure that child care settings are as safe as possible. I have worked closely with the Tennessee Department of Human  Services on how best to address the issue and quickly realized one of the main problems was the lack of resources that the state could draw upon to improve health and safety. 
   To help address this issue and protect our children, I have joined with Senator DODD, the recognized leader in Congress on child care issues, to introduce the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement Act,'' which will establish a state block grant program, authorizing $200 million for states to carry out activities related to the improvement of the health and safety of children in child care settings. 
   These grants may be used for the following activities: 
   To train and educate child care providers to prevent injuries and illnesses and to promote health-related practices; 
   To improve and enforce child care provider licensing, regulation, and registration, by conducting more inspections of day care providers to ensure that they are carrying out state and local guidelines to ensure that our children are safe; 
   To rehabilitate child care facilities to meet health and safety standards, like the proper placement of fire exits and smoke detectors, the proper disposal of sewage and garbage, and ensuring that play ground equipment is safe; 
   To employ health consultants to give health and safety advice to child care providers, such as CPR training, first aid training, prevention of sudden infant death syndrome, and how to recognize the signs of child abuse and neglect; 
   To provide assistance to enhance child care providers' ability to serve children with disabilities; 
   To conduct criminal background checks on child care providers, to ensure that day care providers are credible and reliable as they care for our children; 
   To provide information to parents on what factors to consider in choosing a safe and healthy day care setting for their children. Parents must know that the setting they are choosing have a proven safety record; and 
   To improve the safety of transportation of children in child care. 
   I am pleased that Tennessee is carrying out many of the activities authorized under the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Act.'' Under this bill, Tennessee would receive an estimated $4.2 million to help expand health and safety activities. 
   Mr. President, as a father, I understand the parental bond. A parent's number one concern is the safety, protection and health of their children. Parents need to be reassured their children are safe when they rely on others to care for their children. I am hopeful that this legislation will give Tennessee, and all states, the needed resources to implement necessary reforms and activities which they determine will improve the health and safety conditions of child care providers as they care for our children. 
   I want to thank Senator DODD for joining me in this effort and for the work of his staff, Jeanne Ireland. I would also like to thank the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund and the National Association for the Education of Young children for their input and letters of support for this bill. I would also like to thank Governor Sundquist and members of the Tennessee Department of Human Services, especially, Ms. Deborah Neill, the Director of Child Care, Adult and Community Programs, for their input on this important and needed legislation. And finally, I would like to thank and acknowledge the assistance of the Mayor of Memphis, the Honorable W. W. Herenton and his staff, who have been of great help in developing this legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, after going to the southern Sudan as a medical missionary and a surgeon 2 years ago, I came home with a realization that the unparalleled human disaster I went there to address was really, to my own surprise, inextricably linked to my role as a Senator. Yesterday, that realization was brought home again to me in the most horrific and despicable way. 
   As background, the Government of Sudan has, for over 16 years, carried out a war of unrivaled barbarity against its own people. Over 2 million people, mostly civilians, have died in bombings, intentional mass starvation, raids by militias on horseback, and what we call more conventional war. Slavery there today is common, so common that the raiding parties the Government of Sudan in Khartoum sponsors accept captive humans as their pay. 
   Yesterday, the regime in Khartoum struck once again, this time with old Soviet cargo planes that have been crudely outfitted as bombers of a sort, where large antipersonnel bombs are simply pushed through large cargo doors. 
   The accuracy is poor. Yet the intent could not be clearer. I received a phone call yesterday morning around 10 o'clock. It was at 6:25 a.m. yesterday morning, minutes before the first wave of relief flights were to leave the United Nations relief operations in Lokichokio, Kenya, they received a phone call from Khartoum instructing them that no relief flights would be allowed into Sudan the entire day. 
   The Government of Sudan then proceeded with a full day of bombing raids on nine sites in areas of rebel control. 
   What were the strongholds the Government of Sudan hit in those raids yesterday? What decisive blow did they deliver to those rebels? 
   Well, there is one location that I know for sure was a civilian hospital. They bombed and destroyed a tuberculosis clinic and one of the only x-ray machines in the entire country. They hit the local marketplace. They hit a feeding center for the starving and displaced. 
   In three passes over the small bush town, they dropped five antipersonnel bombs. They killed or maimed civilians, many of them patients in the hospital, others in the marketplace, others in a feeding center for the starving. 
   All of these were known civilian centers and all were intentionally targeted. The Government of Sudan knows exactly what is in that town and in those hospitals, and they targeted them anyway. 
   Why do I mention this? How do I know this was a civilian target? It is because it was approximately 2 years ago that in this very hospital I was operating in southern Sudan in a small village called Lui. The TB clinic is adjacent to a small schoolhouse that was converted to a hospital. It is in a small 
   outpost, and there is a little airstrip town there just north of the border approximately 100 or 110 miles. The press release I received today describing the incident in this hospital where I worked says:  
   Armed aircraft from Sudan's Islamic government dropped 12 bombs on the Samaritans First Hospital in Lui, the only hospital within a 100-mile radius. Eleven of the 12 bombs exploded at or near the hospital killing a number of people, critically wounding dozens, and damaging the hospital's children's and tuberculosis wards. More than 100 patients were being treated or housed at the hospital at the time of the bombing, where four American doctors are stationed. The bombing prompted many patients to flee, interrupting critical tuberculosis treatments needed to save their lives.  
   This release came to my office this afternoon. 
   Again, these senseless acts are militarily insignificant, I believe. The only purpose is to terrify and kill civilians and the doctors and the relief personnel who dare to provide life and comfort to them. 
   The most outrageous aspect of all of this is not that I have been there, that I know this hospital well, that I was one of the very few physicians and early surgeons to come to that hospital, and it is not that this could have just as easily happened when I was there; it is that this is not an uncommon practice. It is a chosen tactic in the war that lurks on the edge of the world's consciousness. 
   Just 2 weeks ago, the same government dropped bombs on a town in the Nuba Mountains area, killing 21. 
   What was the critical rebel target that day? It was a group of schoolchildren under a tree--not child soldiers, but children trying to learn to read. 
   These are just two in a long and sickening history of intentionally bombing civilians by the Government of Sudan. 
   How long does the world intend to tolerate these outrages? How long will the regime in Khartoum benefit from their prowess in public relations in the capitals of Europe and the Middle East --and on Wall Street? If indiscriminately bombing children and the infirm doesn't serve as a call to action, then what will it take? 
   I am realistic about what the world is willing to do. Rage and indignation are expected. But it is about 16 years past due for the ``international community'' that responds so generously and decisively in many other places to act forcefully and with clear purpose in Sudan. 
   The world should be ashamed that it has gone on so long. I am ashamed the United States has not made this a greater priority. For a country that is willing to act decisively in Bosnia and Kosovo, we should be ashamed of the anemic level of action to stop this war in Sudan. As a country that is willing to invade another country--Haiti--to stop violence and injustice, we should be ashamed by the fact that we are willing to do so little in Sudan. 
   I am not suggesting that the United States or anybody else become militarily involved in Sudan. Even if that were politically popular here, it would not be something I would recommend. But the world should be ashamed that we have failed to use all reasonable tools at our disposal. Some of our closest allies in Europe and the Middle East would be especially ashamed for their receptivity toward the regime in Khartoum. 
   Yes, I am outraged and disgusted by the bombings of 
   yesterday. I am outraged by the bombings of 2 weeks ago. I am outraged and disgusted by the past 16 years of brutality. I believe the administration and the world should share that outrage, and in some cases they do. 
   But outrage alone gets us no closer to bringing the war to a conclusion. It requires a credible, coherent, and forceful policy from the United States and from the world. 
   Our policy is only selectively forceful and, as a consequence, lacks coherence and credibility--both in Khartoum and in the capitals of the countries we  must have on board to end the war. Correcting those problems cannot happen overnight, but I propose a few steps we can now take. 
   First, the House of Representatives should act now to take up and pass the Sudan Peace Act. This bipartisan legislation was written primarily to address the deficiencies in the way our vast amounts of food aid are delivered, and to compel the administration and our allies to bring as much pressure to bear on the Government of Sudan--and the rebels--to get serious in the limping peace talks. This is a sensible and helpful step Congress can take right now. 
   Second, the United Nations should deploy monitors to areas of conflict in the Sudan now. The Government of Sudan has escaped the condemnation they deserve in large part because the eyes of the world are so far from this remote and enormous land. Human rights monitors can bring this to light and give the world the information they need to push for resolution of the war. Most importantly, they can force the turned eyes of the world to confront the manmade disaster in front of them. 
   Third, we must overhaul our humanitarian operations in Sudan now. They are in complete disarray. The Government of Sudan has the right--and routinely exercises it--to block any food shipments anywhere in Sudan with the stroke of a pen. It is an outrage that we allow them to manipulate our food aid as a weapon of war. They do it, and they do it with devastating effect. The United States and United Nations must make ending that veto power a top priority. I also call on the humanitarian organizations and the rebels to end their squabbling over the rules of operating and in rebel-held areas and get back to work now. In an argument that can only be described as petty and childish compared to the catastrophe at hand, some of the groups most important to an effective relief operation are pulling out. 
   Fourth, the administration and our European, Middle Eastern, and African allies must get the floundering peace process moving on. They need to stop letting the Government of Sudan manipulate the process and stop promising cease-fires and cooperation while continuing to carry on the war. In fact, a cease-fire is in effect now, if you can believe it. Our allies must be convinced to stop offering ``alternative'' peace negotiations to distract from what is really at issue in the talks in Nairobi. They must now set aside legalistic excuses and put the necessary pressure on the combatants to get to the table and get serious about ending the war. 
   Fifth, we must push our allies to stop responding to what is called Khartoum's ``Charm Offensive.'' This PR campaign paints a picture where Khartoum is simply ``misunderstood'' and unfairly vilified by the United States. They offer the cruise missile attack against the pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum as convincing evidence. They deny the ethnic cleansing in the south as just another arm of the American propaganda machine. 
   The lies have been alarmingly effective and little has been done to disabuse the world of the ridiculous notions. 
   No. 6, the access to weapons and capital the regime in Khartoum enjoys must be addressed now. The oil being exploited in contested areas of Sudan is fueling the war and allowing Khartoum to plow more money back into weapons purchases. Much of that money has been raised in the United States. Ironically, capital is raised on Wall Street, just blocks from the World Trade Center Towers, which were bombed by terrorist who operated with support from Sudan. I realize that controlling private and legal funds is tricky business, but the United States' continued ambiguity on this point gives the distinct impression that there is a price on the lives of the people of Sudan, and that the price has been determined. We cannot afford that ambiguity. We must begin an internationally coordinated effort to limit access to the weapons and capital that allows Khartoum to continue their war, just as the world did against the apartheid government of South Africa. Even now, a grassroots effort to push large investors in the United States and Canada to divest of the stocks of the companies operating in Sudan is gaining considerable momentum and having an effect on share prices. Their successes are drawn purely on the power of shame. Surely this tells us that economic pressures can work if coordinated and if supported with good information. Governments will respond to the same shame that investors respond to. It's a powerful tool in a coordinated diplomatic and economic push, and we would be remiss to not use it. 
   These recommendations are not unreasonable or particularly difficult tasks. These are things we can do right now beginning today. 
   It will not require a great deal of money. In fact, it may cost less than we spend now. What it will require, though, is effort, some discomfort and a significant amount of diplomatic and political capital. 
   What it requires most is leadership. We in Congress can press these issues, but we cannot unilaterally form our foreign policy. That is the Constitutional prerogative and responsibility of the President of the U.S. 
   The President should immediately become personally involved in seeking resolution and pressing these peaceful goals in Sudan. To date, he has not. 
   Just a little more than a month ago we observed ``the month of Africa'' at the United Nations. There, the war in the Congo was the focus. That war is compelling and the implications it has for the future of Africa are very real. It too deserves the focus and attention of the United Nations. 
   Yet the festering--and much more deadly--war in Sudan went without any serious consideration at the United Nations during ``the month of Africa.'' Not only is that shameful in itself, it was a lost opportunity. 
   We can afford no more lost opportunities when it comes to Sudan. This war has continued long enough and has cost enough lives. It has hovered on the edge of obscurity for too long. It is time to get the world to forcefully and directly address it. 
   Only the United States can provide that kind of leadership. And only the President can direct the United States' effort with any hope of ever being truly effective and bring the necessary diplomatic and economic forces to bear. 
   The President has a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives in Congress willing and waiting to help in that effort. As Chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, I pledge my commitment to such an effort. 
   It is unusual that we see such opportunities for immediate, bipartisan action in Congress, especially in an election year. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to pass up. To many lives have been lost. Too many lives are still at stake. The time to act is now.

   Mr. FRIST. Madam President, it is a pleasure to be opening this second session of the 106th Congress with a bill that is, I believe, so important in our  step-by-step approach to improving education, which is something I think both sides of the aisle feel strongly about. From the statements we have heard today and at the end of last week, and we will hear again and again, nothing is more important to America's future than addressing the education needs of our children. That is so for all the obvious reasons. There is nothing more important than education as we look at the preparation for quality of life, for looking at our Nation's overall economic prosperity domestically, but also as we look at issues such as global competitiveness. 
   As we heard this afternoon, every child in America does deserve the right to a drug-free classroom, to a violence-free classroom, with a highly qualified teacher at the head of that class. As a father of three young boys, 16, 14, and 12, I think a lot about education. I think a lot about how students can be best prepared for a future that is increasingly sophisticated in technology, information technology, and a global economy where competitiveness is not only with other people in the community but other people across the State, across the country, and across the world. 
   It comes back to that basic principle of local involvement, how we can step away from thinking education needs to be controlled by either us in the Senate or Washington, DC, or bureaucrats; and recognize it is that local control, those local schools that can best identify the needs of a local community with the involvement of parents who care the most about the education of their own children, and the involvement of principals in a local community. That is why last year my colleagues and I introduced legislation which we called Ed-Flex, which basically returns that power back to local communities, recognizing how limited we are, being right in Washington, DC, even assuming we can micromanage what goes on in Alamo, TN, or Soddy or Daisy, TN. It is those principals, those teachers, those parents, those superintendents, those districts that can best identify what the needs are of that community. 
   Ed-Flex allowed schools to use Federal money. That particular bill did not include new Federal money. Although I might add, we in the Senate, under Republican leadership--and I am very proud of this--did increase Federal spending last year by $500 million above what the President of the United States wanted or requested. The Republican leadership in the Senate sent a strong message: Yes, if we have local control, improved flexibility, and strong accountability, we will continue to invest, and invest heavily, in education across this country. 
   Ed-Flex took the same amount of money we had, but basically stripped away all the Washington redtape, freeing the shackles of these excessive, burdensome regulations that were added here in Washington, DC, but really handcuffing our teachers whose goal, whose profession is to educate people in that classroom, 
   children in that classroom. 
   Ed-Flex was a first step. Issues such as school safety are, again, very important issues that have to be addressed if that right really does include being in a classroom that is violence free and drug free. It is time we extend this concept of empowerment of families, of parents, of using resources locally so they can be directed where the needs are. That is what this legislation does. 
   I am pleased because this is a continuation of a process. Again, this particular bill doesn't answer all the education challenges we have, but it continues that process by giving significant relief to American families, to parents as they pursue the educational opportunities which we all--both sides of the aisle--know are so important. 
   I had the opportunity of presiding over the previous hour, and again you hear this particular bill does not do enough to improve all K-12 education, or all education. Yes, this particular bill is not intended to solve all of the problems or all of the challenges of education. But it does very specifically address a number of them. 
   At the same time this discussion on the floor continues, we are debating in committee what is called ESEA, although a lot of people are just getting familiar with what those letters mean. ESEA is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We are reauthorizing that large act, which addresses many of the other issues in education. This particular bill will likely be debated actively in committee within the next several weeks and then brought to the floor to follow the current bill about which we are talking. 
   It is this combination of the bill we are talking about on the floor--and I will come to a few more of the details in this bill--and the more comprehensive legislation of ESEA that I believe put together, building on Ed-Flex last year, building on the additional $500 million investment this body put in above the President, that moves us towards the goal on the right track with the right principles of local control, strong accountability, and increased flexibility that ultimately will improve our American education system. That is true especially where we need the improvement the most, and that is kindergarten through the 12th grade. 
   The ESEA, or the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, addresses issues on the spending side of the ledger. The bill we are addressing today addresses the tax-related issues associated with education as well as the savings side of education. We had hearings in the Senate a couple of weeks ago. My colleague from Tennessee, Senator THOMPSON, held hearings on the rising cost of college, how that can be addressed today. 
   One of the things that came out of those hearings is that we should do all we can to empower parents and students to save enough for a college education. 
   What do we have today? Under current law, a family can contribute $500 per year into an education IRA. I do not want to diminish that because it is very important. It again came from this particular body, of which I am very proud. But I think we can extend it. We have an opportunity to extend that limit in one part of this bill. 
   Last week in Tennessee, I had an opportunity to visit three different K-12 public schools. The teachers and parents who had come said: Senator FRIST, we don't want you to be telling us how many computers we can have, what kind of computers, and where to hook them up. We want you to help us to be free to spend the resources we have. And can't you help us save a little bit for our children's education in the future? Isn't there something you can do in terms of legislation? 
   IRAs are tremendous savings vehicles. The regular IRAs we have today simply do not help the conscientious people of Tennessee save enough money for their children's education because when you take money out of these traditional IRAs, you pay a significant penalty for early withdrawal. Therefore, the only savings vehicle we have today is the education IRA. But as I mentioned, the limit on maximum contributions is $500 a year, and that comes down to about $40 a month. I do not know about my colleagues, but that is about what my cable bill is each month. 
   In addition to raising that contribution limit for education IRAs, this bill will also allow the American family for the first time to use some of those education savings for expenses that are associated with K-12 education. Currently, with an education IRA as presently designed, one cannot use that money for K-12 expenses. I have heard a number of my colleagues claim that allowing families to use some of their own money for elementary and secondary education is a backdoor attempt for a voucher debate. I hate to hear that almost fearmongering of: Let's not talk about the issues at hand because what you are really talking about is vouchers, when they are totally disassociated. 
   It comes down to whose money is this? It is the family's money; it is their money to begin with. This whole debate on vouchers can be held on some other day. 
   I want to make it clear this savings proposal we are debating is no more a voucher proposal than a tax cut is a voucher proposal. 
   As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee's Task Force on Education, I had the opportunity to listen to people who were bringing before that task force creative solutions to the problems which plague our Nation's schools today. Although, again, we need to address that in a comprehensive manner, which we are doing, I believe expanding the education savings account is a positive, constructive first step, not a final solution.  
   It does move us in the important direction of empowering parents, children, and that parent-child team. Again, the concept is very different than a Washington, DC, one size fits all strategy or more mandates out of Washington. What we are doing is locally empowering that parent-child team. Who best can identify the local needs of that child? It might also be an individual with a disability. For the first time, we allow these K-12 funds to be used for the purchase of technology to make learning easier. Or we are empowering for the first time that parent and that child, through a savings account, to use those resources for afterschool tutoring for that child who cannot quite keep up or does not quite understand what the teacher is trying to say. 
   On the issue of expansion of the definition of qualified education expenses, again, it has been talked about, but I want to make the point that you can do these things for higher education, but it is K-12 for which you cannot use these funds. Therefore, this expansion of definitions is critically important. It can be 
   used for fees, it can be used for academic tutoring as I mentioned, for books, or for supplies. It can be used for the cost of computers or technology, for those individuals with disabilities. It might be a tool that allows one either to hear a little bit better or to express one's self if one is unable to talk. Home schooling expenses, again, can qualify. We all know it is parents who know best and who care the most about their children's future. 
   The President signed in 1997 the Taxpayer Relief Act which authorized new education IRAs for those higher education expenses. I have been very supportive of that, and this body has been very supportive of that. What we want to do now is take those moneys and apply it to K-12. 
   Higher education in this country is the envy of the world. There is no question about it. We have the greatest higher education system of all 140 or 150 countries anywhere in the world. But what about kindergarten through 12? Are we the best? No. Are we in the top four or five? I can tell you what TIMSS, the Third International Math and Science Study, shows. 
   Looking at math and science and the 12th grade where one would think we would be the very best with the prosperity and the freedoms we have and our emphasis on education and the best higher education, surely in the 12th grade we are the best. In math and science, which we know pretty well are the backbone of technology and job creation of the future, we are not first in the world. We are not 5th in the world. We are not 8th in the world. We are not 12th in the world. We are not 15th in the world. We are not 18th in the world. But we are 19th and 20th in the world when it comes to the 12th grade. We are failing in K-12. 
   There are a number of issues we can talk about, and I know there are other Members on the floor who want to speak, but I do want to mention the employer-sponsored aspect of this bill. We will talk a lot about the education savings account as we go forward, but in addition, this bill extends the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance and restores the exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance at the graduate level. 
   The Senator from Iowa was just in the Chamber and emphasized a very important point that can be overlooked but should not because it is a very important part of the bill, in that the bill eliminates the limit on the number of months a taxpayer may deduct the interest costs that he or she must pay on his or her student loan. 
   As a reminder, currently a taxpayer can only deduct the interest on his or her loan for 5 years, regardless of how long he or she must pay interest on that loan. The provision allows taxpayers to deduct the interest that must be paid on a student loan for the lifetime of that loan. 
   In closing, I want to mention that the bill itself does provide help for all of those schools, as well as those school districts in need of school construction, school modernization. Thus, I am pleased the majority leader has brought this bill before the Senate for early consideration. I applaud his decision to do so. It builds upon what we did in the last session. It sets us on the right track focusing on K-12 education, and there is no more important issue as we look to the future than education. 
   If we can complete action on this particular bill and then complete action on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will have addressed both the spending side of the equation, as well as the tax side of the equation, both of which are important to improving and strengthening education in this country. 
   We can do all of that before Easter. 
   I compliment the Senator from Georgia, who has worked on this particular issue during the whole period I have been in the Senate. His leadership is impressive. He is a mentor to many of us on education. I appreciate his hard work. I urge my colleagues to support this very important bill in order to expand education opportunities for families and students, yes, in Tennessee but all across America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce America's Math and Science Excellence Act that will keep the United States on the cutting edge of the Information Technology (IT) revolution. If we are to prepare our children to meet the demands of our future workforce, we must dedicate ourselves to strengthening math and science literacy. America's Math and Science Excellence Act would authorize funding for math and science education and training through a series of grants awarded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This bill would create a long-term strategy to ensure that the IT industry is employing American students who are prepared to enter the workforce with sufficient math and science skills necessary to compete both domestically and internationally. 
   The Third International Math and Science Study, the most comprehensive and rigorous comparison of quantitative skills across nations, reveals that the longer our students stay in the elementary and public school system, the worse they perform on standardized tests. Their average tests scores continue to drop from the fourth to the twelfth grade. The rapidly changing technology revolution demands skills and proficiency in mathematics, science, and technology. IT, perhaps the fastest growing sector of our economy, relies on more than basic high school literacy in mathematics and science. 
   This bipartisan legislation targets three specific goals: establishing teacher training and development outreach, providing internship opportunities for students in secondary and higher education, and assisting graduate math, science, and engineering students. America's Math and Science Excellence Act gives priority to applicants who obtain private sector or state matching funds. We must encourage private industry to not only get involved in the education of the future workforce, but also to help direct and guide it. 
   According to a study by the CEO Forum on Education and Technology, our schools spend an average of $88 per student on computers and only $6 on teacher training. And while the nation's 87,000 schools have approximately six million computers and about 80 percent of the schools have Internet access, the report stated that few teachers are ready to use the technology in their lessons. This is a national tragedy. During the past ten years, we have seen a transformation in classrooms throughout the country. Computers have replaced blackboards and students now depend on the Internet for basic knowledge. Yet teachers are not equipped to incorporate technological tools into their curricula. 
   The ``IT Teacher Training Grants'' created by this legislation support professional advancement in the related fields of IT for teachers who instruct elementary, secondary, or charter school students. These grants may be used for teacher salaries, fees for attending 
   special conferences, workshops, or training sessions. They may also be used for the development of a compensation system that rewards excellence in math and science related areas. In administering these grants, the National Science Foundation shall give priority consideration to schools that score in the 25th percentile or below for academic performance according to their respective state standards, and programs that provide matching funds from the private sector. 
   The ``Twenty-First Century Workforce Internship Grants'' will consist of awards to students in secondary schools, as well as students from institutions of higher learning to explore internships in IT. The goal of this program is to transition students' math and science skills into the new digital workforce. By providing them with opportunities to explore the private sector, these grants will enable the next generation of labor to experience the IT professional domain, while maintaining their knowledge and proficiency in basic math, science, and engineering skills. 
   The national demand for computer scientists, computer engineers, and systems analysts by 2006 is projected to be more than double our current capacity. In addition, the supply of new graduates qualified for these positions is expected to fall significantly short of the number needed. This deficiency of qualified workers in the United States  is due in part to a lack of students pursuing advanced degrees in mathematics, science, and engineering technology. The number of degrees in technical science and engineering fields awarded by American institutions of higher learning has declined dramatically since 1990. Foreign national students in the United States were awarded 47 percent of Doctorate degrees in engineering, 38 percent of Master's degrees, and 46 percent of Doctorate degrees in computer science in 1996. The ``IT State Scholarship Program,'' established in this legislation, targets individual states to provide them with supplementary scholarships for students who want to pursue graduate and doctoral degrees in math, science, engineering, or related fields. Two-thirds of these funds shall be awarded to students from low-income families. Furthermore, the director of the National Science Foundation shall award these grants to states who provide at least one half of the cost of grant. 
   Finally, this act will reauthorize the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a Twenty-First Century Teacher Enhancement Program. This initiative was originally written into statute as part of the ``Technology Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.'' However, we have yet to see the implementation of this program. So I will again request through legislation that NIST establish summer program to provide professional development for elementary and secondary math and science teachers. I continue to believe that offering teachers opportunities to participate in ``hands-on'' experiences at NIST laboratories would be invaluable to their understanding of math and science. Not only would this program develop and improve their teaching strategies and self-confidence in instructing math and science, but it would also demonstrate their impact on commerce. 
   We cannot continue to marvel at our robust economy without also looking toward the next century and developing a plan to sustain it. The reality is simple: we must prepare our students to enter the workforce and to prosper in the new digital economy. It is not enough to put computers in every classroom if our nation's teachers cannot implement them effectively into their daily lesson plans. Educating our children and the teachers who instruct them is essential to our economic future. 
   Mr. President, I strongly believe that each of the programs within America's Math and Science Excellence Act will encourage state and local educators, as well as private industry, to engage themselves in the fight to increase basic math and science literacy. These grants target specific long-term deficiencies in the IT workforce shortage and will help create innovative solutions to our current national dilemma. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this critical piece of legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Next Generation Internet 2000 Act, a multi-agency research and development program designed to fund advanced networking infrastructure and technologies. Two and a half years ago, I stood in this exact spot and introduced its predecessor, the ``Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998.'' While scientists throughout the country have made tremendous inroads since that time, the digital divide makes the truth clear and simple: we are leaving many of our fellow Americans behind. The Next Generation Internet 2000 will attempt to eliminate these geographical barriers, while providing research funding for a faster, more secure and robust network infrastructure for all Americans. 
   The Internet is one of the most significant developments of the last decade. Its significance is not limited to the new industries that it has created nor the new educational opportunities that it affords. The impact of the Internet goes beyond those things. With the development of electronic commerce, the Internet has radically altered the economic landscape of this country. Advances in industries are taking place at a faster and faster pace. At the heart of this dizzying pace of change are two things: computers and communications. More and more we are seeing that computers and communications means the Internet. 
   If you had to find a prototypical success story, it could very well be the Internet. There are in fact, multiple dimensions to its success. It was and is a successful public-private collaboration. It demonstrated successful commercial application of technology developed as part of mission directed research program. It showed a successful transition of an operational system from the public to the private sector. Perhaps most of all, it is a prime example of a successful federal investment. 
   In some respects the Internet is now ``suffering'' from too much success. With the advent of tools that have made the Internet easy to use, there has been an explosion in the growth of network traffic. As computers become more powerful, applications more sophisticated, and the user interfaces get easier to use, we can look forward to an even greater demand for network bandwidth. 
   The Internet and its promising applications have transformed our daily lives. They have reshaped the ways in which we communicate at work, and with our families; they have made revolutionary medical advances a reality that we once thought impossible only a few years ago. But each day, as more and more of our neighbors become connected to the World Wide Web and experience the amazement of its potential, certain segments of our nation are left without these same opportunities. 
   Since the enactment of the Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998, the National Science Foundation has connected hundreds of new sites to a testbed providing a 100-fold increase in network performance. And the Department of Defense is currently deploying a testbed with 1,000-fold increased performance at over twenty sites to support networking research and applications deployment. As we applaud the success of the first three years of the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, we must also realize its current limitations. 
   In the review of the first two years of the initiative, the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee recommended that the NGI program should continue to focus on the utility of the Next Generation Internet's gigabit bandwidth to end-users, its increased security, and its expanded quality of service. More importantly, the committee shared Congress' concern that no federal program specifically addresses the geographical penalty issue--the imposition of costs on users of the Internet in rural or other locations that are disproportionately greater than the costs imposed on users in locations closer to high populations. I must admit that this is a great disappointment for myself and my colleagues who fought to combat this geographical penalty through the authorization of NGI in 1998. Unfortunately, the White House did not take us seriously and did not follow through with the complete implementation of the original act. 
   The Next Generation Internet 2000 makes a distinct departure from its predecessor. First, it designates ten percent of the overall program funding for research to reduce the cost of Internet access services available to all users in geographically remote areas. It further prioritizes that these research grants be awarded to qualified college-level educational institutions located in Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research states. 
   Second, the act requires that five percent of the research grants shall be made available to minority institutions including Hispanic, Native American, Historically Black Colleges and small colleges and universities. The most efficient way to open the Internet superhighway to everyone is to provide scientists in every corner of the nation with opportunities to perform peer-reviewed and merit-based research. 
   Finally, the National Academy of Sciences is requested to conduct a study to determine the extent to which the Internet backbone and network infrastructure contribute to the digital divide. The study will further assess the existing geographical penalty and its impact on all users and their ability to obtain secure and reliable Internet access. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, the House and Senate Conference Committee reached agreement on the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, which addresses  a fundamental inequity for individuals with disabilities. 
   As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I witnessed unfair discrimination against patients with disabilities. After a successful transplant, several of my patients were faced with a serious dilemma. They had to choose between keeping their health insurance coverage or returning to work. Under current law, if these patients choose to return to work and earn more than $500 per month, they lose their disability payments and health care coverage provided through Medicare and Medicaid as part of their Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). This is health care coverage that they simply cannot get in the private sector, as it is extremely difficult for individuals with severe disabilities to obtain coverage due to their medical history. 
   Let me illustrate the profound impact this dilemma has had on our disabled Americans. Today, the unemployment rate among working-age adults with disabilities is nearly 75 percent. Only 7% of disabled Americans--318,728 of the 4.2 million non-blind individuals with disabilities--were working in 1997, according the General Accounting Office. Many persons with disabilities who currently receive federal disability benefits, such as SSDI and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), want to work; however, less than one-half of one percent of these beneficiaries successfully forego disability benefits and become self-sufficient. If disabled individuals try to work and increase their income, they lose their disability cash benefits and their health care coverage. The loss of these benefits is simply too powerful of a disincentive to return to work. 
   In addition, more than 7.5 million disabled Americans receive cash benefits from SSI and SSDI. Disability benefit spending for SSI and SSDI totals $73 billion a year, making these disability programs the fourth largest entitlement expenditure in the federal government. If only one percent--or 75,000--of the 7.5 million disabled adults were to become employed, federal savings in disability benefits would total $3.5 billion over the lifetime of the beneficiaries. Removing barriers to work is not only a major benefit to disabled Americans in their pursuit of self-sufficiency, but it also contributes to preserving the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   This legislation is critical to the health and well-being of our disabled Americans. It will create new opportunities for individuals with disabilities to return to work while allowing them to maintain their health insurance coverage and disability benefits. In particular, this bill expands new options to states under the Medicaid program for workers with disabilities; continues Medicare coverage for working individuals with disabilities; and establishes a ticket to work and self-sufficiency program. 
   I would like to thank Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this critical issue. I would also like to thank Senators LOTT, ROTH, MOYINHAN and KENNEDY and their House colleagues for their dedication toward reaching consensus on this important legislation.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed today, S. 1243, the Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act, which I introduced on June 18, 1999 to address the serious issue of prostate cancer. 
   This year 37,000 American men will die, and 179,300 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Cancer of the prostate grows slowly, without symptoms, and thus is often undetected until in its most advanced and incurable stage. It is critical that men are aware of the risk of prostate cancer and take steps to ensure early detection. 
   While the average age of a man diagnosed with prostate cancer is 66, the chance of developing prostate cancer rises dramatically with age--which makes it important for men to be screened or consult their health care professional. The American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association recommend that men over 50 receive both an annual physical exam and a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test. African-American men, who are at higher risk, and men with a family history of prostate cancer should begin yearly screening at age 40. 
   Even if the blood test is positive, however, it does not mean that a man definitely has prostate cancer. In fact, only 25 percent of men with positive PSAs actually have prostate cancer. Further testing is needed to determine if cancer is actually present. Once the cancer is diagnosed, treatment options vary according to the individual. In elderly men, for example, the cancer may be especially slow growing and may not spread to other parts of the body. In those cases, treatment of the prostate may not be necessary, and physicians often monitor the cancer with follow-up examinations. 
   Unfortunately, preventive risk factors for prostate cancer are currently unknown and the effective measures to prevent this disease have not been determined. In addition, scientific evidence is insufficient to determine if screening for prostate cancer reduces deaths or if treatment of disease at an early stage is more effective than no treatment in prolonging a person's life. Currently, health practitioners cannot accurately determine which cancer will progress to become clinically significant and which will not. Thus, screening and testing for early detection of prostate cancer should be discussed between a man and his health care practitioners. 
   In an effort to help address the serious issues of prostate cancer screening,  to increase awareness and surveillance of prostate cancer, and to unlock the current mysteries of prostate cancer through research, the ``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act'' expands the authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry-out activities related to prostate cancer screening, overall awareness, and surveillance of the disease. In addition, the bill extends the authority of the National Institutes of Health to conduct basic and clinical research in combating prostate cancer. 
   The bill directs the CDC to establish grants to States and local health departments in an effort to increase awareness, surveillance, information dissemination regarding prostate cancer, and to examine the scientific evidence regarding screening for prostate cancer. The main focus is to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of various screening strategies for prostate cancer and the establishment of a public information and education program about the issues regarding prostate cancer. The CDC will also strengthen and improve surveillance on the incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer with a major force on increasing the understanding of the greater risk of this disease in African-American men. 
   The bill also reauthorizes the authority of the CDC to conduct a prostate screening program upon consultation with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and professional organizations regarding the scientific issues regarding prostate cancer screening. The screening program, when implemented, will provide grants to States and local health departments to screen men for prostate cancer with priority given to low income men and African-American men. In addition the screening program will provide referrals for medical treatment of those screened and ensure appropriate follow up services including case management. 
   Finally, to continue the investment in medical research, the bill extends the authority of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health to conduct and support research to expand the understanding of the cause of, and find a cure for, prostate cancer. Activities authorized include basic research concerning the etiology and causes of prostate cancer, and clinical research concerning the causes, prevention, detection and treatment of prostate cancer. 
   Mr. President, on the very day I introduced this bill last June, I participated in an event sponsored by the American Cancer Society and Endocare to award our former colleague Senator Dole for his leadership in raising public awareness for prostate cancer. In 1991, Senator Dole was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and since that diagnosis and successful treatment he has turned this potential tragedy into a triumph as he has helped untold others by raising public awareness of this devastating disease. I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Dole and organizations that have worked tirelessly to help promote this and other men's health issues, including The American Cancer Society, The Men's Health Network, and American Urological Association. I also want to thank these organizations for their support and help in drafting this legislation. I am pleased that the Senate has acted to pass this important bill, which will help to further increase awareness, surveillance and research of this deadly disease, and look forward to its ultimate enactment into law.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate passage of S. 1488, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act, a bill which I believe will save lives by examining the appropriate placement of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in federal buildings and extending protection for those who supply and administer these life saving devices. 
   Each year, over 250,000 Americans suffer sudden cardiac arrest with only 5% surviving. Sudden cardiac arrest is a common cause of death in which the heart suddenly lapses into a chaotic rhythm known as ventricular fibrillation and stops pumping blood. As a result, the individual collapses, stops breathing and has no pulse. Often the heart can be shocked back into a normal rhythm with the aid of a defibrillator. This is exactly what happened when I resuscitated a patient with cardioplumonary resuscitation (CPR) and electrical cardioversion in the Dirksen Senate Office Building in 1995. I am pleased to report that he is doing well now four years later. 
   When a person goes into cardiac arrest time is of the essence and every second counts. For every minute that passes without defibrillation, a person's chance of survival decreases by about 10 percent. Thus, having an automated external defibrillator (AED) in an accessible place is important. AEDs are portable, lightweight, easy to use and are becoming an essential part of administering first aid to a victim of sudden cardiac arrest. 
   We have seen that in places where AEDs are readily available, survival rates in some areas increase to as much as 20-30% and in some settings they have even reached 70%. During the 105th Congress, I authored the ``Aviation Medical Assistance Act,'' which was ultimately signed into law. This bill directed the Federal Aviation Administration to decide whether to require AEDs on aircraft and in airports. As a result of this new law, many airplanes now carry AEDs on board, and some airports have placed AEDs in their terminals. At Chicago O'Hare, just 4 months after AEDs were placed in that airport, 4 victims were resuscitated using the publicly available AEDs. 
   Currently, there is a movement in the States to expand the availability of AEDs by expressly extending Good Samaritan liability protection to users and providers of the devices. However, in federal jurisdictions such as court houses, federal agencies, and parks, there has been no coordinated effort to determine where AEDs ought to be placed and how an effective training program should occur. In addition, agencies that seek to obtain AEDs for high-risk populations report deferring purchases due to concerns about litigation and liability. 
   To help address this problem, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act requests that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services make recommendations for public access to defibrillation programs in federal buildings and extends Good Samaritan protection for automated external defibrillator users and providers in States that have not yet passed state legislation on this issue. 
   The bill does not require purchase of the devices, it simply asks for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop recommendations as to how best to develop these programs. The Good Samaritan portion of the bill is crafted so as not to pre-empt existing State laws, as well as to encourage States to continue to act on this issue in the future. In a matter of two or three years, 43 states have passed some form of AED Good Samaritan protection, which this bill will not pre-empt. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has taken action on this important piece of legislation and I look forward to its ultimate enactment into law. I want to thank my colleague, Senator GORTON, for taking the lead on this life saving proposal. I also would like to thank the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross for their help in drafting this legislation.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electronic Commerce Technology Promotion Act. I am very pleased to be joined by Senators MCCAIN and BINGAMAN. 
   Electronic commerce has fundamentally changed the way we do business, promising increased efficiency and improved quality at lower cost. It has been widely embraced by industry, both in the United States and abroad. This is evident in the growth of the electronic commerce market, which though almost non-existent just a few years ago, is expected to top a staggering $1 trillion by 2003, according to market research reports. 
   The basis for the growth of electronic commerce is the potential that electronic transactions can be completed seamlessly and simultaneously, regardless of geographical boundaries. Inherent in this is the ability of different systems to communicate and exchange data, commonly referred to as ``system interoperability''. The continued growth of global electronic commerce depends on a fundamental set of technical standards that enable essential technologies to interoperate, and on a policy and legal framework that supports the development that the market demands in a timely manner. 
   The United States is leading this global revolution. Our industries are at the forefront in every sector, continually evolving their businesses and developing new technologies to adapt to changing market needs. Continued growth of the overall electronic commerce market is vital to our economy as well as the global market. 
   For the electronic commerce market to sustain its current phenomenal growth rate, companies must be allowed to be agile and flexible in responding to market needs, their activities unfettered by cumbersome and static regulations. The federal government must allow the private sector to continue to take the lead in developing this dynamic global market, and refrain from undue regulatory measures wherever possible. 
   At the same time, the federal government must unambiguously signal its strong desire to promote and facilitate the growth of the electronic commerce market by adopting and deploying relevant electronic commerce technologies within the federal agencies, as well as widely promoting their use by small and medium-sized enterprises. 
   Usage of these technologies in the federal agencies enables us to share in the benefits of the electronic commerce revolution and participate more effectively as an active contributor in the private sector efforts to develop the frameworks and specifications necessary for systems and components to interoperate. This has the added advantage of allowing the government to intercede in a timely manner, either in failure conditions or to remove barriers erected by foreign governments. Furthermore, we would be strengthening our global leadership position, while at the same time establishing a model for other governments and enabling the growth of the global electronic commerce market. 
   Small and medium-sized businesses have traditionally been the fastest growing segment of our economy, contributing more than 50 percent of the private sector output in the United States. Electronic commerce has the potential to enable these enterprises to enter the market with lower entry costs, yet extend their reach to a much larger market. The federal government has an inherent interest in helping them to maintain their global competitiveness. 
   It is in response to these needs that I introduce today the Electronic Commerce Technology Promotion Act. The legislation establishes a Center of Excellence for Electronic Commerce at the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) that will act as a centralized resource of information for federal agencies and small and medium-sized businesses in electronic commerce technologies and issues. My  intention is not to create yet another program at NIST which will require substantial appropriations, but to create an office that focuses solely on electronic commerce by building upon existing expertise and resources. We have proposed that the Center be organized as a matrix organization that will coordinate existing as well as future activities at the Institute on electronic commerce. 
   The Center will also coordinate its activities with the Department of Commerce's Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP) and the Small Business Administration to provide assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises on issues related to the deployment and use of electronic commerce technologies, including developing training modules and software toolkits. In working jointly, the Center can build upon the existing MEP infrastructure to reach out to these businesses. It is important to note that my intention is not to enlarge or modify the charter of the MEP program. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the growth of the electronic commerce market is vital to our economic growth. It is our responsibility to facilitate this growth as well as do our best to enable the market to sustain its current phenomenal growth rate. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support timely passage of this legislation so that we can give our unambiguous support for the development of electronic commerce as a market-driven phenomenon, and signal our strong desire to promote and facilitate the growth of the electronic commerce market.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have joined Senators BREAUX and KERREY here this evening to introduce a bill to comprehensively reform Medicare. The obvious question is, why is it necessary to reform Medicare? The very simple answer is that our seniors need and deserve better health care than what the current Medicare program can provide. The problem facing Medicare today is that, although we are in 1999, we are still relying on an antiquated system based on a 1965 model of health care. Medicare today is an inflexible system, it is an incomplete system, and it is a system that is going bankrupt. The rigidity of Medicare today limits access to new treatments and medical technologies, whether it is transplantation or treatment for hypertension. 
   The benefit package, in particular, is severely outdated, as evidenced by a lack of outpatient prescription drug coverage. I can tell you as a physician, that in order to deliver quality health care to our seniors, prescription drug coverage is imperative. 
   Most seniors today do not realize the Federal Government only pays 53 percent, or about half, of their overall health care costs. Our nation's seniors deserve better. 
   Right now, Medicare is micromanaged by Congress through 130,000 pages of regulations, 4 times the number of pages for the IRS code. Right now there are over 10,000 different prices in 3,000 different counties which are managed by the Health Care Financing Administration and Congress. 
   With 77 million baby boomers entering the Medicare program in 2010, we can expect a doubling of our eligible Medicare beneficiaries over the next 30 years. Medicare, in it's current form, is not prepared for and cannot endure these immense demographic changes. The program is already due to be insolvent by the year 2015. 
   This bill incorporates three main concepts. The first is health care security for our seniors. The second is choice, to meet beneficiaries' individual health care needs, as Senator BREAUX just outlined. The third is the establishment of a comprehensive, health care system that offers an integrated set of benefits. 
   We model this proposal on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. As the Senator from Louisiana just said, that is the way we in Congress get our health care. In addition, 9 million others get their health care through the FEHBP model. We have a long history, almost 40 years of experience with this model. All federal employees, including myself and my family, receive a description of benefits and choices, which outlines all the plans available in a geographic area, including the cost and quality of each plan. It is all right here in this booklet. This is what we as Members of Congress have today and it is what our seniors deserve. 
   This bill guarantees all current Medicare benefits, which is critical in maintaining health care security. Regardless of what plan a beneficiary chooses, HCFA-sponsored or private, all benefits in Medicare are guaranteed in a system based on choice and competition. 
   For the first time in Medicare, not only are outpatient prescription drugs offered to all beneficiaries, but all Medicare beneficiaries receive a discount for drug benefits. Full coverage is offered for beneficiaries below 135 percent of poverty. For beneficiaries between 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty there will be a discount based on a sliding scale, ranging from 50 percent to 25 percent. For all other beneficiaries who are above 150 percent of poverty, a 25-percent discount is offered. 
   This bill protects beneficiaries against high out-of-pocket costs. Most seniors do not realize today that if they get sick, there is no limit on what they will pay for care. We, for the first time, through enrollment in a high-option plan, limit out-of-pocket expenditures to $2,000 for core Medicare benefits. 
   This bill also offers low-income and rural protections. In our legislation, we specifically address the lack of private plans in certain areas, such as rural areas. In these underserved or rural areas, we make sure that affordable health care is available for seniors. We guarantee both the current Medicare benefits and prescription drug benefits. 
   We include beneficiary outreach and education efforts coordinated at the federal, state and local levels, to ensure timely, accurate, and understandable information, outlining affordable health care options, is available for all Medicare beneficiaries. 
   In summary, the bill we have introduced today promotes high-quality, comprehensive, integrated health care for our seniors that meets their individual needs. It assists all beneficiaries, especially those with low incomes, in obtaining comprehensive benefits, including prescription drug coverage. It increases the flexibility of the Medicare program to capture innovations in medicine. Whether it is new technologies, new breakthroughs in medicines, or new drugs, it is important seniors have access to these services, something they don't have today. This bill also ends congressional micromanagement. We have been struggling all week with fixes to a Balanced Budget Act from 2 years ago, trying to figure out how to correct the problems we created by micromanaging Medicare on the Senate floor. This just does not make sense. As I said, there are over 130,000 pages of regulations that we are trying to oversee here in Congress. Finally, we adopt a stable, competitive system based on the proven FEHBP model. This bill is based on competition, choice, health care security, and the need for comprehensive and integrated benefits, including prescription drugs. 
   I urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation as it is a critical focal point and sets the stage for future discussions as we address Medicare reform and modernization.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are witnessing today the passage of legislation that is critical to improving the quality of health care in this country. The ``Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999,'' which I introduced on March 10, 1999, will significantly increase our federal investment in health care research and science-based evidence to improve the quality of patient care. 
   The health care system is a dramatically different system today than a decade ago when the Congress established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. The financing and delivery of health care has changed as we have moved to more complex systems such as managed care. At the same time, there has been an explosion of new medical information stemming from our biomedical research advances. As a result, patients and providers face increased difficulty in tracking and understanding the latest scientific findings. 
   As we have seen in the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, issues regarding the quality and appropriate use of health care services is a significant public policy concern. Thus, I felt it was important to include S. 580 in the Patients' Bill of Rights Act that passed the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on March 18, 1999, and subsequently passed the Senate on July 15, 1999. As one of the conferees on the Patients' Bill of Rights, I look forward to working with my colleagues in an effort to improve the quality of health care delivered in this country by passing strong patient protection legislation next year. However, as we have been working on the legislation regarding AHCPR for quite some time--I introduced the first version of the bill, S. 2208, on June 23, 1998--I felt strongly that we pass the legislation reauthorizing the agency this year.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the United States Senate will pass today, S. 976, the ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act,'' which I introduced on May 6, 1999. This action follows the overwhelming endorsement of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which passed this bill by a vote of 17 to 1 on July 28, 1999.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the question before the Senate now--the Africa trade package and enhancement of the (Caribbean Basin Initiative) (CBI)--is a simple question of recognizing and seizing opportunities for America. 
   As the world continues to open trade and reduce barriers with GATT and various regional groupings and agreements the opportunity to gain competitive advantage over Europe and the industrialized countries of Asia could not be more starkly presented than with this package. 
   In terms of the Caribbean and Central America that opportunity begins almost right off our Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. The mutual benefit of those relationships is recognized across the board in both the United States and in the region. 
   The American textiles industry, which has taken such a hit in the past two decades, recognize the potential that CBI has with respect to competing with Europe and Asia in the next 10 years. Many of the companies see the future of the industry in America dependent on gaining that advantage through CBI and other trade agreements. We should recognize and seize that opportunity. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa presents an entirely different set of opportunities and considerations. 
   We have also heard a great deal of concern about what this bill will or will not do for Africa. 
   Much of that concern is because Africa truly sits on the margins of our external trade relationships. It also sits on the margins of our national interests. But it's not just us. Africa sits on the margins of the global economy, where the gap between it and the developed world continues to grow wider at a disturbing rate. 
   In the minds of many people it is a lost continent, typified by extreme poverty and horrific brutality. The number of countries is confusing, as are the fluid alliances and corrupt bases of power which dictate the continent's life. 
   As Chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I must admit that it is very difficult to associate the names of Somalia, Rwanda, Congo, Angola, Burundi, Sierra Leone, and even Sudan with opportunity and potential benefits to the United States. But the continent cannot be viewed as a single entity, and, even in the midst of tragedy and suffering, they still have such great untapped potential. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa has--depending on whom you ask--a collective population approaching 700 million people. They are overwhelmingly poor and quite often isolated. But take even half that number and view them as potential consumers of American goods, and the opportunities for beneficial trade look better. 
   In July I held roundtable discussion in the Africa Subcommittee with some of the top fund managers, past 
   and current Administration officials, and economists, regarding the barriers to investment in Africa. This group brought together very disparate interests and somewhat differing views of how to address those barriers, but a single, profound view was shared by all: Africa is truly the final frontier for American investment and trade, and that the potential is great enough that it must be given immediate and higher priority by policy makers. 
   Although the continent is troubled and presents less immediate returns than our expanded trade relationships with Latin America, Asia, and Europe, the potential benefits to the United States 10 to 20 years from now are so great that we would be remiss if we did not act now. We have before us an opportunity to start diversifying and nurturing that growth outside of the extractive industries, and to profoundly influence the future of Africa. 
   The Africa trade legislation is not a comprehensive set of tools to address those barriers and gain advantage in that last frontier--it has never been billed as such and Senators should not consider it such when they vote. But it is a good start. And, remarkably, it is a beginning point upon which both Americans and Africans have agreed. 
   That is a remarkable opportunity in what has otherwise been a troubled and neglected relationship. 
   But I differ with the ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee and the other well-meaning opponents that this effort is fatally flawed. I differ as well on the idea that we must do all or nothing with respect to our potential trade relationships and policies toward Africa on this piece of legislation. That will be a long and difficult process and one which will require much more than legislation. 
   The Africa trade bill also has virtues beyond the expansion of trade. 
   The United States' national interests in Africa are not clearly understood, and, as a consequence, our policy goals are often ill-defined. Even as the Secretary of State completed her trip to the continent last week, we find a lack of a consensus on the security, economic and humanitarian interests we have there. 
   One point that is clearly understood and agreed upon on both sides of the aisle and throughout policy circles in the United States and the entire developed world, is that our actions must promote greater freedom and opportunity for Africans who suffer under some of the most incompetent, corrupt and sadistic regimes on the face of the earth. 
   These regimes also affect our lives when organized crime, terrorists, drug traffickers and disease have found fertile ground and purchase on a continent that has been so ravaged. 
   In the post-cold-war era, the United States; approach to Africa has been driven almost exclusively by foreign assistance packages. During the cold war, the same was true, but we added the dimension of proxy wars against Soviet and Cuban aggression. That approach was reasonable at the time, considering what was at stake for us, but it did not leave a good legacy on the continent. 
   We now have what is a tremendous opportunity to begin fundamentally changing that legacy and, as I noted in the opening sentences of my remarks, to seize opportunities. 
   If you consider the effectiveness of aid to Africa in achieving those goals a continent-wide scale, the record is not good. Almost all of Africa has seen a reduction in income and, now, life expectancy, since we began direct assistance programs in the late 1950s to mid 1960s. Regardless of that record, it is clear that monetary assistance alone is not an acceptable foundation for our relations with an entire continent. 
   This initiative, though, is quite different and it represents much more than simply a ``trade not aid'' approach. Not only does it potentially benefit us as well, it contains incentives for simple yet critical changes in governance in Africa. 
   Those incentives and mutual benefits have the added and rather dramatic quality of being backed by (literally) every single potential participant on the continent. Every single one.  
   That includes former South African President Nelson Mandela, who has been erroneously portrayed as opposing this bill. 
   I think it is paternalistic to assert that African nations do not understand the effects this bill would have on them. And I do not believe that these nations have unrealistic expectations of its potential benefits. 
   Africans widely view their interaction with the outside world as one that has been anything from exploitative at worst to unequal at best. From the time of the first penetration of the African interior by slavers and ivory hunters until today, that has been the case--regardless of intent. Even benevolent missions were viewed as unintentional but nonetheless effective entrees for colonial powers' exploitation of the continent. 
   Interestingly, our own foreign assistance to the continent--which is viewed as a product of goodwill and of shared goals with reformers--does not escape that stigma. 
   As with any donor/recipient relationship, the recipient will always be viewed as ``less equal'' than the donor. That fact is unavoidable and, indeed, universal. 
   Although cash-strapped and desperately needy, Africans rightfully view a purely donor/recipient relationship between us and them as another manifestation of the treatment of Africans as less than equal--again, that is regardless of intent. 
   This legislation is clearly viewed differently by Africans, and that's why I am puzzled and unimpressed with the accusations by opponents of this effort that it is ``exploitative.'' That somehow American corporations are simply going to reinvent that age-old relationship of Africa to the world and this will be their vehicle to do so. This effort is about realizing opportunities to build new mutually beneficial ties between the United States and Africa. 
   That is the Africans' view, at least. And that is why they bristle at the idea that this effort is not in their best interest, that they must be protected from something which they see as beneficial and positive. 
   In effect, it says to them that they must be protected from beginning to build relationships with America where they can be equals, where they are not simply something to pity and to patronize. 
   This bill will not change that attitude nor the continent overnight. As I said earlier, it is neither comprehensive trade legislation for Africa, nor is it a comprehensive policy toward Africa. It is a beginning, though. An important beginning. And, despite its potential flaws, it is critically important to pass this bill if we ever want to help bring Africa away from the margins, away from the suffering and human and environmental disasters and into the fold of developed and free nations. 
   That effort will require American leadership, and that leadership requires a first step. This effort is just such a first step, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it and to defend it from those who would kill it, obstruct it or otherwise defeat it, either out of protectionist or other outmoded sentiments.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support as a cosponsor of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1999, a bill to extend and improve our Nation's developmental disabilities programs which allow individuals with developmental disabilities, such as mental retardation and severe physical disabilities, to live more independent and productive lives. 
   As the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy during the 104th Congress, I introduced the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1996 which successfully extended this vital law. Through this experience, I became aware of the importance of the programs under this Act and how they work to improve the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities. 
   Before the DD Act was first signed in 1963, Americans who happened to be born with developmental disabilities often lived and died in institutions where many were subjected to unspeakable conditions, far worse than conditions found in any American prison. Over the last several decades, thanks in part to the programs included in the DD Act, we have learned how to help families to bring up their children with developmental disabilities in their family homes; we have learned how to teach children with developmental disabilities; we have learned how to make room for these citizens to live and work in the heart of our communities; and we have learned how to ensure safe living environments and dependable care for those  individuals with developmental disabilities who remain in residential facilities. 
   The bill introduced today will ensure that these activities will continue. This bill will update and increase the accountability and flexibility of these programs under the law. These programs include the university affiliated programs which educate students in developmental disabilities related fields and which conduct research and training on how to meet the needs of the disabled. The law also authorizes funding for State Developmental Disabilities Councils which advise governors and State agencies on how to use available and potential resources to meet the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. To help protect the rights of the developmentally disabled, the law provides grants for Protection and Advocacy Systems to provide information and referral services and to investigate reported incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with developmental disabilities. 
   I am pleased that Senator JEFFORDS has agreed to include a provision in this bill which I drafted to address the training of direct service personnel for individuals with developmental disabilities. The training of direct service personnel is a national challenge in both magnitude and complexity. The size of this workforce is over 400,000 persons with an estimated annual turnover rate of 50 percent. In addition, nearly half of these workers are part time, working nontraditional hours. To address this dilemma, I have drafted a provision to develop a training program to create, evaluate, and disseminate a multimedia curriculum for staff development of individuals who are direct support workers or who seek to become direct support workers. This program will help develop a training regime that will be both cost and time effective for providers of services for the developmentally disabled. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1999, which will improve and strengthen an important law which provides support for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families and which will assist individuals with developmental disabilities to live independently and work in the community, out of institutions, with as little bureaucracy and government intrusion as possible.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is interesting. I believe much of the discussion centers on the fact of this being a particular procedure; that is, as I have said on the floor of the Senate, this particular procedure, as described, is a subset of many other types of procedures of abortion. 
   As I talk to physicians and surgeons, which I do on a regular basis--because, as I said, I am not an obstetrician, I am a surgeon who is trained in looking at surgical techniques--this is a specific technique which is a subset of a much larger armamentarium. This is where much of the confusion is. It is confusing to many physicians. Physicians today have this great fear that by prohibiting a single procedure, in some way that is going to be expanded to eliminate the much larger armamentarium of tools used. 
   That is what we have to be very careful of. We are talking about a very specific procedure that has been described. We do not need to go through the details now. There are other procedures that are in a broader arena called D&E and all these more medical terms it is not worth getting into. 
   But it is important for people to understand this is a very specific type of procedure that is different, that is on the fringe; that does not mean the other procedures can't and in certain cases shouldn't be used.

   Mr. FRIST. No, there is not, or to my mind, there is not. You can find certain examples, because we are talking about life, and other places that the Senate has intervened. 
   The real concern among physicians, which I think is very accurate, is you are taking a specific procedure and taking it off 
   the table. And the question is, Why? 
   The other big concern is, is this a slippery slope? Does this mean the Congress is going to come in and take another procedure and another procedure to accomplish a goal with some hidden agenda of eliminating all abortions for everybody under all circumstances at a certain point in life? It is not. 
   In is this unusual nature of being a specific procedure that is what is hard for the American people to understand and physicians to understand and our colleagues to understand. This basically takes a procedure, which is one of many, at any point --really 22 weeks and later--and eliminating it because of the brutality, the inhumaneness, the way it is performed, the risk, the unstudied risk of the safety of the mother, and the damage to the fetus, which during that period, I would argue, does feel pain.

   Mr. FRIST. Thank you. 
   Let me move to something that I commented on very briefly, and that is this whole concept of a slippery slope. I have talked to a number of physicians in the last several days. Their concern is exactly as I implied. We have the Congress coming in and taking a procedure--and none of the physicians I have talked to have tried to justify this procedure in any way--but the great fear is that you take this procedure, and the Congress will come back a year from now, or 2 years from now or 3 years from now, and ban other very specific procedures. 
   I struggled with this a great deal because I do not want to see the Federal Government coming in to that decision making capacity. I struggled with it night and day. I struggled with it since we last debated this on the floor. But ultimately, I come back to the fact that women are being hurt by a specific procedure; thus, we have a public responsibility, as being trustees to the American people, since there are women being hurt by a procedure, which is unnecessary today, that continues to be performed on the fringe, out of the mainstream, that we do have a public obligation to reach out and prohibit that specific procedure. 
   I described in some detail last night the out-of-mainstream whole fringe nature of this procedure. Again, I think it is very important for people to understand this is a fringe procedure. 
   Then people will come and say: If it's such a fringe procedure, why do you say we need to go so far as to have the Federal Government become involved? 
   Again, it comes back to the fact that being a fringe procedure, the safety, the efficacy of this procedure has not been discussed. 
   As a surgeon, as someone who has spent his entire adult life, or 20 years of his life, studying surgical procedures, studying the indications for operation, the techniques of operation, the potential complications of operation, the risks of operation, and the outcome of operation, none of that--none of that--has been studied by the medical profession for partial-birth abortion, which involves the rotation of the fetus in utero, pulling out most of the fetus, inserting scissors into the base of the cranium of the skull, expansion of those scissors, and evacuation of the brain. 
   It has not been studied. 
   I have also mentioned I wanted to see what our medical students are learning. Therefore, over the last several days, I reviewed 17 different textbooks. In fact, they are sitting in my office. I thought about bringing a couple and putting them on the desk. In 17 of those textbooks, not once is that procedure described. Not once are the indications for that procedure there. Not once is there any discussion of the risk of the complications or of the outcome. 
   I challenge my colleagues and others: Where else would we allow a procedure which we know has complications? They have been outlined on the floor. We know there is hemorrhage or bleeding, or perforation of the uterus by a blind manipulation. We know there is a rupture of the uterus. The list goes on in terms of the complications of the procedure. But where else in medicine today do we actually allow a procedure to be performed that we know hurts people, that is on the fringe, which has not been studied by the medical profession? There are no trials. There are no publications in peer review journals. Of the thousands and thousands of peer review articles out there, the thousands in obstetrics each year, this procedure has not been studied. We have an option. We have alternatives in each and every case. 
   It is interesting because a number of people have called around and talked to their own medical schools trying to gather more information. They will call me afterwards and say: Senator FRIST, or Dr. FRIST, I just talked to the obstetrician back home and he says that abortions are indicated at certain points, in his or her mind. Therefore, to outlaw this procedure would mean no abortions will be performed in that middle or late trimester. You could argue, depending on your moral beliefs or medical beliefs, whether or not that should be the case, but that is not what is under discussion today. 
   What is under discussion is the elimination of a specific procedure for which there are alternatives; a specific procedure I argue not only offends the basic civil sensibilities of all Americans but is inhumane to the fetus and hurts and damages and threatens the health of women. 
   I was talking to an obstetrician yesterday at one of the very esteemed medical centers. I basically asked, do you teach this procedure. I have not talked to anybody yet--I know it is not in the literature--who teaches this procedure in an established surgical residency training program. That is the  program where we train the board certified obstetricians. 
   There might be some abortionists who are not board certified, who have not gone through board programs. It is important for people to know you can perform abortions, you can actually do surgery without being board certified. You don't have to go through the certification process. Yes, there are people performing this procedure, but if you go to the established licensing, credentialling bodies, you won't find this procedure being taught. 
   Are abortions being taught? It depends on which medical school you are attending. It depends on which residency training program. One person I was talking to yesterday said: No, at our hospital, as part of our program, we don't go in and teach midtrimester abortions. We don't teach the procedures. If you voluntarily come forward, yes, we will teach abortion. But we will not teach the partial-birth abortion, which involves manipulation within the uterus, blind extraction of 90, 95 percent of the fetus, and opening the cranium with scissors bluntly and evacuation of the brain. We teach abortion voluntarily, but we do not actually teach the partial-birth abortion. 
   Therefore, when my colleagues talk to people, be very specific that this procedure, the partial-birth abortion procedure as described on the floor of the Senate, is the procedure that is under discussion. 
   To summarize, this is a fringe procedure. It is outside of the mainstream. It is not studied or taught in our medical schools. Of the 17 textbooks I reviewed last night, I did find one reference, after looking through all 17 books, to partial-birth abortion. It had nothing to do with technique. It had nothing to do with complications. It had nothing to do with outcome. The only mention was one paragraph in this particular textbook. It mentioned the veto by the President of the United States. 
   There are alternatives to this inhumane, barbaric procedure. Thus, I continue to support the Senator from Pennsylvania in prohibiting this procedure and its practice. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to continue the debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999. I rise to follow the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has taken a leadership position and a moral position. I am delighted to hear he will tonight concentrate on an issue that I think has been for far too long overlooked in this debate; that is, the effects of this procedure, which is a barbaric procedure, on women. Those women are our sisters, our mothers, our daughters. That health effect is something that gets lost too often in the debate, which is not the politics. It is not the rhetoric. It is not the emotion. It is the health of the woman involved. 
   This is the third time I have had the opportunity to come to the floor and participate in this debate on the issue of partial-birth abortion. Each time I come, as a physician, I take the time to review the recent medical literature to see what the facts are, what the clinical studies are, what is the information and the medical armamentarium, the literature that is out there. That is where the medical profession, that is where the scientists involved in medicine, that is where the surgeons publish their experience, where you talk about indications, you talk about the side effects, you talk about risk, you talk about complications. That is where you share it with your colleagues. 
   Each time before coming to the floor to debate this issue and discuss this issue, I talk to my colleagues at the various institutions where I have trained and have been, on the east coast, the west coast in training. I picked up the phone and talked to several of them today, colleagues who are obstetricians directly involved in the surgical aspects 
   of this procedure. 
   Each time this issue comes to the floor of the Senate, I step back and look at what studies, what developments there have been since we last discussed this issue. I rise tonight to talk about this procedure as a medical procedure. It has been interesting to me because over the course of today I have heard again and again that there is no obstetrician in this body of the Senate. I am not an obstetrician. I am a surgeon, which means I am trained to perform surgical procedures. 
   I am trained. I spent 20 years in both training and engaged in surgery to make surgical diagnoses, to perform  technical operations, to evaluate the risk of these operations, and to assess the outcome of these operations. No, I am not an obstetrician, and I don't pretend to be. I call obstetricians. I call people who are on the frontline. But I am a surgeon. I know something about surgical procedures. That is what I did before coming to the Senate. I am board certified in surgery. I am board certified in two different specialties. 
   When people talk about this medical procedure, I want to make it clear I am not an obstetrician. But I am board certified in general surgery. I am board certified in cardiothoracic surgery. I have spent 20 years studying and performing surgical procedures. 
   This is background. A lot of what I did is publish and research surgical procedures. But this is background. I have focused not, as I mentioned earlier, on the politics or the rhetoric, but on the medical use of this specific procedure, partial-birth abortion. As my colleagues know by now--but I want to restate it because I have gone back and reviewed the medical literature and have talked to colleagues at other institutions, and I have looked at developments since last year--I conclude partial-birth abortion is a brutal, barbaric procedure that has no place in the mainstream practice of medicine today. 
   Again, partial-birth abortion is a brutal, barbaric procedure that has absolutely no place in the mainstream practice of medicine today. Partial-birth abortion is a procedure that is rarely, if ever, needed in today's practice of medicine. Alternative methods of abortion, if abortion is necessary, are always available--even when the abortion is performed very late in pregnancy. 
   Now, we have had the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists quoted on the floor, and they will continue to be, which I think is appropriate. A number of their statements, I think, are taken out of context and put forward. Ultimately, their recommendation is, I believe, against the procedure; but for a lot of different reasons they are against passage of what is being proposed. I will come back to that. But it is interesting, when it comes back to answering the question, ``Are there always alternative procedures available,'' their answer would be yes. 
   Again, I refer to a number of documents, but this is the Journal of the American Medical Association of August 26, 1996, 
   volume 280, No. 8. In an article this quotation is made:  
   An ACOG policy statement emanating from the review declared that the select panel ``could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.''  
   There are always alternative procedures available. This is important because the procedure of partial-birth abortion, as we have described and laid out--a procedure in which the fetus is manipulated in the uterus, partially evacuated from the uterus, scissors inserted to puncture the skull or the cranium with evacuation of the contents of the cranium, the brain--that procedure has not been studied. We know there are certain risks, but the alternative procedures that are available in every case have been studied. You can go to a medical textbook and look up those alternative procedures, and you can go to the clinical literature and read the studies. It has been peer reviewed and presented at meetings. Debate has been carried out. There are comparisons between one surgeon's results and another's. You can identify the risks for the alternative procedures, but you cannot for the partial-birth abortion. 
   Now, ACOG, as has been mentioned on the floor, does take the position that the procedure ``may'' be superior to other procedures, as its basis for justifying opposition to this legislation. But with everything I have read, ACOG did not identify those specific circumstances under which partial-birth abortion would be the preferred procedure. And thus, as a scientist, where you want to look at outcomes, risks, and results in determining whether or not to use a certain procedure or recommend such a procedure, the data is clearly not there. It is not there. Thus, you have a procedure which, as I have said, is a brutal, barbaric procedure, with no data substantiating it or identifying the risks, compared to alternative procedures that have been defined, where we know what those risks are. Thus, this use of the word ``may,'' I would flip around and say ``may not.'' I would say the burden of proof is to go to the literature and present the clinical studies that show this barbaric procedure, in any case, is the best or most appropriate. The data, I can tell you, is not there. 
   So I think the next question to ask is: Are we talking about a procedure, partial-birth abortion, which this legislation would prohibit, which is a part of mainstream medicine? Is it part of the surgical armamentarium out there that is talked about in textbooks, in the literature, or in medical schools? 
   The answer is, no, it is not. It is a fringe procedure. It is out of the mainstream. This procedure is not taught. This procedure is not taught in the vast majority of medical schools in the United States of America. Yet we will hear some medical schools talk about some types of dilatation and extraction, and they will talk about it at 16 weeks, at 14 weeks, and even 18 weeks. I think we need to make very clear we are talking about a procedure that requires manipulation in the uterus, partial delivery; thus, the partial-birth aspects of this procedure, with the insertion of the scissors and the evacuation of the contents. I can tell you, that procedure is not taught in medical schools today. When an obstetrician says, ``Oh, yes, but we teach late-term abortions,'' some do, but they don't teach this procedure. 
   Surgical training. Again, I am not an obstetrician, but I did spend 7 years in surgical training learning every day. What 
   do you learn as part of that? You learn the specific indications for a particular procedure. In your surgical training, you learn the various surgical techniques that have been described on the floor. Although it is very difficult for people to talk about and listen to on the floor of the Senate, that is part of it, that is the barbarism, the brutality of the way this procedure has evolved. In your surgical training, you look at the complications, outcomes, and risks of these accepted surgical procedures. 
   The indications for a partial-birth abortion, for the surgical techniques as described, the complications, the outcomes, and the risks are not taught in medical schools today. The procedure of partial-birth abortion is not routinely part of the residency programs today. Why? Because it is dangerous, because it is a fringe procedure, because it is outside of the mainstream of generally accepted medical practice. It has not been comprehensively studied or reviewed in the peer-reviewed literature. There are no clinical studies of it in the medical literature. 
   As I said, when this debate comes to the floor and you want to make the case, you look at the medical literature, which I have done, and then you want to say: What about the textbooks? Surely, it is in the textbooks if people are out there doing this procedure on women, which I contend is harmful to women; surely, it is written in the medical obstetric textbooks. That is what you study. That is the foundation. 
   So what I have done over the last couple of days is I have gone to the medical textbooks and reviewed 17 of those textbooks. I can tell you, after reviewing those 17 textbooks, only 1 of the 17 even mentioned partial-birth abortion, and that 1 of the 17 mentioned it in one little paragraph. It mentioned the fact there have been vetoes of the partial-birth abortion legislation from last Congress and the Congress before. 
   The textbooks that I reviewed were Williams Obstetrics, which is one of the foundations of obstetrical education today by Cunningham and Williams. 
   I reviewed the manual of obstetrics by Niswander and Evans. 
   I reviewed the Essentials of Obstetrics and Gynecology by Hacker and Moore. 
   I reviewed the Practice Guidelines for Obstetrics and Gynecology by Skoggin and Morgan. 
   I reviewed the Blueprints in Obstetrics and Gynecology by Callahan and Caughey. 
   I reviewed Novak's Gynecology by Novak and others. 
   I reviewed Operative Gynecology by Te Linde, Rock, and Thompson. 
   I reviewed Mishell Comprehensive Gynecology;  
   And Textbook of Women's Health by Wallis. 
   And the list goes on. 
   Again, I think it is important because it demonstrates that this procedure is outside of the mainstream. It is a fringe procedure, and, therefore, any defense of this procedure, which we know has complications, which we know affects women in a harmful way, should be justified in some way in the medical literature, where it is not. 
   The fringe nature of this procedure is also underscored by the fact that there are no credible statistics on partial-birth abortion. 
   Throughout the course of today--and really has been put forward on both sides--people cited certain numbers of how many are performed. We went through this again in the last Congress. Some say that there are 500 of these procedures performed annually. The more realistic estimate I believe is that there is somewhere--again, it is truly so hard to estimate to even mention specific numbers--between 3,000 and 5,000 of these partial-birth abortions performed every year. 
   The numbers do not matter, I don't think, because what we are talking about is this barbaric procedure. It is harmful to women. So 1 is too many, or 5 is too many, or 10, or even 500--any is too many. 
   What data do we have that this procedure can be performed safely? Absolutely none. Part of the problem is the absence of accurate data with which to judge the safety of this procedure, and because of, in part, the incomplete data that is accumulated, and the way we accumulate data on abortions. Although the CDC collects abortion statistics every year, not all States provide that information to the CDC, and the ones that do lack information on as many as 40 to 50 percent of the abortions performed in that particular State. 
   But I think most importantly the categories that the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, uses to report the method of abortion does not split out partial-birth abortions from the other procedures. So it gets mixed in with all of the other procedures. 
   It is this lack of data on this procedure that I think is especially troubling because of the grave risk, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out earlier, of complications the grave risk that this procedure poses to women. 
   In the debate, we have opponents of abortion on the one hand, proponents of a right to choose on the other, and we have the debates that come forth with the tint of emotion and rhetoric. But the thing that gets lost is what the Senator from 
   Pennsylvania mentioned, and that is that this procedure is terrible for women. He outlined some of the ways in terms of the physical and mental health. 
   But I would like to drop back and look at this safety issue because in all of the arguments for rights, we need to have this procedure out there. 
   It is critically important, I believe--I say this as a physician--that we recognize that this procedure is dangerous and hurts women. 
   There are ``no credible studies'' on partial-birth abortions ``that evaluate or attest to its safety'' for the mother. 
   I take that from the Journal of American Medical Association, August 26, 1998. 
   There are ``no credible studies'' on partial-birth abortions ``that evaluate or attest to the safety'' for the mother. 
   The risk: I can tell you as a surgeon--again, I drop back to the fact that I am a surgeon and I spent 20 years of my adult life in surgery--that patients who undergo partial-birth abortion are at risk for hemorrhage, infection, and uterine perforation. 
   I can say that. And I can say it and be absolutely positive about it because these are the risks that exist with any surgical midtrimester termination of pregnancy. 
   The partial-birth abortion procedure itself involves manipulation of the fetus inside of the uterus, turning the fetus around, extracting the fetus from the uterus, and then punching scissors into the cranium or the base of the skull; requires spreading of those scissors to make the opening large enough to evacuate the brain. 
   That procedure has two additional complications than what would be with a trimester abortion, and that is uterine rupture, No. 1; and, No. 2, latrogenic laceration. That means the cutting of the uterus with secondary hemorrhage or secondary bleeding. 
   Uterione rupture: What does it mean? It means exactly as it sounds--that the uterus ruptures. And that can be catastrophic to the woman. 
   It may be increased during a partial-birth abortion because the physician in this procedure must perform a great deal of it blindly while reaching into the uterus with a blunt instrument and pulling the feet of the fetus down into the canal. Thus, you have uterine rupture. 
   I should also add that this type of manipulation is also associated--we know this from the medical literature because there are very few cases where you have to manipulate the fetus. That manipulation is also associated with other complications of abruption, amniotic fluid embolus, where the fluid goes to other parts of the body and other trauma to the uterus. 
   All of these are serious, potentially life-threatening complications from this fringe procedure that has not been studied, is outside the main stream medicine, not in the medical textbooks, not in the peer-review literature for which we have alternative procedures available. 
   The second complication is latrogenic laceration, an accidental cutting of the uterus, occurs because, again, much of this procedure is done blindly. The surgeon has scissors that are inserted into the base of the fetal skull. It is not just the insertion of the scissors, but it takes a spreading of the scissors to establish a real puncture large enough to evacuate the brain. 
   An another example, an article dated August 26, 1998, another quotation. Let me open with the quotation marks. 
   ``This blind procedure risks maternal injury from laceration of the uterus or cervix by the scissors and could result in severe bleeding and the threat of shock or even maternal death.'' 
   ``Could result in severe bleeding and the threat of shock or even maternal death.'' 
   These risks, which I just outlined, have not been quantified for partial-birth abortions. 
   Would you want this untested procedure performed on anyone that you know? The answer, I believe, is absolutely not because there is always an alternative procedure available. 
   Mr. President, we are discussing a fringe procedure with very real risks to a woman's health. The lack of data on this procedure underscores my opposition to it. Just as we cannot ignore the risk to the mother, let's also look at the risk a little bit further down the line. 
   It leads me to a conclusion that partial-birth abortion is inhumane, and offends the very basic civil sensibilities of the American people. The procedure itself, yes. But what about the treatment of the periviable fetus? I say that because at what point in the gestation period viability actually is realized is subject to debate. It shifts with technology and with our ability to intervene over time. 
   Most of these procedures are performed today in what is called the periviable period--somewhere between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation, and beyond. 
   The centers for pain perception in a fetus develop very early in that second trimester period. We cannot measure fetal pain directly, but we do know that infants of similar gestational age after delivery--28 weeks, 30 weeks, or 24 weeks--those babies, those fetuses that are delivered, do respond to pain. Again, we are talking about a procedure performed on an infant, a fetus, at 24, 26 weeks. 
   With partial-birth abortions, pain management is not provided for the fetus at that gestational age. That fetus, remember, is literally within inches of actually being delivered. Pain management is given for procedures if those 2 or 3 inches are realized and the baby is outside of the womb, at the same gestational age; if the fetus is in the womb, pain management is not given. 
   I say that again because we have to at least think of the fetus and think of the procedure, taking scissors and inserting them into the cranium, into the skull, and the spreading of those scissors. What is that doing? Is that humane? 
   Therefore, to my statement that this is a barbaric procedure, I say it is an inhumane, barbaric procedure regarding the woman--and I just went  through those complications--and regarding the fetus. 
   Because of the ``fringe'' nature of this practice, because of the lack of peer review and study of this procedure, I have strong feelings about this issue. I have taken too much time walking through the medical aspects, but I think it is important to free up a lot of the intensity of the debate earlier in the day. I think it is important to have a discussion so the American people and my colleagues know at least one surgeon's view of this surgical procedure. 
   I close by saying that because of this lack of peer review study of this procedure, because of the fringe nature of this procedure, because of the grave risk it poses to the woman, because I believe it is inhumane treatment of that infant, that fetus, and because even as ACOG, the gynecologic society, concedes partial-birth abortion is never the only procedure that has to be used, I strongly support this legislation by the Senator from Pennsylvania to outlaw this barbaric and this inhumane practice. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am delighted with the debate thus far because it really does come down to some pretty important concepts as to how we best approach a problem that I believe is the most threatening we have today, as we look into the decade, the next century; that is, the education of our children. 
   As has been said again and again, we are failing. We are absolutely failing today. If we look at our education for kindergarten through the twelfth grade, statistics have been given. Let me review those. This is the fourth grade. This is the eighth grade. This is the twelfth. This looks at just mathematics. We could put science, math, reading, English, any number of things in these columns. 
   Each of these green bars--it is hard to read--is a country. The red bar is the United States of America. That is our performance in the fourth grade in mathematics compared to Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Austria, Slovenia, Ireland, Australia. You can see in the fourth grade, we are at about that level, about seventh or eighth. 
   In the eighth grade--the longer you stay in school--in mathematics, we drop further. And by the time you get to the twelfth grade--the black line is the average--you can see we fall below the average in the eighth grade. In the twelfth grade, we are down further. 
   People agree with the data. That is the good thing about this debate. On both sides of the aisle we have come forward and said we have to act. Indeed, there are things we do have a Federal responsibility to do in education; that is, to reverse these trends in this global marketplace. These are our children; these are our investment in the future. 
   The difference is in approach. It is very important the American people understand the difference in approach. It boils down to these two amendments. On the one hand, we have an amendment which says we have a new program, a new answer, a program we need to grow that will make a big difference with the resources we provide. 
   On our side of the aisle, Senator GORTON has basically said, that is one approach, but why not take essentially the same resources and recognize that every school is going to have a different problem, maybe even every classroom a different problem. It is absurd for us to think that in Washington, DC, we can dictate what is needed in a rural school in Alamo, TN, or an urban school in Memphis or in Nashville. 
   Let's take the same resources and instead of telling them they need more teachers, say take those same resources; maybe you need better trained teachers or maybe you need to hook a computer up to the T-1 line outside or maybe you need to buy computers or more textbooks. You decide. Maybe you need more teachers. Use the money for that. Two different approaches. 
   This is what we have today, and it is failing. We all recognize it is failing. These are the Government programs, the Federal Government programs on the outside. The Department of Health and Human Services has education programs aimed at the beneficiaries of our school system today--at-risk and delinquent youth is one group; young children is another group; teachers. You could put any number of groups. The school is down here. Any number. 
   The point is, we have heard the figure 480. It might be 250; it might be 300. The point is, we have hundreds of these 
   Federal programs all aimed at different populations, and it is not working. It is failing. 
   What our side of the aisle says is that we can identify the problems, but with 87,000 different schools out there, let's let that school, that schoolteacher, that superintendent, that principal, those parents come to the table and say this is what we need and, with the resources we make available through the Gorton amendment, use those resources. It might be more teachers. It might be better prepared teachers. It might be an afterschool program. It might be hooking up a computer or it might be better textbooks. They decide at the local level. That is the difference between our side of the aisle and the other side. The Republican, the Gorton approach is basically saying, identify the needs locally and come together and decide. 
   The Murray amendment says more teachers. Indeed, we have made progress. In 1970, we had 22 pupils per teacher. In 1997, it is 17 pupils per teacher nationwide. That is some progress. Again, I am not going to diminish the importance of that. What I do want to say is that local identification of needs, that local flexibility is more likely to give you the answer to better education than us telling a community whether or not they may need a teacher.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Alabama for his outstanding leadership in the field of education, preparing our children for tomorrow, for that next millennium. He has done outstanding work. We work almost on a daily basis on this very issue. 
   I also commend the Presiding Officer for his leadership on this issue which, again, means so much to the future of our country. 
   Earlier this morning I was talking to a group of people who came up to visit from Texas. They said: Senator FRIST, what in your mind is the most important thing that society must do to prepare our country for this new millennium that is upon us? 
   I very quickly turned it back to the audience and said: What do you think? 
   When we came to education, every hand went up in the air. Indeed, according to every public opinion survey, education is the No. 1 issue when people ask what the responsibility of the public--not necessarily just the Federal Government but of the public--is in terms of promoting more fulfilling lives in the future. If we look a little bit further at those town meetings, we say: What really can be done? People very quickly come back to our education system, to our public school system. About two out of three Americans are very supportive of public schools but do believe that our public schools will require some major change, some major innovation, some creativity. Just more of the same is simply not going to work. 
   We only have to look at how we compare to our international counterparts. When we look at reading, math, or science at the fourth grade, the eighth grade, and at the twelfth grade, we are failing compared to other countries all around the world. What is even sadder,  if we look at subjects such as reading or math, we fail in the fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades. If we do OK in the fourth grade, we do worse in the eighth grade, and we do miserably in the twelfth grade. The longer someone is in school, when we compare ourselves internationally--we all know our world is becoming smaller, and our borders are beginning to fall in this global economy--when we compare ourselves internationally, we are failing and failing miserably. 
   Republicans have set forth very solid proposals based on three pretty simple, straightforward priorities. Mention has already been made about the Ed-Flex bill, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which was signed by the President, debated on this floor, and involves these same principles. 
   Those three principles are, No. 1, take education out of the hands of the Federal bureaucrats and return it to the local level, to parents, to teachers, to school superintendents, to local officials, where it belongs. 
   No. 2, since what we are doing is not working, based on the statistics I just related, let's unleash the spirit of change, of innovation, of doing something a little bit different. We can begin by untying those Federal strings, those Federal regulations which are restricting that change, which are holding back innovation. 
   No. 3, raise the standard of education excellence so every child gets the education he or she needs and deserves. 
   For over three decades, we have seen this progression of Federal involvement in our educational system today. As the Senator from Alabama just pointed out, there are over 780 separate Federal education programs. 
   It really comes from a lot of people in this body and other bodies who came up with good ideas to cure particular problems. The result is that you get a layering of these Federal programs, one on top of each other, until you get this whole spider web of good intentions. But these good intentions have increased Federal bureaucracies, each with its own set of regulations, hierarchy, own buildings, own section, each trying to educate people in a better way. These over 780 different Federal education programs are spread across over 40 entirely separate bureaucracies. So it is time to step back, streamline, and better coordinate the resources that we are directing toward education. 
   Now, it is interesting that, in the Ed-Flex debate, a lot of things were talked about on the floor of the Senate, and one was apparent to me. The statistic was that educators spend over 48 million hours churning out paperwork and red tape because of these Washington-based regulations. 
   Now, 48 million hours sounds like a lot. How much is it? It is the equivalent of 25,000 teachers working 40 hours a week for 1 year--not in teaching that student but in filling out paperwork and regulations. It is this excessive regulatory burden that we in Washington, DC, impose on them. It is what the Federal Government pushes down on that teacher in that school in Alamo, TN. 
   How does it translate into taxpayer dollars? That $1 that is sent, on April 15, to Washington, DC, filters down through the bureaucracy and is only worth 65 cents by the time it gets down to the classroom; that is, 35 cents of every taxpayer dollar that comes up to the Federal Government is lost in these 780 programs through 40 different bureaucracies. 
   The real question is, Can this be modernized? Is there something we can do? The answer is absolutely. Ed-Flex is that first step. It shows that we can make progress by doing what? Education flexibility--giving more flexibility, providing for more accountability; those are two fundamental principles. 
   As Ronald Reagan said, ``There is nothing closer to eternal life than a Government bureaucracy.'' So, yes, No. 1, we have to address the issues of the bureaucracy. How can we streamline and better coordinate to get more value out of the resources that we put into education? Ed-Flex attacked the issue of improved accountability and improved achievement by looking at those three Republican principles. Individual classrooms have individual needs. Classrooms in Alamo, TN, are different from those in Memphis, and different from Bristol, TN, and different from those in New York City, or San Francisco. Some schools stress technology; some have computers; some are in a rural area and don't have the technology. 
   The whole point is each school is different, and we in Washington, DC, must recognize the solutions to an individual school's challenges to educate a student have to be based on local concerns, local input, on what those teachers need, on what advise and counsel parents offer to that particular school. 
   What did Ed-Flex do? As I said, it is the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. No. 1 is flexibility. It gets rid of a lot of the Washington red tape. It comes down from the 780 different programs. You have absolutely the same goals, but how you reach those goals is determined at the local level. Ed-Flex has strong flexibility but also strong accountability. Strong accountability, in that if you have an Ed-Flex program in your State, you must say specifically how that plan will be administered, how achievement will be measured, and you will be held accountable for accomplishing that achievement. 
   In return, you are given flexibility. Ed-Flex started as a demonstration project in six States, and it was expanded to 12 States. Now, through a bipartisan effort, we are able to expand that to every State in the Union. 
   Another way to achieve the three principles we are working on is the authorization process--a process that is looking at the 
   reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This is the big bill that authorizes how we spend all kindergarten-through-12 funding. The purpose of going back and looking at that authorization is to modernize this system, to allow some innovation and creativity, to take it back to local control, instead of Washington, DC, control. 
   Republicans have designated this legislation as the vehicle to address two principles: No. 1, to retain the same basic elements of education funding through ESEA, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but eliminate the red tape that tells localities specifically how to spend it. The bill, as we go forward, needs to stress local control. I believe, and most Republicans believe, that we need to free States and free localities from red tape, from that lack of innovation, from that rigidity, in return for improvements in achievement. We must make sure our students are really learning and progressing over time. In addition, we have to reduce that paperwork by focusing on not just the process but the actual performance of those students who will leave that school and go on to higher education and to competition in our national marketplace and in a global marketplace. 
   We need to allow States, I believe, to consolidate some of these 780 programs at the State and local level if they believe they can have greater achievement, and if they have a specific plan to do so, and are held accountable for that. We need to empower parents, we need to empower local educators, and then we need to hold them accountable for their results. 
   Another issue that we absolutely must focus on, and we are focusing on, is the quality of our teachers. There are some people who say the answer to all this is 100,000 more teachers. That makes a good sound bite because more of anything sounds good to people. But I believe we need to go back to that Republican fundamental belief that more can be helpful, but what is more important is the quality of that teacher in that classroom talking to those 10 students or 20 students or 30 students. Just having more of something there isn't necessarily the answer. The answer is in teacher quality. 
   A researcher from the University of Tennessee put it quite well when he said to me that teacher quality has a greater effect on performance than any other factor, including student demographics or class size. If you have to pick one, it is the quality of that teacher in the classroom. He said--and these are exact words--``When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.'' 
   Think about that. Other than parents, no other intervention equals the effect on a child's capacity to learn, to assimilate than that of his teacher. Every classroom should have a qualified teacher, proficient in the subjects they teach. Now, one might say, well, no, that is not it; we need more warm  bodies in the classroom and that is the answer. 
   Listen to these statistics. Today, over 25 percent of all teachers are poorly trained to teach; 12 percent have no prior classroom experience before beginning to teach; 14 percent have not fully met State standards. In Massachusetts alone, 59 percent failed the basic licensing exam; 54 percent failed a 10th grade level competency test. If we look all across America, 18 percent of all social studies teachers have neither majored nor minored in the subject they teach; 20 percent of all science teachers have neither majored nor minored in science; 40 percent of all math teachers have neither majored nor minored in mathematics. 
   Is it surprising, then, when you compare the performance of 12th graders in this country in math and science to other countries around the world that we are not 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th in math and science, but we are 21st? We are 21st among our competitor nations around the world. Is it surprising when 40 percent of all math teachers--the person actually teaching in that room with the 12th graders--did not major or minor in the field of mathematics? We hear about ``100,000 new teachers.'' That is a short sound bite, but I think the focus you will see from our side of the aisle is on the quality of teachers and not on numbers alone. 
   The Teacher Quality Act works aggressively on directing Federal resources to help attract the very best, to help train and retrain those very best teachers. Funds will be available in several areas, including establishing incentives to teachers with advanced degrees in core subjects, or implementing teacher testing with bonuses for those who score well, or expanding the pool of teachers by certifying qualified retired military personnel. 
   Another issue in our schools today, an issue we hear about all too often, is school violence. Again, the reasons are as many and numerous as the incidents themselves. Common sense says fix the obvious problem. One obvious problem is drugs. A long-term study showed most drug use starts at age 12 or 13. When the White House took a high-profile line on this, illicit drug use declined consistently from 1979 to 1992 and, over that period of about 13 years, fell from 16 percent to 5 percent. However, in the first 5 years of the current administration, over half of that progress has been lost. The latest National Center for Alcohol and Substance Abuse poll shows 35 percent of teens believe drugs are the most important problem they face. 
   We are responding again under an initiative being put forward through the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act. That act will add financial assistance for community programs for violent youth and will add technical assistance to create community partnerships to look at youth drug issues and youth mental health. 
   An area of discipline we will have to come back to is loopholes in the current law, including the act mentioned this morning, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a bill in which I believe very strongly and which was strongly supported in the efforts of the past Congress. There is a problem in that particular bill regarding violence--violence and discipline in our schools. The fact is, one group of students is disciplined in a different manner from other students. That is unfair and has to be changed. It has not yet been changed. 
   In my own county, Davidson County in Middle Tennessee, there were eight firearms infractions, meaning there were eight children who brought either guns or bombs to school; six of those were special ed students. Three of those special ed students were expelled, but three were not expelled and came back to the classroom. In Tennessee, the general law is, if a student brings a gun or a bomb into the classroom, they are expelled for that year. Because of the Federal law, we say all students are not treated equally. There is a special class of students who, even if they brought a gun or a bomb to the classroom, may return in 45 days. I see no reason why all children should not be subject to the very same disciplinary action. 
   Education is the most important gift we can give our children. The time to act is now. We are doing that with Ed-Flex as the first step, with reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and with the Teacher Quality Act. 
   I have an 11-year-old, 12-year-old, and a 14-year-old. I don't want to be too pessimistic. When we look at this generation that is coming through, the overwhelming majority of America's children are good, with good intentions, and are working hard. In fact, when comparing the so-called millennial generation with the preceding generation, statistics are improving: 
   Teen sexual activity is down; teen pregnancies are down, especially in the inner cities; teen drinking is down; teen drunk driving is down; TV time is down; high school dropout rates are down. More time is being spent on homework today. Academic standards are slowly rising; time spent on chores is up; church-going is up. High-tech skills are rising sharply. Most teens today trust institutions; they agree with their parents on core values. 
   As for violence, the high school murder rate has indeed fallen 50 percent since 1993, the steepest decline in any age bracket. School-related violent deaths are declining. There has been an overall improvement in teen crime. I say that because we have this interesting juxtaposition of great opportunity in our system, but when we compare ourselves internationally, we are failing if performance is the measure. 
   Again, looking back to the fourth, eighth, and twelfth grade, we are failing our children today, but we are doing it in an overall framework which says that it is possible to succeed. We need to be committed. We need to do it in the right way, using the three Republican principles I put forward. Our children are America's future, they are America's pride, and Republicans intend to do everything we possible can to help them stay that way. 
   I ask unanimous consent, following the remarks of Senator DORGAN today, at approximately 2:20 p.m., Senator HATCH be recognized for up to 25 minutes in morning business.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Earth, Wind, and Fire Authorization Act of 1999. This legislation would authorize three public safety entities: the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP), the National Weather Service and related agencies of the national Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Fire Administration for fiscal years (FY) 2000, 2001, and 2002. Each of these entities have important science and technology safety programs which serve as a powerful example of the types of research that Federal Government should be investing its scarce resources in--the safety and protection of the American public. 
   Weather forecasts are an indispensable element of our everyday lives. As Hurricane Floyd ravaged the eastern coast of the United States last week, millions of Americans from the southern tip of Florida to the ports of Boston tuned into their local weather channels to obtain the latest information from the National Weather Service (NWS). They evaluated the very safety of their homes, possessions, and loved ones based upon televised data. Numerous organizations including schools, public transportation, and local businesses were also captivated by NWS forecasts to determine the potential of Hurricane Floyed to threaten the safety of its citizens. 
   The Earth, Wind, and Fire Authorization Act of 1999 authorizes the NWS at $617.9 million in FY 2000, $651.9 million for FY 2001, and $687.7 million for FY 2002. Atmospheric Research is authorized at $173.3 million in FY 2000, $182.8 million in FY 2001, and $192.8 million in FY 2002. And the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is authorized at $103 million for FY 2000, $108.8 million for FY 2001, and $114.7 million for FY 2002. NESDIS provides for the procurement, launch, and operation of the polar orbiting and geostationary environmental satellites, as well as the management of NOAA's environmental data collections. 
   Also in the news today is the recent earthquake in Taiwan. The tremendous loss of lives and property has been beyond our comprehension. I am pleased to authorize a federal research program that targets these natural disasters. NEHRP combines research, planning, and response activities conducted within each of the four specified agencies; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The ultimate goal of this multi-agency program is to protect lives and property. 
   The NEHRP is authorized at the following levels ($ millions): 
     FY2000  FY2001  FY2002   FEMA   19.8   20.9   22.0     USGS   46.1   48.6   51.3     NSF   29.9   31.5   33.3     NIST   2.2   2.2   2.4  
   The mission of the U.S. Fire Administration is to enhance the nation's fire prevention and control activities, and thereby significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. 
   The bill, which authorizes the Fire Administration for $46.1 million in fiscal year 2000, $47.6 million for fiscal year 2001, and $49 million for fiscal year 2002, provides for collection, analysis, and dissemination of fire incidence and loss data; development and dissemination of public fire education materials; development and dissemination of better hazardous materials response information for first respondents; and support for research and development for fire safety technologies. 
   With this authorization, our local and state firefighters will continue to have assess to the training from the National Fire Academy necessary to allow them to better perform their jobs of saving lives and protecting property. 
   The authorization levels detailed above in each independent programs are based upon an overall 5.5 percent increase for research programs for FY 2001 and 2002 over the President's FY 2000 budget request to be consistent with the Federal Research Investment Act. 
   Mr. President, there are some additional concerns that the committee will continue to address as we proceed to move this legislation. They include the proper role of the NWS and the commercial weather service industry, and several employee-related concerns.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about an important, yet often ignored aspect of the federal budget--our investment in research and development (R&D). While I strongly believe that Congress must strive to stay within the budget caps, I also firmly believe that funding for R&D should be allowed to grow in fiscal year 2000 and beyond. Many economists argue that such an investment, through its impact on economic growth, will not drain our resources, but will actually improve our country's fiscal standing. 
   The Federal Research Investment Act, which I authored with Senators ROCKEFELLER, DOMENICI, and LIEBERMAN, passed the Senate last Monday for the second year in a row. the bill would double the amount of federally-funded civilian research and development (R&D) over eleven year period. This critical federal investment, performed throughout our national laboratories, universities, and private industry, is currently fueling 50% of our national economy through improvements in capital and labor productivity. 
   Throughout my career in the Senate, I have spent a considerable amount of time advocating for greater funding levels for civilian R&D. Together with many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I have been trying to educate others on the value of the federal government's role in funding merit-based and peer-reviewed programs. One only has to look at the Internet, the foundation of the new digital economy, to find an example of prudent federal investment in R&D.  
   Current economic expansion and growth, however, cannot be maintained if we do not provide the necessary funds and incentives to perform critical R&D throughout the scientific disciplines. Federal expenditures of both civilian and defense R&D as a percentage of GDP have dropped from 2.2 percent in 1965 to only 0.8 percent in 1999--nearly one third of its value. 
   We have both a long-term problem: addressing the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending; and a near-term challenge: apportioning the ever-dwindling amount of discretionary funding. The confluence of increased dependency on technology and decreased fiscal flexibility has created a problem too obvious to ignore: not all deserving programs can be funded; not all authorized programs can be fully implemented. We must set priorities. 
   The Federal Research Investment Act applies a set of guiding principles, established by the Senate Science and Technology Caucus, to consistently ask the appropriate questions about each competing technology program; to focus on that programs' effectiveness and appropriateness for federal funding; and to help us make the hard choices about which programs deserve to be funded and which do not. 
   The Government plays a critical role in driving the innovation process in the United States. The majority of the federal government's basic R&D is directed toward critical missions to serve the public interest in areas including health, environmental pollution control, space exploration, and national defense. Federal funds support nearly 60 percent of the Nation's basic research, with a similar share performed in colleges and universities. 
   The Senate passage of the Federal Research Investment Act reflects a consensus that although basic research is the foundation for many innovations, the rate of return to society generated by investments in R&D is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the performing institution. 
   This legislation sends a strong message to the academic and scientific community--Congress understands the value of pre-competitive, basis research and its impact on the national economy and the standard of living. 
   I hope that the House will be as courageous as the Senate and embrace this long-term funding strategy.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that goes right at the heart of what we should be doing about Medicare. It says Congress should be acting to modernize Medicare, to ensure its solvency, and to include prescription drugs. 
   The congressional budget plan has $505 billion over the next 10 years in unallocated budget surpluses that could be used for long-term Medicare reform. In addition, the congressional budget resolution for the year 2000 has specifically set aside $90 billion for this purpose. 
   Thus, my sense-of-the-Senate amendment says that the unallocated on-budget surpluses provide adequate resources and that: No. 1, the congressional budget resolution provides a sound framework for the modernization of Medicare; No. 2, improving the solvency of Medicare; and No. 3, improving coverage of prescription drugs. 
   Congress should act to accomplish these goals for the Medicare program.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment offered by my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts. The Senator from Massachusetts has introduced an amendment which suggests we set aside this bill, recommitting it to the committee of jurisdiction, so they will incorporate funding for a new prescription drug benefit in the existing Medicare program. 
   I have several points to make. First of all, I think most important is that the Senate, this very body, has already set aside funds for Medicare modernization. This has now become a familiar chart on the floor of the Senate, but I think it is very important. It goes right to the heart of why this amendment should and hopefully will be defeated today. This is the plan. The U.S. Congress' use of the surplus, the almost $3.3 trillion surplus: Debt reduction, $1.9 trillion; tax cuts, $792 billion. We talked about that. But what is most important for this particular amendment is the $505 billion that is set aside over the next 10 years to specifically address issues such as Medicare modernization, including things such as the prescription drugs, which I, as a physician, believe is very important that we address as we modernize, strengthen, and bring Medicare up to date. 
   Let me repeat: The Senate, this very body, has already set aside funds for Medicare modernization, including prescription drug coverage. 
   First, what have we done? How can I say that with such determination? The congressional budget plan has $505 billion over 10 years. Very specifically, we say it again and again and again; it is for domestic priorities. That money is set aside, aside from the tax cuts, the tax relief, and the debt reduction. 
   No. 2, the Senate has already specifically, in a reserve fund, set aside $90 billion, in a reserve fund, for long-term Medicare reform. Again, I refer people to April 15, the day we passed in this very body the concurrent resolution for the year 2000, in section 203, reserve fund for Medicare. We lay it out. The charts are in the back, in terms of coming up with the $92.4 billion over 10 years. 
   No. 1, $505 billion is set aside for such things as Medicare modernization; No. 2, we specifically set aside $90 billion for Medicare modernization in a reserve fund, which I quoted from. 
   No. 3, in the President's very plan, which he introduced a couple of weeks ago, the net cost of the coverage, he said, for prescription drug coverage, was $46 billion for 10 years. That $46 billion is much less than the $90 billion we have already put in our reserve fund and is only a tenth of the $505 billion we set aside, but we do it right. We have a real plan. We do not do it piecemeal. We modernize, update, bring to life a system that was very good for 1965, 1970, 1980, 1990, but it is not good for the year 2000, 20005, 2010, specifically when the demographic shift hits, when we have a doubling of the number of seniors when we go forward. That is the framework we set forward, and it is what we need to address. 
   Our job, our challenge now that we have the money set aside --we do not need to recommit it, send it back for more dollars and cents--is to fix the system inside this framework, and we do it in three ways. We need to modernize Medicare benefits, bring it up to date. The 1965 car is not up to today's standards and we can modernize it. We demonstrated, through a bipartisan plan, the Medicare Commission--I will 
   come back to what we actually said. We need to modernize. No. 2, we need to strengthen our Medicare commitment, our commitment to the seniors, the generation of today, the future generation--we need to make sure we can fulfill that commitment. And No. 3, the issue of prescription drugs. 
   Shortly after I came to the Senate, about 5 years ago, I had a patient who was a transplant patient, somebody whom I transplanted. When I was running for reelection, he was 64 years of age. When I transplanted him, he was about 62. When I was elected in 1965, he had Medicare. He had to give up his private plan. His private plan did cover prescription drugs. When he got to be 65, because we do not have a modern Medicare program there today, he had to give that up. 
   What we need is a system that doesn't only focus on prescription drugs but modernizes the overall program to match individual patients in a system which values choice, values freedom with those specific needs. That is what we set out to do in the Bipartisan Commission. 
   We need to strengthen our Medicare program so it will be there. We all know most young people today do not believe Medicare will be there for them. We need to make sure that it is. 
   Prescription drugs for our seniors and individuals with disabilities--again, somebody with diabetes is going to be on prescription drugs later. Someone with chronic heart disease or debilitating arthritis needs prescription drugs. It shows the inadequacy of our Medicare system today in the fact we do reimburse for hospital beds, we reimburse a little bit for preventive care, but not enough, and not anything at all for those people who need prescription drugs. 
   I say this because I am the strongest advocate, or as strong as others, that we must make prescription drugs a part of our proposal. The Bipartisan Medicare Commission--bipartisan, Democrat, Republican, 17 members--got together and came up with something that has comprehensive Medicare modernization and reform, of which prescription drugs is an integral part, to upgrade that machine which is going to be serving all of us someday. 
   How did we do it? 
   No. 1, we provide full Federal funding for immediate prescription drug coverage for low-income seniors; that is, up to 135 percent of poverty. 
   No. 2, we require in the National Bipartisan Commission--I should say, our recommendation was approved by a majority of the members, not a supermajority, but a majority of members did 
   vote for that--it required all plans participating with the Medicare program to make an enhanced benefit package available which includes prescription drug coverage and protects seniors against unlimited out-of-pocket spending. 
   No. 3, in that National Bipartisan Commission, we require the medigap programs--all plans--to include prescription drugs, to make those drugs available in a policy. There are other prescription drug proposals out there that need to be discussed and should be discussed. 
   President Clinton put a proposal on the table. That program, I believe, is inadequate for a whole host of reasons which I hope we have the opportunity to discuss as we go forward. 
   It is a little disingenuous to say--and I think in some ways this amendment at least implies that--that hard-working families do not deserve tax relief today, which we have shown we can give with the priorities that have been laid out, until we set aside funds for Medicare modernization by just adding prescription drug benefits, because we have set that money aside; this body has done that. 
   The challenge before us, and the work before us, is to modernize Medicare, to strengthen Medicare so that it will be there for the next generation, with a focus on the patient, to make it less rigid, more comprehensive, have more preventive care, have it be less costly to the seniors. We should be able to do that. There are solid proposals before us to do that. 
   Let me briefly talk about what this Medicare Commission came up with. Again, remember that the majority of members supported this proposal. We did not have a supermajority. 
   The four appointees by the President of the United States voted against this proposal, but a majority of members, 10 of the 17, did vote in favor of it. What it basically does is set up a Medicare board to oversee a group of plans which could be, in many ways, individually tailored to the needs of a heart transplant patient or chronic care patient, but all having the same core benefits that we have today.

   Mr. FRIST. Thus, our proposal, which we have discussed, to fix the system will supplement by offering people up to 135 
   percent complete and full coverage, a high option plan for anybody who actually comes to the table. 
   I present all this today to make the point that, No. 1, the money, the budgetary framework, has been set, has been passed by the Senate. We set aside the $505 billion specifically in the resolution; the $90 billion--the President's own plan costs only $46 billion, and we have already addressed the problem of the money. The job of the Senate and the Congress is to fix the system for the American people. A bipartisan proposal that is on the table is the premium support plan. 
   Let's look at other plans. Let's not drop that issue. That is unnecessary. Supporting the Kennedy amendment does not do that today. We need to support freedom for seniors, give that freedom of choice, that freedom to match specific needs with a plan. We need to address Medicare. We have a plan to do that. We have already set aside the resources to do that. 
   The political tactics we are witnessing do nothing to modernize Medicare, do nothing to focus on that individual patient and the quality of care they receive. 
   I close by saying that before 2 o'clock or in the next 2 to 3 minutes, I will be submitting an amendment which addresses the Medicare issue.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion of the Senator from Massachusetts for several reasons. First and foremost, this very body has already set aside funds specifically for Medicare modernization and specifically for inclusion of prescription drug coverage. The congressional budget plan has given us the figure of $505 billion. In our resolution passed just 2 months ago, we have $90 billion set aside specifically. The President's own proposal, his own proposal for Medicare prescription drug coverage, is $46 billion, much less than the $90 billion we have already directed to this cause. 
   We need to focus on fundamental modernization, repair of the Medicare system to include prescription drug coverage. That is something that is before us, not this issue of money just for prescription drug coverage. I urge its defeat.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have not discussed an amendment which we will be voting on tomorrow. It has not been discussed yet at all. It has to do with the very important issue that we voted on today, in terms of another amendment. That is what we are going to do in this body to address a fundamental problem. It has to do with Medicare, the fact that we have a Medicare system which is not going to be solvent long-term. It is a very costly system where, if you are a senior, and you have health care expenses, only about 48 percent of those are paid by the Medicare Program. It is a very costly system for seniors and individuals with disabilities. It is a very rigid system. It is a system that is not comprehensive. Much preventive care is not covered, prescription drugs are not covered at all--outpatient prescription drugs. It needs to be modernized. We talked a bit about that today. 
   The real question is why we cannot take a new benefit and just add it to the overall Medicare system. The gist of the amendment tomorrow is that, yes, we need prescription drug coverage, but we must incorporate that new benefit, which needs to be there, in an overall modernization plan for Medicare.  
   The question is, why? Let me focus on this one chart. On the right half of this chart, the red bar takes an average over the last 5 or 6 years, an average annual increase in all health care. The red bar is in drug expenditures. They have gone up 11 percent every year. The green bar is the annual growth in all health care expenditures in our health care system. 
   The real point of this graph is that every year overall 
   drug expenditures, in the aggregate, go up about twice as fast as other health care costs. Thus if we are going to add a new benefit onto overall health care costs, something that is growing at 5 percent, we need to be very sure we do not run into the same problem we have in certain fields such as home health care. Home health care was a benefit in Medicare that was growing 17 percent a year. It could not be tolerated in the overall Medicare system because of cost. 
   Then we, with the heavy hand of Government, came in and slashed home health care 2 years ago. In many ways that was devastating to patients, to the quality of health care, to people who were depending on venipuncture to have blood drawn on a regular basis. Therefore, I think it is very important we recognize, because drugs are a different entity, if we are going to add that benefit, we need to do it in the realm of overall reform of Medicare and modernization. 
   This shows prescription drug expenditures in the aggregate since 1965 have increased--not quite exponentially, but you can see in 1993, 1995, 1996, from about $55 billion up to about $80 billion. So before we take this entity and put it in Medicare, because Medicare is already going bankrupt, we need to look at the overall picture. It includes hospitals, includes doctors, prescription drugs, chronic care and acute care. 
   There is a proposal that has been put forth by the National Bipartisan Medicare Commission appointed by the President of the United States, appointed by our leadership in the Senate and in the House. We came up with the proposal that is essentially this: The premium support model, the Breaux-Thomas bill. This proposal did look at overall Medicare, hospitals, physician reimbursement, and prescription drugs, and came up with this model. The details of the model do not matter, but I do want to stress that 10 of the 17 Members, in a bipartisan way, did put this forward as a proposal--again, to show Medicare can be modernized. 
   The point with prescription drugs in Medicare--remember, as an outpatient, prescription drugs are not covered in Medicare at all. You have to go outside the system. But of the about 36 million people enrolled in Medicare, two-thirds do have some coverage, one-third do not have coverage. Therefore, in that Bipartisan Commission, which we put forward and worked out over the course of the year, we said let's first focus right now as we modernize and strengthen Medicare, improve its solvency, make it less costly, less rigid, let's at least address this 35 percent as a first step. The 65 percent who are covered are covered in lots of different ways. 
   Since my time is up, I will yield the floor and simply close with this point. We will be offering an amendment tomorrow which says: Yes, prescription drugs, but let's do it in the context of overall Medicare reform. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the United States has a tradition of defining our national interests overseas to reflect our values: freedom from persecution, freedom from religious intolerance, and the inalienable rights of self-determination and economic opportunity. In the twentieth century alone, we have sacrificed so much to defend those interests worldwide, based on the belief that freedom is truly an inalienable right, not simply for Americans, but for all peoples. Even now, in Kosovo and in Bosnia, we have been the world leaders in defending against tyranny and oppression, believing that, although far away, injustice must be met with resolve. 
   Our response to the tragedy and injustice in Sudan has not been quite so aggressive. The radical Islamic regime in power in Sudan has coordinated a systematic campaign of terror against southern Sudan which includes calculated starvation, slavery, and the killing of innocent women and children. The war of low-level ethnic cleansing in Sudan has ground on for 16 years, claiming the lives of nearly 2 million and displacing over 4 million. That staggering number represents more dead than the wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Chechnya combined. In terms of loss of life, it has been the costliest war this century since the Second World War. After 10 years of feeding the starving, with the war no closer to resolution than it was in 1983 when it began, we must change our approach. While we have been very generous as a Nation in terms of humanitarian relief, we have done little to address the causes of the war. 
   Along with my colleagues, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator BROWNBACK, and Senator LIEBERMAN, I am introducing the ``Sudan Peace Act,'' which aims to strengthen American policy and resolve to end the status quo. 
   The timing of this initiative is critical. The Government of Sudan has publicly announced that they will use incoming oil revenues to increase the tempo and lethality of the war. An increase in the lethality and tempo of the war would translate into more death and destruction, more shattered lives and more slaves. Thus, time is of the essence in supporting efforts to reach a comprehensive conclusion to the hostilities. Even under such grim circumstances, a glimmer of opportunity to push for a comprehensive solution to the conflict may be at hand. We must take full advantage of that chance, for without the leadership of the United States, the war will certainly drag on for many more years. 
   International relief operations have been in existence for 10 years with little change. The current arrangement allows Khartoum to manipulate our food donations as a weapon of mass destruction by vetoing United Nations' relief flight plans in areas of rebel activity. Also, at a cost of over $1 million per day, the effort is wrought with the potential for extreme donor fatigue. 
   We need a new policy using all points of pressure and directing all efforts toward a comprehensive negotiated solution. Reinvigorating and pursuing a peace process based on the Declaration of Principles, signed by the combatants in 1994, is the best means we have to push for a comprehensive solution at this time. So far, the Government of Sudan has refused to negotiate in good faith, choosing instead to continue the brutal war and create political diversions to any credible, binding process. 
   With a set of new or strengthened political and humanitarian tools, this legislation aims to push all players toward a comprehensive negotiated solution. 
   The Government of Sudan has long abetted the practice of slavery. Additionally, it has helped organize and coordinate militia, Popular Defense Forces, and paramilitary holy warriors (``muraheleen'') to terrorize and sometimes enslave traditional agricultural and pastoralist tribes in the south and in the Nuba Mountains. 
   The legislation condemns the gross violations of human rights in Sudan--including slavery, the use of the denial of access to food as a weapon of mass destruction, and targeting of civilians--and increases pressure for action in the United Nations Security Council and for UN human rights monitors to be deployed in contested areas. 
   The effort to stop the conflict in Sudan has the best chance of success if  it is a multinational effort. The shameful lack of resolve among the international community to pressure the combatants has been a factor in the perpetuation of the conflict. 
   The legislation does more than simply highlight the shameful lack of resolve internationally, it seeks to change our own policy to address the causes of the famine and the war. 
   The legislation gives the Secretary of State clear authority to commit all necessary diplomatic efforts toward reinvigorating the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace process, including any necessary support for implementation of a settlement. It calls upon the leadership of the members of IGAD and the IGAD Partners Forum (IPF--a grouping of donors and multilateral organizations) to give all necessary support. 
   The combination of a Declaration of Principles on which a peace process should be based and the engagement of the IGAD Partners' Forum bodes well for a reinvigoration of what has been a foundering process. The fact that IGAD is a credible regional organization adds to its potential success. The Declaration of Principles provides a first critical, measurable step to which the combatants can be held accountable. 
   The legislation supports the President's sanctions against Sudan, codifying them into law and protecting them from piecemeal erosion until Sudan makes substantial and verifiable progress toward peace. The existing sanctions must be used as a pressure point for peace. 
   The United States must maintain or strengthen every possible point on which to pressure Sudan to engage in a meaningful peace process. Any relaxation of any portion of the sanctions would essentially be a reward to Khartoum. 
   The legislation also requires the President to report to Congress on the status and means 
   of financing the new oil fields in Sudan and that financing's relationship to the sanctions, the number and circumstances of bombings of civilian targets by the Government of Sudan, the extent to which humanitarian operations are being compromised, and whether progress is being made toward peace by all parties. 
   The issue of financing oil fields is especially important. The revenues from the new sources of oil will add a new source of hard currency to finance the war. A key player in making that influx of hard currency into Khartoum is a Canadian company that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Considering the wording of the sanctions in the President's Executive order of 1997, such a financial instrument would seem to be something the United States would not be able to legally facilitate. It is certainly not something the United States should want to facilitate. 
   The United Nations-coordinated relief effort in Sudan, known as Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), was founded in 1989 in response to the starvation deaths of 250,000 people in southern Sudan. In March and April 1998 the Government of Sudan denied OLS access to much of Bahr el Ghazal in an effort to starve out rebels. The ban caused severe famine. 
   The ability of the Government of Sudan to veto OLS relief flight plans has allowed Khartoum to use food as a weapon of mass destruction. It indiscriminately targets combatants and noncombatants alike. Only with the cooperation and pressure from the members of the Security Council and those countries which continue normal trade relations with Sudan can we ever hope to achieve success on this point. Having a viable alternative to OLS would not only allow for the distribution of relief should a flight ban be imposed, it will immediately discourage Khartoum's use of flight bans as an instrument of war. 
   This legislation continues to press for reform of all humanitarian assistance in Sudan. The bill includes measures to press for reform of OLS, for the continued use of relief organizations outside OLS to deliver the United States' relief assistance, and directs the Administration to develop a possible alternative organization to deliver relief, should Khartoum again place bans on relief flights. 
   The use of non-OLS groups to distribute relief has two primary benefits. First, it fills in holes where OLS is prohibited from operating either by Khartoum or by its own security concerns. It can also strengthen the hand of OLS with respect to flight bans because Khartoum is reluctant to exercise its veto power when it clearly strengthens organizations outside its control. 
   The legislation provides new and expanded authority for the Sudan Transition Assistance for Rehabilitation (STAR) program, which seeks to build the basic civil and economic institutions in areas devastated by the war. 
   The move away from providing only disaster assistance toward providing development assistance is critical. STAR seeks to build the basic administrative and social institutions in areas outside of government control essential for a self sustaining Sudan: civil administration, civil society, agricultural extension services, courts, etc. One of the greatest advantages Khartoum enjoys is a destroyed society in the south. Again, a stronger society and economy in the south serves to disabuse Khartoum of the notion that it can win outright on the battlefield and is thus a pressure point to push for commitment to a viable peace process. The reconciliation efforts between the Dinka and Nuer peoples is arguably the most significant development in recent years in terms of strengthening the areas outside of the government's control and putting pressure on Khartoum to come to the table. Support for those efforts are critical. Finally, this position makes no assumption nor policy statement with regard to the eventual political status of the south. 
   The legislation also provides for an independent assessment of the humanitarian needs of certain regions in Sudan, which are heavily contested and thus excluded from most multilateral humanitarian operations. The Nuba Mountains and its unique and fast-disappearing people and culture is especially vulnerable. 
   In an effort to reduce the diversion of food assistance to combatants, to strengthen the targeted population's ability to defend themselves, and to provide for separation of combatants from ongoing humanitarian operations and the personnel who run them, the bill gives the President authority to provide direct food assistance to those forces protecting noncombatants from attacks by government or government-sponsored forces. However, such a program may only be conducted completely separate from current or future humanitarian operations and without compromising them. 
   Currently, the majority of relief agencies, both within and outside OLS, provide assistance only to noncombatants. As a consequence, hungry rebel forces routinely divert food aid away from delivery areas, either by taxation, or by taking the food outright. The result is that normal food distribution is disrupted and any reasonable separation between combatants and noncombatants is breached. Providing a separate mechanism to feed combatants--who will be receiving food aid in one form or another, regardless of the distribution scheme--hOLSs the possibility of reducing diversions, maintaining a clear separation between combatant and noncombatants, and thus helping to minimize risk to relief agency personnel. Additionally, the necessity of pursuing food has seriously undermined the effectiveness of those forces to defend the population in areas outside of government control, as they must often demobilize for long periods of time to exact food from relief supplies or tend to farming or herding responsibilities. The Administration should make a determination on the potential for such a program to meet the goals outlined in the section. This legislation gives the President the authority to do so, with strong provisions to protect current humanitarian operations. Like other capacity building measures in this legislation, enhancing the ability of those in areas outside of government control to defend themselves from government aggression will ultimately help to dissuade the government from continued prosecution of the war and will thus strengthen the push to engage in a comprehensive peace process. 
   These are all critical measures and opportunities which the United States must seize. Our policy has not done enough to change the status quo. Our generous response, which began in 1989, has grown and continued to feed more of the starving, yet as a response to the war, it has grown tepid. Unless we do all we can to end the conflict in Sudan,  we are part of the problem. For sixteen years we have witnessed the destruction of a nation and the loss of millions of lives, ground into dust as the world misses opportunity after opportunity to stop it.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy today to support continued funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS program. During consideration of the Juvenile Justice Bill in May, I opposed Senator BIDEN's amendment which would have authorized the COPS Program for 5 more years. I took that position because I felt that Senator BIDEN's proposal, which would have cost taxpayers $7 billion, needed to be carefully scrutinized in the normal legislative process. His proposal would have more than doubled the current funding authorization, and did not address the serious problems that exist with the current program. 
   Today, however, I am happy to support continued funding of the COPS Program for FY 2000. Local law enforcement officers from across Tennessee have contacted me to let me know of their support for this program. Tennessee has benefitted from almost $120 million in Federal funds since the COPS Program began. Police Chief Jamie Dotson of Chattanooga told me that the COPS Program has assisted him in hiring an additional 76 police officers. The police chiefs of Memphis, Nashville and Knoxville all support the program. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on reauthorization of the COPS Program. I want to ensure that we build flexibility into the system, so that communities may use the Federal funds to best suit their needs, be they more policemen in schools, purchase of new technology, bullet proof vests, or overtime payments to keep policemen on our streets fighting crime. Additionally, I want to ensure that we carefully scrutinize the program to eliminate waste of scarce taxpayer resources. I am grateful that my colleagues have been able to work out a compromise so we can continue to fund this program, and I am proud to continue my support.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to authorize the appropriations for the Technology Administration (TA) of the Department of Commerce for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. This bill authorizes funding for activities in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Technical Information Services (NTIS), the Office of Technology Policy (OTP), and the Office of Space Commercialization (OSC). 
   The Technology Administration is the only federal agency responsible for maximizing technology's contribution to America's economic growth, and for partnering with industry to improve U.S. industrial competitiveness. Because technological progress is the single most important factor in our current economic growth, it is important that the agency be adequately funded to pursue its missions, even during the current era of fiscal constraints. As the pace of technological changes accelerates and as the world transitions to a digital economy, we must work proactively to ensure that the private sector has the best possible tools to compete in this new economy. 
   NIST, as the main research laboratory in Technology Administration, promotes and strengthens the U.S. economy by collaborating with industry to apply new technology, measurement methods, and technical standards. In support of the programs in Scientific and Technical Research and Services, the bill seeks to increase the authorization amounts for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 by 5.5 percent annually, consistent with my objective for doubling the aggregate federal funding for civilian research over an 11-year period beginning in fiscal year 2000. 
   In keeping with my firm belief that our national commitment to technological innovation must include a complete framework that also facilitates the realization and commercialization of new technologies in the marketplace, the bill also continues to provide funding for two NIST programs that have been particularly contentious: the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP). We respond to existing criticisms of ATP with several changes to the administration of ATP awards to ensure that the program fulfills its originally intended mission. These modifications include provisions to ensure that federal funds would not interfere or compete with private capital for the commercialization of new technologies, and that these funds would benefit primarily small businesses. 
   With MEP approaching maturity, the evidence of its success in providing technical assistance and advanced  business practices to help small manufacturers improve their competitiveness has been overwhelming. However, as we transition from a labor-based to a knowledge-based economy, the function of the manufacturing sector will change and its needs will evolve accordingly. In anticipation of these changes, the legislation requests the Director of NIST to examine these issues closely, and recommend modification or expansion of MEP as appropriate. 
   NTIS is an agency within Technology Administration that collects, archives, and disseminates scientific, technical, and related business information produced by or for the federal government. NTIS is required to cover its expenses through its revenues. However, the advance of the Internet and the convenience of electronic dissemination of information freely via agency web sites have severely impacted NTIS's ability to sell its products. It is my belief that the agency serves an important mission in ensuring the preservation of research results produced from federal investment. Yet, prudent fiscal management practice dictates that we give serious consideration to the agency and its future. Accordingly, the bill reauthorizes additional funding for the agency, but only if the Secretary can recommend potential resolutions to the issue. We leave open the option of possibly resolving this issue in a later bill. 
   Through the Technology Administration Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-309), we created the Office of Space Commercialization, and for the first time, the Office will receive its own funding authorization. As the pace of activities to commercialize aspects of space increases, I hope that the Office will become a more active participant in the ongoing discussion between the government and industry in this strategically important market. 
   Two other issues that the legislation addresses include the commissioning of a study to strengthen and maintain technical expertise of the national laboratories, and a study on the role and impact of international and domestic technical standards of global commerce. These are issues with national impact that I believe we must discuss in a timely manner. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this authorization bill reflects a balance between prudent fiscal policies and wise investment for our Nation's future. We have incorporated input from my colleagues in the Senate, the House, and the Administration, as well as my constituents, and other interested parties. The legislation reaffirms our national commitment to maximize technology's contribution to economic growth in a responsible manner, while at the same time, prepares us for changes ahead as we transition into a knowledge-based economy. It also seeks to maintain America's unique technical skills. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support timely passage of this legislation so that we can give a clear indication to the American people that we are serious about enhancing U.S. competitiveness as we approach the next century, and ensuring that our federal investment is well spent.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, thirty years ago Neil Armstrong took his historic first steps on the surface of the moon, fulfilling the dreams of his fellow astronauts, his country, and the entire human race. His ``small step'' has inspired the following generations in a quest to explore the frontiers of space. Space travel has encouraged ingenuity that permeates American society. National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) accomplishments have led to technological advancements utilized in everyday life, as well as increased math and science interest among school children, and the development of a multi-billion dollar commercial space industry. While there are many benefits of space exploration, the United States still faces the challenge of developing a cost effective strategy to manage existing space programs. We should build on the legacy of Apollo II by forging ahead with both basic R&D and advanced future technologies in a cost effective and well-managed collaborative effort with private industry.  
   The accomplishment three decades ago of the seemingly impossible task of sending a man to the moon led to a newly found confidence in the power of science. President Kennedy challenged America in 1961 to send a man to the moon, when many people believed it to be impossible. Within a decade, America had risen to the challenge by demonstrating their technological superiority over the rest of the world with Apollo 11. Such a powerful display of technology is a catalyst of a cycle resulting in an increased standard of living for many Americans. The cycle begins as many young people are motivated to pursue science as an academic discipline. New scientific interest results in an increase in basic research funding at universities and corporations. The cycle is completed when advancements ranging from more comfortable mattresses to better radiation treatment for cancer patients begin to make their way into everyday life. Other emerging applications include agricultural remote sensing techniques, distance learning, and telemedicine. The increased productivity attributable to these applications will serve as a stimulus to the national economy. 
   Commercial space launch is an entire industry that has stemmed from the application of technology in space. The broadcast, telecommunications, and weather industries all increasingly rely on satellites to provide the most effective services. The U.S. commercial launch industry had revenues totaling $2.4 billion dollars in 1997. This industry is projected to grow exponentially over the coming years. The Commerce Department estimates that over 1,700 satellites are expected to be launched over the next ten years--70% of which will come from the commercial industry. It is clear that if the United States is to remain the world's leader in this domain, we must begin now to modernize the Nation's space launch capacity. That means reviewing the state of our outdated launch vehicle technology, our costly infrastructure, and the financial insurance needs that are key to the growth of this industry. 
   The immediate future of NASA lies in the International Space Station, an international cooperative effort to build a research facility in space. The International Space Station will provide a unique environment for research with the absence of gravity, allowing new insights into human health and disease treatments. However, this innovative research facility bears a price tax of approximately $100 billion dollars to the American taxpayers. Although this program is a long-term investment which will bring discoveries unimaginable to today's scientists, it is our duty to protect the American taxpayers from unsatisfactory performance of the participating foreign partners, prime contractor, and program management. Congress must insist on further accountability from NASA in order to most effectively support this program. We should not allow delays in foreign components of the International Space Station to increase the burden on American citizens. 
   On this day in 1969, Neil Armstrong knew that he was making an important first step. We have the responsibility of taking the next step by determining the future path for NASA and the space industry. Our efforts to reach the moon required a creative approach to a difficult challenge. In the spirit of the Apollo program, I call on NASA and policy makers to take a creative approach to ensuring fiscal responsibility while fostering the innovation that benefits every American.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today pleased with the discussion and the debate which has taken place over the last 4 days, recognizing that we have a number of other amendments as we go forward and hopefully look for a vote later today for final passage. 
   I want to mention a couple of things I haven't had the opportunity to speak on earlier yet I continue to be asked about by my colleagues and by various people in the media and constituents continue to call about. One of them has to do with an issue we debated yesterday, which will be voted on at 3:30; that is, access to specialty care. 
   A number of issues have arisen. I think it is important that our colleagues all understand that the Republican bill ensures access to specialty care. Again, the easiest way for me to take care of that, without getting involved in a lot of the rhetoric that goes back and forth, is with the wording in the underlying bills that is a little bit different. ``Specialty'' versus ``specialty care'' has all kinds of connotations that allow people to confuse the issue. 
   But in section 725 of our bill, it states that plans--and I begin my quotation by saying--``shall'' ensure access to specialty care as covered under the plan. 
   What is important is that people understand that the ultimate decision of what is ``medically necessary and appropriate''--those exact words that are used in the various bills and amendments that have come forward to ultimately decide what is ``medically necessary and appropriate''--ends up being with a physician who is independent of the plan, who is a medical expert, who is a specialist, who is appointed not by the plan. 
   We have heard again and again that in some way this independent reviewer is tied to the plan. The words are written in the bill. I don't know how much  more we can do in terms of distancing this reviewer, this physician, this independent reviewer, who is appointed by an entity, which is regulated by the Government, and is another sort of separation from the plan. This entity can be approved either by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or by the State or by the Federal Government. This entity appoints this third party reviewer who ultimately decides what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' 
   When we use those words ``medically necessary and appropriate,'' again and again it has come back that at least we should consider putting it in Federal statute and defining in Washington, DC, what ``medically necessary and appropriate'' means. 
   I reject that, and I think we should reject that because it is difficult--I think it is impossible, but I will say it is difficult--to define what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' To pretend that we can do it on the Senate floor is misleading. In fact, many think tanks and many Senators, Congressmen and women have tried to do it, and we haven't been able to define it in Medicare or in CHAMPUS. The President's Quality Assurance Commission was unable to define what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' 
   Thus, we don't attempt to define it. We say it is important, but we say ultimately it has to be defined by an independent medical specialist, independent of the managed care company. Then we have a whole list of things that he or she has to take into consideration. 
   We continue to limit what that third party independent reviewer--he or she--actually considers the best practice of medicine, which is very different, I should say, from ``generally accepted medical practices.'' ``Generally accepted medical practices'' haven't been defined very well. There is not a book of ``generally accepted medical practices.'' 
   I say that because if your sick heart is not beating very well, there are procedures that may not be ``generally accepted'' but they can be lifesaving. They may not be done very much in a community. Whether you do a transplant, or you put a wrap around the heart, or you take out a section of it, that may not be the overall best practice, but it could be ``generally accepted practice'' or ``generally accepted'' but not the ``best medical practice.'' I don't want to get into writing these definitions into Federal statute. 
   The distinction that has been made in several bills when we talk about ``medical necessity'' is also a very important issue because for the layperson, or the patient sitting out there, you would think that ``medical necessity'' would be easy to define. But saying what is going on out there in the health care arena, what is the range of treatment--we have seen charts on the floor that basically show that the range of treatment is huge in America, charts on how to treat urinary tract infections 80 different ways by 170 different physicians. 
   What that basically says is the range of treatment is huge--the variety. It doesn't say whether all of those are good or whether all of those are bad. But the fact that it doesn't say that and the practice is so wide, we don't want to make that the gold standard. If we were going to write something into Federal statute, we shouldn't say ``generally accepted medical practices'' because in truth it takes not the lowest common denominator but it takes the common denominator and makes that the standard. 
   I think it is very dangerous to say ``best practices'' will be the standard. That is why I don't think ``best practices'' should be written into Federal statute as the definition. 
   Why is that? It is because ``best practices'' are evolving over time. Yes, you can have studies in the New England Journal of Medicine and in the Journal of the American Medical Association of the greatest breakthrough, but you can't expect that greatest breakthrough which might be in truth the best practice 3 or 4 or 5 years later to immediately be disseminated to hundreds of thousands of physicians the next day across the United States of America. 
   I am trying to spend a little bit of time with this because I think it is dangerous to try to define ``medical necessity'' in Federal statute. We can still use the terms. You need ``medical necessity'' in there--what is ``medically necessary and appropriate''--but I don't think we should. I think we are doing a disservice if we try to define it. I struggled. We tried in our committee and in our staff to come up with a good definition. It doesn't mean that health care plans aren't going to try to define what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' 
   The reason this bill is necessary is that some managed-care plans have terrible definitions. They say what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' They might say that it is effective and that it has had proven efficacy in the past. But some will go so far as to say what is the most efficient or what is--they don't say it this way--but what is the least expensive, and once they have put it in the contract, the people will come back and point to that. 
   Those are bad definitions. But that same sort of risk of writing in the definition in Federal statute, again, can be very dangerous if we are looking for quality of care in an evolving health care marketplace. 
   The beauty of our bill is that we fix the system. We go to where the problem is. We don't bring in a trial lawyer or a lottery where people wait 5 years on average to have a medical malpractice lawsuit. 
   I didn't participate in the earlier discussion today. But when you look at medical malpractice, my experience in medicine is that when you look at health care and lawyers, it is in medical malpractice. Basically, we know that is a very costly system. Most people just want to get something covered and don't know how to go out and hire a lawyer. Most lawyers, because they are operating on contingency fees, aren't going to fool with the $5,000 case, or the $20,000 case, or the $50,000 case. They will fool with the $1 million case. Then it becomes very arbitrary. You have a costly system that is an arbitrary system. 
   The third point is that it takes forever. It is a time consuming system. Earlier studies, I am sure, were quoted on the floor. The average malpractice case takes 5 years before recovery is made. That is an average of 5 years. That means some are 6, 7, 8, or 9 years. 
   The American people want to fix the system. They want the reassurance that their managed care plan is not denying coverage. 
   I yield myself 3 more minutes, and then I will yield to the Senator from Texas, if I may. I will finish this one thought. 
   What the American people want is for us to get away from this fear that managed care is overriding what they or their physician, in consultation with each other, think and believe is appropriate and, in truth, provides good quality of care. The reason I believe we were stuck on this vote earlier is the American people are saying let's fix the system, but let's make sure that we remove the barrier to the coverage that I deserve, that I expect, and that is appropriate for me, and that it is delivered in a timely way. 
   That is not helped by a very expensive lawsuit which is not going to be settled for about 5 years, at least in medical malpractice. It will not allow a person to get coverage for that cleft lip repair of a child or the appendectomy or the laryngitis. 
   We want to do what is best for Americans, best for children, and allow that timely access of care, removing unnecessary barriers. There will be certain barriers. remove the unnecessary, unjustified barriers, so that Americans can rest assured they can, in a timely way, receive good, quality care. That is the purpose of this bill. 
   I have been pleased with our discussions. As we accept some amendments and reject others, I know we can come up with a good bill later today. 
   I yield such time as necessary to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very quickly, because we have a lot of ground to cover over the next 100 minutes, the amendment that has been sent to the desk involves basically five components. I will be relying on a number of my colleagues coming to the floor, all of whom have worked for weeks and months and, in some cases, well over a year on these amendments. 
   The first of these components is on external appeals. As we continue to address the issues before us, it is very important to have the American people  recognize we are going to continue to improve this bill as we go through. 
   A second component is the clinical trial issue, an issue Senator MACK and I have worked very aggressively on over the last year with a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, an issue that had been addressed initially earlier in the week that, as we said before, we are going to come back to and lay out what we think is the most reasonable way to achieve a very important goal, and that is to increase access to important clinical trials. 
   A third component a number of Senators, again Senator COLLINS and Senator GRASSLEY, will be speaking to is on provider nondiscrimination, and we will be looking at some protections that are similar to those in Medicare and Medicaid. 
   A fourth component of this amendment--again a very important one because it involves choice, and again we are working to improve this bill as we go through with the amendments--is on point of service where we expand choice, which again is a basic underlying principle of the Republican efforts in this bill. 
   The fifth component that will be addressed is continuity of care, again a very important issue, the whole issue of extending 
   the transition period for patients. 
   We have a lot to cover over the next 100 minutes. To me it is very pleasing, having participated so much on each of these issues, that upon passage of this amendment with its five components, we will do a great deal to improve the quality of care of individual patients. That is where our focus must be. 
   We are going to begin with the issue of clinical trials, again picking up on the discussion earlier in the week. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from Florida.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently debating an amendment that we have introduced on several topics. One is external appeals, strengthening that external appeals process. 
   No. 2, and one that I have been intimately involved with, is expansion of cancer clinical trials, to make those  trials more available to the American people. We have a very important issue on provider discrimination and continuity of care. Senators COLLINS and ENZI will be responding later to the comments that were just made, which I thought were very positive in terms of what is necessary and what the American people expect in terms of continuity of care. 
   We want to address the fifth issue at this juncture, and that is the point of service. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. I know we have a number of other speakers on the floor. After our discussion two nights ago, I looked at the two studies the Senator from Connecticut used. This is one of the problems. There is not good data on what are routine costs. I went through this the other night. I cannot be any clearer. 
   I have personally read the studies, as many as I could find. The two presentations you made in the data on how much money it saves is not peer review. It has not been published, to the best of my knowledge. Both are presentations made on May 7, 1999, at the National Coalition for Cancer Research. The data probably is good, but I cannot go back and see what the methodology is. Let me say that is the problem, that there are only three prospective, randomized clinical trials I could find and we were able to find in the committee. There may be more trials out there. But three clinical trials, not the ones you are talking about, that, again, show the cost, with some variation, might be zero--I am not sure what the lowest is--but up to 10 percent.

   Mr. FRIST. You are exactly right. I do not question the data. But it is unpublished data with no explanation given for methodology on either one. The cost of clinical research in the M.D. Anderson study or the Sloan-Kettering study--no details were given about methodology. So, yes, you say it is cheaper, but I have no idea how they determined that, whether they are accurate or not. 
   To the best of my knowledge, that has not been peer-reviewed. All that does not matter very much, except when you go back to an earlier question of why we focus on just cancer. I was not on the floor, but I had heard the argument, why not other diseases, such as Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease, and others? I think that is legitimate. 
   Let me tell you my rationale for starting with something that is focused. The NIH has about 6,000--maybe it is 5,000; maybe 7,000--clinical trials out there, about 6,000 and 2,000--1 out of 3--are in cancer. The others are scattered among different disease processes. 
   So we said, since we do not know what the routine costs are --the other day I talked about the difficulty of defining ``incremental costs,'' using the example of medical devices. There 
   are no studies--prospective, randomized clinical trials--to know what the incremental costs are for devices. 
   So what we are arguing is, instead of opening that door broadly, to start with a foundation of information about which we know. The clinical studies on routine costs all apply to cancer, which happens to be about one out of three trials that are out there today. 
   That is the base we are going to start with as we get into this subsidy--a good subsidy--that is in our private health care system which is passed on by increased premiums, or some way you are taxing people out in the private sector who are listening to this right now. We are going to tax you to pay for these trials. 
   We simply say, let's do it in a systematic way, starting with the body of knowledge we know about, which happens to be in cancer, and then letting it expand, potentially, over time based on our findings. 
   One last thing, in our amendment, as was pointed out, we also have a study, a very important study, that will expand so we will not have three studies. You will not be presenting data that has not been published yet, which I think is part of our amendment. 
   I will yield to the Senator from Florida, and then we will come back.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on two amendments. The first vote will be an amendment which was carried over from this morning on long-term care, deductibility, access to emergency room services, access to specialists, and access to OB/GYN services, after which we will be voting on the amendment that we have been talking about over the last 100 
   minutes, which is an amendment we have introduced on external appeals with a Republican amendment that provides a specific timeframe for expedited external review, No. 1. 
   No. 2, on coverage of clinical trials, our amendment provides coverage of routine patient costs associated with participation in an approved trial in the field of cancer. 
   No. 3, provider nondiscrimination, where our amendment offered protections similar to those provided in Medicare and Medicaid, and the balanced budget amendment of 1997. 
   No. 4, a point-of-service aspect, where we extended the point-of-service option to beneficiaries beyond what was in the underlying bill. 
   No. 5, continuity of care, which has been discussed by Senator COLLINS. 
   I very much believe these amendments will strengthen the underlying bill. 
   I urge their approval because I think they go right to the heart of what the American people want, and that is to keep the focus on the patient, on the individual, to ensure quality and to ensure access. 
   I yield the remainder of our time.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to comment on the process. We have seen pictures of infants with various medical challenges that I need to clear up. It keeps coming back and back again. The example of cleft palate is being used over and over. I want to demonstrate, to help educate our colleagues, because obviously it is not coming through what is in the bill, what will be in the final bill tonight. 
   No. 1, let's just say the baby is born with a cleft palate, which is a defect in the upper part of the mouth. The doctor recommends surgery, regardless of what is in the health plan. The HMO contract says ``cosmetic'' surgery is not covered. 
   So the medical claim is made. The doctor and the patient say: Yes, this thing is medically indicated. The plan has written down that cosmetic surgery is not indicated. So they say: We want to do something about it. 
   Today they have to throw up their hands. There is nothing they can do. That is why we need a Patients' Bill of Rights. What happens? We have an internal review built into the plan. So if there is a disagreement, the doctor and  the patient disagree with the plan, there is a process, for the first time for most of these plans, for internal review. They may have other physicians who are affiliated with the plan making that decision. Let's just say they came up with an adverse decision. Basically, the second opinion inside the plan, the internal review, said: No; I am with the plan. We are still not going to cover it. 
   Well, is it eligible, or is it not, for external review? Remember the external review plan. You have the managed care company; you have the entity that is government regulated; State, Federal, Department of Health and Human Services regulates this entity. This entity appoints an independent doctor, a medical specialist, if necessary, to do the review: Is it eligible or is it not? 
   The key worlds are, ``Is there an element of medical judgment?'' There clearly is, because you have a doctor saying that cleft palate needs to be repaired. So automatically--and that is the trigger--it goes to an independent external review. 
   We have heard a lot of people say it is not independent. It is pretty independent if you have a managed care company, you have an entity that is government regulated here that is unbiased--the words are actually in the plan--appointing an independent reviewer, who is a doctor. Or, if it happens to be a chiropractor of concern--it can be a chiropractor, I might add, who is independent, a specialist in the field, who makes the final decision. 
   In the independent external review, the reviewer makes an independent medical determination made on a whole list of things that we have in there--not just what the plan considers, but best medical practice, generally accepted medical practice, the peer reviewed literature, the best practices out there, what his colleagues are doing--and then a decision is made and whatever decision is made, it is binding. It is binding on the plan. 
   Let's just say it is binding on the plan, so let's have ``repaired'' here. Let's say the plan says, ``We are still not going to do it. I don't care what the reviewer says.'' You are going to see in the final bill that they have to do it. If they do not do it in a timely fashion--I want everybody to read the bill--they are going to be fined. 
   Mr. President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes.

   Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair. 
   So the decision has been made by the independent reviewer, and it is binding on the plan that you do the repair, that it is medically necessary and appropriate. The plan has to do it. We are still worried. What about that plan, if it just doesn't want to do it? Basically, what we have are penalties that are built in the bill. They have to do it, they have to do it in a timely fashion, and if they do not they are fined $10,000. Not only that, if they are fined $10,000 and still don't do it, immediately you can go to somebody else and have it repaired. And who is going to pay for that? The initial plan. 
   To me, that is the way the process works. You have an independent reviewer. You guarantee the patient gets that repair in a timely fashion, if in that independent review it is thought to be medically necessary and appropriate, regardless of what the HMO contract says. 
   Internal appeals, external appeals, independent reviewer with penalties built in if that is not carried out in a timely fashion, and the guarantee that the care can get done because you can go, even have a third party do it and charge it back to the initial plan--unbiased, independent, internal, external appeals, and that is the accountability provisions that are built into this bill. I am very proud of the fact it is there. It will change the way medicine is practiced by managed care. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. May I respond on his time? This is a critical point because we have been debating scope. It is very important for the American people to understand and for our colleagues to understand that scope, and when it comes to accountability, the internal and external appeals, the independent reviewer does not just apply the 48 million people not covered by the States. It is covered by people who are both ERISA covered, federally regulated, as well as the States, and it is important my colleagues understand that because that is a huge part of our bill. In many ways, it is the heart of our bill for the appeals process, the accountability, what I just went through, both ERISA, federally regulated plans, and State plans. That is why it is so hard, in the last hours of this debate when it is so misunderstood what is in this plan. That is why I tried to go through it very clearly. It covers all 124 million people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address a point of some contention on the floor over the past two days. Two days ago, I twice quoted from Dr. Robert Yelverton, Chairman of the Primary Care Committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The precise quotes were as follows: First, ``The vast majority of OB/GYNs in this country have opted to remain as specialists rather than act as primary care physicians,'' and second, ``None of us could really qualify as primary care physicians under most of the plans, and most OB/GYN's would have to go back to school for a year or more to do so.''

   Mr. FRIST. Unfortunately, before introducing these statements, I apparently misspoke and said, ``Let me share with Members what one person told me.'' I should have said, ``As Dr. Yelverton was quoted in the New York Times as stating.'' So, I wish to clarify the RECORD. 
   Dr. Yelverton has taken offense at my use of his quotes. In fact, he contends that I ``misused'' his quotes. At  this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed a letter from Dr. Ralph Hale, with an attached memo from Dr. Yelverton, into the RECORD, so that his views may be clear.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. The gist of Dr. Yelverton's complaint is that he was informed that I used his quotes to oppose an amendment which sought to allow OB/GYNs to be treated as primary care physicians. Dr. Yelverton supports allowing OB/GYNs to serve as primary care physicians and he supports ``direct access for women's healthcare.'' My position is that we should not be confusing the issue and saying that OB/GYNs--specialists--are ``primary care physicians'' and thus have the implied responsibility of serving as overall gatekeepers for insurance plans. Instead, I believe we should insure that women have direct access to OB/GYNs for obstetrical and gynecological care without going through a gatekeeper. In that spirit, I used Dr. Yelverton's reported quotes. 
   I continue to believe that our task is to see that women can have direct unimpeded access to OB/GYNs. We will do that, without saying that OB/GYNs must be designated as ``primary care physicians'' who are responsible for treating all aspects of the patient's health needs, including ear infections and the like. I sincerely believe that direct access to OB/GYNs is the issue, not whether we label OB/GYNs as ``primary care physicians.'' 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I just want to openly thank Members on both sides of the aisle. This has been a very challenging bill. Although I think it is going to be more satisfactory to this side of the aisle than the other side, it is a bill that I think we can all, after tonight, go home, think about, talk to our constituents about, and recognize that we have accomplished exactly what at least I wanted to accomplish; and that is, as I said 4 days ago when this first started, to keep the patient at the center of all of this debate--not special interests and not the rhetoric that goes back and forth, but how we can ultimately come up with a bill that helps patients. 
   We have strong patient protections. We have addressed quality head on and hit it with internal, external review. It has been strengthened from both sides of the aisle. It has been strengthened by recommendations that we have had through our staff and working together. 
   If we look at the access provisions, they are very strong, the medical savings accounts, the full deductibility for the self-employed, all of which we have done, the gag clauses, the access to specialists, direct access to obstetricians, what we have accomplished in terms of emergency room access, continuity of care. If we put it altogether, it comes back to the benefit of the patients, smack-dab at the heart. 
   When people ask me all the time, what can you do as a Senator to really help individual people, it comes down to this bill, I believe, a first step. 
   Our bill does take medical decisions out of the hands of a huge HMO bureaucracy and puts them back to that very special relationship, one I have been blessed to participate in again and again, that special relationship of the doctor-physician, the provider and the patients, who entrust their lives to you, their lives to you, their health care, their quality of life, their ability to see, to walk, to have that heart keep beating. That is entrusted to you. We have benefited that. We have enriched that. We have made that better. That is what we have accomplished tonight. 
   We have done it without markedly increasing cost because we all know, when cost goes up, out of control, it drives premiums up and access falls, and the number of uninsured are important. 
   I appreciate the support.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I truly believe that tonight is a win-win situation. We have made health coverage significantly better for those people who have such coverage today, but, almost more importantly, we make it more accessible for others, and more affordable for others in accomplishing the many patient protections--the improvement in quality, the appeals, internal and external. 
   A lot of people have been involved over the course of the last year. I simply want to add my thanks to the two leaders in this effort, Senator JEFFORDS, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for whose committee this bill passed and was debated. And, through much bipartisan discussion, the amendment process improved a bill that the task force, after about 6 to 8 months of very hard work, developed. 
   It was under Senator JEFFORDS' leadership that this bill took its final shape so that it finally arrived on the floor, and we were able to debate it. 
   Senator NICKLES for the last year and a half has chaired a task force, has been the quarterback, the manager of a broad range of people who participated in the study of the issues, true substantive study--not superficial policy reviews but a substantive study of the issues. Senator NICKLES oversaw and managed a group of people on that committee who have already been mentioned, including Senators ENZI, GREGG, HAGEL, and Senator COLLINS who literally has been on the floor for the last 4 days almost without leaving, participating in the debate on issue after issue. 
   Thanks also to Senator SANTORUM, Senator GRAMM of Texas, Senator LOTT--especially our majority leader, Senator LOTT, who spoke so eloquently a bit ago summarizing what this bill has been about, what it will accomplish, the confidence that he placed in both the task force and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. 
   I especially want to thank several staff members: Stacy Hughes and Meg Hauck, who have shown leadership among all the staff members; Anne Phelps and Sue Ramthun, two people with whom I worked most closely with and who have gathered the information, digested the issues, and spent late nights here. 
   I had the opportunity to work with Sue Ramthun over the last several years on health issue after health issue. This will be the last bill that she participates in, in the Senate--at least for a while. I say ``for a while'' because I am hopeful she will come back to our staff. I recognize her tremendous leadership and her knowledge of what has gone on in this body in the past. It has been immensely helpful to me, coming here just 5 years ago, to be able to work with an individual who understands the institution, understands the issues, and who has been involved in health issues long before I came to this body. 
   I want to mention Bill Baird, legislative counsel, who over the last 4 days--and also over the past years--has participated so directly in allowing Members to translate these ideas to specific language for the bill we were able to ultimately pass. It is a win-win. 
   As I said in my closing remarks tonight, the thing I will think about as I go home and reflect on over the last 4 days is we made real progress. We don't have all the answers. We don't pretend this bill has all the answers in establishing an appropriate balance between managed care, coordinated care, and that doctor-patient relationship. But we are getting it back into balance because it has been out of balance for a period of time. Our bill does take that whole doctor-patient relationship and make it the heart of this managed care environment. 
   In closing, it has been a wonderful opportunity for me to be able to work, again, on both sides of the aisle as we developed this bill which will significantly improve the quality and access of health care for Americans.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very quickly, let me state where we are, and then I will yield to the Senator from Florida. 
   We are presently considering an underlying amendment on clinical trials which was put forth by Senator DODD. It is an issue we have discussed a great deal in committee. It deserves discussion and it deserves a great deal of debate because it is important. As one who has been a principal investigator in clinical trials and has been involved in clinical investigations and trials for pharmaceutical agents and the application of medical devices, such as cardiac valves and stints, all of which I am familiar, it allows me to say it is critically important we debate and address  this issue, that we make sure we do move forward in a direction to capture and support the great benefits which are available in clinical trials. 
   A clinical trial is fairly straightforward in patient care. It is to figure out whether or not something works or whether it is harmful or not harmful. It is necessary to use and investigate patient populations where one group of the population receives it and one group does not receive it, to see what the adverse effects are, what works and what does not work. It is the accepted way of making and capturing the great advances which we all know are both being realized, but even more exciting--whether it is in the field of cancer or heart disease or bone disease or stroke--is that we are going to make our great breakthroughs. 
   In the underlying bill we are considering, we have a study by the Institute of Medicine to look at the factors which might hinder patient participation in those trials and also to figure out what the cost of these trials are, because you have one population that is not getting either a specific device or pharmaceutical agent and one population that does. But to compare these two populations, you need to do more testing, more examinations. If you have side effects or an adverse reaction from a medication, maybe you have to have a longer hospitalization or new treatments. 
   Well, the challenge we have as a nation is to figure out what that additional cost is. There have been only three good studies completed to date to determine the difference between those incremental costs to carry out that investigation. What we are considering is a new mandate and whether or not that new mandate should be placed on the HMOs' backs, or the private sector's back, in order to make the great advances in which we all want to participate. If we open that door--and I think we can go further than what is in the underlying bill--we have to be very careful not to impose a huge, very expensive mandate on our private health insurance system--something we haven't been able to do in Medicare, the public system. We have struggled with it, and we haven't been able to figure it out with the public dollars. So before we put in a huge mandate, we have to be careful not to dump on the private sector something we haven't been able to do in the public sector. That is the essence of the bill we will be passing over the next 48 hours. 
   I think we can make great strides. Probably the first thing to do is to look at the clinical trials. In this body, no Member has spent as much--or more--time looking at this issue of clinical trials than the Senator from Florida. 
   I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently debating an amendment on clinical trials. It is something that is very close to my heart because, as I said earlier, I have been involved in clinical trials. I have seen the great advantages of having such clinical trials in that it allows us, through that final stage, to determine whether or not a particular intervention, whether it be a new medicine that might potentially cure prostate cancer or a medical device that might be used to hold open the coronary artery after a heart attack, a heart attack which results in a squeezing down or atherosclerosis or blockage of a coronary artery, put a little stint in that, opens it up, how do you take that to the clinical setting? How do you take that to where it can be distributed broadly across America and across the world, if it is beneficial? 
   I should mention that the United States is the leading Nation in taking such innovation and such creativity, capturing it, studying it carefully, putting it in appropriate clinical trials, and then having it applied, if it is safe, if it is effective, to people around the country and the world. It should give all of us in this body and in the country a great deal of pride that we are the leaders in medical technology, medical innovation, whether it be the use of pharmaceutical agents; that is, medicines, whether it is treatment of chemotherapy; that is, using medicines to treat cancer, or the application of medical devices. 
   Just a few days ago I was in Boston and visited some of the great, young, aggressive research people who, by hand, make those little stints, the stints that look like little springs, that keep thousands and thousands of people's coronary arteries open. They come in with an acute heart attack, a little balloon blows up in a vessel, a stint is placed. Twelve years ago those stints were not around. They had never been placed into a coronary artery. How do you get to that point to where it is used in just about every hospital, every cardiology hospital in the United States of America? Well, the last phase of development is clinical trials. 
   That is why it is so important to me. And it is, in a very direct but also an indirect way, important to every single American, no matter what age you are because everybody at some point in their lives will be sick or will be ill. Anything that we can do as a Nation to lower the barriers between whether it is industry or our investigators or medical science and the delivery, the effective delivery of safe and effective procedures is something we need to work on. We started much of that work 3 or 4 years ago in modernization of the FDA. 
   I spent some time explaining this aspect of clinical trials to reinforce how critical it is that we do everything we can to lower the barriers to participation in clinical trials. 
   One thing we have to be aware of in terms of clinical trials is that we don't fully know what--I use the word ``incremental''--the increased cost, the incremental cost is when someone goes in to a clinical trial. As I mentioned earlier, usually you have one group of patients who did not get an intervention, one group of patients who did get an intervention, get that additional drug. You need to follow them over time and see what the incremental costs are of that clinical trial.

   Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield briefly for a question. My answer will be very short because I don't have enough time to finish. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-frist-tn-7-19990714</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. Yes. I really appreciate the question because it shows why we are addressing this today. In part, it is  because we are just beginning to understand the real importance of clinical trials. We are just figuring out the cost. The other dynamic is just that. 
   We have insurance companies and managed care companies and private payers today who basically say: We are in the insurance business. Our job is to deliver health insurance. If an individual comes in and they are sick, my obligation, as a managed care company or as an HMO or a health insurance company, is to take that patient and cover them by the definitions of that contract. 
   The question they are asking us today, and need to ask us on the floor, is shouldn't that be the responsibility of the Federal Government? Why should I, an HMO, an indemnity plan, a private health insurance plan, be paying for research that has potentially nothing to do with that particular patient? Because this is a mandate, the underlying Dodd amendment is a new mandate. 
   What Senator MACK and I will propose is also a mandate. So both sides are going to be hearing it. They are basically asking: Why are you all of a sudden thrusting on me the responsibility that is yours, the Senate, the Federal Government, the NIH? Why aren't you using Federal money, taxpayer money to subsidize this research, which is very beneficial? Why are you putting that mandate on my shoulders, the private insurance company? 
   Now, the answer to that is twofold. We probably need to do a little of both. We need to have more appropriate public investment in the clinical trials and at the same time have the private health insurance company in some way subsidized. 
   The problem with that is, if we put this new mandate on the managed care companies and the HMOs, somebody has to pay for it. The Federal Government is not going to pay for it. Unfortunately, I think we need to go back and address this same issue in Medicare. The Federal Government has basically said that we, except through the NIH, are not going to. For example, in the Medicare system, the health care delivery system for seniors, we have not approached the issue of how we subsidize these clinical trials. 
   So the private sector is saying: Why are you making us pay for it, while you in the Federal Government, at least in Medicare, have not yet addressed that? 
   The response to that is, yes, but we have the National Institutes of Health. We need to continue investing in that, and they oversee, along with other public agencies, clinical trials. 
   The private sector says: Why us? What the private sector is going to do is say: I am in the business of taking care of the heart attack that I cover under contract. Why am I having to, under your mandate, to have this clinical trial on prostate surgery or prostate cancer treatment? Why are you forcing me to 
   subsidize that? 
   We need to answer that question. The general public good and the great advances are the answer to that question, but then somebody has to pay for it. 
   The health insurance companies, what are they going to do? Whatever that incremental cost is, they are going to charge their very next person that they cover. So they are going to pass it back to the patients. 
   Then all of a sudden you have the patient come forward basically saying: I came in because of a heart attack. Why are you increasing my premiums and making me pay more every year to do general research that benefits everybody across the world? I just want a health care plan that pays for my own insurance. 
   We have to be able to determine what that additional cost of this mandate is, and that is very unclear today. We have to determine what that is. Then we have to explain to people why that is going to result in increased premiums that are passed on to the individual patients. That is sort of the big picture. 
   Let me go back to the Senator's question because it was a good question. Twenty years ago we didn't have many HMOs. Twenty-five years ago, we didn't have coordinated care plans, HMOs, PPOs, provider-sponsored organizations. All these are new entities. It used to be that private health insurance would be able to subsidize or cross-subsidize some of these clinical investigations--not a lot but some. That was at a time where there was more room to maneuver. 
   Now, with the scarcity of the health care dollar, they have been squeezed down, physicians have been squeezed down. You hear it all the time. People who are in our reception room and here to lobby us all the time say: We are being squeezed down. Managed care companies say: We are being squeezed down. Everybody recognizes that in terms of health care dollars, the demand is so huge. 
   Technology allows us such a great opportunity to deliver heart transplants, which I was able to do every week, or putting in heart valves or hip replacements in 95-year-olds, things that we couldn't do 30 years ago. The overall expense has caused a squeezing down on everybody. You hear private health insurance companies saying: No longer can we subsidize; no longer can we take a little money from here and subsidize this research out of the goodness of our heart because we are squeezed so far. 
   And thus we come in with some sort of mandate which is going to end up being in this bill, and some say performed to encourage and promote the private sector. We need to address it in the public sector in Medicare where we haven't addressed it for the private sector in some way to participate in clinical trials.

   Mr. FRIST. I will respond, through the Chair, to my colleague that the gist of her question is, shouldn't we allow what used to be done to continue to be done, and we should encourage that. The models of health care are changing rapidly. I hate to look back and say that because something used to be done, it should be done today. In this case, I am one who wants to promote the expansion of clinical trials as much as possible.

   Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 6 minutes. Please notify me when we have 30 seconds remaining. 
   The real issue--and the reason why I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, as written--is the following: 
   I have explained the difference between overall cost and incremental costs, and the cost of the clinical trial. Let me say that the data presented by Senator HARKIN is good data, but it always asks for what the end number is in science, how many cases the data is on. I didn't hear that; I didn't know how many. One of the charts was around 100, maybe 130 patients. You are looking at small statistical differences. We need more patients if we are going to be making policy on studies. That involved very few patients. 
   We had the opportunity in committee to look at a number of studies. There have been three completed studies--not ongoing but completed--all of which had some limitations. All three included just cancer patients, which is a very important group. We don't want to extrapolate cancer patients to artificial heart patients where they are putting in artificial hearts, cardiac valves, or stints. We have to be careful with that. The overall sample and size of the studies is very small. 
   On the other hand, the charts, in essence, are right. If you get into a clinical study, the medicine continues to be very good. Why? Because you have outside people watching what every move is, making sure every lab test is  justified. If you are going to do a lab test, it gives you the result; that is right. But there is an incremental increase in cost. 
   If you take two patients and you are studying them, you end up doing more testing. The side effect of the drug might be that it lowers one's blood test count, so then you have to test the hemateikon more. That increased cost is passed on to the patients in the private sector--not through Federal taxation going through Medicare and the subsidy coming down, but it is passed on by increased premiums. 
   We have to be able to explain to the patients, for the great public good, why they are having to pay more. I am saying basically that the science of knowing exactly what that cost is very young; it is in development. We should have 100 studies, not just 3, to be able to cite. 
   I think it is very important for us to continue as a body to encourage the gathering of that information and the academic study, careful study, through carefully controlled perspective trials, to determine what that cost is before we open the door broadly and pass that cost on to managed care companies, which on the very next day are going to put it on the backs of everybody who is listening to me speak today; that is, the patient--the patient who may have appendicitis 30 days from now, or a heart attack 60 days from now. Every day you are going to say tomorrow you are going to pay for this mandate we put on your managed care company. 
   In Medicare, which insures 36 million senior citizens and individuals with disabilities, we try to address it, and we are going to address it. But the reason we have not is we don't know what the cost will be. Where you have Medicare, you have a system going bankrupt over the next 15 years. We can't get together in this body, working with the President of the United States, to reform that in a sensible, modernized way. We just can't do it. We are not going to be throwing new mandates out there either--or we should not--which furthers that bankruptcy. 
   The question is, Where do we go from here? I think my objective is exactly the same as the principal sponsors of this amendment. There is one huge, gaping door there that I am most concerned about. I think the populations you have drawn from are probably appropriate, so we can get the data, the information to do this right. But basically the indication is that qualified individuals to whom this new mandate will apply in health care broadly--the indication is life-threatening or a serious illness. Now, having a category that broad in putting this mandate out on managed care, which is going to be passed on to patients--it has to be; there is nowhere else to pass it to; we are not taking it out of the Federal Treasury--before we do that, shouldn't we get a little more information and narrow the scope so we can learn and not make what could be a tragic mistake? 
   Saying that the people who are qualified is anybody who walks in and says they have a life-threatening illness, or anybody who has a serious illness, is very dangerous. If you are a patient and have appendicitis, that is a routine procedure and that is serious. Is it a life-threatening illness? No, but it is serious. As I go in as a patient under this new mandate, I might be able to say I want to be in a clinical trial.

   Mr. FRIST. Let me finish my statement. What does that actually set into motion? I am not quite certain because we don't know exactly what the overall expense or cost range of those trials would be. So what I would like to see first would 
   be an approach like the one of the Senator from Florida--to use the same overall indications but have the scope of a particular entity, instead of anybody who comes in and falls into the category of life-threatening or a serious illness because to a patient every illness is serious. 
   How much time remains?

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's clarification of that because it is important. The concept is basically that we can't create a door that is so broad that anybody can come in. If I need a heart transplant, is there any other therapy available? Probably not. Does that automatically qualify me for arranging a clinical trial? That can be dangerous. I can tell you that putting an artificial heart in can cost $100,000 or $150,000. I have put in these devices before. 
   We have to be very careful because to put a $150,000 expense into a policy that is translated directly down to the shoulders of patients--not the patient who needs the artificial heart but somebody else--can be dangerous. 
   I want us to work together. We can do that in the underlying amendment. We may not be able to go as broadly as we all would like to go until we get the appropriate information on the incremental cost and how much of a burden we are placing on society. 
   Again, I think our goals are very similar. I will refuse to move as far as the Senator on that concept in terms of life-threatening or serious illness, such as the example I just gave of the artificial heart, but I look forward to working with the Senator. 
   I again urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment with the understanding that the outline Senator MACK put forward as an amendment hits right at the principles of a mandate where we will support clinical trials without an undue burden on the backs of patients. That will be to the benefit of all Americans. 
   I yield 30 seconds initially to my colleague from Maine so that she may submit her amendment, and I yield the remainder of the time if that is appropriate.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly--I will not take 5 minutes--a number of issues have been discussed. Let me comment on a couple of issues. 
   The first has to do with some statements made by my colleague from California about obstetricians and primary care specialists; second, about clinical trials; and, third, scope. 
   I know my colleague from Texas has been waiting. I will conclude my remarks in 2 minutes, and then, hopefully, we can turn to her. 
   No. 1, do obstetricians want to be designated by their managed care companies to be primary care physicians? It sounds as if they do. 
   I have to say that if you are a primary care physician--that means if you are responsible for that managed care company, insurance, group, plan, or HMO--you are responsible really to become the gatekeeper. That means you have a specialist, obstetrician or gynecologist, who wants to be able to take care of the woman as a whole but doesn't necessarily want to take care of her ingrown toenails, appendicitis, headaches, or laryngitis. 
   That is the danger. It sounds good to say the OB/GYN is the primary care specialist for the patient. They are the primary care physician, the gatekeeper. That means the OB/GYN is going to be doing things that they are simply not trained nor want to do. 
   What women want in this country is to at any time be able to go to their obstetrician or gynecologist, whether it is an emergency or not, for routine care. That is what our bill does. That is what the American people want--to remove the barriers that exist today. 
   Yes, we need legislation. That is what our bill does. It drops that barrier so at any time a woman can go to, and be taken care of by, their obstetrician and gynecologist. It is in our bill. 
   The designation of ``primary specialist'' sounds benign. In truth, they are dangerous to the system. Obstetricians as a group may want it, and some may not. 
   I quote on behalf of 100 patients and provider groups, The 
   Patient Access Coalition. They talk about these specialist amendments. They write to us very specifically:  
   We do, however, wish to express concern about specialists being defined as primary-care providers.  
   It is very important that people do not come in and legislate and make them primary care providers. We want to remove the barriers to access to specialists. That is what we do. 
   No. 2, clinical trials. Again and again, the Dodd bill has some very good points in it. We are for clinical trials. We believe clinical trials should be part of the system, and I have spent most of the morning talking about that. But we don't know the overall cost. Before we know that cost, a managed care company is going to take care of that mandate from here, and they will put it on sick people who are getting sick and paying the tax. We don't have any idea what it is. 
   The amendment that will be offered tomorrow by Senator MACK looks at the cost issues. It has a mandate to cover clinical trials in an appropriate setting and in an appropriate way, but not in an irresponsible way. 
   We remove the Dodd language. We take what is very good in his amendment, and we will build on it and have a better amendment for the American people. 
   On the issue of scope in the underlying amendment about breast disease and cancer, the reason this scope is different from the other things is, they wanted to make this particular amendment consistent with the D'Amato approach from last year that had this with mastectomy and reconstruction of a breast--a procedure. What we did--and what was done by the Senator from Maine--was very specifically match that scope for this type of disease in a way that is consistent. That is why  that scope is different. They are exactly right. There is some difference there. 
   Those are the three points I wanted to make on that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again I stand as an advocate for clinical trials and say at the end of the next 48 hours, we are going to have a very good amendment that will be added to this bill which will address the issue of getting clinical services to people earlier by lowering the barriers to get into clinical trials with a mandate on managed care, HMOs that will be very effective, that will be accountable, that will be affordable, and that will get things to people quickly. 
   Let me go back to the examples. It is so hard. You use an example and somebody plays off it. Artificial hearts are expensive. A clinical trial opens up. It is life-threatening; there is no alternative. Two patients: one dying of cardiomyopathy. The patient will hardly last 2 weeks. You put in an artificial heart to see if it works. The patient dies 2 weeks later. It is terrible. The artificial heart in the other patient keeps him alive and 2 weeks, 3 weeks has a stroke to the brain. He has a massive stroke and stays in the hospital for a week, 1 month or 2 months. He takes hematinics. He has about $4,000 to $5,000 of testing every year. There are 15 people or so monitoring that patient for the next week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks. Two different patients: the intervention, the artificial heart you introduced as part of the clinical trial, and this patient dies. The incremental cost, the difference between these two is the hospitalization for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 8 weeks and the medical care. 
   Again, the incremental cost you are going to make the managed care plan pay--since everybody is bashing managed care, that seems to be OK--but remember, all the managed care plan does is pass that cost on to the people who are sick. You have sick patients, whose premiums go up, who pay this bill. It is unintended. I know that is not what you meant, but by using life-threatening or serious illness where there is otherwise no alternative, using the example you introduced, which I refuted--I am going to throw it right back at my colleague--it is very complicated. We need to stay sharp and focused and pass a sharp bill.

   Mr. FRIST. In the Kennedy-Robb amendment is the issue of access. 
   Again, my colleagues on the other side hit it right on the head: Women today want to have access to their obstetrician. They don't want to go through gatekeepers to have to get to their obstetrician or gynecologist. That relationship is very special and very important when we are talking about women's health and women's diseases. 
   In the Kennedy-Robb amendment, the language is that the plan or insurer shall permit such an individual who is a female to designate a participating physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as the individual's primary care provider. 
   It is true that in our underlying bill we don't say the plan has to say that all obstetricians and gynecologists are primary care providers. That is exactly right. The reasons for that are manyfold. 
   Let me share with Members what one person told me. Dr. Robert Yelverton, chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Primary Care Committee, stated: 
   The vast majority of OB/GYNs in this country have opted to remain as specialists rather than act as primary care physicians. 
   He attributes this to the high standards that health plans have for primary care physicians, saying: 
   None of us could really qualify as primary care physicians under most of the plans, and most OB/GYNs would have to go back to school for a year or more to do so. 
   You can argue whether that is good or bad, but it shows that automatically taking specialists and making them primary care physicians and putting it in Federal statute is a little bit like taking BILL FIRST, heart and lung transplant surgeon, and saying: You ought to take care of all of the primary care of anybody who walks into your office.  
   Doctors Yelverton, Lerner, Fallieras, Kilbride, Marston, Jaeger, Minton & Brown,
   Tampa, FL, July 13, 1999. To: Lucia DiVenere, ACOG Government Relations. From: Robert W. Yelverton, M.D., Chairman, Primary Care Committee. 
   I received your fax tonight and offer the following in response. 
   I have never spoken directly to Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) or any member of his staff on the subject of OB/GYNs as primary care physicians or on any other subject. The quote that Senator Frist attributed to me on the floor of the Senate today came from an article in the June 13, 1999, edition of the New York Times. The article may be viewed on the New York Times website (go to www.nytimes.com, then click on Health and Science). I was contacted by the article's author, Larry Katzenstein, and asked to comment on the impact of managed care on women's healthcare in this country. In my interview with Mr. Katzenstein, I discussed ``barriers'' that managed care organizations have raised against the efforts of OB/GYNs to become primary care physicians. The quote attributed to me by Senator Frist was from a non-quote in this article. I told Mr. Katzenstein that some managed care organizations have placed barriers consisting of such stringent (not ``high,'' as Senator Frist stated) standards for their qualifications as primary care physicians that most OB/GYNs would not be able to meet them without further training. 
   One objective of my comments was to demonstrate that the College's interests were to allow OB/GYNs to provide women's healthcare to their patients unimpeded by the cumbersome requirements of managed care referral systems. Mr. Katzenstein's article did not emphasize to the degree it should have that these were barriers to OB/GYNs  being designated primary care physicians--not ``high standards''--as has been discussed repeatedly in meetings of the Primary Care Committee. I went on to say to Mr. Katzenstein that the qualification requirements that some managed care organizations impose on OB/GYNs in certain instances exceed even those required of family physicians. He chose not to include that statement in his article. 
   Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care physicians because of the ``high standards'' that managed care organizations set for primary care physicians, is regrettably misleading, to say the least, and does an injustice to the true intent of my statements. 
   I personally supported then and I support now the amendment sponsored by ACOG to allow OB/GYNs to act as primary care physicians and to allow direct access for women's healthcare and did, in fact, spend a portion of this very afternoon e-mailing my senators and encouraging them to vote in support of the amendment. 
   Please contact me. I will be glad to discuss this matter with you at that time and will support any effort that you want to undertake to clarify this issue now on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes, followed by Senator GRAMM for 10. 
   The issue we are talking about is an amendment which came on the floor about 50 minutes ago. We are currently looking very carefully at that amendment. It is the first time we have seen the amendment. It comes down to a critically important issue, and that is one of scope. 
   We have a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have spent much of yesterday and the day before and this morning on what those rights should be. Are they consumer protections? Are they patient protections, gag clauses, access to specialists, access to emergency rooms, poststabilization in emergency rooms, continuity of care? We have talked about the issues of the internal and external appeals process. All are very important. 
   Now we turn to this underlying discussion of scope. We have heard again and again that our bill excludes a large number of people. No. 1, the whole information section of our bill applies to all 124 million people, the information to understand what is in that insurance policy, in that contract. 
   On the whole issue of genetic discrimination, something the other side has not even mentioned, again we apply it to all 124 million people. Why? Because it has not been adequately addressed in the United States of America today because projects such as the human genome project are just coming on line. Yet in advance we want to make sure that an insurance company does not use a predictive test in some way to either exclude somebody or raise policies. 
   No. 3, the internal and external appeals process, the whole accountability process, grievance procedures, inside, outside, applies to all 124 million people. 
   The issue which has been discussed over the last 40 to 45 minutes is that of the 48 million people who are uncovered today by State plans, cannot be regulated by State plans. It is to those 48 million people that we address the patient protections of gag clauses, access to emergency rooms, continuity of care, poststabilization in the emergency room. 
   That is the focus. In our bill, internal and external appeals covers everybody; discrimination, everybody; information, everybody; recover the uncovered, regulate the unregulated. 
   I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for laying out so well what this amendment is all about. 
   The amendment has four parts: Long-term care deductibility, which has been spelled out. The Senator from Arkansas has just laid out the second portion of this amendment on access to emergency services, something he and I have worked on very closely that I think really pulls together so much of the debate over the last 3 days and demonstrates we are working together to improve the underlying legislation as we go forward. Another demonstration of that is the third component, the access to specialists, which I will outline. Then I will turn to the Senator from Vermont to discuss the fourth component on access to obstetricians and gynecologists--again, an issue that has been on the floor again and again and again. 
   I think overall this amendment demonstrates our very sincere effort to  work together as we go forward, taking ideas, bringing ideas forward, and improving this bill as the day develops. 
   Under access to specialist, we do four things: 
   No. 1, we ensure timely access to specialty care. ``Timely" is the key word. Timely is important. I will come back to why it is important and what we do. 
   No. 2, we expand the provision to ensure access to primary care subspecialists. It is an expansion to the underlying provision, but again I think it is one that is very important to clarify the intent to which I believe both sides agree. 
   No. 3, the third component of the access to specialists is that we acknowledge, in very specific language, that a specialist could be the patient's case manager. That is important. It is very important to understand what a case manager is, and I will come back to that very briefly. 
   The fourth point I want to make in describing my aspect of this amendment is that there are concerns that referrals do not require a treatment plan to be in place. 
   No. 1, timely access to specialty care. This amendment is necessary to improve the underlying bill. It does so by requiring the plans to ensure ``timely''--it is in the bill--access in accordance with the surrounding medical circumstances in the case. That is very important. 
   It is important to me as a physician, to patients, and to doctors because the last thing in the world we want to do is have something on the books that says you have access to a specialist, which we have in our bill, but to have a plan be able to delay in some way, or say, yes, the provisions are there; we are going to work on it. So we want to put a temporal component in it to make sure you have timely access, that you can see that specialist in a timely way so you get that care when you actually need it. Therefore, we have timely access. 
   Why is it in the Patients' Bill of Rights? Basically to guarantee to the patients, to assure the patients, the plan has to respond in a way that meets the circumstances of their particular care--appendicitis, heart disease, lung disease; that they will have a timely response to that with a specialist. 
   No. 2, we expand the provision to ensure access to primary care subspecialists. Again, this is something very close to me. Again we focus on access because that is what patients want. They don't care what titles these people have, but what they say is: If I need a cardiologist, I can get to a cardiologist; I can get to a heart transplant surgeon. I want to make sure that care is there. So we remove the barriers. We do not try 
   to dump people into categories and give them labels. 
   There are some subspecialties within primary care that are actually subspecialties under primary care, and we want to make absolutely sure, because for those individuals it is critical that they are involved in chronic care--we want to make sure it is very clear. We want to reach out and expand that amendment to include that definition of specialty care to include both primary and specialty health care professionals who are appropriate to the patient's condition. If you have heart disease, it needs to be a cardiologist. If you have cancer, it needs to be an oncologist. 
   A typical example to bring this home is a cardiologist. I am a heart transplant surgeon. We also have cardiologists. I operate on patients. Cardiologists are the medical end of the study of the heart. To become a cardiologist, you go through training to become an internist, or internal medicine. Internal medicine is considered a primary care specialty. But a subspecialty of internal care medicine is cardiology. You may go for 3 or 4 years of internal medicine training, which is a primary care field; then you go ahead and do a subspecialty of internal medicine, and that is cardiology, an additional 2 or 3 years. 
   I want to make clear that we are talking about access, we are talking about the subspecialties underneath the primary care of internal medicine. This amendment ensures that access. 
   No. 3, I want to make sure, what this amendment does is it acknowledges that many times the treating specialist could be the patient's case manager, the person who is coordinating that care. Therefore, our amendment adds the words ``case manager'' where information may be required to be communicated to a patient, to a patient's primary care provider, in the creation of a whole section called Treatment Plan. Both the Democratic bill and the Republican bill have a section called Treatment Plan. This also applies to obtaining an adequate number of referrals. 
   The fourth point: The Republican bill follows the recommendation put forth by the President's own quality commission, the commission we referred back to that was in effect for about a year and produced a document. Under their section, Access To Specialists, they use the word ``authorization.'' I quote from that:  
   Authorization when required should be for an adequate number of direct access visits.  
   I wanted to actually take that language and put it in our bill.  
   Authorization when required should be for an adequate number of direct access visits.  
   Again, that is from the President's commission, his quality commission. What we have done there is follow their recommendations. What our amendment does is revise and amend and improve that recommendation to clarify that a treatment plan is not required to obtain an adequate number of referrals. 
   We need to make very clear that the treatment plan does not have to be the provision in order to get an adequate number of referrals. It is a necessary clarification because the underlying bill simply states that a plan may require the specialist to put together a treatment plan in consultation with the patient and primary care provider or case manager, but we do not require or expect that a treatment plan will be required or necessary for every patient. 
   I have spoken long enough on this whole issue of access to specialists. The timely component, the case manager component, the access to subspecialists, and adequate number of direct visits are very direct components. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. To clear this up, the three of us have had discussions. The issue in the underlying bill was not clear. The question was raised two or three nights ago by the Senator from Florida that there is a potential barrier there that we need to clarify, to make sure you can go to the closest emergency room, that there is not an economic barrier there, believing you are going to be charged more if that is an out-of-network provider or participant. 
   I agreed on the floor openly two or three nights ago. The committee report I disagree with, he disagrees with it, and Senator HUTCHINSON disagrees because it says--I don't have the exact words, but it implies they are allowed to charge more out-of-network. Therefore, agreeing with that, we have come up with this wording, which is as clear as we can make it. I want to make sure the RECORD is clear that I agree with the Senator from Florida and with Senator HUTCHINSON, and this is our best effort to be as clear as we can, and that the language in the committee report is inconsistent with the amendment on the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a number of issues have been raised again. I appreciate the debate. I think it has been very good on a number of these issues, some of which we have talked about in the past and some of which have come up on the floor. It is difficult, with the amendments being presented, to know exactly what to address and what not to address. Those of us who have been looking at this for the last year, and through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, have looked at a number of these issues. Let me comment. 
   The allegation has been made the Republican bill does not assure access to specialty care. The fact is the following: The Republican bill guarantees access to specialists. Period. Section 725 states that plans ``shall ensure access to specialty care when such care is covered under the plan.'' We brought up again and again that the problem with the Democratic bill is that it guarantees that 1 1/2 million Americans, if it were adopted, would not have any health insurance at all and, therefore, would not have access to specialty care. 
   No. 2, we have heard that under the Republican bill there is no guarantee a child with cancer will have access to a pediatric oncologist. That came up earlier in the debate. The Senator from Rhode Island brought it back up, so let me just clarify what we have done. Again, it has been a process, as we talked again and again about that. 
   The Senator from Rhode Island says we need to specifically say ``appropriate pediatric expertise.'' We talked about it in the committee. The reason we use the words ``age appropriate expertise'' instead of just pediatric, which is much more narrow than ``age appropriate expertise'' is because it includes pediatrics but it also includes a terribly important part of our population and that is the geriatric aspect of health care. 
   We are going to have a doubling of the number of seniors over the next 30 years in this country. We have to write this legislation for today and 10 years from now and 20 years from now. By using the words ``age appropriate expertise'' instead of the very narrow construction of ``appropriate pediatric expertise,'' we include the geriatrician, both of today and the future, as well as the pediatrician; on either end of the spectrum. That is the intent. That is the way it is written. That is the way it is spelled out very clearly in the committee language in the report. 
   Going through, we have heard again and again: Under the Republican bill, patients could be charged more for out-of-network specialty care, even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists. 
   Again, let me read from the committee report, on page 33, because some people have not gone back to read the original committee report which is the intent behind the language. We say:  
   ..... the committee intends that when the plan covers a benefit or service that is appropriately provided by a particular type of specialist not in the network, the benefit will be provided using the ``in-network'' cost-sharing schedule.  
   I want people to understand that. It is on page 33 of the committee report, for people to refer back to that. 
   I heard again and again: The Republican bill will not allow patients to appeal a denial of access to a specialist, to make that appeal to an independent reviewer. The fact of the matter is the Republican bill provides the right to an independent, external review by a medical expert when the access 
   to a specialist is denied on the basis that care is not medically necessary or not medically appropriate. 
   So, again, let me summarize for, I think, the Senator from Rhode Island. The ``pediatric expertise'' I have explained to be more ``age appropriate expertise.'' The Senator from North Carolina listed three gaping holes which I simply contend are not gaping holes. 
   I have not addressed one. The first was the plan can do anything to control costs. That was his point No. 1. Let me say that what we have used in the bill is, in fact, almost the exact words out of the Democratic bill. He is referring to the rule of construction under the timely access provision, section 104. Basically, we lifted--used the exact same wording as the rule of construction. It goes something like:  
   Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the coverage under a group health plan of particular benefits or services or prohibit a plan from including providers .....  
   And it goes on forward. 
   With that, I will simply refer him to the rule of construction on page 34 and 35 of their bill, of the underlying Kennedy bill, because that is where we took that rule of construction, about not requiring coverage. 
   The second so-called hole was the treatment plan issue and the limitation. Again, from your bill, if you look at page 12 where we say we require a treatment plan, your bill requires the same sort of treatment plan as what we actually required. Again, you can be critical of it in our plan, but explain why it is in your plan on page 12. 
   The third is this right to appeal. It is very important to deal with that right to appeal. Saying there is no right to appeal is, basically, absolutely false. We have obtained a legal opinion on this to make absolutely sure. If required, the treatment plan is required--what they told me, it is to be an element of medical judgment; that is, is it medically necessary or not necessary, which takes it in the realm of medical judgment. If that is the case, there can be an appropriate request for an external appeal, where you have a medical physician, independent reviewer, have the final say as to whether or not that coverage is there. 
   That is about 9 or 10 of the complaints that have been discussed over the course of the day. 
   Senator BINGAMAN mentioned cost sharing. Again, I would refer him to page 33 of the report where we talk about in-network cost sharing. 
   His second point where the specialists have to be primary care physicians, I have gone on and on about this. I just disagree. Specialists today--a heart transplant surgeon does not need to be designated a primary care physician from an access standpoint when you have removed the barriers, and that somebody does have access, as guaranteed in the bill. 
   I see there to be no reason why you designate a heart transplant surgeon to be a medical specialist. We just disagree. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. Thank you. 
   Mr. President, today we will be talking about a number of issues that have to do with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Yesterday, the discussions began on what I regard as a very significant, important piece of legislation that is called the Patients' Bill of Rights. The debates that we will be having on the floor address really two underlying bills that were introduced formally yesterday: One is the Kennedy bill from the Democratic side, and the other is the Republican leadership bill. Both bills set out to accomplish what I think we all absolutely must keep in mind as we go through this process, and that is to make sure that we are focusing on the patients in improving the quality and the access of care for those patients and at the same time help this pendulum swing back to where patients and doctors are empowered once again; not to have this be so much in favor of managed care that, when it comes down to an individual patient versus managed care on certain issues, managed care enters into this realm of practicing medicine. 
   Again, I think if we keep coming back to focusing on the individual patient, we are going to end up with a very good bill. 
   We left off last night with the discussion of the Graham amendment which focuses on emergency services. In the Republican bill, basically there are a list of patient protections which include a prohibition of gag clauses, access to medical specialists, access to an emergency room, which is the real thrust of the Graham amendment, continuity of care--a range of issues that we call patient protections. 
   A second very important part of our bill focuses on quality and how we can improve quality for all Americans. I am very excited about that aspect of the bill. We will be discussing that later this week. That is our responsibility as the Federal Government, to invest in figuring out what good quality of care actually is. It is similar to investing in the National Institutes of Health: The research behind determining where the quality is, and spreading that information around the country so that excellent quality can be practiced and people can have access to that. 
   A third component of the Republican bill which I think is, again, very important that we will keep coming back to, is the access issue, the problem of 43 million people in this country who are uninsured. Some people say: No, that is a separate issue; we can put it off for another day. 
   But when you look at patient protections, you look at quality and you look at access. It is almost like a triangle. If you push patient protections too far you end up hurting access. If you push issues beyond what is necessary, to get that balance between coordinated care and managed care and fee for service and individual physicians' and patients' rights, if you get too far out of kilter, all of a sudden premiums go sky-high. 
   When premiums go sky-high in the private sector, employers, small employers start dropping that insurance. It becomes too expensive for an individual to go out and purchase a policy, and therefore instead of having 43 million uninsured, you will have 44 million, 45 million, or 46 million, all of which is totally unacceptable. As trustees to the American people, we simply cannot let that happen. Therefore, you will hear this quality and access and patient protection discussion go on over the course of the week. 
   Last night and today over the next 45 minutes or so we will be focusing on this patient access to emergency medical care. Let me just say that I have had the opportunity to work in emergency rooms in Massachusetts for years, in California on and off for about a year and a half, in Tennessee for about 6 years, and almost a year in Southampton, England. 
   Whether it is a laceration, whether it is a sore throat, whether it is chest pain, whether it is cardiogenic shock from a heart attack, access to emergency room care is critically important to all Americans. 
   We have certain Federal legislation which guarantees that access, but it is clear there are certain barriers that are felt today by individuals that their managed care plan is not going to allow them to go to a certain emergency room or, once they go, those services are not covered. That is the gist of what we have in the Republican bill--a very strong provision for patient access to emergency medical care. 
   This Republican provision, as reported out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee where this was debated several months ago, requires group health plans, covered by the scope of our bill, to pay, without any prior authorization, for an emergency medical screening exam and stabilization of whatever that problem is--whether it is cardiogenic shock, whether it is a laceration or a broken bone or falling down the steps or a broken hip--to pay for that screening and that stabilization process with no questions asked--no authorization, no preauthorization, whether you are in the network or outside of the network. 
   The prudent layperson standard is very important for people to understand. The prudent layperson standard is at the heart of the Republican bill. We use the words ``prudent layperson.'' By prudent layperson, we define it as an individual who has an average knowledge of health and medicine. The example I have used before is, if you have a feeling in your chest, and you do not know if it is a heart attack or indigestion, and you go to the emergency room, a prudent layperson, an average person, would go to the emergency room in the event that that was a heart attack, and therefore is the standard that is at the heart of the Republican bill. 
   Now, there are two issues that need to be addressed. We talked about them a little bit yesterday. One is what happens with the  poststabilization period. You are at home. You have this feeling in your chest. You go to the emergency room. Under our bill, you are screened; you are examined. Initial treatment stabilization of that condition is given. 
   Then the question is, What happens with poststabilization? This is where I have great concern in terms of what my colleague from Florida has proposed and what is in the underlying Kennedy bill. That is, once you get in the door, you can't open that door so widely that any condition is taken care of out of network. Why? Because it blows open the whole idea of having coordinated care, having a more managed approach to the delivery of health care. 
   This is a huge door you could get into. Then, once you get into that hospital door, you might say: Well, I have a little ache over here. Can you examine that and put me through all the diagnostic tests, regardless of what my health plan says and what I have contracted with my health plan to do? 
   That is where the concern is. The issue of poststabilization needs to be addressed; we need to talk more about it. Over the course of last night and, actually, the last several weeks, we have worked very hard to look at that poststabilization period. In just a minute, I will turn the floor over to my colleague from Arkansas to talk more about that. 
   The other issue is on cost sharing. We need to make sure there is no barrier there that would prevent somebody going to the closest emergency room or the emergency room of choice. It is an issue, I believe, we, as a body, Democrat and Republican, are obligated to address, to make sure that barrier is not there --again, returning to the patient so if the patient has any question at all, they don't have to think about payment and barriers and will they turn me away or, once I get in the emergency room, will they refuse to treat, but basically can I get the necessary care. 
   That is what is in the Republican bill. I am very proud of that. Can it be improved? Let's discuss it and see if there is anything we can do to make it better. 
   That is where we were yesterday, and that is where we are this morning. We will have a number of amendments as we go forward. Right now we are on the Graham amendment on emergency services. 
   At this juncture, on the amendment, I yield the time necessary to the Senator from Arkansas.

With premiums going sky high, and you are a small employer and trying to do the very best to take care of your employees and offer them insurance and you are barely scraping by with your margins, as small businesspeople are working so hard to do, is it not correct that an 11-, 12-, 15-percent increase is enough to make you say I just cannot do it anymore?

   Mr. FRIST. Is it correct, what the CBO says, responding to, ``How will employers deal with these costs?'' Do you agree with what the CBO says:  
   Employers could respond to premium increases in a variety of ways. They could drop health insurance entirely, reduce the generosity of the benefit package......  
   I tell you, as a physician, neither of those sound very attractive to me. We have to be very careful in this body that we don't cause them to drop their insurance or decrease their benefits package. I continue back with the quote:  
   ......increase cost sharing by beneficiaries......  
   As an aside, I am not sure we want to throw that increased cost sharing on our beneficiaries unless it is absolutely necessary.  
   ......increase the employees' share of the premium. CBO assumed employers would deflect about 60 percent of the increase in premiums through these strategies.  
   Mr. President, 60 percent, that is almost unconscionable unless these mandates are entirely necessary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this Patients' Bill of Rights is critical. For us to come in and return the balance between physicians and patients in managed care--and I think managed care has gone too far--we need to absolutely make sure patients and physicians are empowered so the very best care is given to that patient. It means we in this body have to be very careful not to drive the cost just sky high, through the roof. Why? Because all the information, all the data presented to us is if we make these premiums skyrocket people are going to lose their insurance. 
   We have not talked about that very much. I mentioned it to my colleagues. Is very important to get some insurance coverage. Some coverage gets you into the door. That makes sure you have access to health care. 
   If we look at the President's own advisory commission on managed care, they were very careful to consider costs. I think we should be, just as they were, very careful. 
   This is one of their guiding principles of President Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. They basically say:  
   Costs matter ..... the commission has sought to balance the need for stronger consumer rights .....  
   As an aside, we have to do that and accomplish that in this bill we have before us this week.  
    ..... with the need to keep coverage affordable ..... Health coverage is the best consumer protection.   
   I agree with this. We need to come back to this guiding principle and consider cost. 
   We talk about the mandates. Let me say, because I mentioned the commission, we have a lot of mandates in the underlying Kennedy bill. I think we need to go through and see what other people have said about these mandates; are they necessary? Because we know unlimited mandates imposed on insurance companies, States, individuals, if they are not necessary, are going to drive costs up and decrease access. If we look at the Democratic mandates--and I just put a few on here to see whether or not President Clinton's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality recommended them--you will find the following. 
   Under a medical necessities definition, something we will be debating over the next couple of days: Rejected under the President's commission. 
   Under the health plan liability, coming back to bringing the lawyers into the emergency room and suing everyone: Rejected; mandatory repeal of standardized data, rejected by President Clinton's commission; State-run ombudsman program, rejected by the President's commission; restriction on provider financial incentives, rejected by the President's commission. All of these are mandates in the Kennedy bill today, all of 
   which were rejected by the President's own commission. 
   Rules for utilization review, section 115 in S. 6, the Kennedy bill: Rejected by the commission. Provider nondiscrimination based on licensure, rejected by the commission. 
   The point is not so much each of these and the sections I have enumerated here, 151, 302, 112, 151. The point is, in this body, as we go forward, we have to be very careful in all of the rhetoric and all of our commitment and all of our hard work, legitimately, on both sides, to protect patients. We have to be very careful not to go too far out of good intentions, to the point that it is unnecessary, if they do not need those rights, and it also drives the cost up. 
   So when you go through the Kennedy bill and see these mandates, President Clinton's own Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality looked at them, considered them, but rejected them. 
   Why? I cannot tell you for sure why because I was not in the room, but I think it comes back to the amendment we are talking about today and to what they have actually said in their guiding principles: Costs do matter.  
   The commission has sought to balance the need for stronger consumer rights----  
   Just as we are in our Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus bill----  
   with the need to keep coverage affordable....... Health coverage is the best consumer protection.  
   I look back at Tennessee. Looking at the uninsured and the costs associated with the underlying Kennedy bill, the number in Tennessee that we throw to the ranks of the uninsured would be 20,872. Again, we talked about the 1.8 million nationwide. Look to our own individual States.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will close simply by saying I am very glad this amendment was brought to the floor because very early on it says this debate is more, it is in addition to just patient protections. Why? Because the ultimate patient protection means you get good quality of care and you have access to that care. So over the next several days our primary objective is to increase that quality of care, strong patient protections, but do all that without hurting people, without throwing them to the ranks of the uninsured. 
   That is our challenge. That is why I am very proud of our underlying Republican bill and look forward to supporting it and gathering more support as we go over the next several days. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to return to the underlying amendment. It has taken me a while to read through the amendment. The first time I saw the amendment was 30 minutes ago. I have just read through the amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY and others which relates to certain breast cancer treatment and access to appropriate obstetrical and gynecological care. 
   I apologize for not being able to participate directly on in this issue earlier. At the outset, I will say that about 2 years ago, Senator Bradley from New Jersey and I had the opportunity to participate in writing an amendment that actually 
   eventually became law which addressed the issue of postmaternity stay, postdelivery stay. We wrote that particular piece of legislation because we felt strongly that managed care had gone too far in dictating how long people stayed in the hospital and pushing them out after deliveries, and it was a little controversial, although I think a very good bill for the time, because it sent a message very loudly and clearly to the managed care industry that you need to leave those decisions, as much as possible, at the local level where physicians and patients, in consultation with each other, determine that type of care. 
   The amendment on the floor is different in that it focuses on another aspect of women's care and that is breast cancer treatment. As to the debate from the other side of the aisle, I agree with 98 percent of what was said in terms of the importance of having a woman be able to access her obstetrician and gynecologist in an appropriate manner, the need for looking at inpatient care, to some extent as it relates to breast disease. Yet I think the approach that Senator KENNEDY and others have put on the floor is a good start but has several problems. Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to vote against that amendment, with the understanding we can take the good efforts from that amendment, correct the deficiencies, and address the very same issues that have been identified so eloquently by my colleagues across the aisle. 
   Now, in looking at the Kennedy-Robb amendment, on page 2, they talk about:  
   ......health insurance coverage, that provides medical and surgical benefits shall ensure that inpatient coverage with respect to the treatment of breast cancer is provided for a period of time as is determined by the attending physician, in his or her professional judgment.......  
   So far, I agree wholeheartedly. But where I cannot vote in good conscience, or allow my colleagues to, without fully understanding the implications, is where they continue and say:  
   ......consistent with generally accepted medical standards, and the patient, to be medically appropriate following--(A) a mastectomy; (B) a lumpectomy; or (C) a lymph node dissection.  
   I agree with all of that and inpatient care. The part that bothers me is the ``consistent with generally accepted medical standards.'' This goes into the debate we will go into tomorrow, or the next day, on medical necessity and what medical necessity means. 
   When we talk about what is medically appropriate and medically necessary, you are going to hear me say again and again that we should not try to put that into law, Federal statute. We should not define ``medical necessity'' as generally accepted medical practices or standards. The reason is, as exemplified in this chart, nobody can define generally accepted medical standards. You will go up to a physician and a physician will say: That is what I do every day. 
   Well, that is not much of a definition, I don't think. Therefore, I am not sure we should use those terms and put them into a law and pass it as an amendment and make it part of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   This chart is a chart that shows the significant variation of the way medicine is practiced today, and that generally accepted medical standards has such huge variations that the definition means nothing. Therefore, I am not going to put into a Federal statute a definition that means very little because I think, downstream, that can cause some harm because maybe a bunch of bureaucrats will try to give that definition.

   Mr. FRIST. I think that is right. My colleague said it much more clearly than I. The definition itself of ``medically necessary and appropriate'' is so important that we should not lock the definition into something that is so  small, so rigid, that we can't take into consideration the new advances that are coming along. That is why when we say generally accepted medical standards or practices, it leaves out the best evidence, the new types of discoveries that are coming on line. That decision should be made locally and should not be definitions put into a statute. Therefore, I am going to oppose this amendment.

<DOCNO>106-frist-tn-4-19990713</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. I will not yield. 
   Let me go through for my colleagues why the variation in medical practice has implications that may be unintended and therefore we cannot let the amendment pass. 
   Reviewing regional medical variations for breast-sparing surgery--basically for breast cancer today--I don't want to categorize this too much because the indications change a little bit. In a lumpectomy--taking out the lump itself and radiating because it is the least disfiguring--the outcome is equally good as doing a mastectomy and taking off the whole breast. 
   In my training--not that long ago, 25 years--the only treatment was mastectomy. As we learned more and more and radiation therapy became more powerful, we began to understand there are synergies in doing surgical operations and radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We didn't have to remove or disfigure the whole breast. The new therapy ended up being better for the patient but was not generally accepted medically. That sort of variation is shown in this chart. 
   In this chart, the very dark areas use lumpectomy versus mastectomy. Comparing the two, the high ratio of around 20 to 50 percent, versus going down to the light colors on the chart where this procedure is not used very much, there is tremendous variation. The different patterns of color on the chart demonstrate that a procedure generally accepted in one part of the country may be very different in another part of the country. 
   For example, in South Dakota, using this ratio of lumpectomy versus mastectomy, the ratio is only 1.4 percent. 
   In Paterson, NJ, the generally accepted medical standards in that community go up almost fortyfold to 37.8 percent--the relative use of one procedure, an older procedure, versus a newer procedure. 
   Which of those are generally accepted medical standards? That shows the definition itself has such huge variation that we have to be very careful when putting it into Federal statute. We will come back to that because it is a fundamentally important issue. Medicine is practiced differently around the country. Therefore, the words ``generally accepted medical standards'' have huge variations. We have to be careful what we write into law. 
   What I am about to say builds on the work of Senators SNOWE and ABRAHAM. 
   How much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FRIST. Again, Senators SNOWE and ABRAHAM will talk more about this a little bit later. 
   Instead of using language such as ``generally accepted medical standards,'' it has a built-in inherent danger because it defines what ``medical necessity and appropriate'' are. 
   We should be looking at words as follows: That provides a group health plan and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage, that provides medical and surgical benefits, shall ensure that inpatient coverage--just like the Kennedy-Robb amendment with respect to the treatment of breast cancer--is provided for a period of time as determined by the attending physician, as the Kennedy-Robb amendment does, in consultation 
   with the patient. I think this is ``in consultation with the patient.'' 
   No, they do not have in their bill ``in consultation with the patient.'' I suggest ``in consultation with the patient'' should be part of their amendment. 
   We would put in ``in consultation with the patient'' to be ``medically necessary and appropriate,'' instead of using their words ``generally accepted medical standards,'' which has such huge variation. 
   Why not use the better terminology, ``medically necessary and appropriate''? 
   Use the same indications. Mastectomy is what we will propose, what they propose. Lumpectomy is what we propose, what they will propose. Lymph node dissection, we will use that language. 
   But ``generally accepted medical standards'' is dangerous. We ought to use such words as ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' Then we are not locked into the variation where there is a fortyfold difference in mastectomies versus lumpectomy, which shows the importance of being very careful before placing Federal definitions of what is ``medically necessary and appropriate'' in Federal law.

   Mr. FRIST. In the Kennedy-Robb amendment is the issue of access. 
   Again, my colleagues on the other side hit it right on the head: Women today want to have access to their obstetrician. They don't want to go through gatekeepers to have to get to their obstetrician or gynecologist. That relationship is very special and very important when we are talking about women's health and women's diseases. 
   In the Kennedy-Robb amendment, the language is that the plan or insurer shall permit such an individual who is a female to designate a participating physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as the individual's primary care provider. 
   It is true that in our underlying bill we don't say the plan has to say that all obstetricians and gynecologists are primary care providers. That is exactly right. The reasons for that are manyfold. 
   Let me share with Members what one person told me. Dr. Robert Yelverton, chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Primary Care Committee, stated:  
   The vast majority of OB/GYNs in this country have opted to remain as specialists rather than act as primary care physicians.  
   He attributes this to the high standards that health plans have for primary care physicians, saying:  
   None of us could really qualify as primary care physicians under most of the plans, and most OB/GYNs would have to go back to school for a year or more to do so.  
   You can argue whether that is good or bad, but it shows that automatically taking specialists and making them primary 
   care physicians and putting it in Federal statute is a little bit like taking BILL FRIST, heart and lung transplant surgeon, and saying: You ought to take care of all of the primary care of anybody who walks into your office.

   Mr. FRIST. I simply want the courtesy of completing my statement. I know people want to jump in and ask questions, but we have listened to the other side for 50 minutes on this very topic. I am trying to use our time in an instructive manner, point by point, if people could just wait a bit and allow me to get through my initial presentation of why I think this amendment must be defeated with a very good alternative. 
   I want to get into this issue of access to obstetricians and gynecologists. In our bill that has been introduced, we take care of this. I believe strongly we take care of it. We say, in section 723: The plan shall waive the referral requirement in the case of a female participant or beneficiary who seeks coverage for routine obstetrical care or routine gynecological care. 
   We are talking about routine women's health issues. We waive the referral process. There is not a gatekeeper. A patient goes straight to their obstetrician and gynecologist. That is what women tell me they want in terms of access to that particular specialized, trained individual.  
   It is written in our bill. Let me read what is in our bill.  
   The plan shall waive the referring requirement in the case of a female participant or beneficiary who seeks routine obstetrical care or routine gynecological care.  
   Therefore, I think the access provisions in the Kennedy-Robb amendment are unnecessary and are addressed in our underlying bill. Plus, they go one step further in saying that this specialist is the individual's primary care provider. I am just not sure of the total implications of that, especially after an obstetrician who is the chairman of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology very clearly states that merely assuming that a specialist is a good primary care physician is not necessarily correct. 
   Also, in our bill, beyond the routine care--this is in section 725 of our bill where we address access to specialists--we say:  
   A group health plan other than a fully insured health plan shall ensure that participants and beneficiaries have access to specialty care when such care is covered under the plan.  
   So they have access to specialty care when obstetrics care and gynecological care is part of that plan. 
   So both here and in the earlier provision of section 723, where we talk about routine obstetrical care, there is no gatekeeper; there is no barrier; a woman can go directly to her obstetrician and her gynecologist, which is what they want. Or, if you fall into the specialty category in provision 725, you have access to specialty care when such care is covered under the plan. 
   As I go through the Kennedy-Robb plan, and this is obviously the amendment that we are debating on the floor, there are a number of very reasonable issues in there. Again, I think the intent of the amendment is very good. I do notice secondary consultations in the amendment. I think, as we address the issue of women's health, obstetrical care, breast cancer treatment, access to appropriate care, which we plan on addressing and we will address, I believe, this is the amendment Senators SNOWE and ABRAHAM have been working on so diligently, the idea of secondary consultations. 
   About 2 months ago we did a women's health conference. It was wonderful. It was in Memphis, TN. It was on women's health issues. Maybe 200 or 300 people attended, focusing on women's health issues. We talked about the range of issues, whether it was breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis, diseases of the aging process, but an issue which came up was the issue of secondary consultations. Because it is dealing with something that is very personal to them, women say: Is there any way we can reach out in some way with health plans to lower the barriers for us to get a second opinion? 
   Why is that important? Part of that is important because of this huge variation. If you go to one doctor and he says do a mastectomy, which is very disfiguring, it is very clearly indicated--there are clear-cut indications for mastectomy or lumpectomy today. If you hear two different versions, you may want to get a secondary opinion or a secondary consultation. 
   What we are looking at in that regard is language similar to this: to provide coverage with respect to medical and surgical services provided in relation to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer shall ensure that full coverage is provided for secondary consultations by specialists in the appropriate medical fields. 
   ``Medical fields,'' I think we need to go a little bit further and focus on whether it is pathology or radiology or oncology or surgery to confirm--and I think it should be part of the language--to confirm or to refute the diagnosis itself. That is full coverage by the plan for secondary consultations for cancer as it deals with women's health issues. 
   I think that will be an important part to include as we address this very specific field. It is totally absent in the Kennedy-Robb amendment. I propose offering an amendment which does much of what they say in terms of inpatient care, changing this terminology from ``generally accepted medical standards,'' which I think is potentially dangerous, and move on to the language which I think should be used, which is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' 
   The access issue, I believe, we have developed. There are other issues in the bill that I will work with Senators ABRAHAM and SNOWE to address, in a systematically and well-thought-out way, so we can do what is best for women in this treatment of cancer, breast cancer, mastectomy, and access to obstetricians and gynecologists. That is something about which we need to ensure that no managed care plan says: No, you cannot go see your obstetrician; or, no, you cannot go see your gynecologist; or, no, you have to hop through a barrier; or, no, you have to go see a gatekeeper before you can see your obstetrician/gynecologist. We are going to stop that practice, and we are going to stop that in the Republican bill we put forward. 
   I have introduced the concept today--again, it is very important--of medical necessity and how we define what is medically necessary and appropriate. It is something critical. It is something we are going to come back to. I think with all the issues we are discussing, if we try to put in Federal law, Federal statute, a definition of what is medically necessary and appropriate instead of leaving it up to a physician who is trained in the field, a specialist, we are going in the wrong direction and have the potential for broadly harming people. 
   I urge defeat of this amendment with the understanding we are going to come back and very specifically address the issues I have talked about today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine. 
   My amendment is pending. I will review where we are today. My amendment does two things. No. 1, it strikes certain provisions that we believe will be harmful to the quality of health care, and it goes back to medical necessity and defining medical necessity in Federal statute. We will come back and talk about that. My colleagues will talk further about that shortly. We also strike certain provisions that will increase cost and ultimately reduce access to health insurance coverage. Again, people have heard me again and again going back to the patients. We can simply not do anything. I believe it diminishes quality and at the same time diminishes access to make ourselves feel good. 
   Now, what we have done, we struck that and we replaced that part of the bill--the accountability provisions, the provisions on internal appeal, on external appeal, the issues we have been talking about in the last 15 or 20 minutes--although there is a lot of misconception that we need to straighten out before we actually vote on this bill, because the internal appeals process and external appeals process, which in many ways are the heart of the Patients' Bill of Rights bill, are important to ensure that patients do get the medical care they need and ensure that  ultimately it is physicians, not trial lawyers, not bureaucrats, who make the coverage decisions regarding medical necessity. That is what this amendment is all about. I want to steer the discussion right there. 
   To simplify things, so we will know how the process works, if you are a doctor and you are a patient, and you say that a particular procedure should be covered, and your plan for some reason says no, well, you need an appeals process if that is what you really believe is appropriate to get that sort of care. What you do under our bill is go to an internal appeals process and work through. That is something in the managed care network. It might be going to another physician within the network. It is a process that has to be set up by each and every managed care plan. 
   That is what we call an internal appeals process. 
   The bill on the other side of the aisle also had an internal appeals process. If the doctor and patient and the managed care internally could not come to an agreement after going through a specified process, at that point the doctor and patient can go outside the plan. This is where the accountability is so important: Should my plan cover what is medically necessary and appropriate? Outside the external appeals process is where much of the discussion has taken place. 
   Our bill has that final decision of whether or not something is covered, whether or not it is medically necessary or appropriate, made by a medical specialist--these are words actually in the bill--independent medical specialist, physician making the final decision, not some bureaucrat, not some health care plan, not some trial lawyer. An independent medical specialist is making the final decision in this external process. 
   Mr. President, 20 minutes ago we had discussed that the external reviewer has to be independent--it is written into the bill that way--has to be a medical person from the same field, a specialist, if necessary. Are they part of the Health Maintenance Organization? Does the Health Maintenance Organization actually hire that person to make a decision? 
   We have not talked about what our bill does. Our bill says in this external review process there has to be a designated entity. Nobody has talked about that today. Words such as ``unbiased, external entity'' are in the bill. This unbiased entity is regulated by either the Secretary of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC, by the Federal Government, or by the State government. They regulate that entity, not the plan itself. 
   What about the independent reviewer? Where do they come from? The impression which I have heard again and again is the independent reviewer has ties to the medical care plan and will give a biased view. No; the independent medical specialist making the binding final decision is appointed by the third party entity--not the plan itself but this third party entity regulated by the Federal Government, State government, or signed off for by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This independence from plan to entity has to be unbiased. That is No. 1, to assure independence. 
   No. 2, the entity is regulated by the Federal Government or the State government or the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
   No. 3, it is written in the bill that that entity does the appointment of the independent medical specialist who makes the final decision. 
   What information does that medical specialist use to make the final decision? We don't limit the information. In fact, we encourage them to consider all information. It is very specifically written in the bill that the ``independent medical specialist will make an independent determination based on the valid relevant scientific and clinical evidence to determine the medical necessity, appropriateness, experimental or investigational nature of the proposed treatment.'' They will take into consideration ``all appropriate and available information, including any evidence-based decisionmaking or clinical practice guidelines.'' 
   The point is this external review person is independent and separate from the entity and separate from the HMO. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when our Founding Fathers began their fight for our Nation's independence, they had a vision of what America would be like. They saw a free and self-reliant people, ruled by State and local governments, who took responsibility for their own welfare and progress, and cared for themselves and for others in their own communities. 
   When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America almost a century later, that is what he saw. He later wrote that, In America, when a citizen saw a problem that needed solving, he would cross the street and discuss it with a neighbor, together the neighbors would form a committee, and before long the problem would be solved. ``You may not believe this,'' he said, ``but not a single bureaucrat would ever have been involved.'' 
   While today our citizens are increasingly ruled, not by local governments, but by Washington, the essence of what it means to be an American has not changed: We are a people willing to lend a hand, lift a spirit, and work together to make our land a better place. 
   For 50 years, the All-America City Awards have designated--from among all the cities in America--10 communities that have carried on this time-honored tradition and kept the spirit of America alive. And I'm proud to say that among this year's winners is Tri-Cities, TN-VA, a place our founding fathers would recognize as a fulfillment of their vision of what a free people, living and working together, can accomplish. 
   Among the criteria by which all participants were judged were citizen involvement, effective government performance, philanthropic and volunteer resources, a strong capacity for cooperation, and community vision and pride. And, Tri-Cities--the first-ever region to be so honored by this award--possesses those qualities in spades. 
   Included in the presentation which tipped the judges' decision in their favor were their efforts to involve youth in the decision-making process; improve health care in isolated communities and create an interest in rural medicine among future physicians; and celebrate and preserve the Appalachian region's oral and musical traditions. And they did it all without government handouts or mandates from Washington. Their message, set to the sound of bluegrass music: we are willing to work; we are willing to lead. 
   I think the song, written by a local storyteller and sung by all the Tri-Cities delegates, says it all: 
 If you call, we will answer; If you need us, we will come. We'll lend a hand--there's strength in numbers; If we work together, we can get it done.  
   Mr. President, on behalf of all the people of Tennessee, and all Americans everywhere, I congratulate the citizens of Tri-Cities, Tennessee-Virginia for their accomplishment. Not only they, but all of us, are winners because of their efforts.

   Mr. FRIST. Let me just say at the outset that I, for one, am very glad that we are on this bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a bill that is terribly important to the American people. All of us know, as we conduct our town meetings around our various States, that we have a real problem today in that today's problem is reflected in the feeling of helplessness by patients, helplessness by physicians, helplessness by other providers when it comes to managed care. There are reasons for that. 
   As my colleagues know, I am a physician and was involved in the practice of medicine and training for about 20 years where every day--before coming to this body--I took care of many patients, thousands of patients, 
   well over 10,000 patients, and the changes have been tremendous over the last 20 years as we look at how health care is delivered and the reasons for it. 
   Right now our society, our country is caught up in a rapidly changing health care system. In all those changes and in that evolution, many challenges have been introduced. Part of our responsibility as Senators, as trustees to the American people, is to make sure that we very gently, but in many ways very firmly, make sure these challenges are faced in a systematic way, such that a patient--again, I come back to patients. We are going to hear about cost and about managed care companies and health maintenance organizations and trial lawyers and costs going up and big budgets. I hope throughout this week we will come back again and again to patients. Patients have to be at the center of this debate. 
   When we talk about patients, we are talking about a Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill of rights that patients can expect when they are dealing with the health care system and with managed care and with HMOs. We also need to be talking about the quality of care that is delivered. We need to be talking about access and not ever forget about the 43 million people who don't have health insurance. 
   For the most part, people say: Well, let's deal with the people who have insurance, group health insurance with managed care plans. Let's make sure their rights are protected. In doing that, let's not forget that there is a whole group of people over here, 43 million people--too many people, inexcusable, I feel--who don't have any health insurance at all, making sure that when we fight for the rights of the people who do have health insurance, we don't want to drive more people to the ranks of the uninsured, who don't even have insurance in the first place. 
   When we talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights, whether it is the gag clause or access to specialists or scope of the plan, let's not forget that we are talking about individual patients. In trying to get rights to one segment, let's not go so far or too far in all the anger that we feel against managed care that it drives up the ranks of the uninsured. 
   Why is this access issue important? We know--studies document it again and again--that in America, if you have some health care insurance, the health care system does open up to you broadly. If you have no health care insurance at all, it is less likely that that health care system will open up to you broadly. So the last thing I think we want to do in this body is take rights to such an extreme that we drive up the number of uninsured, recognizing that access is a huge problem, a huge challenge for our country. 
   When I first started 20 years ago in the field of medicine, it was very different. The practice of medicine was basically straight out fee for service. Very few physicians were in groups. They were practicing by themselves. They had full autonomy. They were making a very good living, basically went to medical school and worked very hard. They had professional ethics of ``do no harm,'' all of which continues today, except the system around them has changed dramatically. Managed care 20 years ago was tiny. Today, managed care, coordinated care, health maintenance organizations, if you look  at the overall, nongovernment 
   coverage is the majority of care that we give. And as a product of that, we have this pendulum which has swung back and forth over time. It is true--that is why we are debating this bill today--there is no question that that pendulum has swung way over towards managed care and away from individual patients, individual people who need that care, who will go to bed tonight worried that if they have a heart attack tomorrow, will they be taken care of appropriately, will they have access to the emergency room, will they have access to the appropriate specialist. That is where this whole Patients' Bill of Rights comes in because over the last 5 years or 10 years that pendulum has swung way in the favor of managed care. 
   Now, I believe we are going to hear a discussion over the next week of how we can best get that pendulum back to the middle and have that balance between patients and physicians on the one hand and managed care on the other. 
   One of the objectives I would like to see as we go forward in a very rational way, after we cut away all the rhetoric, going at each other and the hot debate, is to come back and say: Let's keep our eye on the ball. The ball is the patient who is in this system of managed care, and not physicians and trial lawyers and lawsuits, and make sure we say that they are going to get the very best care. If anything is going to happen to them, they know they will have certain rights in this evolving, changing world. 
   It has gotten to the point that it is not just anecdotal, but some managed care, some health maintenance organizations have garnered so much power, so much control that they have abused the system. The whole accusation that some HMOs are in the business of practicing medicine is hard to argue against. I think one of our objectives needs to be to make sure that we don't have insurance companies or managed care companies or HMOs practicing medicine. In other words, get that pendulum back to that patient, to that decisionmaking through that doctor-patient relationship. 
   On the other hand, I think it is irrational to assume that we will go back 20 years and not have managed care, not have coordinated care, not have health maintenance organizations. That being the reality, we want to have a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that looks to those patient protections that empower the patient, empower the American citizen, empower the physician and bring that pendulum back over to that doctor-patient relationship, to keep the patient in charge. 
   We have on the floor now a Democratic bill, a Republican leadership bill, and we have one amendment talking about the scope. We will need to come back to talk a little bit more about scope because it is one of the important issues where there is a sharp dividing line. We will hear words like ``medical necessity,'' the issue of scope, of medical specialists, but amidst all of that, let's come back to the patient. 
   Let me speak to what is in the Bill of Rights Plus Act, which is the Republican bill which is now on the floor, in terms of scope. Scope really means who is being covered. Does this bill cover just a targeted population, the whole population, a part of the population? You can almost look at it as a pie chart in your mind. 
   There are a number of provisions in each of these bills. 
   You have to go through each of the provisions when you are talking about scope. 
   When we talk about the issue of comparative information in the Republican leadership bill, all group health plans would be required to provide a wide range of comparative information about health insurance coverage so that the individual patient knows what is covered and what is not covered, what that relationship is, what they have actually signed, what that contract is about, what the network descriptions are, what the cost-sharing information is. The scope is complete, all 124 million people in the Republican bill are covered by that particular provision, the information. 
   When we look at what I think is fundamentally the most important mechanism by which we are fixing the system, getting that pendulum back over in the middle between managed care and the patients and the physicians, it is the whole process of accountability, the grievance and appeals process, the internal review process, the external review process. Over the next 4 days, we will be talking a lot about how these appeal processes work. 
   If you look at the way health care is delivered, I do believe this is one of most important provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights. Both bills address grievance and appeals, but I want to make it very clear, in terms of the Republican bill, that the scope is complete, with all 124 million Americans covered. The scope is complete. All group health plans would be required to have written grievance procedures and have an internal review process. So if you have a patient who disagrees with the coverage from the plan, or a doctor and a patient who disagree with a plan, they will have someplace to go in an internal review process. If they don't like what the internal review process says, if there is disagreement on coverage between the doctor, the patient, and the plan, they can go outside the system to an external review process. 
   Now, what I like very much about our plan, which I think is very important, is that our external review process has a physician in charge. It is not an insurance company; it is not a trial lawyer; it is not a bureaucrat. It is a medical--I will use the word--``specialist,'' if necessary, in that field who is independent of the doctor, the patient, and the plan. 
   Remember, that external appeals process all started with a disagreement on coverage; you have gone through the internal appeals process, and now you are outside. You go through an external appeals process and that person also is independent. 
   So we have an internal appeals process, and then we have an external appeals process, where you have an independent physician reviewing the coverage and making the decision. In addition, that independent medical expert makes the final decision on coverage--not a trial lawyer somewhere, not a court, not a lawsuit, but an independent medical specialist makes the final decision on coverage. That decision is binding; it is binding on the plan. 
   Therefore, we aim at the heart of what I think is broken today; that is, if there is some sort of disagreement, if the 
   managed care is taking advantage in some shape or form of an individual patient or individual physician, we have an independent medical expert making the final decision, not some statute written here in the Congress, not some definition that we try to give it if we try to define ``medical necessity'' in statute, but somebody who is independent and outside of the system. 
   I mention that because when we are talking about scope, all 124 million people in plans are covered, not a segment. It has nothing to do with ERISA, and non-ERISA, and State-regulated, and Federal-regulated. All 124 million Americans are covered by both self-insured and fully insured group health plans. All 124 million Americans are in there. 
   Again, when we talk of scope and about the information components of our bill, everybody is covered. What I think is much of the heart and guts of this bill is the accountability provisions, the accountability of managed care, the accountability of coordinated care. Everybody is covered, all 124 million people. 
   Now, in our bill, we also have an important component on genetic information. As we all know, the human genome project has been tremendously successful. We have 2 billion bits of information coming out in the next several years and, with that, we raise the potential for insurance companies, or managed care companies, to use that information to discriminate against a patient. In other words, if a patient had a test, and there was an 80-percent chance that a patient would develop cancer, and that information were to get out, an insurance company might say: We are not going to insure you. That is interesting information so we are going to raise your rates. 
   We are not going to let that happen. That provision in our bill--which is not in the Democrats' bill--basically covers everybody. Scope is complete. 
   Now, the one area where scope is targeted in a particular area is what we call the consumer protections, patient protections. That is the gag clause, the access to specialists, the prudent layperson access to emergency rooms, and the continuity of care.  
   Mr. President, do we have 1 minute remaining?

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a number of issues on the floor today--the underlying bill that has been introduced and a substitute bill. We have talked some about scope today. Now we are talking about emergency services. I think it is important that people understand that both of the underlying bills do have parts which address this access to emergency medical care. It is absolutely critical that over the course of today and on future amendments on emergency care we appropriately address a bill of rights that does have a real impact because there is no way we can responsibly leave this debate without addressing the fear, the fear which is supported by anecdote--I do not know how big of a problem it is, but it is a fear and that means we have to deal with it and we should deal with it--of having a heart attack or chest pain or laceration or broken arm or a sick child and going to an emergency room, and in some way, for some reason, having that care denied or be channeled to emergency rooms that are across town, all of the sorts of things that are truly frightening and are really unconscionable. Therefore, it needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed well. 
   The amendment today brings up an issue of poststabilization, which I think needs to be addressed, and I will carefully look at the amendment. 
   Poststabilization is a point after which you have gone to the emergency room, gone through screening, and gone through treatment. Then what happens? Again, it looks at a more complete picture, and we need to make sure what we ultimately pass several days from now addresses that adequately and appropriately, given the  realities of the managed care, coordinated care, and fee-for-service system. 
   Let me briefly comment on what is in our Republican bill. This was discussed in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We talked about emergency access, and we talked about some of the other issues as it went through the committee. 
   What passed out of committee, and is before this body, is as follows: We require group health plans that are covered by the scope of the bill--and the issue of scope has come forward--to pay, without any sort of prior authorization, for an emergency medical screening exam. If you go to the emergency room, that exam, using a prudent layperson standard, which has just been discussed--meaning, if you are at a restaurant and you have chest pain, you think it might be a heart attack, you know it is an emergency or you feel it is an emergency, and you go to the emergency room. They say it is indigestion, not a heart attack; therefore, they are not going to cover it. The prudent layperson --that is, the average person in terms of medical knowledge in America today--says there is no way I am going to know if it is an emergency or not, if it is serious or not. We reach out, using the prudent layperson standard, and cover that individual. 
   You would not have to have prior authorization. That would be for an emergency medical screening exam and any additional emergency care that is required to stabilize that condition. 
   Stabilization is difficult. As a physician, when I think of stabilization, because I am a heart surgeon, I think of heart failure and blood pressure, going into shock, and all sorts of bad things happening overall. Stabilization might also mean if you have a broken arm or if you have a laceration. The definitions are important as we go forward.

   Mr. FRIST. Let me finish walking through what is in the Republican proposal first. 
   The stabilization end of it is important. I mention that because we are talking about a period of poststabilization--after you are stabilized. Again, the Republican bill covers, through the screening and stabilization process, using that prudent layperson standard. 
   We define in our bill what a prudent layperson is, and that is an individual who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. I think that is as good a definition as one can generate, and the concept of prudent layperson I believe is accepted by both sides. 
   As to the cost-sharing aspect, again looking at what is in the Republican bill which was introduced earlier today, plans may impose cost sharing on emergency services, but the cost-sharing requirement cannot be greater for out-of-network or out-of-plan emergency services than for in-network services. That is very important, because I have heard several people allege, no, you can charge anything, you can charge much higher than what in-network cost sharing is, and that is simply not true in the Republican bill. 
   An individual who has sought emergency services from a nonparticipating provider or nonparticipating hospital or nonparticipating emergency physician cannot be held liable for charges beyond that which the individual would have had to pay if that physician were a member of that particular coordinated care plan or managed care plan or health maintenance organization. 
   The important points are basically that you do not need prior authorization. It does not matter whether or not that facility is part of that plan or that HMO's network itself. So you can go to the nearest hospital if, using that prudent layperson standard, you have a concern that you have something that does need to be treated and treated very quickly. 
   The prudent layperson would expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in some sort of jeopardy to the individual's health or serious impairment--again referring back to that standard--or serious dysfunction of their body. Again, it is very difficult in terms of covering the overall realm. 
   The poststabilization period: What happens after you go to the nearest emergency room, using that prudent layperson standard, not having to pay anything beyond what you would have to pay if you had gone to a facility in that network, you have had the screening exam and you have had that stabilization or that initial treatment. 
   Poststabilization introduces: What if you are there and you had this chest pain and you found out it was just 
   indigestion, but while you were there in that poststabilization period, the physicians find a spot on the chest x-ray that you need to rule out as lung cancer, or you have cholecystitis or right quadrant pain, and with a quick exam it is pretty clear another medical problem has been picked up. Does that fall into that poststabilization period? And, if so, does that treatment continue over time? 
   Those are the questions we need to debate, we need to look at. We need to make sure we do not open the door so broadly that somebody basically goes to an emergency room with a complaint and it is taken care of, but 10 other complaints are found and that is an excuse to get all your care outside of that network simply because that might potentially circumvent the whole point of having care coordinated and to have a management aspect of coordinated care. 
   Over the debate, as it continues tonight and in the morning, the poststabilization period is an important period we need to address. We do not want to create any huge loopholes through which people can slide. I am going to keep coming back to again and again that we have to do what is best for the individual patient, and we have to keep our focus on the patient, and we do not want to do anything that exorbitantly increases cost if it is unnecessary, if it is wasteful, because if we do that, we increasingly, by an increase in premiums--somebody is going to have to pay for it--drive people to the ranks of the uninsured. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FRIST. The question is, in essence, what I said earlier about the differential cost sharing; if you go back and look at the committee report, if you go to an emergency room, you can be charged out-of-network rates instead of in-network cost sharing. I do not have that report language before me right now, but if that is what is in the committee report, that is unacceptable to me. That is something that I am willing to work on in terms of the amendment process over the next several days because there is no question  in my mind as to the cost-sharing requirement, when you go into an emergency room, that you have to remove all barriers, that you can go to the closest emergency room, and that that cost-sharing requirement cannot be exaggerated or elevated to an out-of-network rate as we go forward. 
   I will work with you in terms of this whole issue that the cost-sharing requirement cannot be greater for out-of-network emergency services than for in-network services. That is a barrier that should not be there.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just respond that I hope in my earlier comments in what I was saying about poststa-bilization--although I have not seen the wording of the amendment, but I know from committee that the Senator is committed to this--in the poststabilization end of things, in terms of how far in the process of prudent layperson recognition, the presentation to the emergency room of your choice, the cost-sharing arrangement we talked about, the medical screening, the stabilization, the poststabilization period, I, again, want to work with the Senator as we go forward. 
   I have to say it is a very complex issue as to how you trade back into the network, how you do that notification process. I worked in emergency rooms. I have been there. I worked for years in emergency rooms. 
   When somebody comes in, the last thing you want to be thinking about is a lot of phone calls and calling networks--should we or should we not take care of that individual patient? On the other hand, after things settle down and you take care of the emergency in the emergency room, you have the heart going, you have resuscitated them, then at some point in time they have to make their entrance back into the coordinated care plan. 
   So we have to be careful about poststabilization--at an appropriate time--but, again, doing what is right for the patient. So those two issues--the cost sharing and the poststabilization--I am committed to working with the Senator over the next several days. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Citizen Congress Act, a bill which will end the five greatest perks and privileges which separate the Members of Congress from the American people, and which will eliminate taxpayer-funded financial incentives which encourage Members to become life-long legislators. In the past two Congresses, I have introduced a more broad version of this legislation. However, in the next two years, I want to focus on removing the top five taxpayer-funded financial incentives which encourage Senators and Representatives to remain in office as career politicians. I believe that the elimination of these five special privileges will return Congress to the institution our fore-fathers established. 
   As we approach the two-hundred and twenty-third anniversary of the founding of our great country, we should remember that our Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress of citizen legislators who would leave their families and communities for a short time to write legislation and pass laws, and then return home to live under those laws they helped to pass. Unfortunately, we have stayed from that vision. With the passage of the Congressional Accountability Act four years ago, we made the first step towards ensuring that Members of Congress abide by the same laws as everyone else. In spite of this measure, Members of Congress continue to receive special perks and privileges unavailable to most American citizens. While I support term limits for Members of Congress, and I remain committed to passing a term limits amendment to the Constitution, there are other more immediate actions we can take to restore faith in Congress. 
   The legislation I introduce today represents an achievable step toward making Congress more accountable and responsible to the American people. The Citizen Congress Act will eliminate the five greatest financial incentives for Members to become life-long legislators, and will put them on equal footing with the majority of Americans. The provisions of this legislation include: Eliminate the taxpayer subsidy element of Congressional pensions; require public disclosure of Congressional pensions; eliminate automatic COLA's for Congressional pensions; eliminate automatic COLA's for Congressional pay; and require a roll call vote on all Congressional pay increases. 
   Eliminating the taxpayer subsidy of Congressional pensions and reforming the overall Congressional pension system represents a remarkable improvement. With the Citizen Congress Act, Senators and Representatives will no longer be eligible for pensions that far exceed what is available in the private sector and are padded with matching taxpayer dollars. Instead, Members will have access to the same plans as other federal employees and private citizens,  with no taxpayer subsidy. This will ensure that Members who serve in Congress for many years do not accumulate multi-million dollar pensions at the public's expense. Automatic cost of living adjustments for Congressional pensions are also eliminated in this bill. Additionally, requiring a public roll call vote on pay increases ensures that Members of Congress do not vote themselves a pay increase in the dead of night, as has been the case many, many times in the past. 
   At a time when everyone is tightening their belts to maintain fiscal responsibility and restore confidence in our government, it is only fitting that Members of Congress eliminate the perks and privileges which separate them from the American people. This is what Tennesseans tell me when I travel across our state, and that is what I am doing with the Citizen Congress Act. I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation and bringing Congress another step closer to the American people.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is important to view this amendment in the greater context of the current humanitarian situation in southern Sudan. 
   The situation is dire, to say the least: the famine of last year took the lives of hundreds of thousands as flights of relief were banned by Khartoum from large areas outside their control, an act which triggered famine and starvation. The regime in Khartoum is allowed to halt U.N. relief flights at will because of the terms of the 1989 agreement which establish Operation Lifeline Sudan--the U.N. relief organization. As I noted in an op-ed in The Washington Post on July 19, 1998, the ``practice starves combatants and noncombatants alike and compromises the integrity and effectiveness of relief groups desperately trying to fend off famine.''

   Mr. FRIST. The Government of Sudan continues to prosecute the war against the south, including the bombing of hospitals and churches, and a campaign of terror, including slavery. Nearly 2 million have died since 1983, with over 4 million displaced from their homes. 
   In January of last year, I worked in southern Sudan as a medical missionary, in areas outside of government control, and in ``hospitals'' and clinics where I treated people who had never seen a doctor. What I saw was the product of an indiscriminate and savage war. 
   Since that time I have worked with other Senators, relief organizations, and the administration in trying to make our humanitarian policy as effective as it possibly can be. It must be a policy which does more than meet the immediate food needs of those who hover on the brink of starvation. It must be a policy which seeks to eliminate the root causes. The inability of the populations in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan to protect themselves is at the root of  their vulnerability to starvation and famine. 
   That is not a politically or logistically easy task. It does not have a single solution which can simply be enacted. It requires that we constantly push the policy to adapt and become more effective, rather than simply become an amount for which we simply write a check each fiscal year. This amendment does not represent the solution to the root causes of the human tragedy in Sudan, but it is one critical piece which we must consider. 
   The authorization in this amendment will open this issue and place it at the top of the list of issues which we continue to work through with the administration. That process of Congress and the administration jointly working on a more effective Sudan policy has had its moments of disagreement, but it has been largely productive and one where our shared goals have never been compromised. 
   Additionally, it is worth noting that, beyond the traditional chiefdoms, the groups designated in this amendment are really the only organizations functioning in areas outside of the control of the government of Sudan. As a consequence, these are the only organizations which are defending these populations against the heinous attacks by the Government of Sudan and, increasingly, by irregular or paramilitary organizations sponsored by Khartoum--including slaving parties. 
   The more than 1 million dollars' worth of relief distributed in Sudan on a daily basis is done so in such a way that it is purposefully steered away from combatants. From the relief organizations' view point, that is essential to maintain some level of insulation from the political aspects of the war. They see themselves as strictly humanitarian organizations. 
   However, from a practical standpoint, that practice has an unintended, but not surprising consequence. Because the members of the resistance groups have to eat too--for they suffer from starvation as much as women and children--they regularly divert food donations to their own use. 
   Possibly more important than that is the effect on these organizations themselves and their ability to provide protection for the populations they defend. Because their food supply is erratic and dependent on diversions of other aid, they are often forced to demobilize to either collect food on their own, to steal food, or to leave to plant their crops. The practical effect of that is that they cannot stay mobilized and cannot provide any reliable or cohesive defense. 
   It is important to remember then that this amendment should not be seen as a reward to the resistance groups. Yet I remind my colleagues that they are the only line of defense between those people and the regime in Khartoum which seeks to subdue or exterminate them in a sustained effort of low-level ethnic cleansing. 
   The timing of presenting this authority to the President is critically important. The government of Sudan is poised to begin receiving billions of dollars in hard currency from the sale of newly exploited oil in contested areas. The regime in Khartoum has repeatedly and publically said their intention is to convert that hard currency straight into an renewed effort to subdue or eradicate the people in areas outside their control. The ability of the resistance groups to stay mobilized and coherent is arguably more important now than since the beginning of the war. A predictable supply of food is the key to realizing that defense. Again, more so than the weapons Khartoum is purchasing or receiving from the outside world, it is food which most devastating. 
   Besides the obvious human cost of an ineffective defense against Khartoum and their proxies, is the potential cost to the renewed effort to bring the combatants into an effective peace process. As I noted in a further piece in The Washington Post, we must use all available tools to bring the combatants to the table.

   Mr. FRIST. The most important tool to bring them to the table is to continue to highlight the fact that neither side will win this war outright on the battlefield. If Khartoum believes they can not win the war on the battlefield because of their new found source of hard currency, they have absolutely no reason to come to the table and work for real peace. Short of military intervention on our own, the best way we can disabuse them of that notion and continue to press them to commit to a peace process is to clearly eliminate the greatest weaknesses which they will exploit. The greatest weakness is not so much the southern Sudanese's vulnerability to attack, but their inability to defend. That inability is not caused by a lack of weaponry, but a lack of calories.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator DOMENICI and I introduced the Education Express Act (Ed-Express). This legislation builds on the success of the Ed-Flex bill, which earlier this year passed the Senate and House of Representatives by overwhelming margins, and was signed into law in April. 
   It is critical that this Congress builds on Ed-Flex's themes of flexibility and accountability. As we consider the Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we must continue the push to cut red tape and remove overly-prescriptive federal mandates on federal education funding. At the same time, we must hold states and local schools accountable for increasing student achievement. 
   Flexibility, combined with accountability, must be our objective. The end result of our reform effort must spark innovation--innovation designed to provide all students a world-class education. 
   This need for flexibility and accountability in education was repeated again and again in hearings held by the Senate Budget Committee's Task Force on Education. The Task Force, on which Senator DOMENICI serves as an Ex-officio member, and I serve as the chairman, issued a report entitled ``Prospects for Reform: The State of Education and the Federal Role.'' 
   In this report the Task Force made several recommendations of ways to improve the federal education effort. The number one recommendation noted, ``In light of the continuing proliferation of federal categorical programs, the Task Force recommends that federal education programs be consolidated. This effort should include reorganization at the federal level, and block grants for the states. The Task Force particularly favors providing states flexibility to consolidate all federal funds into an integrated state strategic plan to achieve national educational objectives for which the state would be held accountable.'' 
   The Ed-Express bill is the legislative response to this recommendation. Specifically, $37 billion over the next five years would be provided from the federal government as part of a larger consolidation of duplicative and limiting categorical programs into a much more streamlined and direct funding stream to states and localities for a variety of education purposes. 
   We have a national emergency in education. To address this crisis, the federal government will commit additional resources for a five-year period in order to improve student achievement and the quality of our teaching force. 
   This would infuse significant funds to the hands of parents, communities, and local/State governments to improve the education achievement of students. 
   Under this plan, States may elect to receive elementary and secondary education funding by ``Direct Check.'' Incentives such as replacing existing burdensome federal categorical programs are provided to encourage States to choose the direct check option. A State, however, may choose to remain in the categorical system. 
   In the spirit of Ed-Flex, this legislation that we introduced also looks to the Governors for leadership. States which opt for the Direct Check Flexibility will receive their education funding upon the adoption of a State plan written by the governor that outlines the goals and objectives for the funds. 
   The Nation's governors are leading the way for education reform in this country. It was the Nation's Governors who helped bring about the successful passage of Ed-Flex. We at the Federal level must do all we can to advance the reform efforts taking place at the State and local levels. 
   Ed-Express establishes a Challenge Fund, a Teacher Quality Fund, and an Academic Opportunity Fund. 
   Challenge Funds would be provided to States and localities with the flexibility to design and implement programs to improve student learning. These funds may be used to purchase new books, hire teachers, promote character education, provide tutoring services for students, and for a variety of other education initiatives. 
   Teacher Quality Funds may be used for such activities as providing professional development opportunities for teachers, merit pay, increasing teachers' salaries, and alternative certification programs. 
   Academic Opportunity Funds may be used to provide governors who choose the Direct Check option with the ability to reward school districts and schools that meet or exceed state-defined goals and performance objectives for student achievement and teacher quality. 
   The need for a consolidated Federal education effort has never been greater. I think that we are all familiar with the statistics that show our students are not able to keep up academically with their international counterparts. In fact, the longer a student stays in an American school the more his/her academic skills deteriorate. We must draw  upon innovative methods to correct this problem so that our children will be able to compete in the global economy. 
   As a scientist, I know the value of looking for new ways to solve problems, and America has long had a proud tradition to innovation. Ed-Express will create a whole new generation of inventors in the field of education--in particular, Governors, local school boards, teachers, and parents will be better able to put good ideas into practice.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there has been a lot of misinformation and I am sure a lot of confusion on the part of many because of allegations that have gone back and forth because of the rhetoric, so I think I will use my few minutes to outline what is in the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act; that is, the Republican leadership bill we have been discussing for the last several days. 
   I am very proud of the bill we have put forward. I am proud of it as a physician, as a member of the task force that helped put this bill together, and as a Senator, because I believe with passage of this bill we can do what I think everybody in the body wants to do, and that is to improve the quality of care for individuals across this country, their children, and on into the next generation. 
   The bill we put forward has really six major components with three objectives. The three objectives are to enhance health care quality, to enhance access, and to provide consumer protections. We do that through six components. 
   First, as the Senator from Maine has just gone through, strong consumer protection standards. The second way of achieving that is that we offer good, comparative information among plans, at a time when it is very confusing to the beneficiary, to the individual patient, what plan offers what, and what benefits are covered. 
   Third--and I am proud of this--we have a strong internal, and even more important, I believe, external appeals process establishing these rights for 124 million people. We are talking about scope in a lot of these discussions, but let's remember this applies to 124 million Americans who are covered both by the self-insured and fully insured group health plans. 
   Fourth, we have in our bill a ban on the use of genetic information by insurance companies for underwriting purposes. It is very important, as we look at the human genome project, which is producing 2 billion bits of information, all of which can be to the benefit of mankind if it is used appropriately. 
   Fifth, we have a quality focus in our bill which is lacking in other bills and other proposals. We have expanded quality research activities through the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. We address issues of access. This is in contrast to the bill on the other side, because we have a major problem in this country today of about 41 million people who are uninsured. You are not going to find this Senator voting for a bill that drives people to the ranks of the uninsured and expands that 41 million to 42 million. 
   As my colleague from Maine just pointed out, every 1-percent increase in premiums drives about 300,000 people to the ranks of the uninsured. I doubt one will find very many Senators on our side in favor of increasing that number of uninsured. 
   We addressed the issue of access through two means: No. 1 is medical savings accounts expansion, and No. 2 is to have availability of a full deduction for health insurance benefits for the self-employed. 
   As the Senator from Maine pointed out, States already regulate insured health plans. Thus, our bill addresses the unprotected with the protections. We do it through emergency care. A prudent layperson, somebody in a restaurant has some chest pain--is it indigestion or a heart attack? You go to the emergency room and are reimbursed, because a prudent layperson standard is used and, therefore, that service is covered. 
   Choice of plans: In our bill, we make sure those plans that offer network-only plans are required to offer what is called point-of-service options. 
   Consumer protections: Obstetricians, gynecologists, pediatricians--we have heard these words used a lot. Who are these physicians? Do you have access? Under our bill, health plans would be required to allow direct access to obstetricians, to gynecologists, and to pediatricians for routine care without referrals, without gatekeepers. 
   Continuity of care: Under our bill, plans that terminate or nonrenew doctors or providers from their networks would allow continued use of the provider for up to 90 days or, if someone is pregnant, up through the postpartum period. 
   Access to medication: We all know that formularies are used increasingly by people broadly because of the cost of prescription drugs. In our plan, we make sure physicians and providers and people with clinical experience are on those boards that put together these formularies. In our bill, we make sure that nonformulary alternatives are available when medically necessary and when appropriate. Physicians, pharmacists, not just bureaucrats, will be putting these formularies together. 
   Access to specialists: I am a heart and lung transplant surgeon. I have had the opportunity to transplant hundreds of hearts and lungs and do hundreds of heart operations, and I know the importance of access to a specialist. Under our bill, health plans would be required to ensure that patients have access to covered speciality care within the network or, if necessary, provide that access through contractual relationships if heart surgeon BILL FRIST happens not to be inside that network. 
   Gag rules: We all know that physicians should not have gags placed on them when they talk to patients. We have a strong gag rule prohibition in our bill. No more gag rules. 
   A second approach is that we require comparative information be given to individuals so they can compare one plan to another so they will know what services are covered and what services are not. 
   I mentioned grievance and appeals. All group health plans would be required to have written grievance procedures and have both an internal appeals process as well as an external appeals process if there is some disagreement as to what is covered and what is not covered. 
   Timeframes--we address it in our bill. Expedited 
   requests for care, if there is any question of jeopardizing the patient's health, is allowed. 
   Qualification of reviewers: This is a significant improvement in our bill compared to last year. We make absolutely sure that an appropriately qualified external reviewer; that is, a provider who has expertise in the field where there is some question. If it is a question about heart surgery, you have a heart surgeon, somebody familiar to heart surgery as the reviewer. The external appeals process is, I believe, greatly strengthened by having this independent--and those are the words we use--``external medical reviewer where necessary.'' 
   We allow in those cases where a treatment is considered experimental that that also can be handled in this external review process. We require that external reviewer to have ``relevant expertise.'' 
   My time is just about out. There are three other issues. 
   Genetic information: Our bill recognizes that ``predictive genetic information'' can be used against you by an insurance company, either raising premiums or denying coverage. We prohibit it. 
   Our bill focuses on quality improvement by taking the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and focusing on health service delivery and training scientists, providing information systems to improve quality, and, lastly, our bill invests in the infrastructure necessary to measure quality. 
   Medical savings accounts and full health insurance deduction for the self-employed are a part of our bill. 
   That is our bill in a nutshell. It looks at consumer standards. It looks at improved quality, it looks at improved access. It is a bill of which I am proud. It is a bill I know all of us can support. It is a bill that will improve health care in the United States of America. 
   Mr. President, I yield back my time.

   Mr. FRIST. 
   Mr. President, this year 37,000 American men will die, and 179,300 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Cancer of the prostate grows slowly, without symptoms, and thus is often undetected until in its most advanced and incurable stage. It is critical that men are aware of the risk of prostate cancer and take steps to ensure early detection. 
   While the average age of a man diagnosed with prostate cancer is 66, the chance of developing prostate cancer rises dramatically with age--which makes it important for men to be screened or consult their healthcare professional. The American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association recommend that men over 50 receive both an annual physical exam and a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test. African-American men, who are at higher risk, and men with a family history of prostate cancer should begin yearly screening at age 40. 
   Even if the blood test is positive, however, it does not mean that a man definitely has prostate cancer. In fact, only 25 percent of men with positive PSAs do. Further testing is needed to determine if cancer is actually present. Once the cancer is diagnosed, treatment options vary according to the individual. In elderly men, for example, the cancer may be especially slow growing and may not spread to other parts of the body. In those cases, treatment of the prostate may not be necessary, and physicians often monitor the cancer with follow-up examinations. 
   Unfortunately, preventive risk factors for prostate cancer are currently unknown and the effective measures to prevent this disease have not been determined. In addition, scientific evidence is insufficient to determine if screening for prostate cancer reduces deaths or if treatment of disease at an early stage is more effective than no treatment in prolonging a person's life. Currently, health practitioners cannot accurately determine which cancer will progress to become clinically significant and which will not. Thus, screening and testing for early detection of prostate cancer should be discussed between a man and his healthcare practitioners. 
   In an effort to help address the serious issues of prostate cancer screening, to increase awareness and surveillance of prostate cancer, and to unlock the current mysteries of prostate cancer through research, I rise to introduce the ``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act.'' 
   The ``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act'' expands the authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry-out activities related to prostate cancer screening and overall awareness and surveillance of the disease and extends the authority of the National Institutes of Health to conduct basic and clinical research in combating prostate cancer. 
   The bill directs the CDC to make grants to States and local health departments to increase awareness, surveillance, information dissemination regarding prostate cancer, and to examine the scientific evidence regarding screening for prostate cancer. The main focus is to comprehensively evaluate of the effectiveness of various screening strategies for prostate cancer and the establishment of a public information and education program about the issues regarding prostate cancer. The CDC will also strengthen and improve surveillance on the incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer with a major focus on increasing the understanding of the greater risk of this disease in African-American men. 
   The bill also reauthorizes the authority of the CDC to conduct a prostate screening program upon consultation with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and professional organizations regarding the scientific issues regarding prostate cancer screening. The screening program, when implemented, will provide grants to States and local health departments to screen men for prostate cancer with priority given to low income men and African-American men. In addition the screening program will provide referrals for medical treatment of those screened and ensure appropriate follow up services including case management. 
   Finally, to continue the investment in medical research, the bill extends the authority of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health to conduct and support research to expand the understanding of the cause of, and find a cure for, prostate cancer. Activities authorized include basic research concerning the etiology and causes of prostate cancer, and clinical research concerning the causes, prevention, detection and treatment of prostate cancer. 
   Mr. President, as we celebrate Father's Day this weekend, I hope that we  take time to reflect on the serious health threat of prostate cancer. It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the ``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act,'' so that we can further understand the issues surrounding this disease and continue to move forward on developing effective treatment and finding a cure.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we honor our fathers, grandfathers and husbands this Fathers' Day, it is important to recognize the crisis that is taking place with regard to men's health. As highlighted by National Men's Health Week, which ends on Fathers' Day, this crisis in the health and well-being of American men is ongoing, increasing, and predominantly silent. 
   National Men's Health Week, which was established in 1994 under the leadership of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, has helped shed light on some of the primary factors that have lead to this steady deterioration: lack of awareness, inadequate health education, and culturally-induced behavior patterns at work and at home. 
   Many have rightly argued, that one main cause is the cultural message that men should not react to pain. Men continue to fear the risk of appearing unmanly, or merely mortal, if they change their behavior or their environment. Unfortunately that includes visits to the doctor. On average, women on average make 6.5 visits per year while men average 4.9. 
   This lack of attention to health is perhaps best demonstrated by male mortality figures. In 1920, the life expectancy of men and women was roughly the same. Since that time, however, the life expectancy of men has steadily dropped when compared to women. In 1990, life expectancy for women was 78.8 years but only 71.8 years for men. Today, the life expectancy of men is a full 10 percent below that of women. 
   Another indicator: men have a higher death rate for every one of the top 10 leading causes of death. Men are twice as likely to die of heart disease, the nation's leading killer. In fact, one in every five men will suffer a heart attack before age 65. 
   Male specific cancers, testicular and prostate, and other non-gender specific cancers have also reached epidemic proportions among men. One in six will develop prostate cancer at some point in his life, and African-American men are especially at risk, with a death rate that is twice the rate of white men. 
   Death by suicide and violence is another predominantly male phenomenon. Men are the victims of approximately three out of four homicides, and account for approximately four out of every five deaths by suicide. Workplace accidents are also a major killer. Ninety-eight percent of all employees in the 10 most dangerous jobs are men, and 94 percent of all those who die in the workplace are men. 
   As demonstrated by the events this week on Capitol Hill--like the health screenings for prostate and colorectal cancer hosted by the Men's Health Network--National Men's Health Week has done much to end the silence surrounding the real state of health of American men. But much more needs to be done. This Fathers' Day let us all do everything we can to silence as well the cultural mind set that has claimed  the lives of so many of our husbands, fathers, and brothers. Let's show them how much we truly love them by making them aware of the very real--and very preventable--dangers that await them if they fail to pay attention to their health.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on March 9th of this year, 105 students--out of 80,000 applicants nationwide--were selected to receive the prestigious Horatio Alger Award, an honor bestowed each year on students and adults who excel despite significant adversity. 
   One of those recipients was Leslie Jones, a 16-year-old student from White Station High School in Memphis, Tennessee who, despite brain surgery to remove a tumor and medical complications that damaged her vision and rendered her facial muscles incapable of managing even a smile, will nevertheless graduate with her class this year--with honors. Her high school was also recognized as a Horatio Alger School of Excellence. 
   Despite physical setbacks that kept her from attending classes, Leslie used a homebound teacher to keep up with her studies. When her eyes crossed and refused to cooperate, she--as her teacher described it--``just covered one eye with her palm and continued on.'' When asked if the homework was too much, Leslie never once said yes, even when some work had to be done over because faulty vision caused her to miss some lines on the page. 
   In the essay which helped her win the competition over tens of thousands of others, Leslie wrote that despite the pity, the lack of understanding, and even the alienation of other people, she never once lost faith in her own ability to focus on her goals. ``In my heart,'' she said, ``I know my dreams are greater than the forces of adversity and I trust that, by the way of hope and fortitude, I shall make these dreams a reality.'' 
   And so she has. Yet, what is perhaps even more remarkable than the courage and determination with which she pursued her dreams, is the humility with which she has accepted her hard-earned reward. 
   When 1,900 students gathered to honor her achievement, she downplayed her accomplishment saying instead that everyone possesses the same ability to rise above adversity. Rather than dwell on her medical problems, she insists that they don't define who she is. 
   Emphasizing the power of positive thinking, the Italian author, Dr. Piero Ferrucci, once observed, ``How often--even before we begin--have we declared a task `impossible'? How often have we construed a picture of ourselves as inadequate? A great deal depends upon the thought patterns we choose and on the persistence with which we affirm them.'' 
   Mr. President, Leslie Jones stands as a testament to the truth of those words just as surely as White Station High School proves that public institutions committed to helping students achieve can be a major influence in helping them shape a positive future for themselves and others. Both the school, and especially the student, deserve our admiration, our praise, and our thanks--all of which I enthusiastically extend on behalf of all the people of Tennessee and, indeed, all Americans everywhere.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment is meant to assist the men and women serving in our armed forces in attaining an education. This amendment is targeted at a group serving in our military that has been forgotten since the passage of the Montgomery GI Bill. 
   Before the GI Bill was enacted in 1985, new servicemen were invited to participate in a program called the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program or VEAP. This program offered only a modest return on the service member's investment and, as a consequence, provided little assistance to men and women in the armed services who wanted to pursue additional education. It was and is inferior to the Montgomery GI Bill that every new serviceman is offered today. 
   My amendment would allow active duty members of the armed services who entered the service after December 31, 1976 and before July 1, 1985 and who are or were otherwise eligible for the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program to participate in the Montgomery GI bill. This group of military professionals largely consists of the mid-career and senior noncommissioned officer ranks of our services--the exact group that new recruits have as mentors and leaders. 
   If we really believe in the importance of providing our service men and women with the education opportunities afforded by the Montgomery GI bill, it is critical that we offer all service members the opportunity to participate if they choose. 
   It is important to remember that much of the impetus for the creation of the Montgomery GI Bill was that the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program was not doing the job. It was not providing sufficient assistance for young men and women to go to college. It was expensive for them to participate, and provided little incentive for young men and women to enter the military. 
   The Montgomery GI Bill offers those serving in the military a significant increase in benefits over its predecessor and has been one of the most important recruiting tools over the last decade. It is essential that active military still covered under VEAP but not by the Montgomery GI Bill be brought into the fold. 
   The injustice that my bill attempts to address is that new recruits are eligible for a better education program than the noncommissioned officers responsible for their training and well-being. Expanding Montgomery Bill eligibility to those currently eligible for VEAP would, in many cases, help mid-career and senior noncommissioned officers, who are the backbone of our force and set the example for younger troops, become better educated. This legislation is modest in its scope and approach, but is enormously important for the individual attempting to better himself through education. 
   Moreover, this legislation sends a meaningful message to those serving to protect the American interest that Congress cares. S. 4, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airman, and Marines Bill of Rights Act which I was proud to cosponsor was an enormous step in this direction, and my legislation complements that effort. 
   Some of the common sense provisions of this amendment are: 
   1. Regardless of previous enrollment or disenrollment in the VEAP, active military personnel may choose to participate in the GI Bill. 
   2. Participation for VEAP-eligible members in the GI Bill is to be based on the same ``buy in requirements'' as are currently applicable to any new GI Bill participant. For example, an active duty member is required to pay $100 a month for twelve months in order to be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill. The same would be required of someone previously eligible for VEAP. 
   3. Any active duty member who has previously declined participation in the GI bill may also participate. 
   4. There will be a one year period of eligibility for enrollment. 
   I believe that if we are to maintain the best trained, and most capable military force in the world, we must be committed to allowing the people that comprise our armed forces to pursue further education opportunities. I believe that the modest amendment will have a positive effect on morale and give our noncommissioned officers additional opportunities for self-improvement and life-long learning. I ask for my colleagues support in this effort. thank you Mr. President.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator COLLINS in introducing S. 1123, the Imported Food Safety Act of 1999. This legislation will address a growing problem that affects everyone in this nation, the safety of the food that we eat. 
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates as many as 9,100 deaths are attributed to foodborne illness each year in the United States. In addition there are tens of millions of cases of foodborne illness that occur, the majority of which go unreported due to the fact that they are not severe enough to warrant medical attention. 
   The legislation that Senator COLLINS and I have crafted will target one of the most critical areas in helping to provide Americans with the safest food possible--the safety of imported food. The CDC has recognized that as trade and economic development increases, the globalization of food supplies is likely to have an increasing impact on foodborne illnesses. 
   Currently, one-half of all the seafood and one-third of all the fresh fruit consumed in the U.S. comes from overseas. In fact, since the 1980's food imports to the U.S. have doubled, but federal inspections by Food and Drug Administration have dropped by 50 percent. 
   Over the years there have been foodborne pathogen outbreaks involving raspberries from Guatemala, strawberries from Mexico, scallions, parsley and cantaloupes from Mexico, carrots from Peru, coconut milk from Thailand, canned mushrooms from China and others. These outbreaks have serious consequences. The Mexican frozen strawberries I have just noted were distributed in the school lunch programs in several states, including my home state of Tennessee, were attributed to causing an outbreak of Hepatitis A in March of 1997. 
   The Collins-Frist bill will do several vital things to safeguard against potentially dangerous imported food. The bill would allow the U.S. Customs Service, using a system established by FDA, to deny entry of imported food that has been associated with repeated and separate events of foodborne disease. 
   The bill would also allow the FDA to require food being imported by entities with a history of import violations to be held in a secure storage facility pending FDA approval and Customs release. 
   To improve the surveillance of imported food, we authorize CDC to enter into cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance to the States to conduct additional surveillance and studies to address critical questions for the prevention and control of foodborne diseases associated with imported food, and authorize CDC to conduct applied research to develop new or improved diagnostic tests for emerging foodborne pathogens in human specimens, food, and relevant environmental samples. 
   These are just a few of the many provisions in this bill that will help improve the quality and safety of the imported food that we consume every day. I applaud the leadership of my colleague, Senator COLLINS, who as Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held 4 comprehensive hearings last year on the issue of food safety. As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health, I look forward to working with Senator COLLINS and the rest of my colleagues on the issue of food safety and our overall efforts in improving our Nation's public health infrastructure. We must continue to fight infectious diseases and ensure that this legislation is enacted to help protect our citizens and provide them with the healthiest food possible.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
   This will be the last few minutes that I have to speak on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment and, thus, I want to, for the sake of my colleagues and others who are listening, explain what the amendment is about. 
   This amendment is very simple. It is about two things: No. 1, the safety of all students; and No. 2, equal treatment of children. 
   I have a letter from the National School Boards Association. As most people know, it represents 95,000 local school board members. 
   I will read from the first paragraph of the letter:  
   On behalf of the Nation's 95,000 local school board members, the National School Boards Association urges you to support the Frist-Ashcroft amendment to S. 254 that would enhance the safety of all students from gun violence. The amendment provides school officials with the discretion to suspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in the same manner as other students in cases where they bring firearms to school.  
   My colleagues, this amendment is about the safety of all students and the equal treatment of children. 
   Yesterday, we had a very good debate, I thought, on the substance of the amendment. I gave my remarks yesterday, and I wish to also refer today to some statistics that I obtained not too long ago from my own county, Davidson County. 
   For the 1997-1998 school year there were eight children in my home county who brought either a gun or a bomb to school, eight in that 1 year. Of those eight, six were special education students. What happened? The two who were not special education students, because of the zero tolerance policy in Tennessee, were expelled. They were out for the remainder of the year. 
   Of the six special education students, three were back in class. These are individuals who brought a bomb or a gun into the classroom already. 
   Three of them were kept out of school. Why? Because their disability and bringing a gun to school were unrelated. But three of the eight had this manifestation process, and because of the disability, they were treated in a special way and allowed back into the classroom. 
   Yesterday I was caught a little off guard, and I do not like that, I really do not like that. And I do not think the  Senator from Iowa meant to say what he said. But he said those statistics don't count. And then I said, well, let's look at 1999, He said, no those statistics don't count. And I said Why? And he said basically because the regulations just came out and we fixed that loophole. 
   That bothered me, so what I did was go back and call to see really when this law took place, the law that is operating today. I found something very different, exactly the opposite of what the Senator from Iowa told all of his colleagues. And I want to straighten that out for the RECORD. It is very, very important. 
   The Senator from Iowa argued yesterday that the statistics where individuals with disabilities ended up back in the classroom within 45 days of having brought a gun to the schoolroom don't apply and that loophole had been fixed. I found something very, very different. 
   In fact, the IDEA amendments of 1997 were signed into law on June 4, 1997. The Senator from Iowa and I were both there. It was a good day. We were both there. Yes, the regulations were written. And it really took too long, they just came out a few months ago. The implication yesterday by the Senator from Iowa was that they were written only recently and, therefore, so they could not apply. 
   In looking a little closer, the IDEA amendments were signed into law on June 4, 1997. And on June 4, 1997, section 615, the discipline provisions, went into effect that day. So every statistic that I have given for the last 2 years shows repetitively individuals with disabilities, because of this special treatment, it is not their fault, it is the fault of the law that they are ending up back in the classroom. These are individuals who brought a gun or a bomb to school. 
   Again, I was very disappointed, because again and again he said on the floor yesterday and I went back to the RECORD again last night and found that the Senator from Iowa said: ``I say to the Senator from Tennessee, that the school he is talking about was still operating under the old system.'' 
   Not true. Not true. We talked to the director of high schools for Nashville, Davidson County, and the director stated very specifically that every school in the Davidson County was operating under the IDEA amendments of 1997 under advisement of their lawyers. In fact, let me read from the bill that we signed last year. The 1997-1998 school year applied on June 4. 
   This is from the bill that we signed on a great day, on June 4, 1997. It says: ``Effective dates, these shall take effect upon enactment of this act,'' on that day in June 1997. 
   So all the statistics of eight individuals were relevant. Two were expelled because they did not have a disability and of the six who had a disability, three were back in the classroom within 45 days. That is the loophole. Why am I concerned? Just because somebody has not been killed yet because of this loophole, I am not going to wait around until somebody has been killed. I want to prevent that from happening. This amendment is about the safety of all students and to have all students treated fairly. 
   The amendment closes the loophole that I just pointed out. I have demonstrated factually it is occurring in this legislation. So I want to dismiss all of the arguments the Senator from Iowa made yesterday when he said it is not a problem. 
   This amendment will, in its ultimate passage, end the mixed message that the Federal Government, that we in this body, send to American students on the issue of guns in school. 
   Under IDEA, a student with a disability who is in possession of a firearm at school is treated differently from anybody else. Our amendment says very simply that if you bring a gun or a firearm to the school, you, as a student, are going to be treated the same, and you are going to be treated by the local principal or other authorities in the school. 
   Our amendment allows principals or other qualified school personnel the flexibility to treat every student who brings a gun or a firearm or a bomb into the classroom the very same. 
   Our amendment does not enforce any sort of uniform policy. We might like to think that we in Washington can set good school policy, but this shows how dangerous that can be by trying to set a uniform policy here for some subset of students.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the amendment is a simple amendment: Equal treatment for each and every student who brings a firearm, a gun or bomb, to school. It is an amendment which will have an impact, I believe, help individuals in terms of safety in our schools. 
   The amendment closes a loophole, a loophole that I have definitively demonstrated does occur in our schools. If a student brings a gun to school, they, if our amendment is agreed to, will be treated the same regardless of their educational status.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are returning to an amendment that was offered at the end of last week, which is a very simple amendment as written. It addresses a fundamental issue that is at the heart of the juvenile justice issue and discussion in the last week. It has to do with bombs and guns in schools. It is as simple as that. 
   It addresses the issue of how to make our schools as safe as we possibly can. We start with, I believe, the juvenile justice bill which has made real progress but absolutely to my mind must include an amendment that addresses this issue of guns in schools and bombs in schools in an area where we, because of previous legislation that we passed, have created a loophole that means that a student coming into a school who has a firearm may be treated very differently from a student who comes in the next day to that school with a firearm. The goal of our amendment is that any child who comes into a school with a gun or a bomb will be treated equally, will be treated fairly, will not be discriminated against one way or another. 
   Our amendment ends a mixed message that the Federal Government today, because of legislation we passed, sends to American students on the issue of firearms in schools. ``Firearms,'' for the purpose of this amendment, are bombs and guns in schools. 
   We look at Littleton, CO, with 15 dead and 23 wounded. We look at Pearl, MS, with 2 dead and 7 wounded; Paducah, KY, 3 dead, 5 wounded; Jonesboro, AR, 5 dead, 10 wounded; Springfield, OR, 2 dead, 22 wounded. 
   These are all shootings, horrific shootings. They claimed the lives of 27 students and teachers. Thus, we come back to this simple amendment which closes a loophole that we created that has to do with guns and bombs and firearms in schools. 
   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a law which I have strongly supported, and I have worked very, very hard in the past two Congresses to improve, to modernize, to strengthen. Under that act, a student with a disability who is in possession of a gun or a firearm at school is treated differently than a student who is not disabled or who is not in special education. 
   Again, it goes back to that fundamental issue of one child in a special education class who brings a gun or a bomb to school is treated preferentially compared to another child who does not have a disability or is not in special education who brings a gun or a bomb to school. 
   All of us represent States and have our own constituency. Therefore, I look at my home State of Tennessee. The Individual with Disabilities Education Act conflicts with our zero tolerance law which says that students may be expelled for 1 year if they bring a bomb or a gun or a firearm to school. That is zero tolerance. It is the law of the land in Tennessee. Yet, we have passed in this body Federal legislation which says there is a certain group of students, about 14 percent of students in the State of Tennessee, to whom that does not apply. We have a whole different set of standards. What our amendment does is it says, no, if you bring a bomb or a gun to school, you are going to be treated like every other student. 
   Under IDEA, local school authorities have several hoops to remove a dangerous special education student who brings a gun into the classroom. School personnel may suspend the child for up to 10 days. School personnel may place the child in an interim alternative educational setting for 45 days. School personnel may ask a hearing officer to place a child in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if it is proven that that child is a threat to others in his current placement. School personnel may conduct a manifestation determination review to determine whether or not there is a link between that child's disability and walking into the room with a gun or a bomb. 
   If the behavior is not a manifestation of that disability, the child may be expelled but is still given educational services. If 
   the hearing officer determines that the behavior of bringing that gun into the classroom was a manifestation of the disability, the student can go right back into that school, right back into that current placement, and that is the problem. Let me repeat. If the hearing officer determines that the behavior of bringing a gun into the classroom was a manifestation of the disability, the student can go back into the classroom. 
   People say that does not happen. It does happen. In my own State of Tennessee, in Nashville, just over a 1-year period, there were eight students who brought guns into school who were caught and of those eight, six were in special education. Three of those six, it was found that bringing a gun into the school was a manifestation of their disability and, therefore, they ended up back in the classroom. Students who were not in special education were expelled under the law under which 86 percent of the other students fall. 
   Clearly, the way we have set up this federally mandated disciplinary procedure with this loophole sends students a mixed message about guns in our schools. It basically says if you are in special education, you are going to be treated in a special way if you bring a gun into school, but if you are not in special education, you are going to be treated like everybody else and you are going to be expelled. What a mixed message when we are talking about guns. When we are talking about the shootings, the 27 deaths in our classrooms and schools that we have witnessed, we must respond. 
   As earlier stated, if a student with a disability is expelled, that student  must be provided alternative educational services while a nondisabled student, somebody who is not in special education who is expelled for the same offense, will not necessarily receive alternative educational services, which just shows how we are treating a student who comes into the classroom with a gun differently if they happen to be disabled compared to other students. 
   The amendment that I, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator HELMS, Senator COVERDELL, and Senator ALLARD, as the initial sponsors, have put forward, allows principals and other qualified school personnel the flexibility to do something that seems so basic. 
   And that is, to treat all students the same if they bring a gun into the classroom, period. No more complicated than that. It does not matter race, it does not matter financial status, it does not matter educational status, everybody gets treated the same. 
   It allows school authorities to discipline all students in the same way if they bring a gun, we are not talking about threats, and we are not talking about even other weapons. We have this amendment focused on guns and bombs coming into the schoolroom. 
   This amendment does not force local school authorities to have a uniform disciplinary policy. We recognize that every situation needs to be judged as just that, an individual, unique situation. It simply gives them the flexibility to enforce discipline in that local school as they see fit, with the overall objective to assure, to ensure, to guarantee the safety of those students whom every day we send into those classrooms. 
   The amendment is firearms specific. There have been others who have asked us to at least look at expanding it to other weapons, but we have this amendment really quite narrow; we are talking about guns and firearms. 
   I mentioned the Nashville statistics. These statistics are really hard to obtain. You always hesitate, when that is the case, to generalize. So I want to make it very clear, I do not want to generalize, but I do want to illustrate how, in one community where I live, this loophole has the potential for causing real harm, I believe. 
   In the 1997-1998 school year in Nashville, TN there were eight firearms infractions. Of those eight, six were students with a disability. They were in special education. 
   I might add that overall in the State of Tennessee it is between 13 and 14 percent, or about one out of eight students, who are in special education classes. 
   Of these six special education students, three were expelled outright because they found, in the manifestation process, that the disability and their bringing a gun into the classroom were unrelated. Three of those students were not expelled, because the possession of the firearm was found to be a manifestation of that child's disability. It was three students who went right back into the classroom, again, potentially putting the lives of others in danger. 
   We might hear, well, nobody has been killed yet in the last year or the last 2 years. Really, I think that is a whole separate issue. The whole idea is that we are treating people differently who have brought a gun or a firearm into the room. 
   These statistics show that three people out of the eight had come back into the classroom because a manifestation of their disability was bringing a gun into the classroom. It is kind of hard to imagine, but that is what the ruling was. 
   With that, let me close and simply say that when it comes to possession of a firearm or a gun, the Federal Government really should not, I believe, be tying the hands of our local education authorities, of our local schools, our principals, our teachers, those who are in charge of discipline. 
   Again, I say this. When we are focusing on guns and firearms in the classroom, I just find it hard to believe, and really there is absolutely no excuse for any student to intentionally bring a gun or a bomb to school. 
   Students with disabilities really should not be able to hide behind, not their disability, I want to be very clear. What is happening is we set this structure up, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, with this single provision that allows certain students to potentially hide behind the legislation, not their disability, but behind the legislation and, thus, avoid punishment that a nondisabled student would undergo. 
   The amendment is simple. It is straightforward. It means that all students will be treated equally if they bring a firearm in the room. I urge its support and hope it will be brought to a 
   vote shortly.

Of these nine infractions, four involved special education students. In two of these cases, the students were expelled but given alternative services. One was not expelled because the possession, walking into the school with a firearm, was found to be a manifestation of the disability. He is back in school today.

   Mr. FRIST. I will have to check and get back with you. I think the Senator's point is important. That is why I spelled it out earlier. For a student with a disability, you have the 10 days which you can be removed from the process. If you brought a gun into the schoolroom, you can be removed for 10 days. Then you have a 45-day period during which this determination is made. If you brought the gun because you had a disability, you can, as I have demonstrated with this most recent student from a month ago, plus the three from last year, you can go back into the classroom during that 45-day period. I think that is the issue that we want to close, which is basically saying, it doesn't matter whether you have a disability or not, if you walk into a classroom with a gun, you should be treated like everybody else.

This is our wording: School personnel may discipline a child with a disability who carries or possesses a gun or firearm to or at a school, on school premises or at a school function under the jurisdiction of the State or local education agency in the same manner in which such personnel may discipline a child without a disability, period. That is all we are saying. I don't see how you cannot agree that you should treat every child who comes into a school with a gun or bomb the same. How can you separate one group of people out? 
   Again, I am committed to individuals with disabilities, but how can you separate them out and say, we are going to treat you differently and allow you to go back in the classroom, whether it is 10 days, 45 days, 35 days; you can argue that all you want, you can go back into the classroom, but any child who doesn't have a disability, you are out?

   Mr. FRIST. Let me respond to the question. They absolutely should. If two children walk in, regardless of their IQ, the one with a 120 IQ has a gun, and the next one has a gun and has an IQ of 60, when it comes to removal from the room and being kept out, they should be treated exactly the same. It should be by local control. It doesn't mean let them in or keep them out, it means having the decision made by the principal and not by the well-intended legislation that has this huge loophole in it. 
   Treat every child who brings a gun or a bomb to the room the same, regardless of who they are or how empathetic you can make the story seem. The big thing is that you treat them the same. It is the principal and the teacher and  the people locally who decide, not the Senate.

   The whole purpose of my amendment is that, if you bring a gun or a bomb to the classroom, you be treated exactly the same. And if you don't have a disability, if you aren't in a special education class, you are out of school, no questions asked. If you have a disability, there are at least three out of eight chances you are back in the classroom within 45 days. That is not the case.

So the overall manifestation process, as we look at IDEA, is something that I am not necessarily critical of. It is the idea of taking a disability and saying the disability and bringing a gun mean that you are back in the school with unequal treatment. 
   But the answer is yes. I travel around Tennessee and people tell me this manifestation process can be very expensive because it involves lawyers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. That is the way it is written, to take 45 days. Your fundamental question is, did the disability cause you to bring the gun to school? 
   That is hard to imagine, to be honest. It seems that if it is the cause, you would not want to put them back in school. The idea of having 45 days and another 45 days if they are threatening, as the Senator from Iowa mentioned, conceptually, that is pretty good. Imagine that it is manic depression, or something frustrating, something that can be treated, and a kid is violent underneath, and they did bring a gun to school. You are going to want to give the kid the benefit of the doubt. You are not going to say keep them out another 45 days and then another. If the kid comes in and says, ``I am sorry,'' you say, ``Go back to school.'' 
   That is just treating people differently because they happen to have that particular illness and you are getting them back in the school. All I am saying is let's equalize it and keep treating them the same.

   Mr. FRIST. No. It is that loophole that has been created. 
   I will tell you what my theory is as I look and talk to people around Tennessee. Whether people are supporting individual disabilities or not, it is not about that. It has to do with the great fear I have in this unequal treatment of people, and allowing that special group of people with an offense of bringing a gun to school or a bomb to school to go back into school when you don't let anybody else to go back into school. I will tell you, to me, that is a potentially devastating loophole we have created. It hasn't anything to do with the disability. That is my greatest fear. That is why the amendment is on the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. I don't want to keep going back to the underlying amendment. We again have discussed this, and we have debated it. It really comes back to treating people the same under this concept of guns and violence in the school. I think we may come down to a fundamental disagreement that you believe the current legislation will cover and take care of what is happening, that if they have a disability and a manifestation of bringing that gun to school is related to the disability, it is OK for them to come back to school if somebody says they are not threatened. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-frist-tn-33-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRIST. That is right. I think that is going to be different, because we are basically going to say let these school principals and officials make the ultimate decision, and not an officer who happens to be assigned to manage that particular case, who is going to develop a relationship with that student and family, and who says, ``Please let him go back to school.'' 
   Let's treat everybody the same. Let the authorities, the principals, the teachers, make that decision instead of separating them out, since we know they come back into the school. 
   Let me again read the amendment.  
   School personnel may discipline a child with a disability who carries, or possesses, a gun, or firearm to or at school, on school premises, or at a school function under the jurisdiction of a State or a local educational agency in the same manner in which such personnel may discipline a child without a disability.  
   Again, I have given examples of people going back into the schoolroom. Let me give two other examples. 
   This is an article in the Washington Times.  
   Fairfax County, Virginia, school officials learned that a group of students were in possession of a loaded .357 magnum handgun on school property. They moved quickly to expel the six students. Five students were expelled. One student, a special education student who had a learning disability, who had what they called a ``weakness in written language skills,'' continued to receive an education. School officials reported that this child bragged to other teachers and students that he could not be expelled because he was in special education.  
   That is the signal we have sent through IDEA, through this loophole in our legislation, not the overall legislation. The overall legislation is great. 
   In the Cobb County school system in Atlanta, not too far from where I am, two students, who were initially expelled for bringing a handgun and ammunition clip to school, were also protected by IDEA because they were special education students. There is just too much of this special treatment. 
   Our simple amendment basically says, disabled or not, educational status or not, whoever you are, you need to be treated the same where such personnel ``may discipline'' a child the same without a disability.

   Mr. FRIST. But the Senator from Iowa understands that we are not saying keep the students out forever. We are saying if you keep the nondisabled student out for the rest of the year, you should be able to keep the disabled student out for the rest of the year. 
   In fact, if you look at nondisabled students in terms of cessation of services, because the implication is people are so bad and mean they will cut off services, if you look at the nonspecial ed students in Nashville, TN expelled under zero tolerance, 55 percent of those are provided services. 
   I guess the Senator argues that of the disabled there will be such intense discrimination against that group of people, and I understand Senator HARKIN has fought the battles here for 20 years, and I respect that tremendously. I guess I have more faith in our principals and in our schools that if you treat everybody the same, that is exactly what you will do.

   We have gone so far to put wording in the bill to say they intentionally have to bring that gun into the school or the classroom. We have done our best to get it as narrow and focused as we possibly can. 
   It comes down to safety. We are on the juvenile justice bill. We had these terrible 27 deaths from guns in classrooms, and this bill goes right at the heart. Again, not the disability community or individuals with disabilities. I count myself among their greatest advocates, but I am concerned that with the loophole we created that something drastic, devastating, is going to happen because of this loophole where we are treating students with disabilities in special education, allowing them to return to the classroom, but not letting anybody else return to the classroom. 
   We are treating them differently, where people who brought a gun to the classroom can return 45 days later.

   Mr. FRIST. For the last 45 minutes, we have had the Senator from Iowa talking to me or talking to the body trying to explain so everybody can understand this process that we have set up for individuals with disabilities, which is a good process overall because they are very complex issues. 
   We have a 10-day period where we have one set of rules which I agree that basically you do the same for an individual with a disability and nondisability. 
   Then you have a 45-day period, which, as the chart that we saw earlier shows, in terms of a manifestation process, is confusing and is a difficult process. It is an evolving process and one that has changed over time so that we can adequately consider individuals with their disabilities and what their special needs are. 
   Our point, and I know the Senator from Iowa keeps shifting away from it, but I am going to keep coming back to it, because the amendment is so simple. Our point is to close a loophole that if a disabled student brings a gun or a bomb in the classroom, they end up back in this classroom. If you do not have a disability you are not in the classroom. That is a loophole. 
   The point I want to make is, we can march through the whole 10-day period, 45-day period, another 45-day period of threatening and all that. That is the whole point, that we have barrier after barrier after barrier for a group of people who brought a gun into the classroom, with our children around, and they brought a gun there. We have all these barriers set up for one group of students, but for the other group of students they are out for that year. We say, treat them both the same. That is all the amendment does.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong opposition as well to this amendment before the Senate, put forth by the Senator from Washington, an amendment which would instruct local education agencies to set out their own policy--a potentially very different policy--in disciplining students with disabilities. In short, under his amendment, each school district potentially would have its own distinct policy in disciplining disabled children. And with 16,000 school districts, the potential for conflicting policies is very real. And I am afraid this would be a turn-back to the pre-1975 era before IDEA. Is this a double standard? I say no. Clearly, we have outlined a process whereby students, if there is a manifestation of a disability, would go down one process. And if a discipline problem was not a manifestation of a disability, that student would be treated just like everyone else.  
   I am continuing to quote from the statement of the Senator from Tennessee on May 14, 1997:  
   I think this is fair, this is equitable. Remember, if behavior is not a result of that disability, all students are treated the same in this bill. If behavior is secondary to a disability, there is a very clear process which is outlined in detail. Yes, it does take several pages to outline that, but it sets up a balance between the school, between school boards, between parents, and between children.  
   Senator GORTON claims this amendment is about local control, and I feel that it will be used, I am afraid, to turn back the hands of the clock to the pre-1975 conditions where we know that children with disabilities were excluded from the opportunity to receive a free and appropriate public education.  
   I say to my friend in Tennessee that he was right then. Mr. President, he was right then. Now we are caught up with the issue of guns and bombs.

Does the Senator from Iowa believe there should be two standards, if one child with a disability walks into a school with a gun and a child without a disability walks in with a gun, if there is a zero tolerance policy for the States, the individual who walks in with the gun should be back in classroom within 45 days when the person without a disability is totally disallowed?

   Mr. FRIST. In terms of ``intent.'' We have narrowed this bill so specifically  in terms of an individual bringing a gun or a firearm with intent into the classroom that they should all be treated the same. I think it is important that is what this amendment is all about is equal treatment, fair treatment, the same treatment, whether or not you have a disability, whatever your educational status is, that you are treated the same, if you bring a gun into the classroom or you bring a firearm into the classroom.

   Mr. FRIST. There were eight students in Tennessee a year and a half ago brought firearms in the school. We have gone through this, I know. Two had no disability and were expelled. They are out. Six of the eight were disabled students, individuals with disabilities, and were in special education. For three of those who brought the gun to the classroom, it was related to a manifestation of their disability. It has to be that the individuals with disabilities have individual needs that have to be addressed. They should be addressed. Constitutionally, they should be addressed. Ethically, they should be addressed. 
   When it comes to a firearm, or a when it comes to a bomb, after those 45 days, three of those eight students in Tennessee who brought a bomb to the classroom, or a gun, or firearm, firearm, deadly weapon, ended up back in school through this loophole when none of the other students without a disability had that loophole. They entered back into the school. 
   When you keep saying get them out for 10 days, in truth, whether it is 35 or 45 days, they are back in the classroom and treated in a different way. I say treat them the same.

   Mr. FRIST. Those eight, may have been under the old law, I am not sure. I gave other statistics with the nine students from this year. 
   I will have to check on that. 
   I don't want to stress the statistics too much. I keep using them because I have a great fear something bad will happen as a result of the law we created. 
   I can say on the 45-day period which we have talked about and worked on writing together, if a person is a threat during that 45 days, and your team says you are a threat, the Senator is exactly right, they can be kept out another 45 days. After that 45 days, what? I guess it can keep going on. We have great faith in that. 
   As someone who has, as the Senator, seen a lot of individuals with disabilities, if somebody brings a gun into the classroom and they are expelled like everybody else for 10 days and go through a manifestation period, I don't know exactly how to know whether that individual is threatening. We have to go through all the disabilities. That will be a tough diagnosis to make in terms of saying, no, you are too threatening to go back when parents are there who are saying go back; teachers, lawyers, who say he hasn't done anything over the last 15 or 20 days, maybe we should let him go back.  
   That is what our bill gets out. Treat everybody the same, if you have a disability or no disability. If you bring a gun or firearm to school, you should be treated the same. The same applies to cessation of services. You should be subjected to the decisionmaking of the local principals and teachers in terms of services, as well as in terms of expulsion.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I offer on behalf of Senators ASHCROFT, ALLARD, COVERDELL, and HELMS an amendment which addresses an issue which is fundamentally central to the issues we have been discussing over the last several days; that is, of guns and bombs in schools. This amendment will address a problem that we in this body have created through good intent but created a loophole which allows students who have brought a bomb or a gun into a school to be allowed to return to the classroom. 
   The amendment very specifically ends what has become a mixed message that the Federal Government has sent and is sending to American students on the issue of guns and bombs in our schools. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, a law that I have fought very hard for, supported and have worked hard to reform and improve in past Congresses, a student with a disability who is in possession of a firearm is treated differently than a regular education student because of the disability. Students in special education are treated differently than all other students, if both have brought a gun or a bomb into the school. That is wrong. It has to be fixed. It is a loophole that creates a huge danger, I believe, to the safety of our children and teachers in our schools. 
   How big a problem is it? Some people said it is a hypothetical problem. It is hard to get this data. But I want to share with my colleagues what I have been able to find. 
   If you look just last year, over the 1997-1998 school year, just in Nashville, just one community in this country, there were eight firearm infractions, where children have been found to have brought a gun or firearm into the school. That isn't how many came in, but only how many were actually discovered. Of those eight, six were special education students, protected under IDEA. 
   By the way, about 13 percent of all students, or one out of every eight, are in special education. What happened to the six special education students? Under the law as it is written, we basically determine whether or not bringing that gun into school was a manifestation, meaning was it related in any way to the disability. Of those six, three were found to have brought that firearm in for a reason that is unrelated to the disability, and were expelled but were still allowed to receive educational services. The other three special education students were found to have brought the firearm to the school because it was related to the disability. 
   The significance of this is that we take those three students and say, You can go back into the school. The other two regualr education students not protected under IDEA were expelled and were not required to receive educational services. They can't come back to the school. But because we created this special class, we are letting kids with bombs and firearms to come back into the school in as soon as 45 days later. It is no more complicated than that. 
   Our amendment fixes this dangerous, dangerous loophole. To look at just over the last 8 months, of nine firearm violations in Nashville, four have involved special education students. These statistics say that in one city, Nashville, it is a problem. But it is a snapshot, a microscopic picture of what goes on all over the country. It is wrong. Students should be subject to the exact same disciplinary action whether or not they happen to be in special education. It is our fault. We created this system which treats them differently. 
   We contend that when it comes to bombs and firearms, they should all be treated exactly alike. The issue of possession of a gun or firearm, I don't believe the Federal Government should tie the hands of our local education authorities, our principals and teachers, when it comes to protecting students and teachers from guns and bombs in schools. 
   I believe there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for any student to intentionally possess or bring to school a gun. What we have done is create by previous legislation, which this amendment 
   fixes, a means by which a special group of students, students in special education to hide behind the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to avoid the same punishment that a regular education student would receive. 
   Our amendment says that the possession must be intentional. This would allow the principal to determine if the student with a disability unknowingly had the gun placed on him. This targets a student who comes to that schoolyard with a firearm or gun intentionally. 
   Again, it is a tight, focused amendment. 
   Since its inception in 1975, 24 years ago, IDEA has been gradually modified with the times and has been improved. 
   I believe this is a marked improvement. I think this amendment is necessary for the reasons that we have been discussing regarding this bill, with the catastrophes around my State and other States, and in Colorado most recently, which reflect the decline in safety in our Nation's schools. 
   Our amendment, very simply, ensures that school authorities at the local level have the ability to remove dangerous students, whoever they are, from the classroom regardless of their status. Today they can't. Our amendment fixes this problem.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S.980, the ``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999,'' which my colleagues and I on the Senate Rural Health Caucus introduced on May 6,1999. 
   There is no single issue that unites rural Americans more than access to quality health care. It is one of the most important components of good quality of life in rural areas. The ability to receive high quality health care keeps people in and attracts them to small towns. Good health care services in a community can be both a source of great pride and security and many times local hospitals are a community's largest employer. 
   But some of that security is being threatened. Access to health care in rural areas can be problematic. Distances are greater. Some hospitals have closed. There are fewer choices of health plans than in urban areas. The ``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999'' will help to improve access for rural citizens, increase payments to providers in rural areas, and bring innovative technologies to rural areas. 
   Approximately 20 percent of the nation's population, or more than 50 million people, live in rural America. However, the rural population is disproportionately poor, experiences significantly higher rates of chronic illness and disability, and is aging faster than the nation as a whole. In rural areas, the elderly account for 18% of the population. 
   Poverty is more widespread in rural areas and in 1995 the poverty rate was 15.6% there. Poverty was especially high in minorities--affecting 35% of rural African Americans and 31% of rural Hispanics. 22.4% of rural children live in poverty. 
   Health insurance coverage is also a problem. In 1996, only 53.7% of residents in rural areas had private health insurance and in 1996 about 10.5 million rural residents were uninsured. Medicare beneficiaries are more likely than the general population to reside in rural areas. Medicare spends less on rural beneficiaries than on urban beneficiaries and Medicaid covered only 45% of the rural poor. The government has a responsibility to rural communities and a responsibility to support the safety net upon which so many rural communities depend. 
   Before coming to the Senate, I was a heart-lung transplant surgeon. In that capacity, much of my time was spent working with rural health care providers who were caring for trauma victims eligible for organ donation. I spent many late nights flying to remote areas to harvest organs for transplantation elsewhere in the country. In this situation, I entered into their communities and worked side-by-side with rural hospitals, and their physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. These providers do an excellent job. However they work under very difficult conditions and require special attention to their particular needs. 
   To address the unique attributes of the health needs of the rural areas of America, I joined my colleagues in introducing this important legislation. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 contains a number of provisions designed to enhance rural health. 
   There are provisions in the legislation to assist rural hospitals. For example, our bill reinstates the Medicare Dependent Hospital program which expired last year. This special designation directs special Medicare payments to eligible hospitals. Medicare Dependent Hospitals include rural hospitals that are not Sole Community Hospitals, have 100 or fewer beds, and at least 60% Medicare patient discharges or days. The bill also protects the Sole Community Hospitals program which aids hospitals in remote areas that serve as the sole hospital in an area. 
   There are also provisions to expand wage index reclassification. This means that hospitals in areas that are classified as rural can apply to use an urban wage index if they can show that their wages are similar to prevailing wages in urban areas. The provision would also direct the Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA) to establish separate wage indices for home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities so that their payments will be fairer and more accurate. 
   This bill would exclude Critical Access Hospitals, Medicare Dependent Hospitals, and Sole Community Hospitals from the new Medicare outpatient prospective payment system (PPS) when it is implemented. The HCFA analysis has shown that these primarily small, rural hospitals would  be disproportionately impacted by the outpatient PPS as proposed. 
   The bill would improve Medicare payments to rural health clinics and allow HCFA to institute a prospective payment system. Medicare currently pays Rural Health Clinics for their reasonable costs up to a per-encounter cap of $60.40. The equivalent cap for Federally Qualified Health Center services, which was set using more recent data and a different methodology, is significantly higher ($80.62). S. 980 updates the methodology used to calculate the per-encounter cap, which will improve payments to rural health clinics. 
   There are provisions in the legislation to enhance choice of health plans in rural areas. The payment formula for Medicare+Choice plans, as revised in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), contains substantial changes designed to lessen the variance in payments to health plans among geographic areas over time. Today, Medicare payments vary county to county by more than 350% because they had been tied to historical charges. This is not a true reflection of the cost of delivering health care and in fact penalizes rural areas with historically poor access to quality care. Therefore, S.980 adjusts the payment formulas for Medicare+Choice plans to help rural areas attract private health plans. 
   Attracting health professionals to rural areas, and having them remain in the those communities, has been an ongoing problem. But access to high quality medical care is improved when there is an adequate supply of practitioners who remain in the community. S. 980 improves the likelihood of attracting and retaining health care professionals in rural areas. S. 980 increases payments to practitioners serving in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) and assists rural communities with recruiting efforts. Specifically a 10% bonus will be paid to physician assistants and nurse practitioners for outpatient services provided in these areas. Our bill also assists with recruitment of health professionals to serve rural areas. Currently a community is not allowed to recruit and hire a practitioner until the one being replaced has left. No longer would a community have to lose the practitioner, before the recruitment process could begin. In addition, tuition benefits provided as scholarships through the National Health Service Corps, would not be treated as taxable income. These changes help ensure that trained health care professionals are accessible to seniors and individuals with disabilities living in rural areas. 
   The bill also makes changes to assist with training of physicians in rural hospitals. S.980 would allow rural hospitals to get credit for residents who spend time training outside a hospital and in rural health clinics. It would also allow hospitals with only one residency program to add up to three residents to their limit. BBA froze the reimbursement for residents at 1996 levels. This was detrimental to rural areas. These changes will allow for the training of more physicians in rural areas 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that S. 980 would enhance telemedicine and telehealth. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare has begun to pay for telemedicine consultations for patients living in rural areas that are designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act would: (1) allow anything currently covered by Medicare to be reimbursed; (2) expand eligibility for telemedicine reimbursement to include all rural areas; and (3) state definitively that the referring physician need not be present at the time of the telehealth service, and clarify that any health care practitioner, acting on instructions from the referring physician or practitioner, may present the patient to the consulting physician. 
   In addition, the bill would formally authorize an existing group of Cabinet level and private sector members and instruct them to focus on identifying, monitoring, and coordinating federal telehealth projects. The provisions also authorize the development a grant/loan program for telemedicine activities in rural areas. 
   Mr. President, this bill was developed by the Senate Rural Health Caucus, of which I am a member. I am proud of the provisions directed towards rural health care providers and the benefits they will have for the citizens of rural communities. 
   This bill sends a strong message to rural America: Washington cares about your problems and wants to help ensure access to quality health care. This is accomplished by strengthening the Medicare program and by making the newest technology available to rural areas.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, much of the Robb amendment (#325) to S. 254 is based on S. 976, the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which I introduced this past Thursday, May 6, 1999. Furthermore, the Robb amendment does not include S. 976 in its entirety, but rather includes portions of S. 976 along with several new provisions which I have not yet had a chance to carefully consider in the context of other provisions of S. 976. Therefore, I voted to table this amendment. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health which has jurisdiction over these Public Health Service programs, my intent is to allow the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions full consideration of S. 976. 
   I look forward to moving S. 976 through the normal legislative channels to ensure that we pass a balanced, commonsense measure to provide for greater flexibility in treatment services for children.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today is Tax Freedom Day--the day that reflects how many days into the year a taxpayer must work in order to pay taxes. In 1913, when Congress first levied an income tax, Tax Freedom Day was January 30, and only 6 years ago, Tax Freedom Day was April 30--today it is two weeks into May before the taxpayer can stop working for the Federal Government and start working for him or herself. 
   It is thus fitting that I introduce today the Frist tax package--four tax bills that I believe will go a long way toward pushing Tax Freedom Day back toward January. This tax package is based on a set of core principles:

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a physician and father of three young boys, I am alarmed at the current level of drug use in America. In April of 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that 74 million Americans have tried illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime. Of these, 22 million Americans have tried cocaine, 4.6 million have tried crack cocaine and 2.4 million have tried heroin. Last year, 23 million Americans used an illicit drug, and today there are 13 million Americans who are current drug users which means they have used an illicit drug in the last month. 
   The rapid decline of overall drug use in America that began in the mid eighties, thanks in part to the efforts of Presidents Reagan and Bush, has stagnated and leveled off. 
   It is true that cocaine use has decreased from 5.7 million users in 1985 to its current stagnate level of around 1.5 million in 1997 and marijuana use is also down from 19 million users in 1985 to around 11 million in 1997. However, before we become too satisfied, we as a nation must face the very troubling fact that drug and alcohol use is dramatically on the rise among our youth. 
   In 1992, the percentage of 10th graders that admitted to using an illicit drug at least once in the last 30 days according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy was 11 percent. By 1997 that figure had more than doubled to 23 percent. Most troubling is the dramatic increase in heroin use among our nation's teenage population. 
   Let us not forget about the drug of choice for our youth and adolescents, alcohol. Although the legal drinking age is 21 in all States, the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse undertaken by SAMHSA reports that more than 50 percent of young adults age eighteen to twenty are consuming alcohol and more than 25 percent report having five or more drinks at one time during the past month. 
   There are many factors for this increase in youth substance abuse but the factors that I, as a father, am most concerned with is the overall decline of the disapproval of drug use and the decline of the perception of the risk of drug use among our youth. 
   Against this alarming challenge I am pleased to introduce the ``The Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act of 1999.'' 
   This important and needed legislation will reauthorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to improve this vital agency by providing greater flexibility for States and accountability based on performance, while at the same time placing critical focus on youth and adolescent substance abuse and mental health services. Joining me in sponsoring this effort is Senator KENNEDY who, as ranking member of my Subcommittee on Public Health, has been instrumental in developing  this legislation. Joining Senator KENNEDY and me as original cosponsors are Senators JEFFORDS, DODD, DEWINE, MIKULSKI and COLLINS. 
   SAMHSA, formerly known as the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (ADAMHA) was created in 1992 by the Public Law 102-321, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. SAMHSA's purpose is to assist States in addressing the importance of reducing the incidence of substance abuse and mental illness by supporting programs for prevention and treatment. SAMHSA provides funds to States for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and activities, and mental health services through the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) and the Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grants. 
   SAMHSA's block grants account for 40 percent and 15 percent respectively of all substance abuse and community mental health services funding in the States. They are a major portion of this nation's response to substance abuse and mental health service needs. 
   In introducing the legislation, I have targeted six main goals which include: promote State flexibility in block grant funding; ensure accountability for the expenditure of Federal funds; develop and support youth and adolescent substance abuse prevention and treatment initiatives; develop and support mental health initiatives that are designed to prevent and respond to incidents of teen violence; insure the availability of Federal funding for emergencies; and support programs targeted for the homeless to treat mental health and substance abuse. 
   In 1981, President Ronald Reagan revolutionized Federal support for mental health and substance abuse services by eliminating what were many discretionary programs for which States, local governments, and providers had to compete for funds. Instead he created the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services (ADMS) Block Grant. This Block Grant awarded funds to States based on a formula. States were eligible to receive the funds as long as the Federal government was assured the State would comply with certain requirements. This shift to a block grant gave primary responsibility for providing mental health and substance abuse services to the States--where it should be to allow our States to respond to local needs. 
   Unfortunately, over the years, the Block Grant program has become more prescriptive. As a result, these additional requirements place burdens on States and remove State flexibility, which was the main purpose of the Block Grant program. We need more State flexibility and my bill accomplishes this by implementing a number of recommendations from the States. It repeals a requirement in the substance abuse block grant that requires States to use 35 percent of their funds for alcohol related activities and 35 percent for drug related activities. The requirement that States maintain a $100,000 revolving fund to support recovery homes is made optional. New waivers are created for several other requirements in the substance abuse block grant. Application requirements in the mental health block grant are minimized, and States will be able to obligate their block grant funds over two years instead of one giving them more time to plan for and use the funds. 
   If this bill is enacted, the Governors will be able to make a one time infusion of funds into the States substance abuse or mental health treatment system without having to commit themselves to increases in future years when budgets might not accommodate that funding. As a result of this bill, States will have more flexibility in their use of funds than they have had in the past ten 
   years. 
   With more flexibility, comes the need for more accountability. Therefore, my bill changes the way States are held accountable for their use of Federal funds. For example, under the current substance abuse block grant, States are required to spend a prescribed amount of money to address the needs of pregnant addicts and women with children. States are held accountable as to whether they spent the prescribed amount of funds, not on the true outcomes of whether that population is being successfully treated which is how they should be held accountable. The Federal government should be less concerned with whether the State spent the required amount of funds and more concerned on whether the State is being successful in reducing the number of infants born addicted or HIV positive. 
   My bill sets a process in place over the next 2 years to develop a system based on performance measures to monitor States' progress. The reason why the bill does not implement such a system now is that the State treatment systems are not prepared to make that change. First, because there is no agreement on what measures to use. Second, the current State data systems are not adequate to collect and report on performance data. Very few States currently have data systems that could provide the necessary data. 
   To respond to these concerns, this bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a plan to Congress within 2 years detailing the performance measures to be used in such a system that have been agREED to by the States and Federal government. That plan is to include the data elements that States will have to collect, the definitions of the data elements and the legislative language necessary to implement the recommended program. 
   The bill also authorizes a grant program for the Secretary to provide financial support to States for developing the data infrastructure necessary to collect and report on the performance data. 
   As I have previously discussed, the increase in youth drug and alcohol abuse is a problem that threatens to undermine our society. To increase the focus of SAMHSA on youth substance abuse, the bill places a new emphasis on youth in developing treatment programs. 
   Although I believe that none of our children is truly safe when it comes to drugs and alcohol, there are children, because of their environment or state of mental health, that are more at risk to become drug or alcohol abusers. Children of substance abusers, victims of physical or sexual abuse, high school drop outs, the economically disadvantaged or those with mental health problems or who have attempted suicide are all at risk of drug and alcohol abuse. In order to develop effective techniques for prevention and treatment for these children, the bill also reauthorizes a grant program to develop effective models for the prevention and treatment of drug and alcohol abuse among high risk youth. 
   During discussions regarding the increased incidence of youth substance abuse several of my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee have approached me to express their concern and desire to develop provisions to address the problem of youth substance abuse: Senator DEWINE has expressed an interest in developing provisions that would offer early intervention and prevention; Senator DODD has correctly pointed out that there has been little focus thus far on developing techniques to provide effective treatment for our children; Senator REED has pointed out that over 60% of youth in the juvenile justice system may have substance abuse disorders, compared to 22% in the general population; and Senator BINGAMAN has offered his help to address the problems with youth substance abuse in rural areas, Native American communities and other areas that are either underserved or where there is an emerging substance abuse problem among youth. 
   We will be working over the next few weeks to incorporate the elements addressed above into a bipartisan proposal. In the meantime, the bill creates the authority for a new program on youth treatment which will be strengthened by the bipartisan proposal when the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee takes action on the bill. 
   The issue of children of substance abusers is also addressed in this bill. As I have mentioned, children of substance abusers are at high risk of being substance abusers themselves. The Department of Health and Human Services reported to Congress last month that 8.3 million, or 11 percent, of American children live with at least one parent who is either an alcoholic or in need of treatment for the abuse of drugs. This report also sadly confirms that between 50 to 80 percent of children in the child abuse, neglect and  foster care systems have parents who need substance abuse treatment. To address this, the bill reauthorizes the Children of Substance Abusers Act (COSA) and moves its authority to SAMHSA from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for better coordination. Funding under COSA, which was authored by Senator DODD and enacted during the 102nd Congress, would be used for identification and evaluation of families experiencing substance abuse and offer treatment and prevention services. 
   Another area I am addressing in this bill is youth violence and mental health services. As we have seen by the many tragedies in our nation's schools, the issue of youth violence causes us much pause for thought. Although I believe we cannot legislate a less violent society, this bill has programs which we hope will begin to address the issue of youth violence and assist communities by helping them meet the mental health needs of youth to cope with violence related stress. 
   The first step the bill takes is to authorize a provision that will assist local communities in developing ways to assist children in dealing with violence, building upon the actions last year of Senators SPECTER and HARKIN in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS and Education. This bill will authorize SAMHSA to make grants in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education to assist local communities. These grants will support activities that include: financial support to enable the communities to implement programs designed to help violent youth; technical assistance to local communities; and assistance in the creation of community partnerships among the schools, law enforcement and mental health services. In order to receive funding for services under this provision an organization would have to ensure that they will carry out six activities which include: security 
   of the school; educational reform to deal with violence; the review and updating of school policies to deal with violence; alcohol and drug abuse prevention and early intervention; mental health prevention and treatment services; and early childhood development and psychosocial services. The funds, however, may only be used for prevention, early intervention, and treatment services. 
   In order to help youth and adolescents cope with violence and emergency crises, the bill establishes grants for developing knowledge with regard to evidence-based practices for treating mental health disorders resulting from violence related stress. In addition, the bill will establish centers of excellence to provide technical assistance to communities in dealing with the emotional burden of violence if and when it occurs. 
   By law, SAMHSA discretionary grant awards must be peer reviewed which regularly take up to six months to approve which makes SAMHSA unable to act quickly in a emergency. To ensure the availability of funding for emergencies, the bill establishes an emergency response fund to allow the federal government to address emergency substance abuse or mental health needs in local communities. For example, this funding could be available to assist communities exposed to violence or terrorism or communities experiencing a serious substance abuse emergency such as increased drug traffic or inhalant abuse. 
   The final theme of the bill that I would like to highlight is the issue of services for the homeless. 
   Individuals who are homeless face major barriers to access and utilize mainstream addictive and mental disorder treatment and recovery services, including lack of income verification documentation, difficulties in maintaining schedules, and lack of transportation. Furthermore, most providers are not equipped to handle the complex social and health conditions which the homeless population presents. An insufficient number of mainstream providers offer the long-term, residentially-based aftercare and housing services that are essential for homeless individuals adherence to treatment and residential stability. Mainstream providers are not typically linked to the full range of health, housing, and human development services that homeless individuals with addictive and mental disorders require for recovery and residential stability. 
   In order to help address the unique challenges of serving the homeless, the bill reauthorizes grants to develop and expand mental health and substance abuse treatment services for homeless individuals. 
   In addition, it reauthorizes the successful Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness program, know as PATH. PATH is a formula grant program which provides funds to States to provide mental health services to homeless individuals including outreach, screening and treatment, habilitation and rehabilitation. 
   Mr. President, thus far I have laid out the major legislative changes my colleagues and I are undertaking to improve SAMHSA programs. However, I would like to talk about the great work that is accomplished locally by discussing recent efforts in my home State of Tennessee. 
   SAMHSA provides over 70 percent of overall funding for the Tennessee Department of Health's Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services, which is headed by Dr. Stephanie Perry. 
   Last year Tennessee received over $25 million from the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant to spend on treatment and prevention activities. With this funding the Tennessee Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services provides funding to community-based programs that offer a wide range of services throughout the State. 
   In the area of prevention services, the funding allows for the Intensive Focus Group program which provides structured, short term educational and counseling programs for youth and their families. In addition, the State is also able to fund Regional Prevention Coordinators who are assigned to each region of the State to assist communities in the development, implementation and coordination of alcohol and drug prevention activities. One additional program, I would like to highlight is the Faith Initiative which is a voluntary involvement of faith leaders to establish the role of interfaith communities in substance abuse and violence prevention. 
   In the area of treatment, where Tennessee spends 65 percent of its total substance abuse dollars, there are several different treatment programs that focus on youth residential and day treatment, family intervention and referral services. Other offered services include medical detoxification which is a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week program that provides residential service for alcohol and drug abusers. Overall, the block grant funds permit nearly 6,500 Tennesseans to receive the substance abuse treatment they desperately need. 
   I am pleased that Tennessee has focused on serving individuals with co-occurring disorders. There are an estimated 25,000 Tennesseans identified as having co-occurring disorders, meaning they require both mental health and substance abuse services. The Co-Occurring Disorders Project is a partnership between Tennessee's Division of Mental Heath Services and Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Services, allowing the patient to overcome the difficult circumstances that make their recovery complex by allowing them to receive both substance abuse treatment and mental health treatment in an integrated system of care. 
   Another project that SAMHSA makes possible is the Central Intake Process which Tennessee developed to establish a uniformed system for anyone who requires alcohol and/or drug use treatment. Here is how this program works as demonstrated by the true case of a man named John. 
   John, is a 35 year-old, black male who was referred to Central Intake by his probation officer. John's past legal history includes 12 assault charges, 3 contempt of court charges, 15 public drunk charges and one DUI. John is a high school graduate, and has 24 months of technical training in operating heavy equipment. In the 30 days prior to his assessment, John had used 2 pints of alcohol a day, smoked crack cocaine on 22 days and marijuana on 4 days. John has been abusing alcohol for 27 years, marijuana for 21 years and cocaine for 4 years. He also has reported heroin use. 
   He was diagnosed as alcohol, cocaine and marijuana dependent and referred to a residential program with a step-  down transitional living facility outside his geographic region. Upon completion of the program, the Central Intake case manager arranged a placement with a halfway house in another part of the State. The case manager for John reports that he has been clean and sober for 10 months, continues to live in the halfway house, is employed, involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and is a member of a church. By establishing Central Intake, Tennessee, thanks to Federal block grant dollars is able to evaluate and offer appropriate treatment for individuals like John to help put their lives back together. 
   With the $4.4 million that the Tennessee Department of Mental Health received in 1998, Tennessee was able to utilize and enhance an array of services dedicated to mental health. Overall the block grant money was distributed to 16 private not-for-profit community health centers and nine community health agencies throughout the State. SAMHSA block grant funds were used for consumer and family support groups. In addition the major allocation of funding is spent on drop-in/socialization services across the State. In all there are 35 consumer-operated centers which provide a place for consumers to meet and socialize with other consumers of mental health services. In addition funding is used for co-occurring disorder projects which train clinicians, establish resource centers, and establish a statewide network for dual diagnosis advocacy. 
   To address the youth population, the Tennessee Department of Mental Health uses SAMHSA block grant dollars to fund a program called BASIC. BASIC which stands for Better Attitudes and Skills in Children is a public school based early intervention and prevention program that identifies and works with children with serious emotional disturbance with a goal of reducing the incidence of adolescent and adult mental health problems. This project also focuses on enhancing awareness and capacity for response of school personnel to the mental health needs of children. 
   SAMHSA funds also pay for the early children intervention project which targets preschool children with behavior problems that are in a day care setting. The purpose of this program is to intervene at the point which behavior problems become obtrusive and problematic for the parents, teaching staff and other children in the day care center. 
   Finally, I would like to mention the Respite Services program for families of children identified as seriously emotionally disturbed, or dually diagnosed as emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded. Respite consultants assist in identifying and developing community-based respite resources, and work with families to utilize these resources in the most effective manner. 
   Mr. President, the bill I introduce today will ensure that Tennessee and other states will continue to receive critically needed Federal funds for community based programs to help individuals with substance abuse and mental health disorders. The changes that I have outlined will dramatically increase State flexibility in the use of Federal funds and ensure that each State is able to address its unique needs. The bill also provides a much needed focus on the troubling issue of the recent increase in drug use by our youth and addresses how we can be helpful to local communities in regard to the issue of children and violence. I am pleased to offer this bill today and I look forward to working on theses issues with my colleagues as the bill is considered by the Senate.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise, as I have in years past, in support of what has become an annual resolution to designate the third week of October--this year--the week of October 17th--as National Character Counts Week. 
   The importance of character to the future of our nation cannot be overemphasized. As the noted educator, George S. Benson, once observed, ``Great ideals and principles do not live from generation to generation because they are right, nor even because they have been carefully legislated. Ideals and principles continue from generation to generation only when they are built into the hearts of children as they grow up.'' 
   There was a time when great ideals and principles were ``built into the hearts of children'' as a matter of course--in every school house, and classroom, all across our great land; a time when we believed that to educate a man in mind and not in morals, as Teddy Roosevelt put it, was to educate a menace of society. 
   Sadly, this is no longer the case. 
   Not only do many schools no longer teach children the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, they convey the philosophy that there is no difference; that it is all a matter of choice, and that choice--not truth--or justice--or responsibility, is the ultimate object of democracy. 
   That is the greatest threat to democracy any nation can face--but especially ours. For America is a nation founded on principle, forged by courage, and strengthened by every succeeding generation that has been unwilling to let those principles or that courage be diminished. 
   Yet, in many ways, moral leadership is more important now than it has ever been before. The 21st century will hold many challenges that will require the most of us. And the greatest of those challenges will be moral not economic: cloning, genetics, bioengineering; human rights vs. economic prosperity? right to life or right to die? 
   They are challenges that will require principle, demand character. 
   Who will be the leaders of tomorrow, and will they be up to the task? In many ways, the answer is up to us. 
   Which is why I have worked to promote character development in elementary and secondary education, and urged our Nation's colleges and universities to affirm character development as a primary goal of higher education. 
   It is also why I am also proud to support the Character Counts movement, and why I have done so every year since I've been in the United States Senate. 
   In 1995, in the very first quarter of my first term, I became a member of the bipartisan Character Counts Working Group--a coalition of Senators organized to affirm and support the millions of Americans who still believe that character counts, that it should be not just touted but taught, in homes and churches, certainly, but also in schools across America. 
   It is why I have annually co-sponsored this Senate resolution to designate the third week of October as National Character Counts Week. And it is why I am proud to say that, in Tennessee, Character Counts! is flourishing. 
   Mr. President, Character Counts! teaches children respect, responsibility, trust, caring and citizenship. It teaches them the value of virtue, the importance of character. It renews not only the promises of our past, but our faith in the future. 
   In Knoxville, Tennessee alone, 38 schools so far have received Character Counts! training. One of them, Norwood Elementary, asked students to write essays about the importance of character. 
   Another, Farragut Primary School, held an assembly for parents and kids that highlighted ways to be good citizens. 
   In Johnson City, a little boy and his friends at Cherokee Elementary School built a ramp at the home of a boy with a disability so he could get in and out safely in his wheelchair. 
   In Hamblin County, I met a fourth grader--a little girl named Heidi Shackleford--who was the first student to make her school's Character Counts! ``Wall of Fame.'' 
   What did she do to earn such an honor? She found a $100 bill in her school, but rather than stick it in her pocket, she turned it in to her teacher because she learned--through Character Counts education--why it is important to do the right thing. 
   In Sullivan County--where the Character Counts! program began in Tennessee--students at the Indian Springs Elementary School make monthly visits to a grandmother they adopted at a Kingsport nursing home. 
   They have also experienced 25 percent reduction in juvenile crime since the Character Counts! program began--an improvement they attribute directly to the impact the program has had on the region. 
   These are just a few examples of how Tennessee children are learning the value of virtue, the importance of character, and how their communities have benefitted as a result. 
   It has been my honor to support all of these efforts--to help Tennessee communities kick-off new programs, and to encourage and support those already in place. 
   But it is not enough to promote this program in Tennessee, or New Mexico, or in any one of the other states that have taken up the challenge. 
   We must promote the development of character in every state, in every school, in every city in America. For if education is the most important gift we can give to the future, then character education is doubly so. 
   The job of instilling character in the hearts of America's children has always been an important one. But as the tragic violence in Littleton and other cities recently have shown us, it has never been more important than it is today. 
   We are justifiably proud of the liberty we enjoy as Americans. But as the wise British statesman, Edmund Burke, once observed, What is liberty without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils, for it is folly, vice and madness without tuition or restraint. 
   We must take every opportunity to teach our children the difference between right and wrong, to sort out with them, what to value, and what to reject from among the vast array of choices made possible by our freedom. 
   We must all, young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, work together to sow the seeds of character into the hearts of every young American so that together we can give our children and our country one of the greatest gifts any democratic nation can bestow--the assurance that character does count.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is expected the Senate will soon consider a resolution that highlights the week of May 2 to 8 as National Teacher Appreciation Week. We have had a wonderful 2 weeks in this Nation's Capital. Last week the President signed the Ed-Flex bill which returned much of the control--local accountability, local flexibility--to local schools and school districts. This week we honor our teachers. 
   I rise today to honor the many outstanding teachers across the Nation and especially in my home State of Tennessee. In particular, I would like to highlight the achievements of Ms. Delise Teague, the 1999 Tennessee Teacher of the Year, whom I had the honor to meet, as you can see in this photo, just several weeks ago. This is Delise in the picture. 
   First, I would like to cite some of the research which paints a clear picture about the quality of a teacher being so critical to the future of our children and their education. Tennessee is one of the few States with data systems in place which make it possible to link teacher performance to student achievement. Researchers have the capability of examining the impact teachers have in terms of their effectiveness, how well they are teaching, and what students actually learn. Data from these studies show the least effective teachers produce gains of approximately 14 percentile points for low-achieving students. However, the most effective teachers produce gains that average 53 percentile points. 
   The data also reveal that these effects are cumulative over time. In fact, students with three quality teachers in a row, scored over twice as high on math tests as those students with teachers who are less qualified. Thus, we have anecdotal evidence and scientific evidence that a quality teacher has a tremendous impact on students. 
   One such outstanding teacher is Delise Teague, shown here in this portrait, who teaches English at McNairy Central High School in Selmer, TN. She knows firsthand the impact a quality teacher can have on a student. Using her words, she notes, ``I cannot take personal credit for my success as a classroom teacher. Great teachers shared the light with me. I am simply passing it on.'' 
   She adds it was her first Sunday School teacher whose influence ``served to fan the flame of learning that had been sparked at home by loving parents and an abundance of books.'' She will further tell you that she had several teachers in the public school system who played a key role in her own education and in her decision to pursue a career in teaching. The teachers who motivated Delise in her education were the ones who saw her untapped potential and challenged her. This is a lesson that Delise applies in her own classroom. She challenges her students and believes in their potential to succeed. 
   In fact, Courtney Carroll, a student at McNairy Central High School, wrote, ``Miss Teague is loved and respected by her students because she truly wants each person who enters her classroom to be successful.'' 
   Delise coaches the varsity softball team and freshman basketball team. She has served on the Technology Literacy Grant Committee, the National Honor Society Selection Committee, and as a student teacher supervisor/mentor. She is active in her community and takes on projects such as distributing fruit baskets for the elderly and providing gifts through the project Angel Tree for underprivileged children and contributing to Saint Jude's Children's Hospital through fundraising efforts. 
   She is just one wonderful example of the many dedicated teachers in our Nation's schools. In my own past I think of June Bowen, who taught me seventh grade English, and Mary Helen Lowry, who passed away this year, who taught me English through high school. I am so pleased to be able to participate in this effort to honor our Nation's teachers by promoting National Teacher Appreciation Week. 
   As parents and community members, we should all take a few minutes to celebrate this great cause for our children's future. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for a deliberative democracy, going to war is an agonizing task. It is a slow, cumbersome, sometimes combative process itself. It is discomforting to all. 
   With regards to Kosovo, I understand the President's vision of what our world should be and what the United States' role in such a world should be. I believe I also understand the foundations of his vision of the role of the United States in a Europe fundamentally different than the one into which NATO was born--where barbarians are not allowed to butcher, and where long term stability on the continent must be defended to maintain the standard of living we have fought so hard to achieve. 
   I also understand the intent of the authors and sponsors of this resolution. For our Nation to prevail in war, both the citizenry and the Congress must be united behind the Commander in Chief during times of war. I commend my colleague from Arizona for his intent. 
   As Members of the Senate, we must make no mistake about the importance of this vote, but we must also keep in mind the three critical interpretations  this vote represents, regardless of the specific wording of the resolution: 
   First, this vote will be interpreted as a vote on whether we approve of the President's strategy so far--a strategy which seems to have initially failed to achieve at least one of our primary goals: to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
   Second, this vote will be interpreted as a vote on what we believe the role of the Congress should be in the future prosecution of this unfolding war. 
   Third, and most important, this vote will be interpreted as a statement on whether we are willing to commit ground troops to invade Yugoslavia, and whether we are willing to risk a considerable sum in blood and treasure to meet those goals. 
   On all three accounts, the vote on this resolution is premature. The wisdom or failure of the President's strategy cannot yet be fully determined. More important, at the current time in our military campaign, with the decision of what means will be employed to achieve our ends still undetermined, it is premature for Congress to relinquish any future authority to say how this war will or will not be conducted. 
   While I said that I fully appreciate the importance of an unencumbered Commander in Chief, I also believe it is necessary for Congress to retain its limited but critical Constitutional role in declaring war. Such a vote, where that limited authority would be relinquished now at a time prior to the President specifically seeking it from the Congress, is tantamount to approval of the deployment of ground troops to invade Kosovo or other parts of Yugoslavia. That is a blessing I am not willing to give at this time--when the Commander in Chief has not even sought that approval. 
   Because the resolution is premature, I will not support it now. If the Commander in Chief believes this war must be expanded beyond the air campaign, he will have every opportunity to seek that authority. I will listen thoroughly and fulfill my Constitutional duties at that time. 
   For now, I will vote to table this resolution because such a vote does not tie the President's hands more that he has already. I certainly will not give aid and comfort to our enemies by voting against the possibility of using ground troops. My vote allows the President full range of options but does underscore my insistence that he more adequately address his rationale before the U.S. Congress and the American people before committing ground troops to battle.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the sponsor of this critical education bill that we have before us, I would like to thank Senator JEFFORDS, who is Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for his hard work on this bill that began well over a year ago. He really undertook the initiative and expressed his willingness to take this bill, a bill that will benefit millions of children in public schools all across this country, through his committee, not once but actually two different times, and then to shepherd it through the process of floor consideration and, most recently, the debate and discussion in the conference committee. 
   Last Congress, the chairman had a truly remarkable record of passing numerous education bills through Congress and having them signed into law. Most people in America are not aware of the significant number of bills, all of which get translated down to investing in the future by investing in our youth today. 
   Ed-Flex was the only one of all of those bills that we did not complete last year. It was unfinished last year and fell over into this year. I am glad the chairman took the initiative of saying this is the final building block from the last Congress and shepherded it through the legislative process to where we are today. Today we will have several hours of debate and ultimately a vote that I am confident will result in adoption of this conference report. It will ultimately be signed by the President of the United States, again to be translated into an investment in our children. 
   I think we all hope that the passage of Ed-Flex bodes well for another 2 years of positive education accomplishments in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   Mr. President, I started working on this bill to expand Ed-Flex with Senator RON WYDEN, who will address this body in a few minutes, along with Governors VOINOVICH and Carper at the National Governors' Association a little over a year ago. That occurred just following completion of a task force which was set into motion by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee who felt very strongly that an important role for us in the Senate Budget Committee is to provide oversight of existing programs. 
   Senator DOMENICI basically said: What I would like to do in the Budget Committee is look at some of the programs that we have out there in education. That task force resulted in us looking at a number of programs, one of which was a demonstration project called Ed-Flex. 
   Shortly after that oversight process, we began to ask more and more questions. We went to the Governors, and the Governors came to us. It became very clear that Governors--Democrat, Republican and Independent--felt very strongly that one of the most important things that we could do, if our  goal in this body is really to improve our public schools, 
   is go back and look at some of the problems. And one of the obvious problems the Governors pointed out was the excessive regulations--not the intended goals but the excessive regulations. The Governors addressed this, at the level of the National Governors' Association, and they came out with numerous statements. This is one of their statements from February 23 of this year in which they said:  
   Congress should grant all states this important tool that will accelerate the pace of school reform and move the nation closer to meeting its goal of raising student achievement. Congress should pass Ed-Flex now.  
   I am delighted that now is the time, that we will all have the opportunity to cast that final vote in this body, so that not just 12 States but all States in this country can have the opportunity to have increased flexibility, maintaining strong accountability with Ed-Flex. 
   In the task force in the Budget Committee, as many of my colleagues know, what we learned is not necessarily good news as we look at education. We spend billions of dollars every year on a system that, unfortunately, if we look at the final product--and that is an educated student--is failing our students miserably. Achievement levels are staggering at almost every age group in almost every subject matter. And if we compare our students to students in other countries, it appears that the longer a child is in an American school, the worse off he or she is when compared to their international counterparts. That is in the United States of America today. 
   At the same time, we see, as we look at this global comparison, that the world is getting smaller, barriers are falling down. Our students today are and will be competing internationally. New technologies and an increasingly global marketplace are fueling a growing need for well-educated workers who are able to compete with their peers worldwide. Unfortunately, we are equipping too few American students with the ability to compete in those jobs. 
   Ed-Flex is not a panacea; it is a first step. What this particular piece of legislation will do is take a demonstration project that is currently underway in the 12 States--which appear in yellow on this chart--and expand that opportunity of flexibility with accountability to all 50 States. We have a really clear-cut demonstration in States like Texas, where Ed-Flex programs have been implemented, that they have been successful in increasing student achievement. It is not a panacea though; again, in my mind, it is a first step. But it does shout certain things. It shouts that we can do better. It shouts the importance of elimination of unnecessary regulations. It shouts flexibility coupled with accountability. It shouts efficiency. And it shouts state and local control of education. 
   As we look forward, I suspect that we will devote a large portion of our legislative session to considering other education issues, many of which were discussed on the floor in our debate of Ed-Flex. These education reform measures will be addressed in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But Ed-Flex, the bill today, is, I believe, the first step in that process. 
   The success stories we have heard again and again come from innovation at the state and local level. I am sure all my colleagues in this body could share an example of one sort or another from their particular State of an innovative school, an innovative principal, innovative teachers. 
   One such in my own State of Tennessee is the Cason Lane Academy in Murfreesboro. Another example we have all heard about again and again in this body is the Chicago Public School System which went from being the--I quote--``worst school system in America,'' as deemed by then-Secretary of Education Bill Bennett, to a model for reform and innovation. 
   Part of the reason that both Cason Lane back in Murfreesboro, TN, and Chicago have been successful is that they have been free from some of the heavyhanded or shackling Government recommendations at both the State and the Federal level. Once they are freed from these regulations, clearly having a well-defined plan, having strong accountability built in, they have been able to creatively address some of the problems they face and give their students that opportunity to achieve a better education. 
   What our Ed-Flex bill does is give that same opportunity to States which do not have that opportunity today. It will give it to those states, and local schools and those local school districts so they will have the opportunity to meet the stated goals of Federal legislation, but how they meet those goals will be determined and based on local need. And that is what our Ed-Flex bill does. 
   We have heard a lot from Texas about the success there. Test scores have been on the rise for all students, even for those categorized as ``educationally disadvantaged'' who receive title I services. Paperwork demands on teachers and principals were dramatically reduced. The bureaucratic demands on their administrators were greatly reduced. Texas even claims that a whole new environment has been created that is--and I quote--``free of any real or perceived barriers to education reform.'' All States will be able to have that flexibility and that accountability. 
   I am pleased that Congress came together in a truly bipartisan way for what really should be and is a nonpartisan effort to enact this education reform. I was disappointed, however, that the Administration was very threatened by the provision which offered states greater flexibility in using appropriated dollars to either reduce class size or for individuals with disabilities in our school systems. That particular amendment is not part of the legislation we are debating today. 
   That Lott amendment would have given States yet another option how they would use that money. That was important, I believe, in the debate that came forward because Ed-Flex is about that fundamental principle of untying the hands of those people who are closest to our students, those people who are in the best position to identify what needs there might be--whether it is construction or class size or more computers or hooking up to the Internet. 
   The Lott amendment was very much in this same vein. I am disappointed that the President came forward and threatened to veto this particular vision to give States more choice. The Administration's veto threat, which we dealt with last week in the Conference Committee, I believe underlies the President's rhetoric about increased flexibility--which he made in this building during the State of the Union Message--but that in truth is more limited than what we see in reality. Nevertheless, I am delighted with the outcome of this particular bill to cut redtape, to increase flexibility in education. 
   I have enjoyed working with a number of Governors. Later in the afternoon I hope to be able to recognize some of them by name, a number of Members in the House of Representatives, and a number of Senators. 
   I am pleased that the 106th Congress has started out on such a positive note in addressing one of America's most pressing issues, and that is the education of our children. I am proud to have been a coauthor of this bill and look forward to seeing millions of schoolchildren benefit from an expanded Ed-Flex program. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, I want to thank my cosponsor, Senator WYDEN, as we have taken this bill forward, for all of his tremendous assistance on the task force last year, as well as today. 
   Also, because I mentioned the National Governors' Association, I want to very briefly point out how important was their participation in this legislation. Again, it was bipartisan from the outset. I think much of what we do in the future will be with the Governors, as we work together, recognizing the local control of education being so vital and important. Governor Carper, chairman of the National Governors' Association; Governor Ridge, chairman of the Republican Governors Association; Governor O'Bannon, chairman of the Democrat Governors Association; former Governor and now Senator VOINOVICH, who has been so instrumental in this legislation; and Governor Leavitt, vice chair of the NGA, as well. 
   At this juncture, I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from the great State of Missouri.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Technology Transfer Commercialization Act of 1999. 
   Technology transfer is a crucial link in the process that transforms research results into commercially viable products. The federal government's involvement in technology transfer arises naturally from its desire to encourage usage and commercialization of innovations resulting from federally-funded research. However, it is through further development, refinement, and marketing by the private sector that research results become diffused throughout the economy and generate growth. The private sector's active and timely participation in this process must be strongly encouraged if our competitiveness is to be enhanced. 
   Patents and licensing rights play key roles in the technology transfer process in that they provide strong economic incentives to industry. Studies have shown that research funding accounts for only 25 percent of the costs associated with bringing a new product to market. Increasingly, patent ownership is used as a means to recoup the investment through the incoming royalty stream. In addition, actual experience and studies concluded that if companies do not control the results of their investments, they are less likely to engage in related research and development. 
   Existing legislation encourages the transfer of technologies and closer collaborations between the Federal labs and industry by allowing the industry partners to obtain title to inventions that result from these collaborations. The Stevenson-Wydler Act and subsequent amendments created a framework to facilitate cooperative and development agreement (CRADAs) between industry and the Federal labs. The Bayh-Dole Act and subsequent amendments established policies for the licensing of federally-funded inventions. 
   The Technology Commercialization Act of 1999 improves upon both Stevenson-Wydler and Bayh-Dole by taking into consideration the increased competition in the marketplace. Provisions include streamlining the licensing procedure, and encouraging use of the electronic media to shorten the time requirements for public notice. This is in accordance with the fast pace required for doing business today. Other provisions include clarifications of criteria for granting any license, as well as exclusive and partially exclusive licenses. 
   Although technology transfer is important, such transfer should not compromise national security or substantially reduce competition in the marketplace. In response to these concerns, the Act requires the Office of Science and Technology Policy to study existing practices of CRADA creation in the agencies, and issue a report outlining review procedures for the creation of certain types of CRADAs. 
   The Act also lays the groundwork for a better understanding of the technology transfer process. Although there is consensus on the role of technology transfer in economic growth, there are no existing measures for understanding how much technology is transferred or how well the process works. Relevant questions include is the technology that is being transferred useful or successful, and are the inventions being produced in the federal labs relevant to the marketplace. As we transition into a knowledge-based economy, the management of knowledge movement will play a key role in sustaining our competitiveness. 
   In summary, technology transfer is crucial to our national economic growth. Therefore, both Senator Rockefeller and I ask for your support in enhancing our competitiveness and encouraging industry to work together with our federal agencies to create the best technologies possible.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my colleagues, Senators ROCKEFELLER and MACK to introduce legislation that will provide Medicare patients who are battling cancer with coverage of their health care costs when they participate in approved clinical trials. For patients suffering from life-threatening illness such as cancer, the opportunity to participate in clinical trials often offers them their best hope for access to the latest and most advanced treatment modalities. 
   Medicare currently does not pay the costs of patient care associated with clinical trials because they are experimental therapies. Our bill proposes that we begin a demonstration project through Medicare--the nation's largest third party payor--to provide coverage of routine patient costs associated with approved cancer clinical trials. It is a demonstration program because there has been much debate over the costs associated with clinical trials and a clear need exists to gather better cost data. Unfortunately, dispute still exists over how to distinguish between routine patient costs and those associated with the trial. The full impact on health care costs is not yet known. 
   Thus our bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct this demonstration project to study the feasibility of covering patient costs for beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer and enrolled in clinical trials approved by the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Defense, and the Department of Veteran Affairs. The Secretary is required to report to Congress concerning the incremental costs attributed to the trial and the advisability of covering other diseases. Once Congress has these data in hand, we will be able to make the determination to enact legislation to make the coverage of routine care costs in clinical trials a permanent part of the Medicare program. 
   We have spent many years debating this bill and urging the Administration to begin this demonstration project. As a research investigator involved in clinical trials, as a thoracic cancer surgeon, and as co-director of the Thoracic Oncology Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, I know first-hand the critical importance of clinical trials in determining the very best therapies in our battles against cancer. Only through participation in clinical trials can we advance quality care for patients with cancer. 
   Since I have come to the United States Senate, I have urged my colleagues to make federal funding for both basic and clinical research a national priority by doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health over the next five years. Last year we witnessed an historic increase of $2 billion that brought us closer to this goal. But we cannot stop there. If we do not capitalize on this investment by further supporting our clinical research infrastructure and the conduct of clinical trials, we will not reap the full benefits of our investment. 
   Clinical trials are scientific studies that allow us to investigate how new medicines and clinical treatments work in patients. Patients should recognize that clinical trials are by their nature investigational and therefore are not a magic bullet or without risk. Patients should be 
   fully informed of the potential benefits and, equally important, the potential risks of participating in a clinical investigation. With this in mind, patients should be given the opportunity to participate in clinical investigations which may allow them to receive cutting-edge treatments that may improve their chances of survival. Clinical investigations advance our scientific knowledge and help bring about medical innovations to find better treatments for patients. 
   We must continue to foster both public and private efforts to support clinical trials. I believe our foremost federal responsibility is to address access to clinical trials in our publicly-financed programs such as Medicare. We must first determine the criteria the Medicare program will use to evaluate which clinical trials are eligible for coverage and which costs will be covered. This has not been an easy task. 
   We have also been reviewing the proposal to require private health plans and insurers to cover routine costs associated with standard patient care while participating in a clinical trial. The Senate Health and Education Committee, on which I serve, had an informative debate last month on the issue of clinical trials coverage during our consideration of S. 326, ``The Patients' Bill of Rights.'' The amendment we were considering went beyond the Medicare demonstration project by requiring private sector health plans to cover costs associated with clinical trials for patients with any life-threatening or serious illness. Several members of our committee, including myself, expressed concern that before mandating such broad requirements on the private sector, we should first determine what costs would be incurred. In a time of rising health care costs, we must be cautious in our efforts to provide patient protections that do not drive up costs further or we will not be serving patients well. 
   Therefore, I offered an amendment to have a comprehensive study conducted by the Institute of Medicine to assess patient access to clinical trials and the coverage of routine patient care costs by private health plans and insurers. Our efforts should not end there. That is just the beginning. I am encouraged by recent collaborative efforts between the National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Health Plans to increase participation of patients in clinical trials and to encourage health plans to cover routine patient costs. We need to monitor this effort closely and explore other ways to promote public-private collaboration and to gather the necessary data that will reveal the true impact on health care costs. I will continue to pursue this effort in a systematic way with my colleagues. 
   We must not wait any longer to launch the Medicare demonstration project that our bill today addresses. The longer we wait, the longer patients are denied access to potentially life-saving therapies and the longer it will take for new therapies to become standard therapy. And we must continue to address the issue of clinical trial coverage by the private sector to bring about patients' access to new clinical therapies while being mindful of the costs we are imposing. Patients and their families deserve that we give thoughtful consideration to both of these legislative proposals this year.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to focus for a minutes on an important, yet often ignored aspect of the federal budget--our investment in R&D. While I strongly support the Chairman's contention that we must strive to stay within the budget caps, I also firmly believe that funding for research and development should be allowed to grow in fiscal year 2000 and beyond. Many economists argue that such an investment, through its impact on economic growth, will not drain our resources, but will actually improve our country's fiscal standing. 
   A dozen economic studies, including those of Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, have demonstrated that technological progress has historically been the single most important factor in economic growth, having more than twice the impact of labor and capital. In today's booming economy, this fact is particularly evident. Our high tech companies provide one third of our economic output and generate one half of our economic growth. More amazing is the realization that communications and technology stocks now comprise 80% of the value of the stock market. 
   But it is crucial for everyone to understand that our prosperous high tech companies and revolutionary applications of today were created by scientific advances that occurred in the 1960's, when the U.S. government was prioritizing its resources on R&D. In 1965, the federal government spent 2.2% on civilian and defense R&D, as a fraction of GDP. Now in 1999, we spend approximately 0.8 percent--almost one third of its value. If Congress were to follow the President's current budget, the number would dramatically decrease in the next five years. 
   We simply cannot afford not to invest in R&D. Our future prosperity depends on maintaining an innovative environment--with a solid research base and robust talent pool. If we allow our investment in our innovative capacity to continue to slip, current policy commitments and rates of reinvestment may not be high enough to sustain future improvements in our standard of living. 
   I urge each of you to join me in cosponsoring this Sense of the Senate that outlines budgetary goals for increasing the federal investment in R&D in a fiscally responsible manner over time. 
   Thank you.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when East Tennessee State University opened its doors in 1911, it had 29 students and one primary mission: the education of future teachers. A lot has changed in 85 years. 
   While teacher preparation is still a crucial part of its mission, ETSU today consists of nine schools and colleges that offer over 125 different programs of study to more than 12,000 students every year--including some fairly unique offerings such as its one-of-a-kind master's degree in reading and storytelling, and the only bluegrass and country music program offered at a four-year institution. 
   Over the last two decades, there has been an increasing emphasis on the health sciences at ETSU--an emphasis that began in 1974 with the establishment of the James H. Quillen College of Medicine which was created to help alleviate a critical shortage of primary care physicians in East Tennessee. 
   Mr. President, this year the Quillen College of Medicine celebrates its 25th anniversary. But that proud accomplishment, although noteworthy, is not the basis for my remarks this morning. Rather, I rise to commend its recent listing in U.S. News and World Report as one of the ``Best Graduate Schools'' in the Nation--a ranking well-deserved and well-earned. 
   According to the magazine, Quillen College earned the distinction of placing third among all the schools in the Nation for its programs in rural medicine. Last year, it placed sixth in the same category. 
   I also rise, Mr. President, to commend the ETSU College of Nursing--which was also ranked among the Nation's best. And, like Quillen College, this is also the second year in a row it was so honored. 
   Both these schools, Mr. President, embrace the values of the people of Tennessee. Both are community oriented, both provide a valuable resource to local citizens and businesses, and both are making valuable and needed contributions to the practice and the quality of medicine. 
   My heartiest congratulations to the entire staff, faculty, students and alumni of both East Tennessee State University School of Nursing and the James H. Quillen College of Medicine for their splendid accomplishment.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the primary sponsor of S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act (Ed-Flex), I am pleased that the Senate passed this legislation by a 98 to 1 margin on March 11, 1999. In addition, the House of Representatives passed the companion bill on the same day by a vote of 330 to 90. This bicameral, bipartisan support for Ed-Flex is a positive first step for education reform in the 106th Congress. 
   This first step in education reform is desperately needed. Critics of our education system note that the federal government provides only seven percent of funds in education, but requires 50 percent of the paperwork. In addition, more often than not, well-intentioned federal programs come with stringent regulations and directives which tie the hands of school officials and teachers. As the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee's Task Force on Education, I have heard the pleas from states and localities for greater flexibility in administering federal programs in exchange for increased accountability. This theme has been echoed as I travel around Tennessee visiting schools and holding education roundtable discussions for teachers, principals, superintendents, parents, school board officials, and other interested members of the community. 
   The First Ed-Flex bill passed by Congress will provide greater flexibility coupled with increased accountability for our nation's schools. Specifically, this bill will allow every state the option to participate in the enormously popular Ed-Flex demonstration program already in place in twelve states. The twelve state currently participating in the program are: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Vermont. 
   Ed-Flex frees responsible states from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming federal regulations, so long as states are complying with certain core federal principles, such as civil rights, and so long as states are making progress toward improving their students' performance. Under the Ed-Flex program, the Department of Education delegates to the states its power to grant individual school districts temporary waivers from certain federal requirements that interfere with state and local efforts to improve education. To be eligible, a state must waive its own regulations on schools. It must also hold schools accountable for results by setting academic standards and measuring student performance. Using this accountability system, states are required to monitor the performance of local education agencies and schools that have received waivers, including the performance of students affected by these waivers. At any time, either the state or the Secretary of Education can terminate a waiver. 
   The twelve states that currently participate in Ed-Flex have used this flexibility to allow school districts innovate and better use federal resources to improve students outcomes. For instance, the Phelps Luck Elementary School in Howard County, Maryland used its waiver to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading students who have the greatest need in grade 1-5. They also used their waiver to lower the average student/teacher ratio in mathematics and reading form 25/1 to 12/1.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on March 4, 1999, Robert Lawrence Inman, or ``Coach Inman,'' as he was known to his friends--and everyone who ever met him was his friend--``slipped the surly bonds of earth,'' and, I am sure, passed into the waiting arms of his Lord and Savior. 
   He left behind a loving family. He left behind a grateful community. He left behind two generations of Nashville youth, including my own, who learned much more from Coach Inman than how to succeed on the athletic field. 
   They learned that kindness is contagious, that a smile is a wonderful gift, that the path to success is paved not with lesson plans and study guides but with encouragement and with support. They learned that life is not about just winning or losing, but about being the best that you possibly can be. 
   At his funeral last Saturday, at the First Methodist Church in Franklin, TN, the pews were literally packed with people whose lives he had touched in so many personal ways: Fellow teachers from the Ensworth School in Nashville, where he taught for over 30 years, fellow coaches from the Harpeth Valley Athletic Conference--a local sports league he founded for seventh and eighth graders--and family and friends and, of course, students, young and old. For almost all of them, graduation was not the end of their friendship; it continued through college and through marriage and through children of their own. 
   They literally packed the pews; they lined the walls; they billowed over from the balcony; they crammed the choir loft; they spilled out into the vestibule and literally overflowed into the street--all in an outpouring of love and enthusiasm for a man whose love for children was boundless. 
   What made him so special? Students of all ages who remembered him last week answered that question far better than I ever could. Their words:  
   He was always smiling. His smile alone would make you feel better.  
   Another said,  
   He always had a story to tell to motivate you--and if he didn't, he'd make one up.  
   Said another,  
   He liked to tell jokes and play tricks to make you laugh.  
   And yet another,  
   He always showed he cared--whether it was just a word of welcome, or something much more serious--like tending to injuries in body and spirit.  
   Realizing that learning does not just end at the school door, Coach Inman started a tradition of outdoor education, initially in the glorious mountains over East Tennessee. There were camping trips with students, all where the students could practice problem-solving or study the stars or really just be together and have a good time. 
   When some of his students suggested that, ``Well, we should have one more outing after graduation,'' then began the famous Inman ``Out West'' trip, an excursion into the truly great outdoors of Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon and the Redwood Forest. 
   Each summer these trips would be the focal point for scores of children. In fact, several of the Frist family children, including my own son Harrison, shared Coach Inman's ``Out West'' adventure--a time that I know they will never forget. 
   What did they learn from him? Well, in the words of one little girl:  
   I learned how special it is to stand at the top of the Grand Canyon and realize that--like the water--if we try hard enough, and stay at it long enough, we too can create our own wonders. ..... 
   I learned that--every now and then--you should stop to look at an old tree because it has learned how to reach up to the clouds and still keep its roots in the earth. ..... 
   I learned that beauty is everywhere ..... how nice it feels to fall asleep to the sound of a stream ..... how bright the moon can look from the top of a mountain. 
   I learned that there is a way to teach people without lecturing, and that sharing with someone who you are and where you've been is one of the best gifts that you can give. ..... 
   I learned that love isn't about conditions ..... that there are good people in the world.  
   And she continued:  
   If it hadn't been for Coach Inman, his words wouldn't be the ones I still hear when I'm afraid or nervous telling me that I can do anything and that there are people who will support me--even if I fall. 
   If I could build a mountain, or paint a sky to tell him how much a part of my life he is, then the mountain would stretch out past the clouds and the sky would be the color of smiles and laughter and it would tell him that I love him.  
   Mr. President, children weren't the only ones who appreciated Robert Inman. He was six times honored by the Peabody College of Vanderbilt University as an outstanding educator. Singer Amy Grant--herself a former Inman student--donated the funds necessary to refurbish the Ensworth Elementary gym on the condition it be named for Coach Inman. 
   Commenting on this gift at his funeral, his friend and fellow teacher, Nathan Sawyer, noted that the Egyptian pharaohs believed that if their names were written somewhere they would live forever. Thus, he said, every time a stranger sees that name over the gym and asks who it was that was so honored, the Robert Inman story will begin again. 
   True enough. But I think he needn't worry. For as the poet Albert Pike said:  
   What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.  
   At a time when there is so much concern about the state of American education, so much concern about the quality of teachers, the lack of good and virtuous example, it is reassuring to know that there was a teacher of the caliber and the character of Robert Inman. 
   To his loving wife, Helen--who shared his life and his passion for children--and to their three wonderful sons, Michael, Matthew, and John--our love and support. Although Coach Inman is no longer with us, his memory will live on in the inscription over the gym, on the football fields, on the  basketball courts, at the wrestling matches, at the track meets, but most of all in the minds and in the spirits and the hearts of all the children he touched; children who, indeed, are better people because there was a teacher who cared, a teacher named Robert Lawrence Inman.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is an exciting day because education in the United States is off to a fresh start. The underlying bill, which I am hopeful and confident will be passed later today, does something that previous bills out of this body did not do, and that is cut redtape. It combines flexibility and allows local innovation, local creativity to emerge, with strong accountability built in to give our students--and that is the purpose--to give our students the best chance to receive a solid and a strong education to prepare them for the millennium which is just around the corner. 
   Ed-Flex is not a panacea. We have been very careful, as sponsors of this bill, to point out it is not a panacea to our Nation's educational systems' woes, but it is a strong bipartisan, bicameral first step. It is a first step to unshackle the hands of our teachers, to unshackle the hands of our administrators, of our principals--all who are working hard every day to educate our children. You look around at the success of Ed-Flex, whether it is just around the corner in Phelps Luck School in Maryland where waiver authority was granted to reduce class size, or in Kansas where Ed-Flex has made it possible to implement all-day kindergarten, or in many of the States that have access to Ed-Flex now to reduce paperwork. After today, coupled with the passage in the House of Representatives just a few hours ago, and ultimately to be signed by the President, we can give these opportunities to all States, to all children, to all schools in this country. 
   I am proud to have been an original author and original sponsor of this particular bill. I am very appreciative of the manager and his conduct of the floor proceedings over the last several days, and I especially want to thank the Governors with whom I have worked very closely over the last several weeks to accomplish passage of this bill. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I, too, will be very brief. 
   I believe that today has been almost a momentous day, and a very important day to set the stage, I believe, for the way, the manner, and the spirit in which I hope to see a lot of legislation be addressed over the coming months in the remainder of this Congress. 
   We started off with a bill that originated out of really a town meeting format where we have had people come and testify on the task force, and listen very carefully. People came forward, and said, ``We have a program that works.'' 
   To be honest with you, 2 years ago I didn't know what Ed-Flex was. But somebody came forward, and said in a community, as my colleague has just pointed out, that this program works. 
   We fulfilled exactly what the Federal mandate was, and what the Federal intention was. We took the appropriate funding--the Federal dollars that came down. But what the Federal Government allowed us to do through a waiver was to participate through Ed-Flex to accomplish that stated goal of fulfilling the intent of Congress, but in a way that we knew was best for us based on our local circumstances. 
   Not everybody needs a computer, not everybody needs tutoring, not everybody needs kindergarten, not everybody needs an extra teacher, but that varies from community to community, and the beauty of that is we took that idea, we discussed it, we developed legislation, we passed it through the committee last year, but we ran out of time last year. It was brought to the floor. It was one of the first major bills brought to this body, and after 7 days of intense debate, a lot of negotiation, we passed the bill here 10 minutes ago. 
   It is a momentous day also because the House passed a very similar bill, almost an identical bill, about 6 hours ago. And that means, because in a bipartisan way, in a bicameral way, meaning both the House and Senate, in a Federal, State and local way, meaning we worked very closely with the Governors, together we were able to pass legislation which, once it is signed by the President, can inure to the benefit of millions of children within 6 months or 8 months--millions of children. And that is nice. That is what people expect Government to do; produce in a spirit, in an environment where you can work together to accomplish the goals that we all care about. 
   A lot of people should be thanked, and again most of those names will be made a part of the RECORD, but I do want to recognize the coauthor and cosponsor of this particular bill, Senator WYDEN, who just had the floor. 
   Again, this is a bipartisan bill. Both of us knew what our goals were. We worked very hard on both sides. I appreciate his support, his collegiality as we addressed these issues. 
   As is so often the case, what we have accomplished in large part is as a result of the work of many staff members, and I do want to take this opportunity to thank the staff who were most 
   immediately involved over the last year and a half. My own staff of Meredith Medley, Lori Meyer and Gus Puryear have literally been here with other staff members until early hours of the morning each night. 
   Again, most everybody has been recognized already, but I am going to take the liberty of going ahead and verbally mentioning them. Lindsay Rosenberg of Senator WYDEN's staff has been somebody whom my staff has enjoyed and I personally have enjoyed working with in this process as we have gone through it. 
   Senator JEFFORDS, the chairman, who has literally been in the Chamber every day for the last 7 days, does have the patience of Job going through this, looking at every bill and every word that comes forward with a response. And I just want to express my appreciation because he ushered this thing through in a very direct way and really put in both the time and the effort. He is the leader on our side in education. We cited again and again the number of bills passed last year under his leadership as chairman of the former Labor, Health and Education Committee. Currently, he is examining all public education, K through 12, through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I have the privilege of working on that committee with him and his wonderful staff who have been at his side. Mark Powden, Susan Hattan and Sherry Kaiman really all deserve our gratitude for their tremendous work over the last several days. 
   I am not going to list all the staff, but Senator GREGG, again, from whom we have heard so much about special education; Senator LOTT, who needs to be thanked because it would have been very easy after 3 or 4 days, when it looked as if gridlock--it was gridlock, but he, with the Democratic leader, agreed to keep this bill in the Chamber so we could address those issues, and that is what the American people expect. We addressed it with very good, very strong debate, sometimes too strong maybe, but we were able to work it out. And that bipartisanship in coming together, again, is what the American people expect. I thank the majority leader for allowing us to bring this to a resolution, to completion, to a product that we know will benefit, as I said, millions of children in the short term as well as the longer term. 
   I have to just briefly mention the Governors because it has been a fantastic relationship for me over the last month in that at least every day we, a Federal body, the Congress, the Senate, were in touch with all of our Governors, Democrat and Republican. I have talked to as many Democrat Governors as I have Republican, and America doesn't see that sort of interaction, but I think it is important for people to hear because so many problems, whether they be welfare, health care, or education, demand that constant dialog and discussion about what we do here at the Federal level, at the State level, as well as the local level. 
   Senator VOINOVICH, who is new to this body but a former Governor, spearheaded much of that. Governors Carper of Delaware, Ridge of Pennsylvania, Leavitt of Utah, O'Bannon of Indiana, and House Members Castle and Roemer  all played a major role and were significant participants in what we have accomplished today. 
   With that, I think I will stop. I am very excited about this particular bill. It accomplishes much in a way that I think will really set that track for the next several months as we consider other legislation. We do have a fresh start for education. It is a first step. It does not address all the 
   problems, all the challenges in education, but it is a major first step. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, first, I commend the manager of the bill for an outstanding job. It has been now several days that we have been on a bill that to me is a very exciting bill, because we know, based on how it has been used in 12 States, that it is an effective bill, a bill that works, a bill that helps our children learn, a bill that unties the hands of our teachers and our school boards and our local schools. 
   It is a bill that costs not one single cent. How many bills go through here that really don't cost the taxpayer anything? Yet, the money we spend today is spent more efficiently, more effectively, with more local input, with the education of our children being the goal and demonstrated results which, if I have time, I will review some of those results that we know today. 
   Let me, as background, refer to a chart that is so confusing. I do not want my colleagues in the room to even try to look at the details of this chart, but let me tell you what the chart is. Basically, I asked the General Accounting Office, which is an objective body that comes in and helps us evaluate existing programs, how well are we doing in terms of spending education dollars and resources today and how is it organized. 
   I have a 15-year-old, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. If you take a child, a 13-year-old, we know the objective is to educate them, prepare them for a job, to have a fulfilling life, to prepare them for the next millennium. What are the programs we are putting forth since we are failing them--and let me make that point clear, we are failing our children today, when we compare ourselves to countries all over the world. We are failing them. What are we doing? We have to do better. 
   If we take what we are doing today for, say, young children, 
   look around the outside, the outside. The target here says ``young children.'' This says ``at-risk and delinquent youth.'' This says ``teachers.'' 
   For young children, how many programs do we have focusing on young children today? And the answer is: Department of Justice has two programs, the Department of Labor has seven programs; ACTION has one program; the State Justice Institute, a program; the Corporation for National Community Service, six; the General Services Administration has a program; the Department of Agriculture, coming all the way down, has six programs. Again, the point of this--whether you are looking at at-risk and delinquent youth or teachers or young children--is that we have numerous programs, overlapping programs that are really all well intentioned, many of which start in this body as another good program just like many of the nongermane amendments to my underlying Ed-Flex bill. What is happening is we have another few blocks, another few programs  to add to this chart, and that is really not what we need today. What we need today is to have better organization, at least initially, and then have the debate about where resources should come in, how these resources should be spent; how we can coordinate, not duplicate, not have overlap. 
   I say that because my simple bill is a bill that basically says let's give our local schools and schoolteachers and school districts a little more flexibility to innovate, to be creative, to take into account what they know are the needs of their school. It might be one-on-one teaching. It might be smaller class size, though let me just say I was on the phone this morning with three Governors: ``Class size is good, but the ratio in my State already is 18 to 1,'' said one of the Governors. Another said, ``The class size in my State is 19 to 1 right now. We have already solved the class size problem. Our real challenge is to have one-on-one tutoring for grades 1, 2 and 3 so they can at least learn how to read early on. Give us that flexibility to meet the same stated goals; that is, educating maybe a group of economically disadvantaged children--educating them but taking into consideration what my teachers say, what my parents say, what my principals say, what my school district says, and don't you, up in Washington, tell me how to use those resources because that is not what I need.'' 
   The point is, you can use them for what you want as long as you meet the stated goal in statute, what we have set out to use that money for. 
   Real quickly, what do we have today? I am from Tennessee. Tennessee is not in yellow on this map. The States that are in yellow are those States that have Ed-Flex today, a demonstration program started in 1994 with 6 States, 2 years later another 6 States added so we have 12 States. We have data from these States. I will cite some of the data from Texas because they have had longstanding experience with it with very good data. I will show you some of that data. But the Senator from Massachusetts, who is on the floor, feels very passionately about adding more programs--and that debate has to take place and should take place, but just not on this bill. It is currently taking place in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as we speak. There are hearings ongoing, looking into all elementary and secondary education where we are looking at all of the resources. We are looking at that overlap that is there. We are looking at objectives and goals. All that is ongoing. 
   What we are saying is, yes, all of these amendments are important to look at, but let's concentrate on this single Ed-Flex bill, get it to the American people, to their benefit, today. My Ed-Flex bill simply takes what is existing in these 12 States and expands it to all 50 States, paying that respect to that local school, that local school district, those parents and those teachers. 
   The Democratic Governors' Association--it has to be confusing to the American people because we have a bill that is supported by every Governor in the United States of America. It is supported by the population at large, hugely supported by the population. There are Democratic cosponsors in this very body. It is a bipartisan bill. RON WYDEN of Oregon is my cosponsor and we are out front fighting for this bill in a clean state, yet we have this filibuster that is going on, where we have cloture votes, procedural votes that say we are going to stop this bill. I am offended for that in part because of my children, and in part because I feel I am responsible to the American people to make sure the younger generation is educated well compared to school districts in a State or compared to around the country or compared globally, where we are failing today. That is our obligation. 
   It has to be confusing because we have this body filibustering a bill that has broad support, that the President of the United States just a year ago recommended. A week ago he said pass that bill. Secretary Riley of the Department of Education says it is right on target, it is a superb bill--he has endorsed that bill. That is what is difficult and must be confusing. 
   Let me show you what the Democratic Governors' Association 
   said in a letter to us on February 22:  
   Democratic Governors strongly support this effort to vest state officials with more control over the coordination of Federal and state regulatory and statutory authority in exchange for requiring more local school accountability.  
   I think that is an important point because you have the issue of flexibility, of innovation, of creativity. But we have to have tough accountability built in. Why? Because when you give anybody flexibility and give them a little more leeway to meet those stated goals, you want to make sure that they are held accountable for meeting those goals and if they are not, taking that flexibility away. That accountability is built in very strongly. 
   The Democratic Governors--and remember that is where the filibuster is coming from, it is on the Democratic side--but the Democratic Governors tell us ``Most important, S. 280''--and that is this bill, the Ed-Flex bill, the bill we are debating today--``maintains careful balance needed between flexibility and accountability.'' 
   That balance was carefully crafted. I think that is why the bill has so much support; 17 to 1 out of the committee. It is rare for a bill to come out of a committee discussion, again, bipartisan, 17 to 1 this past year.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me make it clear, when I came to the floor there was nobody from the other side here, so that is one of the reasons I wanted to go ahead and use this opportunity to lay out where we are today. 
   Let me take one more minute or so, because this accountability/flexibility is very important. The broad support that my colleague and, really, cosponsor of the bill, Senator WYDEN, has referred to is this broad support that we feel when we go back to our town meetings and we talk to people. The broad support starts at the level of those parents, people in the schools, the teachers, the educational establishment, who have said--and I have shown this on the board--this is a step in the right direction, up through the Governors and their strong bipartisan support. The difference in how we get there is, I think, where the debate is. That is what I am hopeful we can reach, working together with some sort of agreement. 
   I again want to thank my colleague, Senator WYDEN, because this bill came out of us working together in a task force, listening to the American people as we go forward. 
   Let me just close and basically show again, without going into the details, that we have some demonstrated results from Ed-Flex and how beneficial it can be. That is why we feel so passionately about getting this bill through. 
   This is from Texas statewide results. The categories: African American students did twice as well when they were in an Ed-Flex program. Hispanic students in Texas did twice as well in an Ed-Flex program. The economically disadvantaged students improved 7 percent versus 16 percent, again, in an Ed-Flex program. 
   This essence of accountability and flexibility is part of this bill. I plead with my colleagues to pull back this inordinate number, excessive number, of nongermane amendments so we can pass this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Hopefully, in a few minutes we will have word on some sort of final agreement as we move forward. I know we are making progress in terms of the negotiations. I hope we can advance this bill through the Senate. It is  very disappointing that we have all of the politics above and before an excellent, superb policy that has good evidence behind it. 
   I want to respond to my colleague who talked about the waivers and the potential for abuse and money channeled to other populations. We have to make it clear that this is not a block grant. This isn't money that can be used for any purpose whatsoever. The great thing about this bill is the money that is being directed--that 7 percent of Federal dollars--still goes to the stated purpose, with the stated accountability guaranteed by the bill. 
   This whole hypothetical that these States with waivers can take this money and rechannel it away from targeted goals is really absurd. If we look at the history, this isn't hypothetical policy. We can look back and see what the 12 States have done, including the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These waivers have not been abused. Regarding these States who have put the waivers forward, the GAO came back and told us in November 1998:  
   The Department of Education officials told us they believe the 12 current Ed-Flex States have used their waiver authority carefully and judiciously.  
   That is one of the rare pieces of legislation where we have a track record, and we can go back and even strengthen it, which is what we did in accountability. In the field of accountability, across the board, with great care, we built in accountability at the local level, the State level, and the Federal level. This tier approach on this chart--at the bottom is the local level--outlines what we put into this bill to guarantee that the waivers are not abused in any way, and those goals are achieved at the State level and at the Federal level. I know we just have a few minutes. 
   I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Maine.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the next 60 minutes we will be addressing our children's education, which is a continuation of the debate that we brought to the floor last week. Although the debate has ranged from the initial presentation of the bill to various amendments, it is the underlying bill that I would like to spend a few moments discussing. 
   The Ed-Flex bill is a simple bill, a straightforward bill, and a bipartisan bill. It was brought to the Senate floor last week in order to pass it through the Senate, have it pass through the House of Representatives, have it sent to the President of the United States, and signed so that all 50 States would be able to take advantage of a program on which we have a 5-year history, that has been demonstrated to work, that was initially applied in six States, and then another six States. There are 38 States such as Tennessee that do not have access to an Ed-Flex program. 
   Ed-Flex is a program which basically says that individual schools and school districts and communities would be able to obtain waivers to be able to meet very specific education goals to educate their children, but they can do it in a way that is free of the Washington bureaucratic regulations, the excessive redtape which we hear again and again is shackling the hands of our schools and our teachers who are working so hard to educate our children, to prepare them for a future full of opportunities, to prepare them for that next millennium which we all talk about in such glowing terms. Yet we recognize that in spite of giving the system a lot of money, in spite of progress in structure, we are failing our children. We are not preparing them for that next millennium. 
   So now is the time to pay attention to what people are telling us, to what parents are telling us, what principals are telling us, what teachers are telling us. We need to respect the needs of the local communities, because each community is different, rather than thinking in this body that we can decide if you put more teachers there, you are going to do better without telling them what the quality of that teacher might be or telling them that you need just another computer, and if we put that computer in your classroom, your students will do better. 
   No, we should listen to the schools that say let us take those same resources--we know what it takes to educate our children--let us carry out our type of program free of the bureaucracy, free of this administrative burden. And that is what Ed-Flex is all about. This particular bill costs nothing. 
   We have heard of a number of well-intended programs talked about this morning and introduced as amendments, really loading down our bill, but they cost $200 million here, $500 million here, $1 billion here, $6 billion here, $12 billion over 6 years. 
   We should have that debate at some point because we know that we are not educating our children nearly as well as we should, and we need to debate resources. And we most appropriately are doing that in the committee structure right now where we are looking at all of the elementary and secondary education programs through the reauthorization process. We have heard repeatedly that we should not just add one more program to the already more than 250 programs with which we have been trying to educate our children. We hear too often: Let's add this program and that will take care of our problems today. 
   Well, it sounds good and it makes good sound bites and it may even poll well, but it is absurd to think that one program is going to solve our education problems. So let's start with the basics. The Ed-Flex bill includes flexibility at the local level, gets rid of Washington redtape, provides strong accountability provisions built in at the local level, at the State level, and at the Federal level. For instance, performance standards and content standards are built into our Ed-Flex bill, as well as issues at the State level such as corrective action and technical assistance, and accountability is built in at the State level and at the Federal level. In fact, the Secretary of the Department of Education can at any time terminate a waiver. 
   Ed-Flex means greater local control for education decisions, has no cost to taxpayers, and is supported by all 50 Governors. Just 20 minutes ago I was talking to a Governor, and I basically said here we are, in Washington. We have a bill that is supported by every Governor in the United States of America. If we are allowed--and we are going to try again with the cloture vote today--to bring this bill to the floor for a vote, I bet you it will pass 99 to 1. That is how good the bill is. Yet, because of political posturing, because of polls, because of an agenda that someone else has, some have come to the floor of the Senate and are holding the bill hostage. 
   When I mentioned the Ed-Flex bill while traveling across Tennessee Saturday and Sunday talking to parents--I was in three high schools--parents basically said, what is going on in Washington, DC? I thought now was the time for nonpartisanship, for coming together, for bipartisanship. I thought you had finished the gridlock that we have seen in Washington. ``We expect more out of you, Senator FRIST.'' And I said, ``Yes, I will go back, and I will do my very best.'' Yet, I come back and again its gridlock. 
   Our bill very simply means education flexibility. It costs nothing, it has bipartisan support, and provides flexibility and accountability. Everything else you have heard about over the last few years is a new program, costing billions of dollars--silver bullets. People say, ``That's what we need because it sounds good. I go home and I talk to parents. They don't know what education flexibility is all about. But I tell them about adding quantity, adding numbers of teachers, and they listen. Well, that is the whole point. We need to do what is right. We don't need to do just what sounds good because what sounds good doesn't work. For the last 30 years we have done what sounds good, but without any improvement whatsoever. 
   We need Ed-Flex. We have to forget this gridlock. In the next 45 minutes or so, that will be our discussion. 
   I see that my distinguished colleague from the great State of Florida has arrived, and I would like to yield 10 minutes to my colleague.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would love the opportunity to respond to that, because that is exactly right. It is crystal clear that these are important issues in all of these amendments, all of which are so well intended, all of which sound so good. The point is, as we speak, right now in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the large bill in which all resources going into kindergarten through 12th grade is being addressed, the committee is looking at how effective they are, how they interrelate to each other--because right now we have 180 or 190 or 200 programs, all in K-12 education, all with their own little bureaucracies, all well-intended, but with huge overlap, huge duplication, huge waste. Again the goals are very good, but we have a process to look at all of those. 
   That is ongoing as we speak. Hearings are going on right now in that particular committee on every one of these issues. That is the appropriate forum, not to bring them to the floor, especially when they cost $12 and $15 billion. And now is our opportunity, now, to pass that single, straightforward, education flexibility, no-cost, demonstrated-that-it-works, bipartisan-supported bill, and that is where the gridlock is.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida because he really has hit the nail right on the head. We have a bill, Ed-Flex, with flexibility, with accountability, with broad support among the American people. That bill will help the American children, No. 1. 
   No. 2, we have Members on the opposite side of the aisle who recognize they can kill this bill. They can kill this bill. They cannot vote for cloture and therefore effectively filibuster this bill, but at the same time, hide the fact that is actually hurting our children. We hear, again, of all these well-intentioned programs. ``Oh, if we can pass those, we can help our children.'' Let's recognize the facts. By killing this bill, by filibustering this bill, they are preventing something which is demonstrated to work for our children from being delivered to our children right now. 
   Delaying tactics will put it off for a couple of years. Yes, it will eventually pass, but why not give our children something today? Why deny them that? Because of gridlock? Because they want to define an agenda or they want to take the President's agenda and bring it to the floor? It is hurting the children. We need Ed-Flex. We cannot tolerate gridlock. 
   I see my distinguished colleague from Georgia is on the floor. I would like to turn to him. Let me just briefly quote from a letter from the Democratic Governors' Association from 2 weeks ago, February 22, 1999, just to demonstrate the broad support and how what is happening on the other side, the obstruction, doesn't represent what the Democratic Governors tell us. They say:  
   Democratic Governors strongly support this effort to vest state officials with more control over the coordination of federal and state regulatory and statutory authority in exchange for requiring more local school accountability. *.*.*.*.* 
   Most importantly, S. 280 [which is our bill, the underlying bill here] maintains the careful balance needed between flexibility and accountability.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
   The underlying bill is the Ed-Flex bill, which is a bill that I and Senator WYDEN introduced in a bipartisan way, supported by all 50 Governors, a straightforward bill which strips away Washington redtape, which empowers our teachers to teach instead of filling out paperwork. Seven percent of the Federal money is coming down with over 50 percent of the Government regulations there. Strip it away so that they can really teach, accomplish the objectives we set out for them, meet the standards of accountability, and we will be able to innovate, offer some creativity. 
   This bill all of a sudden has taken off, and we are having innumerable amendments placed on it, and most of them are huge new programs, new spending, all of which has an appropriate forum to be addressed. I just hope, for the American people, that we are not in a gridlock here. The fact that we are going to be voting on cloture in about 2 or 3 minutes demonstrates there is gridlock here. Let's help our American children, let's help the American people, by passing this bill, voting on it, Ed-Flex, not all these new spending programs. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. FRIST. Madam President, thank you. 
   It must be really confusing to people following this debate over the last several days, especially after people have been away for the weekend coming back now. In about an hour, we will have a vote called a cloture vote on a topic that means a great deal to the American people. I had a chance to review some of this in some town meetings over the last 2 days. I have come back even more convinced we have a real obligation to pass this simple, direct bill that will be translated into  improving education opportunities for people all across America. 
   This bill--a simple bill--is a bill I brought to the floor last week called the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. The cloture vote, in 55 minutes, is an attempt on our part to say, let's bring this bill in as clean a fashion as possible, addressing flexibility, addressing accountability, at no expense --at no cost; this bill does not cost a single cent--and let's vote on that bill. Let's not clutter it with all sorts of different amendments from either side of the aisle. 
   I think it is very sad that we are having to file cloture on this bill to bring it to a vote, because it is a worthy bill. It is a bill that has the support of every Governor in the United States of America. It is a bill that is bipartisan. My principal cosponsor is the distinguished Senator from Oregon, 
   Senator WYDEN. 
   It is ostensibly supported by the President of the United States. He first called for this bill, in fact, about 13 months ago, and has been in support of the bill since that time. Just last week he spoke out in support of the bill and said let's pass Ed-Flex. I think it is sadder still--yes, we are voting on cloture--but sadder still that now we are playing politics, playing politics with the future of our children, with our children's education. And that is what it is. 
   It became really clear to me as I was at home and I was in Mountain City, which is at the far east end of Tennessee, and went across Tennessee and ended up in Memphis yesterday talking about education. They said: ``If there's one thing we want you to do, U.S. Senate, Congress, the Washington Federal Government, it is to stop playing politics and pass useful legislation that you know will work.'' And we have in this Ed-Flex bill. We have 5 years of experience with a program that has been demonstrated to work. Numerous examples have been cited again and again. Stop playing politics. 
   Let me just very briefly bring people up to date in terms of the history of this legislation. Senator WYDEN and I worked together on a task force on the Budget Committee which complemented much of the work we did last year on the Labor Committee and identified a particular program that, as we held our hearings, very clearly worked. We heard the examples from Texas and from Vermont and from Massachusetts--all of whom came forward and said this is a program that allows us to focus the resources, with the intent out of Washington, DC, but to do it in such a way as we do it with respect to our needs in our local communities, in our local schools, in our local school districts--with the same goals, with the same money, with the same intent of the Federal Government, but without the Washington red tape, without the excessive bureaucratic regulations. And that is what Ed-Flex is about. 
   I did not bring this bill to the floor to be cluttered with another 25 different spending programs, however well intended they are. No. There is a more appropriate place to be dealing with that, and that is on the reauthorization which is currently underway in the Health and Education Committee, that reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Ed-Flex is a valuable program. It is a bipartisan program. It has been demonstrated to work. We introduced Ed-Flex just last July. I worked very closely with the Department of Education: How can we make absolutely sure that we have strong accountability provisions built into this piece of legislation? It only makes sense, if you are giving local communities more flexibility, to innovate, to be creative, and to answer those challenges that are out there in educating our children--by taking into account those local needs specific to whatever school might be considering a particular issue. 
   The Department of Education came, and we worked closely together. I worked with Secretary Riley, and last year he endorsed this very bill. The Labor Committee approved this bill 17-1--not 9-9 or 10-8, but 17 in favor of Ed-Flex and 1 against. We ran out of time last year. 
   We reintroduced Ed-Flex this year. The Health and Education Committee again reported this bill out of committee, and now we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate debating this simple, straightforward bill on education flexibility with accountability. Yet clearly we are getting off in other directions. We have had a list of amendments come in. One program cost $12 billion, we want to add; another cost $80 million. I plead with both sides of the aisle, let's step back and pass the bill we brought to the floor. 
   Let me also say--and again it is an important point--it is important for my colleagues who are not on the Health and Education Committee to understand, and for Americans and Tennesseans to understand, that the vehicle, the appropriate vehicle to which we should be considering, whether it is construction or whether it is getting dollars all the way to the classroom or whether it is 100,000 new teachers or better teacher preparation in terms of quality, the appropriate place is not on the Ed-Flex bill, which does not cost anything, which allows for this innovation, but through the authorization process currently underway. We are having hearings right now, and will over the next several weeks and months, on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, where we look at all of these programs, kindergarten through 12. 
   Some, as I said, would rather play politics with this bill. I really call upon my colleagues to put the politics aside and pass this bill. 
   Ed-Flex does not cost a dime. The bill on the floor does not cost a single dime, yet an amendment just came to the floor which costs $12 billion over 6 years--$12 billion. The appropriate place to debate that is where you are looking at other resources we need to put into education and have that debate. 
   Chairman JEFFORDS offered an alternative to those expensive plans, and that is we should not be out there funding all these new programs which have come along as amendments until we fulfill a promise we made in 1974. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire just outlined that we should not be debating funding new programs until we fully fund our special needs children, special education, where we made a promise in the past. Indeed, the Senate voted 100 to 0 to support that approach, although it seems now we have people backing away from that commitment. 
   Madam President, the floor debate has not focused on the real merits of the Ed-Flex bill. In fact, I bet if we can get cloture today, when this bill comes to the floor the vote will be probably 99-1 in favor of the Ed-Flex bill. I plead that people vote in favor of cloture so we can vote on the Ed-Flex bill without introducing myriad amendments. 
   We have moved beyond talking about Ed-Flex to the political posturing and the doublespeak. America is not going to tolerate it, I don't believe, based on my experiences around Tennessee this week. Every Member on the other side of the aisle voted to fund the needs of special education students before spending on new programs, yet today we have seen another amendment discussed which is yet another new spending program. 
   We cannot be occupied by political rhetoric. What is at risk is the Ed-Flex bill. This bill could be brought down if we overload it with all of these new programs. That would be a travesty because we could have this bill passed here and in the House and on the President's bill in 6 weeks, and 38 States that don't have Ed-Flex now would have that program available for them if we passed it here in the next several weeks. Ed-Flex streamlines our education process, it cuts through redtape, it allows States greater flexibility. 
   Let me briefly refer to this chart, and please don't try to dissect the chart. Let me use it as an example of what I am up against. This is the General Accounting Office, and as everybody in the Chamber knows, the General Accounting Office will come in and look at a field and make advice. At one of their presentations, this chart was presented. It basically says here are some target groups that are very important to education. One is teachers, the other is at-risk and delinquent youth, and the other is young children. I asked that group a simple question: What programs do we have today--out of Washington, DC, or what Departments--looking at at-risk and delinquent youth? I don't understand because I have heard that there were hundreds--200 and 260; 500 and 560. I asked a simple question: What is Washington doing for teachers, for example?  
   This is the chart they came back with.

   Mr. FRIST. The point I end with, what we are hearing today is to have a new program put on the outside to address a population that we know is important. 
   Look at the complexity of this on this chart, which my staff jokingly calls the spiderweb chart. Look at the 15 different programs for teachers. What the other side wants to do is put another program out there. 
   Our argument is to pass a simple program--that allows innovation; it has bipartisan support--instead of introducing a new program. The appropriate debate here is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   I plead with my colleagues to pull back on all of these amendments, pass Ed-Flex, vote in favor of cloture today so we can address a bill that has bipartisan support, that is supported by all 50 Governors, supported by the President of the United States, the Department of Education, and, I bet, 99 U.S. Senators. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the bill we have been discussing for the last several days is a bipartisan bill entitled ``Ed-Flex.'' It really aims at a fundamental issue, I believe, which is how we improve education for our children, kindergarten through the 12th grade. 
   This particular bill, which is sponsored by myself and RON WYDEN, is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that is very simple. 
   My question is: It seems that over the last several hours of yesterday that a number of extraneous amendments which have nothing to do with my bill, the Ed-Flex bill, a very specific bill which gives flexibility to schools and to teachers and to local communities to accomplish education goals--all of these amendments seem to be well intended, seem to be great programs, but I ask: Is it not appropriate, or more appropriate, so that we can deliver a bipartisan bill supported by the American people, supported by all 50 Governors, supported by the President of the United States, supported by the Department of Education--why can't we in this body come to agreement to pass this bill as written with several germane or relevant amendments, which we have been dealing with very appropriately, in a clean way without trying to attach all of these other programs--all of these other programs, I might add, which have huge price tags. My bill doesn't cost a single cent, has bipartisan support, and will help the children within weeks or months of passage. 
   Why not--this is the question to my distinguished colleague--address all of these other issues, well intended, which do cost money, which are new programs, why not address them through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is the most appropriate forum where we are considering all of these education programs as we go forward? Why can't we proceed with our bill as written, as appropriately modified, without having to consider every one of these other major issues that come forward that need to be addressed elsewhere?

   Mr. FRIST. If the Senator will yield for one more question about where we stand as of this morning, again, the bill I have proposed, which passed through your committee last year by a vote of 17 to 1, which passed through your committee this year, which has bipartisan support, is Ed-Flex, flexibility given to local communities with strong accountability--that is the bill that we are discussing. Is what you have just pointed out, and what was pointed out yesterday, that before we consider a number of other programs--which may be important and which will be considered in your committee over the course of the next year--before we should fund new programs, however good they might be, we have an obligation to fulfill the promises that we made in the past, promises to fund a very good program--the Disability Education Act; special education? You pointed out that we have not fulfilled that promise yet and before we should dedicate specific funds to new programs, we should fund that unfunded promise that we made, that we guaranteed in the past.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to introduce the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1999 with my colleagues, Senators SNOWE, JEFFORDS, HAGEL, and COLLINS. We have worked diligently on this legislation for several years to bring this issue to the forefront of the Congressional agenda and to craft a solid piece of legislation that will provide patients  with real protections against genetic discrimination in health insurance. 
   Scientists anticipate that the entire human genome will be completely decoded within the next few years. This unprecedented accomplishment will usher in a new era in our understanding of diseases that afflict all Americans and is bound to expand our understanding of human development, health and disease. Ultimately, our hope is that medical science will capitalize on these scientific advances to promote the health and well-being of our citizens. 
   It is the discovery of ``disease genes'' that provides the eye of the current legislative storm. Scientists have already identified genes that are associated with increased risk of certain diseases including: breast cancer, colon cancer and Alzheimer`s dementia. In time, more genes will be linked to risk of future disease. While early knowledge of disease risk is imperative to our ability to take measures to prevent disease, many fear some form of retribution for carrying ``bad'' genes and, therefore, refuse testing. Discrimination in health insurance, either by denial of coverage or excessive premium rates, is the major concern of most individuals. For example, nearly a third of women offered a test for breast cancer risk at the National Institutes of Health declined citing concerns about health insurance discrimination. 
   Biomedical research and scientific progress march on and do not pause for social and public policy debate and legislation. The escalating speed of genetic discovery mandates that Congress act now to prohibit discrimination against healthy individuals who may have a genetic predisposition to disease. The bill I have been working on with Senators SNOWE and JEFFORDS prohibits group health plans or health insurance issuers from adjusting premiums based on predictive genetic information regarding an individual. In the individual insurance market, our bill prohibits health insurance issuers from using predictive genetic information to deny coverage or to set premium rates. Furthermore, insurers are prohibited from requesting predictive genetic information or requiring an individual to undergo genetic testing. If genetic information is requested for diagnosis of disease, or treatment and payment for services, health insurers are required to provide patients a description of the procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of such information. 
   The deciphering of the human genome presents an unparalleled opportunity to more completely understand disease processes and cures. We want patients to benefit from our investment in biomedical research and fully utilize medical advancements to improve their health. This will not be possible unless individuals are willing to be tested. Patients must feel safe from repercussions based on their genetic profile. Prohibition of genetic discrimination in insurance will remove the greatest barrier to testing and thus further accelerate our scientific progress. 
   My Senate colleagues and I are in the process of scrutinizing the quality of the medical care in our country. Increasing access to health care and improving the quality of that care are two cornerstones of the Senate Republican Patients' Bill of Rights (S.300/S.326). I believe that quality is best achieved when patients and their care givers can make fully informed decisions regarding different treatment options. In addition, the essence of a long and productive life is the adoption of healthy habits including preventative measures based on disease risk assessment. As a result, testing for genetic risk becomes an indispensable part of quality health care--which is why Senators SNOWE, JEFFORDS, HAGEL, COLLINS, and I felt strongly that genetic discrimination provisions must be included our Patients' Bill of Rights. Patients must not forgo genetic testing because of fear of discrimination in insurance. We have the opportunity--we have the duty--to dispel the threat of discrimination based on an individual's genetic heritage. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact these provisions this year as the health care debate moves forward.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, clearly, we would like to get to the bill, and we can actually talk about what is in the bill. The bill has not been, as you know, introduced in the managers' package. And I hope that, although the morning hour has been reduced, we can get to the bill and discuss what is in it or not. 
   For a State to become a title I State, in both existing law as well as what we will have in our bill, you have to have the full complement of title I requirements, which will be spelled out. 
   You can't be an Ed-Flex State both today and in the future law. So is it in the bill? Because you can't be eligible unless they are actually in. For the very specific things, if we could introduce it, there is a whole list of accountability clauses I would like to get to after we introduce the bill formally, if we could do that, talk about the core principles and the protections and the accountability.

   Mr. FRIST. I have not seen the core requirements. I didn't hear what the core requirements are specifically. But if you would allow us to proceed to the bill at some point, at the appropriate time--right now, as you know, we have given the Senator the last 3 hours so he can make these points. We are ready to go to the bill, introduce to America a great Ed-Flex bill, as soon as the Senator is finished.

   Mr. FRIST. I would respond to my distinguished colleague from Minnesota, that if we could introduce the bill and discuss the bill before specific amendments--right now we have not had the opportunity because of these delaying tactics, which is what they are, so the Senator would have the opportunity to have 3 hours to lay everything out--if the Senator would just allow us to at least bring this bill to the floor at some time so we can discuss and formally debate and read the amendments--he is talking about an amendment which I have not seen. I haven't had the opportunity to see it. The Senator hasn't presented it. It is a little bit strange to be debating specific amendments and principles to amendments before the bill is introduced. 
   So let me just make a plea to the Senator to allow this bill to be formally introduced, debated, amendment by amendment, if the Senator would like, and I think that is appropriate, but we can't do it unless the Senator allows consideration of this bill. Right now it is important for the American people to understand that we, because of what is going on right now and what we are hearing, cannot proceed until the Senator from Minnesota allows us to proceed with the underlying bill. 
   So I will just ask, Is the Senator going to allow us to proceed to address the Ed-Flex bill?

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to very briefly respond to a couple of points that have been made over the course of this morning. 
   The distinguished Senator from Minnesota has made a number of points in outlining his view of what needs to be done with education in this country as we go forward. His time was delegated to him so that he would have that opportunity, although a lot of us are anxiously waiting to get to the bill itself, the Ed-Flex bill, which is the subject of our debate over the course of today, tonight and tomorrow, and probably the next several days. 
   First of all, he has outlined many of the challenges that we do have in education today. The great thing about this whole debate is that whether it is his intentions or my intentions or the intentions of the Senator from Oregon,  it really is to address the fundamental issues of education, of really making sure that our children today, and in future generations, are best prepared. And they are not today. We all have come to that conclusion. Parents recognize that and principals understand that, and teachers and school boards and Governors, and all the various groups that we will hear about. 
   That is the great thing, that as the No. 1 agenda item coming out of this Congress and the Senate, we are addressing education. Let me say that the approach is going to be different. There won't be a lot of heated debate. What needs to be protected, which programs to address, how to address them, how much control does the Federal Government have, how much control do the local communities have or do parents have or do Governors have, that will be the subject of much of the debate that we will hear. 
   A second big issue is flexibility. People on both sides of the aisle are so well intentioned, and we all have our favorite education program and we think that that program might be the silver bullet, but we all know that there is no single silver bullet as we address this whole issue of educating our young people, preparing them for that next century. 
   Let me say that right coming out of the box, before we even introduce this bill formally, which I think will be done early this afternoon: This bill is no silver bullet either. It does address the basic principles. It is not a series of programs that are well intended that may cost money, that may be very good in and of themselves, but it sets that principle that does allow more flexibility, more creativity, more innovation in accomplishing the goals that most of us agree to. This bill does not change the resources going in, nor does it change the goals, but it does reorder our thinking of how to get from those resources to those goals. And what it does, it drops the barriers with strong accountability. 
   When we talk about flexibility and we talk about accountability, that is what this bill does. Not the resources, not yet; we are going to have that argument over the course of the year with what is called--we will all become very familiar with it--the ESEA, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. There is an ongoing discussion right now in Senator JEFFORDS' committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. That is ongoing and hearings will be held and that is where we will be looking at all these multiple well-intended programs. We will be looking at all the resources going into education. Is it too little? Is it too much? Should we divert certain of those resources to certain programs? 
   That is not what we are doing today or tomorrow in the Ed-Flex, the Frist-Wyden Ed-Flex. That is not what we are doing. We are looking at how to streamline the system, make more efficient use of those resources, trust our local schools and local teachers and local principals who can identify specific needs in order to improve education, and make sure those resources are used in the appropriate way to meet the goals that we all lay out. That is an important concept, because a lot of these amendments that are being proposed, principally on the other side of the aisle and maybe solely on the other side of the aisle, will be to make some good, strong points that this program is great. You will hear me and others say let's consider all of those issues, but we need to consider them in the context of what we are doing with education totally and that is not what this bill is all about. This is about the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, the Ed-Flex Act. 
   I want to begin with that because it does set the overall environment in which this debate can most intelligently be carried out. Without that, we are going to drop into these whirls of rhetoric: Although this program will really turn things around--and we all should recognize right up front we cannot look just at rhetoric. 
   I heard three points over the last 3 hours that my colleague from Minnesota mentioned. No. 1, we are rushing through this thing and we are trying to jam it through the U.S. Senate and thrust it upon the American people. You hear these words ``rushing it through, rushing it through.'' The second point he seemed to make this morning was that in some way Ed-Flex hurts poor children. And then he said there is no data, there is no evidence, there is no information; let's wait until we generate some information before we go forward. In some way it hurts poor children, that was almost the theme. So I think we need to respond to that and move on and look at the great things this bill does. 
   The third point he made is that our bill does not address a lot of specific programs that he would like to address, and it is nutrition needs and it is Head Start and a lot of afterschool programs and a lot of programs which are very important to education and need to be discussed. We need to go back and evaluate. But that is not what Ed-Flex is intended to do. That is not what the Ed-Flex bill is all about. 
   What we have is a bill that was generated by myself and Senator WYDEN, who just spoke on the floor, that is a bipartisan bill that represents strong support with all 50 Governors--every State Governor is supporting this piece of legislation. It is bipartisan, symbolically, because it is RON WYDEN and BILL FRIST out there who have been working on this bill for the past year. 
   We will talk, after the bill is introduced, about the broad support that it has. But we all know the President said last week: Let's pass Ed-Flex this week. The Department of Education has been very supportive of this bill throughout. Unfortunately, I think what we heard this morning may be a prelude to what we can expect, and that is going to be a series of programs which have billion-dollar price tags, million-dollar price tags, that will be billed as the best program out there. And some of those programs are really going to appeal to our colleagues and to people listening to this debate. They will say: Yes, things like more teachers and construction and all would be good, and they are very concrete and real. Again, we 
   are going to look at those later. 
   Real quickly, as we go through, are we rushing this through? Let's make very clear that we are not rushing this through. We addressed this in the committee, the appropriate committee of Health, Education, Labor, and Pension, which is the former Labor Committee. Senator JEFFORDS will be managing this bill with me. He has been very thoughtful, and over the period of time through a number of different discussions, we have debated the bill, we marked this bill up--again, that is terminology inside this room--but that means we have discussed this bill, we have debated these amendments, many of them, both last year when it sailed through the committee we debated each of these issues and then again this year. 
   It is important for the American people to understand that, yes, this particular bill passed last year 17 to 1; that one person, that colleague we have heard from this morning and I am sure we will hear from again and again. But recognize it passed 17 to 1. We ran out of time at the end of the last Congress. It came back through the committee and was marked up just several weeks ago and, again, was passed out and sent to the floor. 
   The General Accounting Office study which has been cited, which will be referred to--again, I will have to turn to my colleague, Senator WYDEN, and say thank you. He is the one who initially requested that, the initial request to GAO which came back with the report, and out of the report we have been able to see great benefits and also some of the areas in which we need to strengthen our legislation, which we have done so we can go ahead and move ahead with that flexibility and accountability. 
   Then ``rushing this through,'' when you think about most of the education we address here, we have not had an experience of 5 years. Remember, this is a demonstration project today. There are 12 States that have Ed-Flex--passed in 1994 with six States; another six States added on to that. So we have a 5-year experience in 12 different States with this program already. So, yes, we know that it works. So, are we rushing it through? You can just move that argument right to the side. 
   No. 2, it hurts poor children? This is remarkable because it was really the theme of this morning: In some way, Ed-Flex hurts poor children. Let me just look to some outside groups who have looked at this. 
   If you refer back to the chart behind me, it is the report of the Citizens'  Commission on Civil Rights, a wonderful report that may be referred to several times in the course of the next several days, issued in the fall of this past year, and they hit right at the heart. Really, I think we can just move on, almost:  
   In the Citizens' Commission's judgment, these waivers did not seriously undermine the statute's intent to target aid to poor children.  
   Then, if we look for hard data, again we have heard all this rhetoric about, ``Oh, we have a potential for hurting poor children; we have the potential for this.'' Clearly, you can create hypotheticals in any piece of legislation, in any statute, any regulation, and politicians are pretty good at it. We can create hypotheticals and say if this were to happen it would destroy education and so forth. My approach is a little bit more the scientist. 
   Before coming to the Senate, I spent time looking at data and that scientific, analytical mind may interfere with some things, but it does cause me to ask the question: What data do we have? What is the hard data and what is the evidence? And let me just look at some of the areas that were mentioned. 
   Texas, which has a very successful Ed-Flex program, has accumulated some representative data which looks at three different areas. It is going to be hard to read, but at the top it looks at African American students; beneath that it looks at Hispanic students; and beneath that it looks at economically disadvantaged students. 
   The far left column shows 1996, the next column over shows 1997. The column I want to concentrate on is, ``Actual change.'' Remember, this is hard data, looking at a State that compared Ed-Flex to non-Ed-Flex. 
   If you look at that middle column--let me just drop right down to the bottom where it says ``Economically Disadvantaged Students.'' 
   In 1996--this is for mathematics. This is a statewide comparison of selected campuses in title I, part A. Title I is the disadvantaged students element which we heard so much about this morning. We see in those States, like Westlawn Elementary, La Marque ISD, with the title I schoolwide waiver, in that column we see an improvement of 16.8 percent. These are just with the disadvantaged students. The statewide average was an improvement of 8 percent. 
   Thus, for those disadvantaged students, if you compare the Ed-Flex program, we see that students improved twice as much in the very population that we hear this rhetorical concern about. Again, this is hard data, representative data. 
   We look at African American students compared to the statewide average. In the Ed-Flex, African American students at Westlawn Elementary, we see they improved by 22 percent; statewide average, 9 percent--again, more than a doubling of improvement in the Ed-Flex schoolwide waiver program. 
   Halfway down you see Hispanic students. Again, if you take the entity of Westlawn, you see an improvement of 16 percent versus 7.9 percent--again, that Ed-Flex school doing twice as well under a schoolwide waiver as they would otherwise do. And this is representative data. Again, once we get to the bill, you will see. 
   So we see that the Commission on Civil Rights--we see hard data. There are other examples from Massachusetts we will hear about. 
   And then I guess really the fundamental thing I will come back to later is, our bill can't hurt poor children, because the dollars have to be used. Going back to my earlier comments, we do not change the dollars and we did not change the ultimate goals in the targeted population. Our bill does not do that. So by law, if you are targeted for this population, the money and the programs have to go there. How you get there is where the flexibility comes in. 
   One last point I referred to, which was his last point, was that we are not addressing nutrition and other well-meaning programs, again, that we will hear paraded out. Let me just say that is not the intent of this bill. We can discuss them. We can introduce them. Those sorts of issues will be discussed in the chairman's committee appropriately, where they can be debated, where we can consider all of the resources, all of the programs, recognizing there is not one single silver bullet to cure education, the challenges of education. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the appropriate forum that this body has to consider these issues. 
   With that, I thank you for this opportunity to speak and thank the chairman for yielding time.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to speak on Ed-Flex and give just a little bit of background of what the bill is, the importance of the bill, and where we are going. 
   Earlier this morning I had the opportunity to comment on the nature of the bill--that it is not a bill that is intended to solve all of the problems in education today, but it is a focused bill, a bill which will be of significant benefit to hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren. And, if we act on this bill sometime in the next several days, and if the House does likewise with its corresponding bill, it could be sent to the President very shortly, and hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren can benefit in the next several months. That is why we are moving ahead with this particular bill. 
   It has strong bipartisan support. It is supported by the Nation's Governors, and by Democrats and by Republicans. 
   I thank my colleague from Arkansas who I think did a wonderful job setting the big picture and the fundamentals of why a bill that stresses flexibility and accountability really unties the hands and unshackles the schools which right now have huge amounts of paperwork and regulations coming down from well-intentioned laws and statutes passed here in Washington, DC, but really makes it very difficult, in fact impedes their ability to efficiently do what they want to do, and that is teach students and educate our children. 
   I thank Senator HUTCHINSON for that wonderful background and presentation. He mentioned the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS), and although we are not going to be talking a lot about that today, it is interesting because this study, which is an objective, very good study, recognized nationally and internationally, is a good measurement of where we are today. It reflects the common interests that we have as American people on both sides of the aisle to present a better future to our children by preparing them. 
   Behind me are the results of the Third International Math and Science Study. It is a little bit confusing when you see the chart. But after digesting lots of different studies, the more time one looks at this chart the more comfortable it is. And this chart has a lot of information which hits right at the heart of why we have the problems we have today. 
   This particular chart highlights science. I have other charts that I won't show today that also highlight similar statistics for mathematics. But the statistics are very similar, whether it is reading, science or math that is being evaluated.  
   Let's look at science. 
   In the first column, it is grade 4. As the Senator from Arkansas said, the TIMSS study looks at grade 4, looks at grade 8, and looks at grade 12--all of those green lines going down in the print. There are different countries that are involved. So you will have a relative standing of how well the United States does in grade 4, 8 and 12 versus other countries. 
   Again, the studies are very good, very carefully controlled from a scientific standpoint, and right on target. For example, grade 4, at the top of the list is South Korea. In the fourth grade in terms of average score, in terms of science, the second one down is Japan; third one, is Austria; the fourth is the United States. The red line, both in grades 4, 8, and 12, is the United States. 
   So right off you see in the fourth grade we do pretty well relative to other countries. In the eighth grade, just as the Senator from Arkansas said, we didn't do nearly as well. And in the 12th grade, we fall way down. 
   You will also see on the chart a black line. The black line indicates the average for all countries. 
   So not only do we know where we stand relatively in terms of other countries, but we also know where we stand with the average of other countries. 
   Again, the observation is in the fourth grade, we are fourth when we compare ourselves to other countries, which is above average. In the eighth grade for science, we fall way down, yet we are still above the average. But look what happens by the time we get to the 12th grade. By the time we get to the 12th grade, Sweden is ahead of us, Netherlands is ahead of us, Iceland is ahead of us, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, are ahead of us. Denmark is ahead of us, and so are Germany, the Czech Republic, and France. The Russian Federation is also ahead of us in the 12th grade in terms of science. 
   As we look to the future and we look at fields like reading and science and mathematics and we see this trend over time, that is really the call for us, as a nation, to focus on education, to do it in a bipartisan way, a way that really does focus on our children today, and recognize how are we going to be able to compete in the next millennium with this sort of trend over time. As the charts have indicated the United States is below the average of all these other countries, and the trend is getting worse the longer one stays in school in the United States of America. 
   Let me refer once again to what a pleasure it has been for me to participate in the education issue on this particular bill with Senator WYDEN of Oregon. He and I have been working on Ed-Flex expansion through a number of committees and task forces--the Senate Budget Task Force on Education, working with the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which is the new name for that particular committee. We began to address this issue over a year ago when first explored it through the Senate Budget Task Force on Education. 
   The more we looked into it, the more we felt this bill could make a huge difference, and it is something that Government can and should do. The Federal Government needs to take the leadership role to untie the hands of our States, our schools, and our school districts so that they can carry out the sort of objectives that we all generally agree to, the sort of goals that we set in this body. 
   Again, what we are doing today, is to expand a demonstration project that began in 1994. As the Senator from Vermont outlined in his brief history of the program--it began in 1994 as a demonstration project with 6 States. It was extended later to another 6 States, so now 12 States have the opportunity to be Ed-Flex States. And what we are going to do in this legislation, which will pass, I am very hopeful, not too long from now, is extend that demonstration project from 12 States to all 50 States. 
   Behind me on the map, again, for the edification of my colleagues who may not be familiar with this program, you can see that Massachusetts is an Ed-Flex State, and we have, I think, good demonstrated results there. Texas has also had positive results with using its Ed-Flex waiver authority. Earlier this morning I had an opportunity to present some of the outcome data from that particular State. The color yellow on the chart indicates the States where Ed-Flex is currently available. But Tennessee, the State I represent, says, Why don't we have that same opportunity of increased flexibility for greater accountability? Let us have that same flexibility to get rid of the excessive regulations. Let us get rid of the unnecessary paperwork. Let us get rid of the Washington redtape. 
   Now, what they are saying is, Allow us to look at our local situation, which in Nashville is different than Jackson, which is different than Johnson City, which is different than Humboldt, which is different than Soddy-Daisy. Give us that opportunity. 
   And, again, you can see how it happens. All of us in this body have good intentions when we pass these statutes and we pass these laws and then they go through this regulatory machine. Everybody has good intentions. But the regulations get more and more complicated, which seems to be a common theme whenever one look at a variety of fields here in Government. 
   Now, one of the issues that we are going to be talking about is waivers. So what is the Ed-Flex program? There are currently 12 States participating. The Ed-Flex program, very simply, is a State waiver program which allows schools and school districts the opportunity to obtain temporary waivers to accomplish specific education goals but free of that Washington redtape, free of those unnecessary Federal regulations. And that in one sentence is a description of Ed-Flex. 
   Because the Ed-Flex program is currently a demonstration program, we have a lot of data available about it. Again, over the course of the debate, we will come back to some of the outcomes of Ed-Flex and give some examples of how it is being used. The key thing is that Ed-Flex gives flexibility to find some of the 
   solutions to specific problems that vary from school to school, school district to school district, and community to community. It allows that element of responsiveness to specific needs. In addition, it allows a degree of creativity, and innovation. These things are critical especially when we see the trends that I just showed on TIMSS which clearly indicate that we can't just do more of the same; we can't just throw more money at existing programs; we can't accept the status quo; we can't do a lot of the things that at first blush we might think work, because we have tried it in the past and it hasn't worked. 
   Over the past 30 years, we have been flat in terms of our student performance in this country. Now, some people will stand up and say, yes that is true, but look at some results released last week or look at some from 5 years ago where there is a little bit of improvement. I will tell you--and I can bring those charts--if you plot it out year by year performance for students has been stagnant in the 4th, 8th and 10th grades. The problem is that the other countries that have allowed creativity and innovation are all improving and we are being left behind. 
   So I don't want to underestimate the power of that innovation, the power of that creativity. We like to think it all begins in this room here with the Congress; in truth, it begins in those classrooms with hard-working teachers, with hard-working school attendants, with those Governors who recognize that they really have made progress and need some flexibility. 
   We will hear a number of examples of how flexibility and accountability have worked. In Maryland, we have seen that the Ed-Flex program has allowed a school to reduce the teacher pupil ratios from 25 pupils to 1 down to 12 to 1. They felt that was important and they received a waiver that allowed them to accomplish this based on their particular needs. 
   In Kansas, waivers have been used to provide all-day kindergarten, because this was a priority for them. It was a dimension where they had a specific need. 
   They were also able to have a preschool program for 4-year-old children. They also saw they weren't doing very well in reading, so they were able to implement, through the waiver program, new reading strategies for all students. 
   Now, the waiver issue will come up, and whenever you hear ``waiver,'' people have to think, and they should  think, ``accountability,'' We are saying, accomplish certain goals, but do it in a way that meets your specific needs with programs that you believe will work at the local community level. It is critical that we build in strong, accountability measures. 
   If we look at the history, again referring to Senator WYDEN's initial request to have the General Accounting Office look at some of the Ed-Flex programs, we can see in GAO's report in November of 1998, that the ``Department of Education officials told us they believe that the 12 current Ed-Flex States have used their waiver authority carefully and judiciously.'' This is an important statement because we are going to hear some rhetoric, and we heard a little bit this morning, that if you give this freedom, people are going to abuse it. People say there is no evidence. Based on what the Department of Education has concluded and reported to us through the General Accounting Office, the waiver system has worked well. 
   Ed-Flex is a bipartisan plan. It is a common sense plan that will give States and localities and school districts the flexibility, which I have already been stressing. Now I want to stress the accountability provisions. Accountability is critical to the overall success of the program. It has to be built in. The two words I want my colleagues to remember are ``flexibility'' and strong ``accountability.'' Those are two important principles behind this bipartisan bill. 
   Now, the accountability measures in the current Ed-Flex programs--we have 12 programs with this 5-year history--are very good. I want my colleagues to understand that accountability has been strengthened. We have given even more teeth to ensure accountability in the bill and in the managers' package that has been put forward. Under current law there is less accountability than what we are proposing. Under current law, a State need only have what is called a comprehensive reform plan to participate in Ed-Flex. 
   Even though the current 12 state program has less accountability than what we are offering, have been told by the GAO, that the Department of Education says there has been a judicious and careful use of this waiver authority. 
   Behind me is a chart which, again, is going to be difficult to read from far away. It is a pyramid and it is tiered, because we have accountability measures built in at the Federal level, which is at the top; we have accountability measures built in at the State level, which is the middle; and at the bottom of that, we have strong accountability measures built in at the base, at the local level. 
   At the local level, there is a requirement to demonstrate why the waiver is needed. You have to spell that out very specifically. The applicant has to say how that specific waiver will be used to meet the purpose of the underlying program. Again, we are not changing the purpose of the program. You have to specifically say how that waiver will be used, and then you have to have specific measurable goals written out in that waiver application. You will be held accountable for all of that. There are additional accountability measures in the bill, but I have summarized accountability at the local level. 
   At the State level, again we include strong accountability measures because we address things that are called ``content standards'' and ``performance standards'' and ``assessments.'' In addition to those content standards and performance standards, States are required to monitor the performance of local education agencies in schools which have received a specific waiver. That includes the performance of students who are directly affected by those waivers. Then, for those low-performing schools or school districts that are identified, the State must engage--and these are the key words--in ``technical assistance and corrective action.'' And then the last, in terms of the State level, the State can terminate a waiver at any time; the ultimate power. If the State says things are not going right, it may terminate the waiver. 
   At the Federal level, indicated on the chart at the top of the pyramid, we have an additional backup, an important element, I think, to demonstrate the pyramid effect of this. That is, the Secretary is required to monitor both the performance of the States and also to have the ability to, as you can at the State level, terminate that waiver at any time. 
   I think this three-tiered level of accountability is something that is very, very important when we give that flexibility to achieve the specific goals which are outlined. That, I believe, is a real recipe for success as we work towards educating our children and improving those scores that have been referred to already this morning. 
   I will just spend a couple of more minutes, I think, so we can move on with other people's comments. But as I pointed out, we have experience with this. This is not a program that we pulled out of the sky and said, let's try it out, some experimental program, rushing this through the legislative process. I think we need to recognize right up front that we have a 5-year history with it. It has been a demonstration project, it has been endorsed by the Department of Education, it has been endorsed by the President of the United States, it has been endorsed by Democrats and Republicans, and something which I think is critically important is the fact that all 50 Governors have said this program is right; it is what is needed to best educate that child who is in the school system in his or her State. 
   The Governors are in a position, I believe, both to judge but also to lead, as we go forward. I have behind me a resolution that passed just last week from the National Governors' Association. The headline or title is, ``Expansion of Ed-Flex Demonstration Program To All Qualified States and Territories.'' It was a resolution. NGA doesn't do a whole lot of resolutions, but this is a major priority for our Governors who understand, like we do, addressing as a nation, that we must put education at the very top of our priorities. Let me just read the first sentence:  
   The governors strongly affirm that states are responsible for creating an education system that enables all students to achieve high standards and believe that the federal government should support state efforts by providing regulatory relief and greater flexibility.  
   Skip on down just a little bit to the second paragraph so we can look back to the past from the Governors' perspective. Again, this is Democrats and Republicans, bipartisan, which is the nature and the real power of this bill. They say:  
   Ed-Flex has helped states focus on improving student performance, by more closely aligning state and federal education improvement programs and by supporting state efforts to design and implement standards-based reform.  
   And then just their last sentence:  
   Ed-Flex will provide states and territories with increased incentives to strengthen state efforts to adopt meaningful standards and assessments with greater accountability.  
   As I mentioned earlier, we ran out of time to pass Ed-Flex last year. It is coming back to the floor now. It has been passed in the Labor and Human Resources Committee and the now Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where we had the opportunity to discuss many of these amendments. We have an opportunity to pass this legislation very, very early in this Congress so it will be to the benefit of hundreds of thousands of children in the very near future. That is why we really should not put this off. Some people have said, Why don't you consider this in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act? That is unnecessarily pushing a bill off that we know will benefit children today, putting it off for a year or a year and a half unnecessarily, given the tremendous consensus that has been reached around this particular bill. 
   In closing, let me just say I think the time really has come that we lend our efforts to give States and give localities and give schools and give school districts the flexibility they need, and the tools that they need, to accomplish the jobs that we, as a society, have entrusted them to do. 
   Ed-Flex is not the cure-all. It is not going to be the answer to all of our education challenges. But what it is, is a modest first step at moving toward that common goal that we all share. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will just take a few moments to expand upon a couple of issues that have been raised over the course of the morning and early afternoon. One has to do with accountability and the other, parental involvement. Both of these are very important issues as we proceed ahead in addressing both the underlying bill and the potential amendments that are coming forward. 
   The Ed-Flex bill itself, again, is a bill that expands a demonstration project, which has been very successful, from 12 States to 50 States. What it does is simple. It allows schools and school districts the opportunity to obtain a waiver, and that waiver would allow them to accomplish very specific goals as set out in programs but free of the redtape and excessive, burdensome regulations, and it also allows them to say we are going to meet those goals and objectives and be held accountable for those in very strict ways that identify our particular needs. Schools have different needs; a particular school might need access to computers and another might need to have a pre-kindergarten program. 
   Another school might need to have an afterschool tutoring program. I think the point is that we don't want to tie the hands of our local communities and our schools if they say this is what it takes for us to increase student performance, this is how we have identified, based on our own needs to achieve, these very specific objectives. Again, we are not talking about a block grant. We are not talking about changing the goals that we set out. We are saying that given the resources that we are putting in a particular area, and given the specific goals, we are going to give the local communities the opportunity to have more flexibility and at the same time demanding accountability to meet those goals. 
   That, very simply, is what the bill does. We have this experience with it that historically we can look to; we can learn from it. We can expand upon it. And that is where we are today.  That is what I think real leadership in education is all about. I think it is an appropriate Federal role to give that flexibility and demand that accountability. ``Accountability'' is tied with ``flexibility.'' 
   That accountability needs to be carried out at the local level, for which I have the next chart, which was spelled out earlier. We need to have the accountability built in at the local level. We need to have the accountability built in at the State level and at the Federal level, all reinforcing each other in an appropriate hierarchical way just to make sure we are holding those schools or school districts accountable for the waiver that they have spelled out. 
   I have gone through the specifics earlier, but as I keep this chart up, just so people can understand how it builds one on the other, let me also make it clear that the type of waivers that we are allowing are really two kinds. One is an administrative type of waiver. That is a waiver where you unshackle the paperwork on local communities, local schools, and school districts which say that they are bombarded with paperwork and time requiring activities which keep them away from accomplishing that goal. Those sorts of administrative waivers are very important. And that is one element of the waiver system. 
   Another element of the waiver system about which we have talked a great deal about today is where the schoolwide waivers take place, again accomplishing the specific goals consistent with the intent of the Federal law. 
   We have to keep in mind that not all waivers are about student performance per se, that some waivers are about--I will describe them first--lowering that paperwork burden on both schools and school districts and at the State level. 
   I say that because we have to be careful, if we start modifying this bill at all, so that we don't try to connect every single waiver with an increase in student performance and use that as the judge. There are certain areas that we cannot basically come back and link that particular waiver that produces paperwork to the performance of individual students in a school. 
   On the issue of student performance, I think it is important to point out that Ed-Flex, as is spelled out in the underlying bill, has more accountability that we have injected into it than the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which is in existence today. That particular act authorizes over $13 billion. We have injected in our bill, Ed-Flex, more accountability than is in that Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   I mention that again so people will know how hard we have worked in this peer approach to make sure that accountability is included. 
   Under current law, education programs that provide direct services to students are not specifically required to improve student performance. Ed-Flex has more accountability built into it than the largest single Federal education law in the land. 
   That is point No. 1. 
   No. 2, it is important to understand that the accountability provisions in our bill as written--I encourage my colleagues to read that bill as written--inject more accountability than the 
   existing 12-State demonstration-project. It is important, because I want people to go back and read the bill and not just look at what is in the current Ed-Flex program and the 12-State demonstration project. 
   First, before a State may issue waivers, they must first provide public notice and comment. I am going to come back to that shortly because that will give me the opportunity to talk a little bit more about parental involvement. But it is very clear that by having that requirement that the community at large, including the parents, will be very much involved as they can express their concerns if they have such concerns about the waiver. 
   Second, before receiving any waiver in the State, local school and local school districts must establish specific measurable education goals, which may include student performance. But they have to have very specific goals spelled out. 
   That is important, again, so we can demand that accountability as to whether or not they meet those goals. As I pointed out before, those goals, as spelled out in the bill, may very well include student performance. 
   Third, every year States must monitor--this is at the State level--and review the performance of schools and school districts that have received those waivers. So we go from local up to the State level that the State must monitor. In addition, the States are required to make sure that the school and school districts that have received waivers are, indeed, making progress toward those goals; again, including school performance. Whatever those goals are they establish, consistent with the Federal intent, we need to show not only that the goals have been spelled out, but that progress on a regular basis is being met. If a school district or a school fails to meet that progress toward meeting the goals, the State at any time can revoke that waiver. 
   In addition, we have built in and spelled out here that the States have to offer technical assistance, if progress is not being made, and also take corrective action. 
   Fifth, every year the States must send a report on how Ed-Flex is working to the Department of Education; again, an accountability measure. 
   Sixth, again looking at the top of the chart at the Federal level, the Secretary of Education has the final say. He or she can terminate a waiver at any time. 
   Seventh, the Secretary must issue a report to Congress every 2 years on the performance of students affected by the waivers. 
   Eighth, State waiver authority to issue waivers is thoroughly reviewed every 5 years, and is contingent upon school performance. 
   Earlier today, the Senator from Oregon presented the accountability checks in the bill. These accountability checks are critical. 
   The second issue that I wanted to refer to, again because it has been talked about, is regarding the requirements that can or cannot be waived. Again, I encourage my colleagues to go back and see what is in the legislation, because it has been written very carefully with a huge amount of input from a broad number of people. The requirements that cannot be waived in Ed-Flex--again, spelled out in the bill--include such things as: The civil rights requirements, the underlying purposes of each program or act for which a waiver is granted. 
   The third one that I want to stress right now--I will not go through the rest of these--as requirements that cannot be waived under Ed-Flex, is parental participation and involvement. We have heard a lot about the parents, how important it is to have the parents involved. I agree. There is nobody that cares more about their children, about the future of their children, than those parents. 
   One important thing is the whole notion of public notice. We talked a little bit about public notice. This is one area that has been greatly improved, I think compared to a year ago--public notice of those waivers. 
   First of all, let's see what is currently being done in terms of public notice of the waivers. Let's look at Texas. In Texas, at the local level requests for waivers must be reviewed by campus and/or site-based decision making committees composed of parents, teachers, and other community representatives. 
   The same thing in Maryland. I won't go through the details. But, if you look at these examples, you will see that through public notice, comments and concerns by the parents are made known. The parents are involved. 
   To take another example of public notice in current Ed-Flex States, in Michigan, it has a waiver-referent group composed of representatives from a number of people: Michigan Department of Education, local and intermediate school districts, private schools--and importantly--parent organizations. 
   Furthermore, if you look at the public notice, among the criteria that the Secretary uses to evaluate a State's Ed-Flex application is,  
   Did the State conduct effective public hearings or provide other means for broad-based public involvement in the development of the Ed-Flex plan? How has the State involved districts, schools and [very specifically] parents, community groups and advocacy and civil rights groups in the development of the plan?  
   These are the criteria that are used, which will be used as well under extension under our bill.  
   I can just go on. The other criterion that they have to use is,  
   How would the State provide districts, parent organizations, advocacy and civil rights groups and other interested parties with notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed waivers of Federal requirements?  
   Again, as you can see, parents are an integral part of this waiver process. And there is a good reason. As has been pointed out by both sides, we want parents involved. Nobody cares more about the education of the children of this country than those parents. 
   The National Education Association, (NEA), on February 25, 1999 made an important statement. I d like to look at how a group that is involved in education, that is objective, that is not on one side of the aisle here, that is not just a policymaker but is a group of people who are in the field, who have a vested interest in education and education policy--how do they view the direction we are going, in terms of that overall balance? I think we can go through this first statement on the chart. It says:  
   ......the NEA believes the Ed-Flex legislation introduced by Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bill Frist of Tennessee is a step in the right direction.  
   Remember, we are not trying to cure all of the problems in education today. That is not our purpose in this particular bill. That is a process underway in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee right now as we are reauthorizing the ESEA, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is the appropriate forum for that. This is a very targeted bill that can be passed to the benefit of hundreds of thousands of children if we do it right over the next several days. 
   But going back to the NEA, because again I want to stay on this issue of parents, how do they view what we are doing from the outside with their vested interest in education, the education establishment, and, most important, the education of our children? I will turn to the second quotation from their letter. They say:  
   The bill has been much improved through the addition of increased accountability and coordination measures and a public comment period that permits parents and members of the community to participate actively in education reforms.  
   I think this again is critically important, because it demonstrates objectively that we, as a body, on a bipartisan bill, have made absolutely sure to address the accountability issue and to address the issue of including parents. 
   I have to say, ``The bill has been improved.......'' Those are the words of the NEA, which shows we have taken a bill that really went through committee and passed, and have been willing to work again with all interested parties to make sure that accountability, through the eight steps I outlined, through the tiered approach of the pyramid, guarantees--guarantees--that accountability. 
   Just so people will know, because it is always hard for people to go back and read the bill, on the public notice and comment 
   issue, which I think is very important--just so people will know specifically what is in the bill on public notice and comment, let me just read directly from the bill, page 13. The bill has been distributed.  
   Public notice and comment.--Each State educational agency granted waiver authority under this section and each local educational agency receiving a waiver under this section shall provide the public adequate and efficient notice of the proposed waiver authority or waiver, consisting of a description of the agency's application for the proposed waiver authority or waiver in a widely read or distributed medium, and shall provide the opportunity for all interested members of the community to comment regarding the proposed waiver authority or waiver.  
   I repeat, ``shall provide the opportunity for all interested members of the community to comment regarding the proposed waiver authority or waiver.'' 
   There are a number of other issues. I wanted, again, to come back to the accountability issue and parental involvement, both issues that have been addressed. People who read the bill will find the accountability and parental involvement issues very, very strongly enumerated, supported, and substantiated in the bill, again with the input of the Department of Education, from whom we solicited direct input on how to assure that accountability, and many, many other interested parties. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take great pleasure today in introducing the Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1999. With this legislation, which doesn't cost taxpayers a penny, Congress has the opportunity to recognize and encourage potential donors, and give hope to over 52,000 Americans who have end-stage disease. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I saw one in four of my patients die because of the lack of available donors. Public awareness simply has not kept up with the relatively new science of transplantation. As public servants, we need to do all we can to raise awareness about the gift of life. 
   Under this bill, each donor or donor family will be eligible to receive a commemorative Congressional medal. It is not expected that all families, many of whom wish to remain anonymous, will take advantage of this opportunity. The program will be coordinated by the regional organ procurement organizations [OPO's] and managed by the entity administering the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Upon request of the family or individual, a public official will present the medal to the donor or the family. This creates a wonderful opportunity to honor those sharing life through donation and increase public awareness. Some researchers have estimated that it may be possible to increase the number of organ donations by 80 percent through public education. 
   Any one of us, or any member of our families, could need a life saving transplant. We would then be placed on a waiting list to anxiously await our turn, or our death. The number of people on the list has more than doubled since 1990--and a new name is added to the list every 18 minutes. In my home State of Tennessee, 62 Tennesseans died in 1998 while waiting, and more than 775 people are in need of a transplant. Nationally, because of a lack of organs, close to 5,000 listed individuals died in 1998. 
   However, the official waiting list reflects only those who have been lucky enough to make it into the medical care system and to pass the financial hurdles. If you include all those reaching end-stage disease, the number of people potentially needing organs or bone marrow, very likely over 120,000, becomes staggering. Only a small fraction of that number would ever receive transplants, even if they had adequate insurance. There simply are not enough organ and tissue donors, even to meet present demand. 
   Federal policies surrounding the issue of organ transplantation are difficult. Whenever you deal with whether someone lives or dies, there are no easy answers. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 potential cadaveric donors each year, yet inexcusably, in 1997 there were only some 5,400 actual donors. That's why we need you to help us educate others about the facts surrounding tissue and organ donation. 
   Mr. President, there has been unprecedented cooperation, on both sides of the aisle, and a growing commitment to awaken public compassion on behalf of those who need organ transplants. It is my very great pleasure to introduce this bill on behalf of a group of Senators who have already contributed in extremely significant ways to the cause of organ transplantation. And we are proud to ask you to join us, in encouraging people to give life to others. 
   By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. JEFFORDS, and Mr. HELMS):

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will be discussing two critical areas as we address the education of our youth in this country. Those two areas are flexibility and accountability. Discussing this topic with me will be Senators CHAFEE, BOND, CRAIG, VOINOVICH, GREGG, HUTCHINSON, and COLLINS. 
   The issue that we will discuss is called Ed-Flex. Specifically, it is the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. The shorthand version is ``Ed-Flex.'' That is the way it will be referred to, I am sure, over the next several hours and the next several days as we look at this particular bill which I expect to come to the floor next week. 
   Let me begin by discussing what Ed-Flex is so people will know what we are talking about. It is really pretty simple. Ed-Flex is a State waiver program that allows schools and school districts at the local level to obtain or have the opportunity to obtain a waiver to carry out and accomplish a specific educational mission, but with flexibility free of Washington red tape, free of the administrative regulatory burden which too often--and we hear it as we travel across the State again and again--shackles them in terms of meeting those specific goals. These regulations are often well intentioned. We create them right here in this room in Washington, DC, and then we expect them to fit every local community. They simply don't fit. That is No. 1. That is what Ed-Flex is. 
   No. 2, we as a country recognize we are failing our children today in terms of education. We are trying hard, teachers are trying hard, local schools are trying hard, but we simply are not doing the job that our children deserve in preparing them for the next millennium. 
   Ed-Flex allows every State the option of participating in a demonstration program which has been enormously successful; this program was first established in 1994 and expanded in 1996. So we have a track record. Right now Ed-Flex is in 12 States. What this bill does is strengthen the accountability provisions and then gives all 50 States the opportunity to participate in Ed-Flex to help our States, to help our localities. 
   Education is primarily a local issue. That is where these decisions should be made. Washington must give these localities, these schools, these school districts, the flexibility they need in order to innovate, to do a better job, to do what they know is best. 
   Let me cite some examples that really make it clear to people. They understand Ed-Flex is a State waiver program that allows schools and school districts to accomplish goals free of red tape. Here are some examples: 
   In Maryland, Ed-Flex reduced class size for math and science students from 25 to 1 to 12 to 1. It has cut it in half. They wouldn't have been able to do it without Ed-Flex. 
   In Oregon, Ed-Flex allowed high schools and community colleges to work together to provide advanced computer courses to students who would otherwise not be able to receive this technical instruction. 
   A third example: In Kansas, waivers provide all-day kindergarten, preschool for 4-year-olds, and new reading strategies for all students. It would not be possible without Ed-Flex. 
   It is common sense. It is bipartisan. It is a plan that has been supported by every Governor in this country. It is one that we are going to move ahead, doing the Nation's business in a bipartisan way to accomplish what I believe is one of the most important goals before us, and that is to improve education in this country.  
   Now, that describes the flexibility, innovation, and creativity. The accountability is an important issue, because if you strip away Washington red tape, you have to be accountable. Accountability is built strongly into this bill. It is even tiered-in so that you have local accountability, State accountability, and Federal accountability to make sure that those missions are accomplished. 
   At the local level, schools have to demonstrate why this waiver is necessary, what the objectives will be; they have to have specific, measurable goals. 
   At the State level, there must be in place an accountability system in three ways: You have to have content standards, No. 1; No. 2, you have to have performance standards; and No. 3, you have to have assessment standards. Backing that up at the Federal level, the Secretary of Education is required to monitor the performance of States, and in fact the Secretary can terminate the State's waiver authority at any time. 
   So we have a three-tiered approach to accountability. 
   Ed-Flex expansion has passed twice in the Senate Labor Committee. It has the support of 38 Senators from both sides of the aisle. It has the support of the National Governors' Association. It has the support of the Democratic Governors' Association. The Secretary of Education and the President have all called for Ed-Flex expansion. 
   Last year, we ran out of time to pass Ed-Flex. It has already gone through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee this year. We need to keep the bill clean and simple. There will be an unfortunate tendency to put a lot of amendments on the bill and attach your favorite education bill. We have an opportunity to have a bill passed in this body next week, passed by the House of Representatives within a couple of weeks, and at the President's desk within 6 weeks. It is a simple message: Congress cares about education. 
   Congress respects local control, local innovation, local creativity. And we, by passing this bill, demonstrate to the American people that we can work together in the interest of our children, preparing them for that next century, the next millennium. Let's untie the hands of local government. Let them do the jobs they are entrusted to do. Ed-Flex is a modest bill, but an important first step at administrative regulatory simplification with strong accountability built in. I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this bill next week, again, with strong bipartisan support. 
   I thank the Chair. At this juncture, I will yield to my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island. I will yield to colleagues, and they can take from my time as we go forth over the next 45 minutes.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to establish the Howard Baker School of Government at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am proud to introduce this legislation with my colleague, Senator THOMPSON. Although the Senate passed this legislation last year, unfortunately it was not signed into law before the completion of the 105th Congress. 
   The bill we are introducing today would create a new academic program at the University of Tennessee, and authorize the appropriation of $10 million to establish the school and its endowment fund to provide long-term funding for personnel and operations. I am pleased that this school is to be named in honor of Senator Howard Baker, who is a University of Tennessee alumnus. Senator Baker has enjoyed a distinguished career in public service. He served in the U.S. Senate for 18 years, held the positions of Minority and Majority Leader, was a presidential candidate, and has served as White House Chief of Staff to President Reagan. Senator Baker has been a long supporter of the University of Tennessee, working diligently to raise funds for various fellowships and scholarships. He has served his State and country with pride and integrity, and it is therefore fitting that we establish a School of Government in his name. 
   The Howard Baker School of Government would comprise the existing political science, public administration, regional planning, and social science research programs, house manuscript collections from important public figures such as Tennessee's three presidents and leading twentieth-century political figures, and institute a lecture series on public issues. In addition, the school will establish a professorship to improve the teaching, research, and understanding of democratic institutions, establish a fellowship program for students interested in pursuing a career in public affairs, and support the professional development of elected officials at all government levels. The School of Government will be housed in the renovated former Hoskins Library, and will be dedicated to advancing the principles of democratic citizenship, civic duty, and public responsibility through the education and  training of informed citizenry and public officials. 
   Again, I am proud to introduce this legislation which I believe will bring greater prominance to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, while simultaneously honoring one of our State's most distinguished public servants.

I have heard from thousands of fellow Tennesseans during this trial, and their opinions were deeply split. While I looked to the people of Tennessee for guidance, responsibility for my final vote ultimately turned on my own conscience. I am sure that this will be one of the most important votes I cast as a United States Senator, and I am honored to explain fully my vote.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Nation's rural health infrastructure is facing immense pressures. Changes in the private market, Medicare, Medicaid, and costs of new technologies, treatments and education are squeezing many providers out of rural areas. The President's budget shows a surprising lack of sensitivity to the critical realities in these underserved areas. 
   First, the President would cut reimbursement to hospitals an additional $9 billion over the next five years. This comes before most providers have had time to absorb the full impact of the Balanced Budget Act. Rural hospitals have lower patient volumes than urban hospitals, and they serve populations with a larger proportion of seniors, on average, than urban populations. In addition, nearly 20% of rural individuals don't carry health insurance. The burden this imposes on rural providers is intensified by the President's reduction of bad debt payments to hospitals by 10%. 
   Congress has begun to address these problems, and late last year, we provided $25 million for state implementation of the Rural Hospital Flexibility Program. This program creates cost-based reimbursement for Critical Access Hospitals. The money will help states develop and implement a rural health plan, develop networks, designate Critical Access Hospitals, and to improve rural emergency medical services. 
   I must point out that people in rural areas don't have many choices of health providers. Thirty-seven states have less than 1% enrollment in Medicare risk plans. Often one hospital will serve the needs of many communities interspersed through very large regions. We must take great care to support, rather than destroy, the rural health infrastructure. We may need to reexamine the payment rates to hospitals, but let us do so with good data, and an awareness of the special needs of rural safety net providers. 
   In addition, HCFA has not yet adequately educated beneficiaries or resolved the regulatory payment issues surrounding Medicare private plan opportunities in rural areas. We in Congress must continue to monitor the developments in Medicare+Choice, and make the most of opportunities to increase the quality and choice of health care for rural Americans. 
   The Administration also ignored calls for an increased investment in important programs such as the National Health Service Corps, and Rural Health and Telehealth--flatlining their funding. The Office of Management and Budget also refused a request from the rural health caucus to appropriate additional demonstration grant funding for the development of emergency medical services networks. 
   At a time when the U.S. needs to prepare itself for emergency response to public health threats, including bioterrorism and identifying and tracking emerging threats such as antimicrobial resistance, President Clinton proposes to eliminate the health professions education programs intended to increase the number of individuals in the public health workforce. These programs include support for retraining existing public health workers, as well as increasing the supply of new practitioners to address priority public health needs. 
   As Chairman on the Subcommittee on Public Health, I was especially disturbed to find that the President proposes to eliminate programs directed at training primary care physicians and dentists with an emphasis of practicing in rural areas. The President signed my bill reauthorizing these important programs less than three months ago. 
   Currently $80 million is spent to assist medical and dental schools in developing programs to train family physicians, general internists, physician assistants, general dentists and pediatric dentists. 
   There is a demonstrated imbalance between primary care providers and specialists. The key to correcting this imbalance is to provide appropriate incentives at the medical school level to introduce more students to primary care settings during their training. Yet, the President wants to eliminate it. 
   [Last year's request = $77 million ($80 million appropriated)] 
   COMMUNITY-BASED LINKAGES: 
   Today, $54 million is spent to develop and support health professional training programs that link community providers with academic institutions. President Clinton suggests a $17 million (30%) reduction. 
   This funding supports: 
   Area Health Education Centers (AHECs)--support health care in underserved rural and urban areas, including recruitment and support to help rural communities retain health professionals. 
   Education and Training Relating to Geriatrics--Congress established this program to ensure that our health professionals are trained to meet the needs of seniors. With the aging of the baby boom generation, the number of seniors will double over the next 40 years. 
   Rural Interdisciplinary Training Grants--supports projects to train, recruit and retain health care practitioners in rural areas. 
   [Last year's request = $51 million, $54 million appropriated, fy'00 request = $37 million] 
   I'm disappointed that such important rural programs failed to receive adequate funding under the President's budget proposal. It appears that the Administration would do well to reexamine their commitment to a viable rural health infrastructure, and I urge my colleagues to renew their efforts to protect vulnerable Americans in rural areas.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the authorization bill for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. 
   NASA's unique mission of exploration, discovery, and innovation has preserved America's role as both a world leader in aviation and the preeminent spacefaring nation. It is NASA's mission to: 
   Explore, use, and enable the development of space for human enterprise; 
   Advance scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe and utilize the environment of space for research; and 
   Research, develop, verify and transfer advanced aeronautics, space and related technologies. 
   This bill is essentially the same as reported by the Commerce Committee last year. It contains provisions that had bi-partisan support and would have been included in a manager's amendment had the bill been brought up for discussion on the Senate floor. 
   The bill, which authorizes $13.4 billion for NASA in FY 2000, $13.8 billion for FY 2001, and $13.9 billion for FY 2002, provides for the continued development of the International Space Station, Space Shuttle operations and safety and performance upgrades, space science, life and micro gravity sciences and applications, the Earth Science program, aeronautics and space transportation technology, mission communications, academic programs, mission support and the Office of the Inspector General. 
   The FY 2000 levels are consistent with the President's request with the exception of a reduction of $200 million for the International Space Station account. This reduction eliminates the funding requested for the Russian Program Assurance activities. I feel that it is only appropriate to withhold judgement on providing additional funding to assist Russia with their financial problems until NASA provides additional explanation on how these funds will be used. The situation in Russia is changing daily and we must fully understand the impact on the Station schedule and overall cost before committing more funds. 
   The FY 2001 and FY 2002 levels represent a 3 percent increase over the previous year's amount with the exception of the Space Station. The Space Station has been authorized in accordance with NASA outyear projections for FY 2001 and FY 2002. 
   The bill contains a price cap on the development costs of the International Space Station. The price cap language provides NASA with additional funding Space Station development and allows for additional Space Shuttle flights by exempting certain activities at the point when research, operating and crew return vehicles activities' costs comprise more than 95 percent of the annual funding for the Station. At this point, the majority of the activities are truly beyond the development phase of the project. 
   The bill provides for liability cross-waivers for the Space Station. The provision authorizes, but does not require NASA to enter into agreements with any cooperating party participating in the Space Station program, whereby all involved parties agree to take the risk of damage to their own assets, and agrees not to sue other entities. These cross waivers would not apply in the case of sabotage or other deliberate and willful acts. 
   NASA has indicated that these liability cross-waivers will be needed to fully commercialize the Space Station. I support the commercialization of the Station as a means of achieving a return on investment for the public through the creation of new industries and jobs for the Nation. 
   I am concerned with the cost and schedule delays in other programs as well. The X-33 test vehicle and the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility programs represents major investments of public funds and therefore should be managed such that program requirements are met in a timely manner. 
   The balance between manned and unmanned flight, as well as the balance between fundamental science and development activities, is in need of review. I intend to pursue these balances further when the Commerce Committee holds hearings on the NASA budget and associated activities in the upcoming weeks. 
   Therefore, I, along with my co-sponsors, urge the Members of this body to support this bill and allow NASA to continue its mission of support for all space flight, for technological progress in aeronautics, and for space science.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of aviation legislation that I believe will improve the quality of life for Tennesseans. First, I would like to introduce ``The Great Smoky Mountains National Park Overflights Act.'' 
   Last year, I was an original sponsor of the ``National Parks Overflights Act'' along with my colleague and Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator JOHN MCCAIN. I was proud to have my name associated with this legislation. But, in spite of overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in the Senate, an unrelated dispute in the conference committee with the House of Representatives led to its demise in the 105th Congress. 
   Last year's legislation would have affected many National Parks from coast to coast and even Hawaii. The legislation I am introducing today will only affect the Smokies. I am advancing a more limited approach because I believe the preservation of the Smokies and the safety of park visitors are far too important to include with other more contentious legislative efforts. 
   As the air tour industry in many parks continues to grow, safety concerns also increase. By addressing safety now, before tragic accidents occur, we can assure the public that we have taken every precaution to protect visitors in our parks. Under this legislation, the Federal Aviation Administrator will work in tandem with the Secretary of the Interior to ensure public health and safety goals are met while concurrently maintaining the natural beauty and serenity of our Smoky Mountains National Park. This bill makes park overflight passenger safety a paramount concern for the Federal Aviation Administrator, who, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, will set minimum altitudes for overflights and will prohibit  flights below those minimum altitudes where necessary to meet safety goals. 
   This legislation also takes a crucial first step toward restoring and preserving a vital resource within the Smokies--natural quiet. The natural ambient sound condition found in a park, or natural quiet, as it is commonly called, is precisely what many Americans seek to experience when they visit some of our most treasured national parks. Natural quiet is as crucial an element of the natural beauty and splendor of certain parks as those resources that we visually observe and appreciate. 
   I believe that this critical environmental legislation strikes a careful balance between the reasonable concerns of those in the air tour industry and the environmental necessity of preserving the natural quiet of the Smokies. I am a pilot and I know well the beauty and thrill of flying low. The Smokies beg for more restraint. They must be enjoyed from a responsible altitude where the noise of our aircraft does not disturb the life and majesty below our wings. 
   The second piece of legislation that I would like to introduce today is the Air Service Improvement Act of 1999. As many of my colleagues know, I have spent considerable time working with airport managers, airlines and many others attempting to solve the problems of underserved small communities. It became clear to me early on that there is no silver bullet solution. Rather, a learning process has taken place where we have discovered what has worked best for the individual communities in question. Moreover, the problems of small communities are related to the competition issues at larger, well-served airports. Tennessee is experiencing both problems. 
   In Memphis, there is certainly adequate service, but limited competition results in high fares. In the Eastern part of our State, there are several communities that have little competition and limited service. We can do better. 
   It is critical that we remember that deregulation has been remarkably successful in spite of the ``pockets of pain'' in some communities. Therefore any changes must be made with an emphasis on the free market and not be reregulatory in nature. Deregulation has served most Americans well and should not be dismantled. 
   With that prologue, I would like to go through some of the provisions of the Small Communities Air Services Act. For most small and medium sized communities that are underserved, access is the key. These airports must have access to major hubs that provide network benefits. When travelers in the Tri-Cities have jet service to Chicago they can conveniently connect to nearly any city in the world. And indeed, much of the improvements the underserved markets of Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities have seen over the past two years has been from the Department of Transportation adding slots that created additional access to Chicago. 
   With access to the Nation's four slot-controlled airports as a primary goal, I am proposing that the Secretary of Transportation be required to approve all applications from underserved small and medium-sized communities that partner with an air carrier that is willing to serve their market. The Secretary will retain the right to deny applications only if the Federal Aviation Administration certifies that the increase in operations is unsafe or if increase in operations violates the National Environmental Policy Act. In short, if an additional flight from an underserved area is safe and does not have adverse environmental effects the slot shall be awarded. 
   Additionally, I am introducing provisions that I worked closely with Chairman MCCAIN on last year. These include a grant program for small communities, an in-depth study on market-based incentives using regional jets, and numerous safety programs affecting small communities including an FAA tower program. It is my belief that collectively, this initiative will diminish many of the challenges that underserved communities now face. 
   Again, it is my strong belief that both the Overflights legislation and the Air Service Act will improve significantly the quality of life for Tennesseans. I thank my colleagues for their consideration of these proposals, but I would especially like to thank the Majority Leader TRENT LOTT and Chairman JOHN MCCAIN for their considerable assistance.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would elevate Congress' commitment to technological innovation and long-term economic growth. The Federal Research Investment Act specifically targets federally-funded, civilian research and development (R&D), while establishing greater accountability mechanisms for both Congress and the White House. The bill would bolster the aggregate amount of federal funding for R&D over an 11-year period. Although this legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent last year, the rush to finish the 1999 federal budget kept it from reaching the floor of the House of Representatives and the President's desk. 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER, my partner in this endeavor, and I are not discouraged. We believe that we laid a solid foundation to build on by getting this legislation through the Senate last year. Now, we intend to persistently advocate for increased funding levels for basic R&D until they are realized. This legislation is the product of numerous hearings, caucus events, forums, and meetings with scientists and scholars from across the country. We have been working closely together on this legislation and feel that now, more than ever, Congress must advocate for greater R&D funding to preserve the future economic prosperity of our nation. 
   Innovation is a key element of economic growth in the United States. Economists widely agree that more than 50 percent of our economic growth is directly linked to technological innovation. It is the principle driving force behind our long-term growth and our rising standard of living. Technology contributes to economic growth through the creation of new jobs, new goods and services, new capital and even new industries. 
   The Federal Government plays a critical role in driving the innovation process in the United States. The majority of the Federal Government's basic R&D is directed toward critical missions to serve the public interest in areas including health, environmental pollution control, space exploration,  and national defense. Federal funds support nearly 60 percent of the nation's basic research, with a similar share performed in colleges and universities. Congressional support reflects a consensus that although basic research is the foundation for many innovations, the rate of return to society generated by investments in R&D is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the performing institution. 
   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) received the largest dollar increase in history in the fiscal year (FY) 1999 federal budget. The agency received a record 14.1 percent increase in its R&D budget, nearly $2 billion. Due to steady increases every year, the NIH R&D budget is now 28 percent larger in inflationary-adjusted terms than it was in FY 1994. 
   NIH's overwhelming support by Congress reflects a growing popular movement both in the Senate and House to double funding for NIH over the next five years. Many of my colleagues, eager to fund the biotechnology that enables our citizens to live longer, more healthy lives, are embracing this crusade. I believe, however, many of them are missing the critical link that exists between the breakthrough advances we are experiencing today and what has enabled them to occur. The funding surge of R&D in the sciences in the 1960's created a wealth of research opportunities for scientists throughout the nation. Since that time though, funding has declined steadily with no hint of a reversal of that downward trend. If we are to dedicate ourselves to advancement of biotechnology and all the benefits that it will afford, we must support it with solid funding for the basic sciences. One truly depends upon the other. And that critical link, I believe, has been lost in the revolution of health care policy. 
   Fiscal constraints due to recent efforts to balance the federal budget threaten the U.S. R&D infrastructure. This is due to both a long-term problem of the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending of discretionary funding that must be allocated across an increasing range of programs. Now, for the first time in nearly three decades, the Federal Government has attained a budget surplus of $70 billion in 1998. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office estimates a budget surplus of approximately $1.5 trillion over the next ten years. As Congress debates how to allocate surplus funds, serious consideration must be given to federal research and development investment. 
   As a result of the current monetary environment in Congress and the desire to utilize the surplus prudently, I am confident that investing in basic R&D, and in turn the technological innovation of the future, is a proper use of the federal taxpayers dollars. Furthermore, the increased funding called for in this legislation is coupled with a judicious strategy for federal investment and strong accountability mechanisms to help guide the Administration and Congress. Nothing less is acceptable. 
   Mr. President, despite its modest share of total U.S. R&D funding, the Federal Government continues to play a vital role in the nation's R&D enterprise. With dramatic decreases in U.S. defense R&D spending in the post Cold-War era, devoting attention to civilian basic research is more critical now than ever before. This pivotal need for a resurgence in basic R&D investments is evident when we further consider our nation's increased dependency on technology and the global competition that threatens our sustained leadership position. R&D drives the innovation process, which in turn drives the U.S. economy. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the nation's future prosperity.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the bill we are introducing today and to urge my colleagues to pass a strong Patients' Bill of Rights this year. Our Patients' Bill of Rights is a good bill that will improve the quality of health care for patients in this country.  
   We have the benefit of starting off in a new Congress. The partisan rhetoric of elections is behind us. Today, we are here to convey our genuine interest to pass managed care reform this year as well as to provide the necessary building blocks to improve health care quality. 
   Not much attention was given in last year's debate to the many areas of agreement between the Republican and Democratic proposals. It is my hope that we can work together this year in a deliberative, thoughtful manner to pass bipartisan legislation. For example, there is bipartisan support to enact strong patient protection standards including coverage for emergency screening exams and services; allowing continuity of care so that patients may keep their physician, even if he or she is dropped from the plan, during a terminal illness, institutional care or pregnancy; and to prohibit plans from including gag clauses in their contracts. There is also strong consensus that we must require health plans to provide comparative information about their plans and to hold plans accountable for their decisions by allowing patients to appeal coverage denials to an independent medical expert, including expedited reviews, and receive a timely response. 
   In addition, I am pleased that many provisions that are in the Senate Republican bill also have received bipartisan support. Our bill last year included the ``Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments,'' which I also introduced as S. 1722, that passed the Senate unanimously at the end of last year. These programs provide a broad spectrum of activities to improve the quality of women's health; including research, prevention, treatment, education and data collection. 
   We must remember that the central focus of this debate--the genesis for the entire debate--is to embark on a national discussion of how we can truly improve real quality of care for patients. Our bill this year will again contain two measures which have broad bipartisan support and will greatly improve the quality of health care in this country. 
   Title III of our bill prohibits genetic discrimination against individuals in health insurance. Prohibiting genetic discrimination translates into a patient's right to quality care. Genuine quality care means that patients and practitioners have the very best information available to them when they make health care decisions. Patients should not be afraid to benefit from new genetic technologies, or share personal information that has immense potential to improve care and save lives. This is not a political or partisan issue. Our 49 Republican cosponsors last year, several of our Democratic colleagues, and President Clinton all support enacting legislation to prohibit genetic discrimination. 
   Title IV of our bill refocuses the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to support our federal efforts to improve health care quality through a vigorous research agenda. I also introduced this proposal as a stand alone bill (S. 2208) last year which had broad bipartisan support. Our goal is to enhance the agency to become the driving force of our federal efforts to support the science necessary to provide patients with information about the quality of care they receive and to provide physicians with research data to improve health care outcomes for their patients. 
   There is no question Congress will need to revisit some issues in the managed care debate. However, we will work deliberatively and in a bipartisan manner through our committee work this year to pass comprehensive legislation because we all share the ultimate goal of improving health care quality for patients.

    Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN, The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. This bipartisan measure will expand the immensely popular and highly successful Ed-Flex program to all 50 states in the country. As you may know, Ed-Flex is currently a demonstration program, available only to 12 states. Under the Frist-Wyden bill, all states would have the option to participate in the program. 
   States and localities have waged a war on poor student performance and they need our help. For too long, Washington has dictated a plan riddled with red tape and regulation. Stagnant student performance has been the result. The longer a child is in an American school, the more his math and science skills deteriorate compared to the skills of his international peers, according to the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS). Out of 21 countries, the United States ranked 19th in math and 16th in science for twelfth graders. 
   To help our states and localities, Washington must give them the flexibility that they need in order to find creative solutions that make sense in their own communities. When localities find ideas that work, the federal government should either get out of the way or lend a helping hand. The last thing that our schools need is more bureaucracy and federal intrusion. Education dollars should be spent in the classroom, not in the front office. 
   Ed-Flex frees states from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming Washington regulations, so long as states are complying with certain core federal principles, such as civil rights, and so long as the states are making progress toward improving their students' results. Under the Ed-Flex program, the Department of Education delegates to the states its power to grant individual school districts temporary waivers from certain federal requirements that interfere with state and local efforts to improve education. To be eligible, a state must waive its own regulations on schools. It must also hold schools accountable for results. The 12 states that currently participate in Ed-Flex have used this flexibility to allow school districts to innovate and better use federal resources to improve student outcomes. 
   For instance, the Phelps Luck Elementary School in Howard County, Maryland used its waiver to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading students who have the greatest need in grades 1-5. They also used their waiver to lower the average student/teacher ratio in mathematics and reading from 25/1 to 12/1. By granting localities more flexibility to use resources already allocated, Ed-Flex allows local decision-makers to decide for themselves how to best tailor federal programs to meet the needs of their own schools. 
   As the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education, formed by Budget Chairman PETE DOMENICI, I heard first-hand accounts of the success of the Ed-Flex program and the need for flexibility for our states that are overburdened by federal requirements. Secretary Riley told the Task Force that, ``through our Ed-Flex demonstration initiative, we are giving State-level officials broad authority to waive federal requirements that present an obstacle to innovation in their schools.'' The Department of Education further notes, ``Ed-Flex can help participating states and local school districts use federal funds in ways that provide maximum support for effective school reform based on challenging academic standards for all students.'' 
   Recent GAO reports have questioned whether Ed-Flex has addressed or can address all of the concerns that local schools and school districts have regarding the regulatory and administrative requirements that federal education programs impose. GAO is definitive in its answer: Ed-Flex hasn't and it won't. We certainly do not believe that Ed-Flex is a panacea to our nation's educational system's woes. Nor do we believe that the complexity, redundancy and rigidity that are the unfortunate hallmarks of our federal education effort will magically disappear. But it is a good first step. Not all states will be as active with Ed-Flex waiver authority as front-runners like Texas, but they all deserve the opportunity to try. 
   The time has come for this common sense reform. In the Senate, the Ed-Flex expansion bill had 21 bipartisan cosponsors last year. The Labor Committee passed the bill by a vote of 17-1. In the House, Representatives CASTLE (R-DE) and ROEMER (D-IN) introduced companion legislation with 25 House cosponsors. The National Governors' Association has made Ed-Flex expansion a top priority and both the White House and the Department of Education support Ed-Flex expansion. Last year, there obviously was a convergence of support from all corners; nevertheless, the usual end-of-the-session morass claimed Ed-Flex as one of its many victims. 
   We must do better in the 106th Congress. Ed-Flex is a bi-partisan proposal with broad-based support. Even so, Ed-Flex expansion will again face an uphill battle. Some in Congress want to delay real reform by attaching poison pill amendments or waiting for the reauthorization of the far-reaching Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) scheduled for 1999. If history is any guide, Congress will be lucky to have completed the reauthorization process for K-12 education programs two years from now. Ed-Flex expansion should not get bogged down in this partisan embroglio. Delay is not the answer to our education crisis. The jury is in on Ed-Flex. Let's not allow partisanship to stop us from improving the public education system. We hope that Congress will rise to meet the challenge of helping our children sooner rather than later. 
   Mr. President, I believe that passage of this legislation is a strong first step for improving our public education system. Let's give states and localities the flexibility that they need to address the many needs of our students. I am hopeful that we will move this bill quickly in a bipartisan way. I strongly urge passage of this bill.

   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise to acknowledge another NCAA National Championship for the University of Tennessee. Last year, I had the opportunity to congratulate the Tennessee Lady Vols on their third straight national women's basketball title, but just two weeks ago, the University of Tennessee Volunteer football team defeated the Seminoles of Florida State University in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona to become the undisputed champions of college football. 
   It was a perfect ending to a perfect season; a season of thirteen wins and zero losses; a season in which this national championship team pulled together to overcome tremendous adversity, including the loss of key starters to the National Football League, the loss of a Heisman Trophy candidate to a season-ending injury, and arguably the most challenging schedule in collegiate football, to attain the national title. 
   Today, along with my fellow Volunteer fan, Senator THOMPSON, I introduce this sense-of-the-Senate resolution recognizing the University of Tennessee Volunteers for their commitment to excellence, for their dedication, for their selflessness, and for their sportsmanship throughout the 1998 football season. 
   Mr. President, I, along with my fellow Tennesseans, watched with pride as the Volunteers marched their way through the 1998 football season setting numerous school records, Southeastern Conference records, and NCAA records. For players, coaches, and fans, it was indeed a remarkable season full of excitement, anxiety, and joy. From Jeff Hall's last-second field goal in the opening game to defeat Syracuse to Peerless Price's spectacular touchdown receptions against Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl, the Vols proved again and again that they can delivery in the clutch in a manner befitting a champion. 
   Throughout the year, the Volunteers functioned as a cohesive unit, rather than relying on only a few star players. Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer, the winningest active coach in college football, put it best when he said, ``It's been an unbelievable effort. *.*.* It's amazing what you can accomplish when no one cares who gets the credit.'' Truly a testament to the selflessness and determination of this national championship team. 
   In closing, I would like to congratulate the team, Coach Fulmer, his assistant coaches, and the outstanding faculty and staff of the Univesity of Tennessee, all of whom contributed to this championship season. Finally, I would like to recognize the most important group, the group in which I am honored to be included, the Tennessee Volunteer fans.
