   Mr. VOINOVICH. I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Senator DEWINE. I do not think we can stress enough that this really is a matter of survival for these companies and their employees. The government bears some responsibility here, we simply must get this bill done as soon as possible. The companies, their workers, and asbestos victims--after all when the companies go bankrupt it affects payments to victims--need certainty that this will be brought to the Senate floor at the earliest possible date next year. We need to work to keep these companies afloat.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today is November 1st, one month after the beginning of the new fiscal year and less than one week before the 2000 elections. Most of us in this body had anticipated that by now, we would be home in our respective states instead of here in Washington. However, we are once again in the midst of gridlock with a President who, despite his eight years in office, still does not understand how to delineate the proper role of government at the federal, state and local level.  
   Our forefathers referred to this differentiation as federalism, and outlined this relationship in the 10th Amendment:  
   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.  
   Just the other day, in response to his veto of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, the President made the claim that we in Congress were taking care of ourselves first before we take care of education, and that he could not ``in good conscience'' sign a bill that would do so. 
   I would say to the Chair that I am as committed to the need to provide our children with a quality education as any member of this body--Democrat or Republican--and just as committed as the President. 
   But what the President and my friends on the other side want to do with respect to education is all wrong and it smacks of election year politics. 
   The reality is that the President has his priorities all mixed up. Over the last eight years, he has missed a fundamental opportunity to reform Social Security. Over the last eight years, he has missed the opportunity to reform Medicare. Over the last eight years, he has missed the opportunity to revamp and upgrade our military. 
   As my colleagues know, both Governor Bush and Vice President GORE have made education among their top priorities in their campaigns. As such, I believe in a few short months from now, Congress and the new President will work together to craft an ESEA reauthorization bill, which I am confident will pass quickly and be signed into law. 
   However, instead of waiting a few months to allow his successor the opportunity to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, this President seems consumed with constructing education policy through the appropriations process. 
   In this appropriation cycle, the President has demanded more than $4 billion in new education spending primarily for additional teachers, after school programs and school facilities, plus billions of additional dollars for school construction bonds. 
   Let me state emphatically to my colleagues: these activities are not federal responsibilities. 
   What is a federal responsibility is giving state and local leaders the flexibility to spend funds the way that makes the most sense for their particular school districts. 
   On this side of the aisle, we are saying, ``we trust our teachers, and principals and school superintendents to make decisions on education spending.'' We are saying we will give you education funds and if you want to spend them on hiring teachers or building schools you can, but if your needs are new technology or books or training or special education, you ought to be able to spend the money on those programs. This is the right approach. 
   Throughout American history, the federal government's role in educating America's youth has traditionally been relatively minor. The U.S. Constitution and the Federalist Papers affirm that the primary responsibility for education lies with those closest to our students in our states and localities. 
   It is parents, teachers, local school districts and states who have done the lion's share with respect to educating our children, not Washington. And the numbers back up this fact. 
   Right now in America, the Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the funds for education. 
   Let me repeat that because that fact is hardly ever discussed: the Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the funds for education in this nation. 
   That means 93 percent of each dollar that is spent on education comes from state taxes or local taxes or some other non-federal source. 
   Yet, this Administration would have the American people believe that all good things spring from Washington and that ``top down'' command-and-control policies from the White House work best. 
   To them, the local school districts in America--the parents and teachers and administrators across this nation--have no earthly idea how to educate their own children, nor do they know what their needs are. 
   Believe it or not, most states are already investing in teachers and in school construction and in technology and after school programs. 
   Most States have the money to pay for education--for teachers, for classroom materials, and for school construction. 
   The National Governors Association reports that 46 states have a budget surplus and at least 36 states have a comfortable surplus. As a result, many states have been able to increase spending on education while cutting taxes. 
   Does it make sense, then, for the White House to dangle a $4 billion carrot in front of America's school districts when so many states are reporting budget surpluses and are cutting taxes? 
   The federal government has billions of dollars of unmet needs. 
   We have a national debt of $5.7 trillion--a debt that is costing us $224 billion in interest payments a year, and $600 million per day just to pay the interest. 
   Out of every federal dollar that is spent, 13 cents will go to pay the interest on the national debt. In comparison, 16 cents will go for national defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary spending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we spend more federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the entire Medicare program. 
   Yet the President is willing to spend billions of dollars on what are state and local government responsibilities instead of targeting those funds on what are true federal needs. 
   Clearly, states are the ones with the resources for school construction, and they are, in fact, using them for that purpose. 
   When I was Governor, I felt so strongly about the importance of building new schools that I started the Ohio School Facilities Commission. Because of what we were able to do in Ohio, the General Accounting Office reported earlier this year that Ohio's increase in school construction spending from 1990-1997 was the ninth greatest in the nation in percentage terms, and the eighth greatest in terms of dollar amount. 
   In addition, thanks to the settlement our states have negotiated with the tobacco industry--something I fought hard to achieve--Ohio has more than $10 billion in additional revenues. 
   Governor Taft has pledged to fully address the facility needs of every Ohio school district within the next 12 years. His proposal for allocating $23 billion in state and local resources included a plan to fund the building needs of Ohio's 49 vocational school districts, accelerate the pace of work for our largest urban school districts, and in short give all districts an opportunity to address their immediate facility needs. 
   And in New Jersey, Governor Christine Todd Whitman announced recently that her state has begun spending money on a plan to build $12 billion worth of classrooms over the next 10 years. 
   States have invested in teachers as well. In Ohio, we realized that young teachers needed mentors to show the way. So we started a program that pays teachers $1,500 to serve as mentors to younger teachers. 
   And because professional development is important, I initiated Ohio's participation in the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. 
   I felt it was so important for us to prepare our teachers that we began encouraging teachers in Ohio to participate by paying their application fees and the cost to take the test. Teachers who passed the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards certification process were rewarded with a bonus of $2,500 for 10 years. 
   As a result of these commitments, Ohio has ranked fourth in the nation in professional development by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future. And Congress continues to recognize the value of this organization. 
   In short, like most states, Ohio is getting it done for education. But what really upsets me is the fact that the President is calling on Ohio taxpayers to send money to Washington so that the federal government can turn around and send it to states that are not meeting their responsibilities--responsibilities that are totally and absolutely state or local obligations. 
   Right now, the President is pushing to spend $1.75 billion on a school class size reduction program, but, with  120,000 teachers already in Ohio, this program at best yields only 1.5% increase in the number of teachers in my state. 
   In fact, even if the President gets all the money he wants, 47% of Ohio's public school districts and community schools will not even receive enough money from the President's program to hire a single teacher. Not a single one. 
   The Clinton class size reduction proposal undermines local control and the ability of school districts to spend money where it is needed most. But it goes to the point that the Clinton-Gore administration wants to be all things to all people. 
   I say to my colleagues, if we really want to do something for education, then we should live up to the federal commitment to IDEA. 
   In 1975, Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a program designed to help mainstream young men and women with disabilities so they could obtain a quality education. Congress thought it was such a national priority, that it promised that the Federal Government would pay up to 40 percent of the cost of this program. 
   However, through fiscal year 2000, the most that Washington provided to our school districts under IDEA is 12.6 percent of the educational costs for each handicapped child. The remainder of the cost for IDEA falls on State and local governments. 
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed two amendments that I offered regarding IDEA. The first said that Washington should live up to its commitment to fund IDEA at the 40% level before it allocates new education money. 
   The second would allow school districts to use federal money for IDEA. Or, if the district wanted to spend the money on new teachers or new facilities, they could do so. 
   If the Federal Government was fully funding IDEA, most of the education initiatives the President and my colleagues are proposing--school construction, after-school programs, and new teachers--could be and likely would be taken care of at the State and local level. 
   The Federal Government does have important responsibilities like national defense, infrastructure, Medicare and Social Security and we must also look at real federal priorities such as prescription drugs and responding to the cries of our health care system that has been short changed by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. However, Washington must figure out how to sustain paying for its responsibilities before making new commitments. 
   Because of the President's spending programs, the Labor HHS appropriations bill is, at last count, already at $113 billion. Last year, we spent $96 billion for the same bill. That's nearly an 18 percent increase. 
   This appropriations bill contains more than $43 billion for the Department of Education. In the President's own budget, he asked for only $40 billion. Still, that is almost double the $21.1 billion in discretionary education spending allocated by the Federal Government just 10 years ago in fiscal year 1991, and nearly 5 times the $8.2 billion spent on discretionary education spending 25 years ago in 1976. 
   The President and my colleagues across the aisle must stop acting as if they are the Nation's school board, trying to fund every education program possible. 
   I believe our State and local leaders should be given the flexibility they need to spend their Federal education dollars to live up to our obligations with respect to IDEA, freeing them to address state and local education needs that have not yet been met. 
   It is my hope that in the waning days of this Congress, we will find the strength to recognize what is a federal responsibility and what is not and act accordingly. We can no longer count on the President to do so: it is up to us.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad. This is Sunday, when it is the Sabbath for millions of Americans. Many of my colleagues have explained why we are here today, but I hope this is the last Sunday that the Senate, the U.S. Congress, is in session unless it is for a crisis of national or international concern. I hope this is the last Sunday that we would be here for anything but that. 
   Next Tuesday, the citizens of this nation will go to the polls and elect the next president of the United States. One of the first challenges that the new president will face is the need to recapture what has been lost for a generation of Americans: trust in the Federal Government. 
   The American people used to believe in the competence of the Federal Government to provide services and meet this nation's needs in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, in too many instances, this is not happening. Today, the Federal Government is held out as a source of scorn and ridicule. 
   The fact of the matter is that the Federal Government has brought most of this on itself through a gross inattention to management. 
   In 1993, Vice President GORE launched his ``Reinventing Government'' initiative. Purported to make government ``work better and cost less,'' it had every intention to turn the diminished reputation of the Federal Government around. 
   However, this initiative will be remembered not for its modest accomplishments, but for missed opportunities. It has rejected bold efforts to reform Federal programs and personnel issues, and actually contributed to the growing human capital crisis that will be a major headache of the next administration. 
   It will be one of the most formidable tasks of the next administration. 
   As we have all seen, the Vice President is trying to run away from the label of being for ``Big Government.'' In recent remarks in Arkansas, and in the presidential debates, he pointed to Reinventing Government as proof that he favors small government. 
   He claims credit for shrinking the Federal Government by 300,000 positions. In the third Presidential debate held earlier this month, the Vice President boasted that, due to his efforts, the Federal Government is ``now the smallest that it has been since ..... John Kennedy's administration.'' 
   The Vice President's record of reinventing government is second only to his record of inventing the Internet for genuine achievement and accuracy. 
   The truth is: more than 450,000 positions have been removed from the Federal Government since January 1993, not 300,000 as the Vice President claims. However, his offense lies not just in the fuzzy math but also in taking credit for reductions where he does not deserve it. 
   More than 290,000 of the personnel cuts that were made--64 percent of the total--came from the departments of Defense and Energy. These cuts were made at the end of the Cold War in the resulting Pentagon budget reductions, as well as through four rounds of military base closings. 
   My colleagues should be aware that this process began before the advent of the Clinton-Gore administration and existed independently of the Reinventing Government initiative. 
   Other significant personnel reductions were also independent of Reinventing Government, including 15,000 employees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who were downsized at the end of the savings and loan crisis, and 8,500 employees of the Panama Canal Commission--now just a force of seven after the canal's hand off to Panama. 
   In truth, most of the non-defense positions discussed by the Vice President have not been eliminated, but merely transferred to the private sector through Federal contracts and Federal mandates. Paul Light, of the highly-respected Brookings Institution, has documented a ``shadow workforce'' of almost 13 million contractors, grantees, and state and local government employees who serve as a de-facto extension of the Federal workforce--yet without the oversight and accountability. Evidence suggests that oversight of the contractor workforce is poor, yet contract managers were targeted for downsizing by Reinventing Government. 
   Far more noteworthy than the Vice President's characteristic exaggerations, however, is the sorry state of the civil service seven years after Reinventing Government was initiated. 
   As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, I have led an ongoing review of overall government performance. I have found an appalling lack of forethought by the Clinton-Gore administration toward workforce planning as well as the training and development of Federal employees. The ``A-Team,'' the people who get the job done, and who, for the last 7 years, have been ignored. 
   In testimony earlier this year before my subcommittee, nonpartisan experts testified that inattention to management has taken a heavy toll on the ability of the Federal workforce to do the job the American people deserve and expect. 
   Don Kettl, from the University of Wisconsin, testified:  
   The problem is that we have increasingly created a gulf between the people who are in the government and the skills needed to run that government effectively.  
   Paul Light of the Brookings Institution put it more bluntly. He testified that the downsizing initiated by Reinventing Government:  
   Has been haphazard, random, and there is no question that in some agencies we have hollowed out institutional memory and we are on the cusp of a significant human capital crisis.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, there has been an effort in recent days to score partisan political points by misrepresenting Governor Bush's commitment to NATO and southeast Europe. Unfortunately, some of my Senate colleagues have been involved in this effort. 
   No one in the Senate has been more involved in our policy toward southeast Europe, and no one cares more than I do about that part of the world. I have traveled to the region three times this year--on a factfinding mission, to participate in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and to participate in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. I have been to Kosovo twice and visited with troops. 
   I have been involved in efforts to bring about alternative leadership in Serbia--something that has finally happened. I have been a leader on the Stability Pact with the belief that its successful implementation is crucial to the long-term stability, prosperity, and peace in the region. I have also constantly watched the situation in Kosovo, outraged at the ongoing ethnic cleansing going on there today. 
   With this background and involvement, I can say definitely that Governor Bush understands the importance of the region to our national security interests. 
   I think it is important that we set the record straight. Governor Bush has said that he would systematically review our military commitments internationally upon his inauguration. He will look at them across the world. This will include a review of our deployments in the Balkans. He has said that he will work with our allies to develop a strategy to remove our troops from the region when it is possible to do so without threatening peace and stability in the region or our relationship with our European allies. He understands the important relationship we have with our NATO allies. 
   There never was and never will be any statement by Governor Bush or, if he is elected, President Bush, regarding a reduced commitment to NATO. He understands how important NATO is. 
   Vice President GORE has joined Governor Bush in saying that we should pull out of the Balkans when we are no longer needed. 
   Governor Bush is committed to political stability and security in the Balkans. He emphasized this point repeatedly--that stability in southeast Europe is vital to Europe and hence to the U.S. In other words, we have strategic interests in southeast Europe, which are important to Europe and to the security of the U.S. and, for that matter, peace in the world. So Governor Bush is committed to political stability. 
   Without the Governor's involvement in the Byrd-Warner debate on our troop commitment to Kosovo, the next President would be facing a July 1 deadline to decide whether to stay or go. Governor Bush stood up and was counted at the time of the Byrd-Warner discussion in the Senate. He demonstrated leadership at a time when leaders from both parties were considering having the U.S. unilaterally withdraw from a NATO commitment. That was a very important thing that he did at that time, because if he had not stood up and said he thought it was 
   overreach, we would have lost that on the floor of the Senate and would have done irreparable damage to our relationship with NATO. 
   We must remember that the Clinton-Gore administration promised the American people in 1995 that our troops would not be in Bosnia for longer than a year. That promise was never kept. Rather than set a misguided deadline, Governor Bush is simply saying we should not, and will not, be in the Balkans forever. Nothing more. 
   Governor Bush has said time and again that he would actively consult our European allies in the formation and implementation of our policies in NATO and in southeast Europe. I hope Lord Robertson, who heads up NATO, understands that. I made that very clear when I was at the NATO Assembly in Budapest. We understand how  important our leadership and our commitment is to NATO. 
   Governor Bush is an internationalist who is committed to NATO and our European allies. 
   These attacks are just partisan politics designed, in my opinion, to turn attention from a growing scandal involving Vice President GORE.  
   Just this morning, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing to examine Vice President GORE's dealings with former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin regarding weapons sales to Iran. It has been widely reported that the Vice President failed to fully and properly inform relevant congressional oversight committees regarding agreements reached with Russian officials. He has to be more forthcoming about what went on there. 
   The hearing was in response to new and critical information on this matter which surfaced in the New York Times report dated October 13. Governor Bush remains fully committed to NATO and American leadership in Europe. Repeating, he remains fully committed to NATO and American leadership in Europe. 
   He understands our unique role and is committed to maintaining that leadership. We know how important our leadership is to NATO. We certainly found that out during the Kosovo-Serbian war that we had. To suggest that he doesn't understand is just plain hogwash.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the main reasons I ran for the Senate was to bring fiscal discipline to Washington. As the 106th Congress winds down this week, I look back with mixed feelings at the actions that have been taken over the last 2 years toward bringing our financial house in order. While for the first time we are not spending the Social Security surplus or the Medicare Part A surplus, I believe we could have done a much better job in reining in Federal spending. 
   Indeed, one fact that does not seem to draw too much attention is the fact that Washington increased overall nondefense domestic discretionary spending in fiscal year 2000 to $328 billion. That is a 9.3-percent boost over the previous fiscal year, and the largest single-year increase in nondefense discretionary spending since 1980. And I fear we will have another big increase in fiscal year 2001. 
   However, there is actually some good news to celebrate since the beginning of this Congress. As my colleagues may recall, President Clinton said in his State of the Union Address in 1999 that he wanted to save 62 percent of the surplus and spend the other 38 percent. Well, at the time, the entire surplus was the Social Security surplus. 
   It was Members on this side of the aisle in both the House and the Senate who exposed the President's plan as just another spending gimmick. We were also the ones who got busy advocating and fighting for a lockbox for Social Security and Medicare. For all intents and purposes, we were successful in fiscal year 2000 in doing so, and we will do the same in fiscal year 2001. 
   Now the Vice President is out there on the campaign trail bending the truth and taking credit for lockboxing Social Security and Medicare. Everyone should be aware that it was the Clinton-Gore administration that sent a veto threat to the Senate regarding the Social Security lockbox amendment that the Senate considered in April of 1999. 
   Let me recite the direct quote from the veto threat:  
   If the Abraham-Domenici amendment or similar legislation is passed by the Congress, the President's senior advisors will recommend to the President that he will veto this bill.  
   I suspect that senior advisors would include the Vice President. 
   Although Congress has agreed by consensus not to use the Social Security and Medicare surplus for more spending, Congress still has not been able to pass lockbox legislation. I am fearful, if things get tight in the future and we have a blip in the economy, Congress will revert to its old ways. So I am hoping next year that on a bipartisan basis we can pass lockbox legislation for the Social Security and Medicare surplus. 
   Probably the best news from fiscal year 2000 is that despite all the supplemental spending we did this past summer, we still achieved an $87 billion on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. That is a lot more than the $1 billion on-budget surplus we had at the end of fiscal year 1999. Without question, though, the American people are responsible for this surplus, and their success continues to generate better than expected revenues. However, Congress would have spent considerably  more money, had it not been for a handful of us in the House and Senate who were willing to take the heat for condemning massive spending increases and budget gimmickry. Because this $87 billion on-budget surplus had not been spent, and not used for tax cuts, it is going to go to reduce the national debt. 
   In my view and in the view of many experts, using our on-budget surplus to pay down the national debt is the best way to ensure fiscal discipline and continue our economic prosperity. We need to continue that economic prosperity if we are going to deal with the problems of Social Security and Medicare in the future. We cannot be lulled by the booming economy and the fact that we have been able to utilize the $87 billion fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus for debt reduction. 
   In addition, the way things are going right now in Washington, we may not even see a fiscal year 2001 on-budget surplus. That is because the projected $102 billion surplus is evaporating very quickly. With all the years of experience that I have had in public service, I have to say that I have never seen anything more fiscally irresponsible than the spending spree I have seen occur in Washington this year--but, in particular, these past weeks. The lack of willingness on the part of Congress to make the hard choices and restrain the urge to bring home the bacon is blowing a hole in the fiscal year 2001 surplus and a gigantic hole in the projected 10-year budget surplus. 
   I think back to 1997 when Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, helping to put an end to the era of annual deficits. The Balanced Budget Act set spending targets for each fiscal year and was meant to teach Congress to prioritize its spending choices. Under the Balanced Budget Act, if Congress wanted to spend money, it had to find an offset to cover the additional spending. Fair enough, and it worked. It helped to balance the budget. 
   Today, with the surplus we have achieved and the surplus that everyone thinks we are going to have in the future, the discipline is gone. It is just an out-of-control feeding frenzy. Add the fact that the normal legislative process has gone out the window, and we are in a free fall. Right now, only a handful of individuals--the President and my colleagues who are on the Appropriations Committee--are making the decisions that will impact how much the Federal Government spends for the coming fiscal year. Once the decisions are made, they are packaged together, sent to the floor of the Senate and the House, and voted on: No debate, no amendments. In some circumstances, Members have not even seen the bills they are voting on. 
   Basically, it is a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. Since these bills contain the bacon, most Members go along and simply vote for 
   them. For those Members who do, they will run home, bragging about how they got this or that for their districts or for their State, failing to understand that their constituents know there is no such thing as a free lunch. Make no mistake, the American people will fast appreciate the spending spectacle that is going on here in Congress. If you think they were mad in 1998 when Congress went on a similar spree--and I remember that because I was campaigning for the Senate in 1998 and I caught all kinds of flak from people because of what Congress had done--wait until they get wind of what is happening right now. And they will. We will definitely feel their wrath. But more important, we will experience their disappointment in letting them down. 
   This Senator is not going along with the ``pork-a-thon.'' I have voted against most of the appropriations bills that have come before the Senate, not because I am opposed to the Federal Government spending money on what is necessary, but because Congress has been unwilling to prioritize spending and unwilling to make the hard choices within the framework of the 2001 budget resolution. 
   In case my colleagues are not aware, let me explain briefly how big the increases are in the various appropriations bills. 
   The fiscal year 2001 Interior appropriations bill spends $18.8 billion, a 26-percent increase over fiscal year 2000; the Transportation appropriations bill, spends $16.8 billion in discretionary spending, a 23-percent increase over fiscal year 2000; the VA-HUD appropriations bill spends $82.5 billion, a 14-percent increase; the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill spends $15.6 billion, a 13-percent increase; the Energy and Water appropriations bill spends $24 billion, a 12-percent increase; the Agriculture appropriations bill spends $15 billion in discretionary spending, an 8-percent increase, and that is not including agriculture emergency spending. 
   For fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2001, nearly $23.25 billion in agriculture emergency spending has been provided by the Government--$23.25 billion in emergency spending. That is more than double the approximately $10.75 billion in emergency spending for the entire 10 year period before. In other words, in 3 years, we have doubled the emergency spending for agriculture over what we spent in the 10 previous fiscal years. 
   In April, the Senate spent over 50 hours debating and amending a budget resolution for fiscal year 2001. An agreement was reached on an overall spending amount of $600.3 billion in budget authority. I worked with Senators like PHIL GRAMM to add new points of order to bring more discipline to the process. But in light of recent events, I wonder what was the 50 hours of effort over? I find myself asking, Why should we have a budget resolution if we are just going to ignore it? Why even have a budget process if we are just going to operate as if the rules did not exist? Congress and the White House are spending money like drunken sailors, and we need to get on the wagon before it is too late and we spend it all. 
   CBO's projections over the next 10 years estimate that Federal spending will grow with the rate of inflation, but this does not reflect reality. In fiscal year 2000 alone, we increased discretionary spending by 8.3 percent, a rate much higher than the actual inflation rate. When you compare that with the spending increases of 14 percent, 23 percent, and 26 percent in just fiscal year 2001 alone, then you can see the kind of trouble we are getting ourselves into. 
   Add up all the numbers, include the appropriations bills that have passed and those that are anticipated to pass; include as much as $265 billion worth of tax reductions for the next 10 years; and, of course, we cannot forget there are going to be additional interest costs that will be generated by Congress simultaneously increasing spending and lowering taxes. Just add it all up. When you do, you will find that Congress and the Clinton-Gore administration will have reduced the 10-year projected budget surplus by more than $600 billion. In a worst case scenario, the Concord Coalition estimates that Congress' accelerated pace of spending could wipe out up to $1.46 trillion of the non-Social Security surplus projected for the next 10 years--over a trillion dollars is what they project. What a terrible thing we are doing to the next administration and to the citizens of this Nation. 
   After the 106th Congress' drunken spending spree is over, the American people and the future President will be waking up to a tremendous hangover.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will hopefully begin debate on the Older Americans Act at 9:30 a.m. At 11 a.m., the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour and then resume consideration of the Older Americans Act. The House is expected to consider the conference report to accompany the District of Columbia appropriations bill, which also contains the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations language, the Labor-HHS appropriations conference report, and the tax bill during tomorrow morning's session. It is hoped that the Senate can begin consideration of those bills as they are received from the House. Therefore, votes are expected in the afternoon on these bills, as well as a vote on a continuing resolution.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the inductees into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the year 2000. Located in Akron, OH, the National Inventors Hall of Fame is America's shrine to those who have made significant contributions to our nation, and improvements to the quality of life for all mankind. As Governor of Ohio, I was proud to speak at the dedication ceremony for this magnificent facility in July of 1995, and I was pleased to have the Hall also serve as the backdrop for the Edison Innovator Awards my office presented to companies throughout the State of Ohio. 
   Inductees into the National Inventors Hall of Fame represent the epitome of ingenuity and inspiration, and this year's class is no exception. Inductees for the year 2000 include: Walt Disney, whose name has become synonymous with imagination and creativity; Reginald Fessenden, whose pioneering work in the area of wireless communication led to the modern radio broadcasting industry; Helen and Alfred Free, whose work developing the ``dip-and-read'' urinalysis test greatly eased the lives of those suffering from diabetes; J. Franklin Hyde, whose discovery of fused silica made possible the fiber optic cable so widely used today; William Kroll, who escaped Europe before the onset of World War II, and whose work in his home laboratory resulted in a process that allows titanium and zirconium to be produced; and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer and the inventor of the modern personal computer. 
   Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. In modern parlance, one might say that technological advancement is the engine that drives our economy. It is the biggest contributor to increasing our standard of living here in the United States, and the best way to improve the lives of individuals the world over. This progress is essentially made possible through the protection of intellectual property that is afforded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the main force behind the founding of the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In today's rapidly changing world, the Patent and Trademark Office is the ``safe haven'' that encourages men and women to accept the challenge to build the better mousetrap through the protection of creativity and what our minds can produce. 
   Consider the accomplishments of the 158 inventors enshrined at the Hall. Consider the contributions they have made to society: to prolonging our lives and making them more enjoyable; to reducing our workload; and to allowing us to explore new continents and the heavens themselves. It is easy to see the power of invention and the tremendous impact inventors have on all of us. 
   As an Ohioan, I am always struck by the ingenuity and sheer determination of two Dayton bicycle workers who dared to believe that they could defy gravity with their winged invention. Little did the Wright Brothers realize that 66 years after their historic flight, man's inquisitive nature would improve upon their invention and put another Ohioan--Neil Armstrong--on the moon. 
   Invention is progress, and I salute the work of America's inventors, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office and the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, for their continuing efforts to improve and enrich our lives.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael Dawson, who, over the past 11 years, has been my press secretary, one of my most trusted advisors, and a man whose judgement has been a key component to my success, from the campaign trail, to the Statehouse of Ohio and to the Capitol of the United States. But most of all, Mike Dawson has been, and will always be, my friend. 
   I first got to know Michael in 1989, when I was pursuing the governorship of Ohio and he was working as a top aide to then-Congressman Mike DeWine during his campaign for Lieutenant Governor. I was immediately struck by his work ethic and his tenacity. During that campaign, it was reported that if Mike saw the lights on in the offices of our opponent when he was leaving the office, no matter what time it was, Mike would turn around, go back inside and continue to work. Mike refused to allow them to get the upper hand by putting in more time or effort. 
   Once the election was over, and I was elected Governor, there was little doubt in my mind that one of the people I had to have on my executive team was Mike Dawson. Since then, Mike has been with me through thick and thin and through good times and bad. Whatever the situation, and no matter how rough things got, Mike was always there providing me sound advice. 
   I will never forget Mike's dedication and professionalism during the Lucasville prison riots in April of 1993--a period I consider to be the darkest days of my administration. For eleven days, Ohio held its breath as the Lucasville prison erupted in violence. As I worked to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, one of the people I depended upon most for assistance was Mike Dawson. Not only did Mike serve as press secretary at that time, but he was also my executive assistant in charge of emergency management operations. In that position, Mike had a strong hand in working with the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, the Ohio Highway Patrol, and several other agencies in helping to put an end to the siege at the prison and restoring order. Mike initiated a task force to review what had gone wrong at Lucasville and to make recommendations on how to avoid similar Lucasville situations in the future. A special emphasis of the task force focused on the proper role of the media in covering prison situations. 
   Mike's service in emergency management operations was not limited just to the Lucasville riots. He was instrumental in Ohio's efforts to coordinate assistance to flood-ravaged areas of Ohio in 1997 and 1998, and was always right in the middle of things whenever Ohio was faced with an emergency situation during my two terms as Governor. 
   But no tribute to Mike would be complete without mentioning the work he has done as my press secretary. Mike has a relationship with Ohio's press corps and editorial writers that is legendary. All you would have to do, Mr. President, is ask any reporter who has covered my two terms as governor or my first two years in the Senate to find out what kind of a professional Mike really is. 
   Throughout the entire time that he has been my press secretary, Mike has always been accessible, always wiling to go the extra mile to furnish the information that will make a reporter's job easier and he has made it a point to be able to provide an answer to whatever questions the press ask. If Mike does not know an answer, he will find it, and he will make sure that he understands the entire issue well-enough to be able to explain it. Mike has always been relentless in wanting to guarantee that the press gets the story right the first time. 
   Of course, the Ohio press corps could write volumes of examples of Mike's tenacity in wanting a story reported correctly. If Mike felt he was right, he would argue his point until that reporter understood what he was talking about and where he was coming from. If Mike knew he was right, he would be relentless in his effort to not only convince the reporter to see his point of view, but to agree with it as well. 
   Mike's style has earned him the respect of reporters from all across Ohio. In fact, when I left the Governor's office to come to the Senate, Mike was lauded in a column written by Joe Hallett in the Cleveland Plain Dealer for how diligently he served as press secretary during my administration: probably the highest compliment any press secretary can receive from his peers. 
   That column put in print what I already knew and what I told millions of Ohioans on the night I was elected to the Senate--that Mike Dawson was the best press secretary in America. It was true then, and it is true today. In all the years I have known him, and in the hundreds, if not thousands, of stories that Mike handled for my gubernatorial administration, as well as here in the Senate, he has always kept the best interests of Ohio at heart. I have been truly blessed to have had Mike provide me such tremendous professional service over the years. 
   As I have been blessed with Mike's service, he has been blessed even more so with a wonderful and loving family. To witness the love that Mike has for his wife Laurel and his son Will makes it evident that they are the most important priorities in his life, and to see them all together makes it easy to realize that God's love truly shines upon them. 
   Mike is an Ohioan to the core, and he has always considered it his distinct privilege to work on behalf of the people of his state of Ohio in an effort to improve government and make government work more efficiently, and for the benefit of all Ohioans. When serving the people of Ohio, Mike was the first to arrive in the morning and the last to leave at night, and it was a given that Mike was on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
   Today, though, Mike's responsibilities are focused a little more closer to home, and he and Laurel have decided to go back to their roots and raise Will in the Buckeye State. And while I am losing a valued member of my staff, I take great comfort in the knowledge that my friend Mike Dawson's service to the people of Ohio will continue. Mike has gone back to work for his former boss and my very dear friend, Senator MIKE DEWINE. I know that he will be successful in this new endeavor. 
   I consider myself a better person and a better public servant for having the  opportunity to know Michael Dawson. He has been a loyal friend and a sage counselor whom I will truly miss.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I appreciate the Chaplain of the Senate opening today's session in prayer for Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan and for his son, Randy Carnahan, and for Chris Sifford, all of whom were tragically killed last night in a plane crash in Missouri. 
   Mel Carnahan and his wife Jean were good friends of mine and my wife Janet. We got to know them through the Governors' Association--a wonderful man, wonderful family man, one of the finest human beings I have ever met. From a personal point of view, my sympathy goes out to Jean, his wife, and to the rest of his family and to the citizens of Missouri. This country lost a great leader. 
   On behalf of the entire Senate, I express our deepest sympathies to Governor Carnahan's wife Jean and to their sons, Russ, Robin, and Tom, and to their grandchildren, Andrew and Austin. They have lost a father, husband, grandfather, son, a brother, and an uncle. This is a terrible burden to carry, and we wish them God's strength and courage in so doing. 
   The entire Senate joins me in expressing condolences to the citizens of Missouri who have lost the Governor

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of Ohio's illustrious public servants, Commissioner Craig Glazer, is retiring as a member of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio after serving successfully under three Ohio governors. I extend to him my sincere congratulations and best wishes. 
   Craig is a man with a love for Ohio. After graduating from Vanderbilt University Law School, he went directly to work for Ohio businesses as an advocate for industry at the law firm of Hahn Loeser & Parks. He worked extensively for utility and consumer interests helping them to expand their operations throughout Ohio. 
   I personally had the opportunity to witness Craig's leadership while I was Mayor of Cleveland. Between 1979 and 1985, Craig represented the people of Cleveland before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) as the utility rate counsel. 
   During my time as Mayor, I worked with Craig on legislation that was ultimately passed in the Ohio Legislature as Senate Bill 378. Upon passage it reformed the structure of PUCO to ensure its accountability to its many constituencies. During this time, he additionally served as house counsel to the city of Cleveland's utility system and served over 300,000 customers through their water, sewer and electric utilities. 
   He presently serves on the Board of Directors of the national Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, serves as vice-chair of its International Relations Committee and is a member of their electricity committee. He also chairs the National Council on Competition in the Electric Industry, an interagency policy group, and is President of Board of Directors of the Ohio Energy Project. He is chair of the Ameritech region Regulatory Coordinating Committee and serves as a member of the North American Electricity Reliability Council's Generation Adequacy Committee and Electric Power research Institute's Advisory Council. 
   It is clear from his leadership and many efforts that Craig Glazer consistently works hard for the people of Ohio. 
   I have immense respect for Craig. He is and always has been a true professional. And although I am sorry to see him retire, I am confident that the citizens of Ohio have not heard the last from him.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in a few short weeks, it will have been two years since the people of Ohio elected me to represent them in the United States Senate. One of the main reasons I wanted to serve in this body was to have an opportunity to bring fiscal responsibility to the nation's capital and eliminate the gigantic debt burden that we have put on the backs of our children and grandchildren. 
   As my colleagues know, for decades, successive Congresses and Presidents spent money on things that, while important, they were unwilling to pay for, or, in the alternative, do without. In the process, Washington ran up staggering debt, and mortgaged our future. 
   Today, we have a $5.7 trillion national debt that is costing us $224 billion in interest payments a year, and that translates into $600 million per day just to pay the interest. 
   Out of every federal dollar that is spent, 13 cents will go to pay the interest on the national debt. Think of that. In comparison, 16 cents will go for national defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary spending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we spend more federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the entire Medicare program. 
   As the end of the 106th Congress draws near, I look back with mixed feelings at the actions that this Congress has made towards bringing our financial house in order. While we have made some strides in paying down the national debt, there is a lot more that we could have done. For example, we could have done a much better job of reining-in federal spending. Regretfully, we have done the opposite. 
   What many Americans don't realize is the fact that Congress increased overall non-defense domestic discretionary spending in fiscal year 2000 to $328 billion. That's a 9.3 percent boost over the previous fiscal year, and the largest single-year increase in non-defense discretionary spending since 1980. 
   In an effort to bring spending under control, my friend, Senator ALLARD, and I offered an amendment this past June to direct $12 billion of the FY 2000 on-budget surplus dollars toward debt reduction. While that amendment passed by a vote of 95-3, the victory did not last long--all but $4 billion of that $12 billion was used for other spending in the Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report. 
   Nevertheless, we have had reason to celebrate some good news. Just last year, many of us fought to ``lock box'' Social Security. In spite of the fact that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle defeated the bill, Congress did, though, for the first time in three decades, not spend a dime of the Social Security surplus. 
   I have to say that I take great offense at the fact that the Vice President is out there taking credit for ``lock boxing'' Social Security and Medicare. My colleagues--and indeed the American people--should be aware that, in fact, it was this administration--the Clinton-Gore administration--that sent a veto threat to the Senate regarding the Abraham/Domenici Social Security ``lock box'' amendment that we considered in April of 1999. 
   Here is the direct quote from that veto threat: ``......If the Abraham/Domenici amendment or similar legislation is passed by the Congress, the President's Senior Advisors will recommend to the President that he veto the bill.'' I would presume that the term ``Senior Advisors'' would include the Vice President. 
   Although Congress has agreed by consensus not to use the Social Security surplus for more spending, Congress, still has not been able to pass ``lock box'' legislation. And because Congress has not passed a ``lock box'' bill, I am fearful that if things get tight in the future, Congress will revert to its old ways. 
   Probably the best news from fiscal year 2000 is that despite spending roughly $20 billion of the on-budget surplus this past summer, Congress did not touch the additional $60 billion on-budget surplus that CBO announced in July. In other words, when fiscal year 2000 came to an end on September 30th, that $60 billion on-budget surplus had not been spent nor used for tax cuts. Instead, it will go towards reducing the national debt. 
   When on-budget surplus funds are used to lower the debt, it sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main Street that the federal government is serious about fiscal discipline. It encourages more savings and investment which, in turn, fuels productivity and continued economic growth. 
   All the experts say that paying down the debt is the best thing we could do with our budget surpluses. Indeed, CBO Director Dan Crippen said earlier this year: ``most economists agree that saving the surpluses and paying down the debt held by the public is probably the best thing that we can do relative to the economy.'' 
   I would like to say Mr. President, in the last month or so, I have had the opportunity to meet with director Crippen in my office a couple of times, including, most recently, this morning. He said that the only way we were going to be able to deal with the wave of Social Security and Medicare benefits that we will have to pay when the ``baby boomers'' start to retire, is to reform Social Security and Medicare, and most important, we should undertake policies that encourage a robust, growing economy. And as far as I'm concerned, paying down the national debt is the best way that we can foster a robust growing economy.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. In addition, just yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office released its report, entitled ``The Long-Term Budget Outlook.'' 
   That report states that, ``projected growth in spending on the federal government's big health and retirement programs--Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security--dominates the long-run budget outlook. If current policies continue, spending is likely to grow significantly faster than the economy as a whole over the next few decades. By 2040, CBO projects those outlays will rise to about 17 percent of gross domestic product--more than double their current share.'' 
   The report goes on to say, `` `saving' most or all of the budget surpluses that CBO projects over the next 10 years--using them to pay down debt--would have a positive impact on the projections and substantially delay the emergence of a serious fiscal imbalance.'' 
   I believe that each of my colleagues should read this report because it might make them consider the consequences of all the spending that's going on in this body and help make the argument for more fiscal restraint in these last days of the 106th Congress. Therefore, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to look up the CBO report, ``The Long-Term Budget Outlook,'' at the CBO website, www.cbo.gov. 
   Mr. President, I am a firm believer in the phrase, ``prepare for tomorrow, today,'' and I believe that anytime we have an opportunity to enhance our future economic position, we cannot squander that opportunity. That is why I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is not going to consider the Debt Relief Lock-Box Reconciliation Act for Fiscal Year 2001, H.R. 5173. This is a bill that passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 381-3, and which would have taken 90 percent of the fiscal year 2001 surplus and used it strictly for debt reduction. 
   As my colleagues know, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that in fiscal year 2001, the United States will have a surplus of $268 billion, including an on-budget surplus of $102 billion. 
   Under H.R. 5173--or the ``90-10'' bill as it has been called--$240 billion of the $268 billion projected surplus would go toward paying down the national debt. By using such a substantial amount of the surplus for debt reduction, Congress would be officially ``lock boxing''  not only the Social Security surplus, but the Medicare surplus as well. Thus, some $198 billion--the amount CBO predicts--will be in surplus for those two funds. 
   In addition to ``lock-boxing'' Social Security and Medicare, the legislation would appropriate $42 billion of the fiscal year 2001 on-budget surplus projection toward debt reduction. 
   The remaining 10 percent--or $28 billion--would be divided and used to cover whatever tax cuts or necessary and reasonable spending increases that needed to be made. 
   Even though it is not perfect legislation, I support H.R. 5173, because in my view, it is the best chance for Congress this year to make another significant payment on the national debt while keeping a tight lid on spending. Unfortunately, the ``90-10'' bill has never achieved the same kind of support here in the Senate as it did in the House, and therefore, the types of controls the bill would have put on spending will not be enacted in the Senate. 
   Instead, I fear that with the end of session ``rush to get out of town,'' Congress and the President are engaged in a spending spree the likes of which we haven't seen since LBJ's Great Society. While I am concerned that the President wants additional spending, I am particularly alarmed at the fact that many of my colleagues are trying their hardest to outspend the President. Under this scenario, it's no wonder H.R. 5173 never had a chance. 
   Although we have not yet passed all of the fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills, the amount that spending has increased in the bills that have been passed is quite disturbing: particularly when compared to the Consumer Price Index, which is 2.7 percent. 
   For instance, the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water appropriations bill that was just vetoed spends 12 percent more than its FY 2000 counterpart; the FY 2001 Interior appropriations bill represents a 26 percent increase; and the FY 2001 Transportation appropriations bill that we passed last Friday increased its discretionary spending by about 25 percent. So far, Congressional spending in fiscal year 2001 is on-track to make the 9.3 percent fiscal year 2000 non-defense discretionary spending increase look like ``chump change.'' 
   I would like to say to the citizens of Ohio that there are many good things in those bills that I would have liked to support, but spending increases of this kind are just outrageous. 
   What we should have been doing with these appropriations bills is prioritizing our spending and living within the budget resolution that we passed in the beginning of the year. Maybe I should ask my colleagues, if we are not going to live within the parameters of the budget resolution, then why did we spend to much time on it? 
   If, when I was Governor, I had ever gone to the Ohio legislature and told them I wanted to increase the budget by 25 or 26 percent, they would have impeached me. The editorial writers would have said I had gone crazy, especially when my mantra when I came into office was, ``gone are the days when public officials are measured by how much they spend on a problem. The new realities dictate that public officials are now judged on whether they can work harder and smarter and do more with less.'' 
   And Mr. President I hate to think what the voters would have done to me. 
   Many of my colleagues do not seem to consider that each separate appropriations bill adds-up. There is no sense of concern that one particular appropriations bill increases its spending from FY 2000 by 20 percent, because it's only $2 billion to $3 billion more than last year. Or, some may say we need to spend an extra billion dollars or so on this or that program because we have a huge surplus and we can afford it. 
   In a $1.7 trillion overall budget, I can see how someone may got caught up in that logic. 
   However, in the words of Everett Dirksen:  
   A billion here, and a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.  
   It is all real money--real taxpayer's money. Congress and the President have got to admit that we cannot fund everything that we want. We have got to make hard choices with respect to spending if we are ever going to bring our debt under control. 
   The American people know that the spending Congress is engaged in right now must be accounted for somewhere, because they know there is no such thing as a free lunch. They know that ultimately they are the ones paying for what I like to refer to as a Congressional ``feeding frenzy.'' 
   They want us to make the hard decisions and most of all, they want us to pay down the national debt. When I go home to Ohio my constituents say to me: Senator, we want you to pay down the national debt. 
   On one other last note, Mr. President--if you take the 9.3 percent increase in non-defense discretionary spending from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000, and the rate of increase projected in the fiscal year 2001 budget, we are blowing a big hole in the CBO 10 year projected budget surplus. 
   The 10 year CBO budget surplus is predicated on a 2.7 percent increase in Federal spending over 10 years. 
   We must remember that the on-budget surplus also includes the Medicare surplus, and if we are ever successful at passing Medicare ``lock box'' legislation, those funds will be off the table for spending. Consider also the Medicare giveback which we must have to stabilize this country's healthcare system which will also take part of the 10 year budget surplus; a prescription drug benefit that everyone agrees we must implement which will also take part of the 10 year budget surplus; we must spend more money to stabilize and improve our national defense which will also take part of the 10 year budget surplus. 
   If you add up all of the numbers, including appropriations bills that have passed and those that are anticipated to pass and include the projected $200 billion worth of tax reductions for the next 10 years, as well as the additional interest costs generated by Congress' spending and reducing taxes, then Congress will have reduced the 10 year projected budget surplus by some $750 billion. Let's not let that happen. 
   If Congress intends to spend money on implementing programs, we need to tighten our belts on our current spending and not squander our on-budget surplus on the kinds of wasteful spending included in the various fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills. We cannot forget that we are facing a Social Security and Medicare funding crisis in the near future, and if we can't prioritize our spending now, we will not be able to keep these programs solvent at their current level of benefits. The young people here who are pages will have that burden right on their backs. 
   That's why I believe the best course of action we can take is to use whatever on-budget surplus we achieve to pay down the national debt. 
   For three decades, we borrowed from our children, mortgaging their future for our present. And now, when times are good and we have the most ideal situation to set things right, we cannot continue down the same flawed path as before. Have we learned nothing? 
   Our current economic situation is our second chance to pay our children what we owe and ensure fiscal solvency for future generations. We have an obligation to our children--indeed, a moral obligation--to pay down the national debt and rein-in our spending in order to give them back their competitive edge. If we do not act now, I fear we will not get another chance to do the right thing.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4 p.m. with Senators DURBIN and THOMAS in control of the time. Following morning business, the Senate is expected to consider the VA-HUD appropriations bill. It is hoped that legislation can be completed in short order and without a rollcall vote. However, if a rollcall vote is requested, the vote will occur tomorrow at a time to be determined. 
   On Wednesday, there will be up to 7 hours of debate on the conference report to accompany the sex trafficking victims bill. Senator THOMPSON will make a point of order against the report, and a vote is expected relative to appealing the ruling of the Chair. Senators can also expect a vote on the adoption of the sex trafficking conference report. The Senate may also begin consideration of the Agriculture appropriations conference report during tomorrow's session. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and I shall not object, but I would like to engage in a discussion with the Senator from Arizona. I have some substantive concerns about this bill and I and my staff need some time to review the bill. I have concerns that if we are going to impose criminal penalties in this area, that standard for triggering these penalties is a clear bright line. I am also concerned that the reporting requirements as outlined presently are over broad and unworkable. I am very concerned about safety and want to ensure that we enact solid workable legislation to protect people. I am not trying to stop this bill, just ensure that it is solid, clean, well thought through legislation.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as my colleagues are well aware, I have a keen interest in what happens in the Balkans because I believe what happens in Southeastern Europe impacts on our national security, our economic well-being in Europe, the stability of Europe and yes, world peace. 
   For the better part of the 20th Century, Western Europe and the U.S. have had an enormous stake in what has occurred in Southeastern Europe. 
   However, we have not done enough to pay attention to what is happening there, dating back to the time when former Secretary of State, Jim Baker, said of Yugoslavia that ``we don't have a dog in this fight.''  
   Unfortunately, that line of thinking has prevailed, and we've allowed Slobodan Milosevic to wreak havoc. Over the last decade, he has spread death and destruction to the people of Serbia, Kosovo and Croatia and we all know that U.S. troops now are in Kosovo and Bosnia because of him. 
   Even a U.S. and NATO led air war last year was not sufficient to bring an end to the Milosevic regime. 
   Since the end of the war, I have been working hard on three essential items that I believe will bring peace and stability to the region. First, I have been working with leaders here and abroad to help stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo; second, to try and make sure that we keep our promises to the Stability Pact of Southeast Europe. To that end, I recently met with Bodo Homback, the head of the Stability Pact to underscore the importance of the Stability Pact; and third, I have been working tirelessly to support democracy in Serbia, a cause I took on when I was governor of the State of Ohio. 
   When I was in Bucharest at the Organization for the Security and Cooperation of Europe, OSCE, in July of this year, I introduced a resolution on Southeastern Europe that called to the attention of the OSCE's Parliamentary Assembly the situation in Kosovo and Serbia, and made clear the importance of democracy in Serbia. 
   I pointed out to my OSCE colleagues in that resolution that Milosevic was a threat to the stability, peace and prosperity of the region. I argued that in order for the nations of that region to become fully integrated into Europe--for the first time in modern history--Milosevic's removal from office was absolutely essential. 
   My resolution put the OSCE, as a body, on record as condemning the Milosevic regime and insisting on the restoration of human rights, the rule of law, free press and respect for ethnic minorities in Serbia. I was pleased that my resolution passed, despite strong opposition by the delegation from the Russian Federation. 
   Many people had become resigned to the fact that if the NATO bombing and the hardships that followed the end of the air war did not produce widespread anti-Milosevic sentiment, the prospect for Milosevic's removal from office by the Serbian people would not happen any time soon. Even Milosevic himself felt confident enough in his rulership of Yugoslavia to call for general elections 
   nine months earlier than they were supposed to occur. 
   On Sunday, September 24th, historic elections took place in Yugoslavia in spite of the worst type of conditions that could possibly hamper free and fair elections, including military and police presence at polling places; ballots counted by Milosevic appointees; reports of ``ballot stuffing;'' intimidation of voters during the election process; and the refusal to allow independent observers to monitor election practices and results. 
   In spite of all that, the people won. They won because of the old Serbian slogan--Samo, Sloga, Srbina, Spasava--which translates into ``only unity can save the Serbs'', or, ``in unity there is strength for the Serbs.'' 
   And I might say the opposition finally got its act together with prayers to St. Sava, and with enlightenment from the Holy Spirit. 
   It was the political force of the people that propelled law professor, and political unknown, Vojislav Kostunica, to victory. 
   This monumental victory over an indicted war criminal proves that the Serb people strongly desire positive change. They want to see their country move beyond the angry rhetoric and nationalistic fires fanned by Milosevic. 
   And let me make this point clear: Mr. Kostunica's victory and his support are not the result of Western influence. 
   And although Milosevic had previously acknowledged that Mr. Kostunica had more votes, we learned yesterday afternoon that his pawns on the constitutional court declared that the September 24th elections were unconstitutional. 
   This latest and most blatant attempt by Milosevic to thwart the will of the people is the final insult to the citizens of Yugoslavia. 
   The citizens of Yugoslavia--through a constitutional election--have spoken. They have elected a new President. 
   The Serb people, driven by a desire to live free from the dictatorship of Milosevic, have been pushed to take their election mandate by force. They are, at this very moment, engaged in a struggle to throw off the shackles of oppression. 
   In light of these developments, I am prayerful that the Serb people will be able to enforce their will, and that they will remember their slogan--Samo, Sloga, Srbina, Spasava--and remain united at this very important time for freedom. 
   I also pray that the Serb military and police forces will avoid bloodshed, recognizing that their brothers and sisters only seek the freedom that a tyrant has denied them. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. President: this is not a revolution. The Serb people are enforcing the mandate of their election because this man who has been beaten refuses to relinquish power. 
   He ought to understand that he's either going to walk out of there or go out on a stretcher or in a body bag. 
   Mr. President, we in the United States must render our support to the Serb people immediately, and convince our allies and the nations of the world that Vojislav Kostunica is the new and legitimately elected leader of Serbia, and we need to convince Russia that they should immediately tell Milosevic that the game is over; it's time to go. 
   Mr. President, we also need to assure the Serbian people--who have been long-standing friends of this nation and also our allies in World War II--that we are still their friends and that it is Milosevic who has been the problem, not the Serbian people. 
   The Serb people need to know that with their new leader, Vojislav Kostunica, we will remove our sanctions against Serbia and help them re-invigorate their economy and re-establish their self-respect and the United States will welcome them into the light of freedom and a bright new chapter in Serbian history. 
   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senator BOB SMITH of introducing the Environmental Streamlining Improvement Act today. Last month several of my colleagues on the Environmental and Public Works Committee, following a full committee hearing on the issue, requested that the Administration revise its proposed rules on environmental streamlining and transportation planning, taking into consideration comments already submitted on the proposed rules, and publish them in the Federal Register for an additional 120-day comment period. This legislation is being introduced today because the Administration has not responded to our request. 
   In addition to requiring the Administration to consider public comments and to revise and re-propose rules on environmental streamlining and transportation planning, this legislation would prevent the Secretary of Transportation from finalizing the rules until May 1, 2001, and require a report on changes that were made to the revised rules. 
   When I was Governor of Ohio, I witnessed first-hand the frustration of many of the various state agencies because they were required to complete a myriad of federally-required tasks on whatever project they initiated. 
   With my background as a local and state official, I bring a unique perspective to this issue. While environmental review is good public policy, I believe that there are more efficient ways to ensure adequate and timely delivery of construction projects, while still carefully assessing environmental concerns. 
   Congress recognized the frustration of the states and enacted planning and environmental provisions to initiate environmental streamlining and expedite project delivery. These programs are embodied in Sections 1308 and 1309 of TEA-21. Section 1308 calls for the integration of the Major Investment Study, which had been a separate requirement for major metropolitan projects, with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Section 1309 of TEA-21 calls for the establishment of a coordinated review process for the Department of Transportation to work with other federal agencies to ensure that transportation projects are advanced according to cooperatively determined time-frames. This is accomplished by using concurrent rather than sequential reviews, and allows states to include state-specific environmental reviews in the coordinated process. 
   Last year, I conducted two hearings as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure on streamlining and project delivery. During those hearings I stressed how important it is that the planning and environmental streamlining provisions of TEA-21 be implemented in a way that will streamline and expedite, not complicate, the process of delivering transportation projects. A year after these hearings and nearly two years after the passage of TEA-21, the Department of Transportation finally published its proposed planning and NEPA regulations on May 25, 2000. Frankly, I am very disappointed with how long it took to propose these rules, and I believe many of my colleagues feel the same way. More importantly, there is a lot of disappointment with the proposed rules in general. 
   I strongly believe these proposed regulations are inconsistent with TEA-21 and Congressional intent and do little, if anything, to streamline and expedite the ability of states to commence transportation projects. The proposed rules create new mandates and requirements, add new decision-makers to the process, and provide endless fodder for all kinds of lawsuits, especially with regard to environmental justice. 
   In Ohio, the process of highway construction has been dubbed: ``So you Want a Highway? Here's the Eight Year Hitch.'' My hope has been that in the future we could say ``So you Want a Highway? Here's the Five Year Hitch.'' I don't see that happening with the proposal we have before us. For that reason, I am very pleased Senator SMITH has introduced this legislation today. 
   Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. CONRAD, Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mr. BREAUX, Mr. BURNS, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. DASCHLE, Mr. ENZI, Mr. GORTON, Mr. GRAMM, Mr. GRAMS, Mr. GREGG, Mr. HARKIN, Mrs. HUTCHISON, Mr. JEFFORDS, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. KERREY, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. LUGAR, Ms. MIKULSKI, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. REED, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire, Mr. THOMAS, and Mr. WELLSTONE):

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution today to congratulate the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) for embracing democracy and the rule of law in the September 24, 2000 municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections. I am pleased to be joined by Senators BIDEN, LANDRIEU, LAUTENBERG, HAGEL, LUGAR, and GORDON SMITH in this bipartisan effort. 
   This resolution makes it clear that the Senate is eager to embrace a democratic government in Serbia that respects the rule of law, human rights, and a market economy. Milosevic's bloodletting, ethnic cleansing, and human rights violations have forced the international community, including the United States, to impose a number of crippling sanctions on the FRY. In the wake of the courageous September 24 vote, it is important to send a clear message to the Serbian people that the Senate intends to assist a democratic government and reintegrate it into the global marketplace. This resolution sends that message. 
   The historic friendship between the American and Serbian people have suffered for too long. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Senate to reestablish this important relationship by assisting a new government in Serbia recover from the destruction of Milosevic's rule.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, in a few minutes we will vote on final passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The bill is a product of months of hard work by the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I thank those Senators and staff members whose efforts have brought us where we are today. 
   First, I thank Ellen Stein, Rich Worthington, and Karen Bachman of my staff for their dedicated effort on this bill. The number of hours they put in on this is unbelievable. 
   I also thank my chairman, BOB SMITH, and his staff for all their efforts in making this bill a reality, particularly in the very difficult negotiations on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 
   My thanks to staff director Dave Conover, Tom Gibson, Stephanie Daigle, and Chelsea Henderson Maxwell for all the hard work they put in on this piece of legislation. 
   As most successful bills in the Senate--and I am learning this pretty quickly as a new Member of the Senate--ours has been a product of bipartisanship. Senator MAX BAUCUS and his staff, in putting this bill together, have put in long hours. I recognize the efforts of minority staff director Tom Sliter, Jo-Ellen Darcy, and Peter Washburn for the good work they did in putting this legislation together. 
   I also acknowledge the work of Senator BOB GRAHAM and Senator CONNIE MACK and their staff in helping to forge a consensus on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. I suspect they looked at some of the things I was involved in as maybe getting in the way and holding things up, but I want them 
   and their staff to know we were conscientiously trying to make this something we could all be proud of and get the support of the Senate. I particularly thank C.K. Lee of Senator MACK's staff and Catherine Cyr Ranson of Senator GRAHAM's staff for their work. 
   We know the essential role of the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office in helping to draft legislation. I thank Janine Johnson for her invaluable help. Again, I think so often we take for granted the terrific work these folks do in putting these bills together. 
   Further, any water resources development bill involves the evaluations of hundreds of projects and proposals. We depend on the Corps of Engineers in supplying information and expertise in this process. Larry Prather and his staff at the Legislative Management Branch at the Corps have provided invaluable assistance to the Committee on Environment and Public Works and to this Senator. I give them the recognition they deserve. 
   As I stated in my opening remarks, when we began debate on this legislation, I am proud of the work our committee and subcommittee have accomplished in putting together this bill. This is a disciplined bill that maintains the committee's commitment to the principles of high standards of engineering, economic, and environmental analysis, and adherence to cost-sharing principles and resistance to mission creep. 
   This has not been an easy process, and we have not always agreed on the content of the legislation. But this effort has been marked throughout by cooperation and compromise. To me, this was highlighted dramatically in the negotiation over the bill's discussion of the relationship between Homestead Air Force Base and Everglades restoration. I particularly thank the environmental groups--specifically, the National Resource Defense Council and the Sierra Club--for their critical roles in this effort. 
   All in all, I think this is a well-balanced bill that provides authorization to a number of needed water development projects across this Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and his staff, and the ranking member and members of his staff for their terrific work. I also thank Senator GRAHAM and Senator MACK for their patience as we worked through some of the problems we had with the Florida Everglades restoration project. 
   This Water Resources Development Act of 2000 is a product of months of hard work by the Environment and Public Works Committee. The bill provides authority for the Secretary of the Army to carry out 24 projects for water resources development, conservation, and other purposes, substantially in accordance with the Chief of Engineer reports referenced in the bill language. 
   In addition to the projects authorized by WRDA 2000, there are a number of significant policy provisions in the bill, including a provision to enhance the Corps' ability to accomplish multiple jurisdiction watershed studies, a provision to extend the ability-to-pay provisions to all types of projects, and a provision to accelerate project deauthorizations, which is very important. 
   The bill also provides for a facilitated role for the Corps to partner with non-Federal interests in implementing  small environmental restoration projects on a regional basis including the Ohio River, the Puget Sound region, New England, the Great Lakes region, Chesapeake Bay, and the Illinois River. 
   There are some who may question the need for a WRDA bill this year since Congress passed a WRDA bill just last year. In reality, last year's bill was actually unfinished business from 1998, and if Congress is to get back on its 2-year cycle for passage of WRDA legislation, we need to act on a bill this year. The 2-year cycle is important to avoid long delays between the planning and the execution of projects, and also to meet Federal commitments to State and local government partners who share the costs with the Federal Government. 
   While the 2-year authorization cycle is extremely important in maintain efficient schedules for completions of important water resources projects--as I explored in a hearing I conducted in May of this year--efficient schedules also depend on adequate levels of funding. Unfortunately the appropriations for the Corps; program have not been adequate to meet the needs that have been identified. 
   I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to Chart No. 1. This chart dramatically illustrates what has occurred. Chart No. 1 shows our capital investment in water resources infrastructure since the 1930s, shown in constant 1999 dollars, as measured by the Corps of Engineers Civil Works construction appropriations. You can see the sharp decline from the peak in 1966 of a $5 billion appropriation, and appropriations through the 1970s in the $4 billion level, to the 1980s, and then to the 1990s, where as you can see, the annual Corps construction appropriations have dropped substantially. Corps projects have averaged only around $1.6 billion during this period of time. 
   Another dramatic thing has happened, as illustrated in the next two charts. We are asking the Corps of Engineers to do more with less. These two charts show the breakdown by mission area for the Corps' construction appropriation in FY 1965 and FY 1999. 
   If we look at the FY 1965 chart, you will see that in FY 1965, most of the money went for flood control, navigation, and hydropower. 
   Then we come to 1999. We find that the Corps' mission has expanded into many, many other areas: Shore protection, environmental infrastructure. So we have asked the Corps to take on a lot more responsibility than it ever had before. 
   As the FY 1999 chart shows, there is a dramatic mission increase with environmental restoration as a significant mission area, and two new mission areas: environmental infrastructure, and remediation of formerly used Government nuclear sites. Environmental infrastructure, as contrasted with environmental restoration, includes such work as construction of drinking water facilities and sewage treatment plants. 
   What is the point of all this? 
   If you recall the chart, the Corps construction appropriations have been falling since 1965, and its falls sharply in the 1990s. At the same time, the Corps' mission has been growing. 
   The result is today's huge backlog of over 500 active projects that will cost the Federal Government some $38 billion to complete. Think about it--$38 billion. 
   These are worthy projects with positive benefit-to-cost ratios and capable non-Federal sponsors. The projects in the backlog that are being funded for construction are being funded under spread out schedules that result in increased construction costs and delays in achieving project benefits. 
   I recognize that budget allocations and Corps appropriations are beyond the purview of this Water Resources Development Act. But the backlog issue impacted very fundamentally the way we approached WRDA 2000 by highlighting the importance of adhering to three important criteria in putting together the bill. 
   We adhered to these criteria which made many of our colleagues unhappy because many of the projects they wanted did not fit into the criteria we laid down. 
   First, we controlled the mission creep of the Corps of Engineers. WRDA 2000 addresses national needs within the traditional Corps mission areas: needs such as flood control, navigation shore protection, and the emerging mission area of restoration of nationally significant environmental resources such as the Florida Everglades. 
   The second thing we did in WRDA 2000 is make sure that the projects we are authorizing meet the highest standard of engineering, economic and environmental analysis. 
   We can only assure that projects meet these high standards if projects have received adequate study and evaluation to establish project costs, benefits, and environmental impacts to an appropriate level of confidence. This means that a feasibility report must be completed this calendar year before projects are authorized for construction. That is a requirement. 
   Finally, we have to preserve the partnerships and cost-sharing principles of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. WRDA 1986 established the principle that water resources projects should be accomplished in partnerships with State and local governments and that this partnership would involve significant financial participation by the non-Federal partners. 
   My experience as mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio convinced me that the requirement for local funding to match Federal dollars results in much better projects than where Federal funds are simply handed out. It doesn't matter if it is parks, housing, highways, or water resources projects, the requirement for a local cost share provides a level of accountability that is essential to a quality project. Cost sharing principles were enforced in this WRDA bill. 
   I am very proud of the discipline that the Environment and Public Works Committee exercised in putting together this bill Chairman SMITH should be congratulated. I recognize, though, that not everyone, as he said has been satisfied, but I believe that our authorization actions must reflect the fiscal realities of the Corps national program. 
   Without a doubt, the centerpiece of WRDA is the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. I want you to know, I have spent a lot of time in the Everglades on a number of different occasions. I want my grandchildren and their grandchildren to have the same experience as I have had in enjoying this wonderful national treasure. 
   Our Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman BOB SMITH and his staff deserve enormous credit for making this Everglades provision a reality, particularly in the very difficult area of assuring that the benefits to the natural system are realized while the interests of other water users are adequately protected. 
   As Senator BAUCUS said, this is not only the largest restoration project the Corps has undertaken, but it is the largest restoration project ever undertaken in the world. So this is really quite an undertaking. 
   My role in putting together the Everglades title has been to assure that we moved the Everglades Restoration Plan forward while achieving consistency with the criteria that applied to all the projects in this WRDA bill. The Everglades Restoration Plan is extremely important but there are other critical water resources needs reflected in this WRDA bill. I believe the playing field should be level for the consideration of all projects. 
   I want my colleagues to know that we spent a great deal of time making sure that the Florida Everglades restoration plan does fit into the criteria we have establishes for other projects. 
   Originally, the administration's Everglades legislative proposal deviated substantially from Corps of Engineers and Environmental and Public Works Committee policies for other water resources projects, and would have set precedents which would have been very damaging to preserving effective Congressional oversight of the Corps of Engineers program. Our goal was to hold the Everglades project to the same standards that apply to other projects. This is really important. 
   We have accomplished a great deal in meeting this objective. I would just like to mention a few of them to give comfort to my colleagues. 
   First, we have reduced the level of programmatic authority for restoration projects that can be accomplished without congressional review. That is very, very important. The levels we have set are applicable to other parts of the Corps program. 
   We have required that two primarily land acquisition projects have been  earmarked to be accomplished under other programs. That was in this. We are saying, No. Those will be done someplace else. 
   We have expressed concerns about advanced wastewater treatment and indicated that more effective ways of providing additional water must be explored. 
   We have eliminated the provision that would have allowed reimbursement to the State of Florida for the Federal share of work accomplished by the State. However, we have retained the ability of the State to receive credit for work in-kind for up to 50 percent of the work but only as this work is accomplished proportionate to Federal expenditures based on appropriations. In other words, they cannot move ahead of Federal appropriations. 
   We have added an incentive to encourage the completion of the modified water deliveries to the Everglades project which is essential to many aspects of Everglades restoration. 
   I think our most important accomplishment was in assuming that individual Everglades projects receive the same level of congressional review as other water resources projects. The administration recommended 10 projects for authorization at a total cost of $1.1 billion without a traditional feasibility report level of detail and without individual project justification. 
   These projects would have been authorized without congressional review of the detailed information normally associated with a Corps feasibility report and required of every other large Corps of Engineers project as a condition of authorization. 
   I am pleased to have been able to add a requirement to the Everglades section of the bill that no appropriation shall be made to construct any of the 10 projects until the Secretary submits the Project Implementation Report on the individual projects. Such reports will be presented to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, and each committee will be able to approve the projects by resolution. 
   This assures that the Everglades projects will get a similar level of congressional oversight as other Corps projects. 
   I believe we have accomplished a great deal in making this Everglades Plan acceptable to all parties. The only question I have is the question of the operation and maintenance costs. I will be discussing that later in an amendment. 
   As a final item, let me turn to the redevelopment of the former Homestead Air Force Base and its relationship to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 
   In December of 1999, the U.S. Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration released a draft supplemental environmental impact statement, EIS on the disposal of 1,632 acres of the former Homestead Air Force Base. About 870 acres of the Homestead Air Force Base has been retained as the Homestead Air Reserve Station. 
   This draft supplemental EIS presents as its proposed action the redevelopment of portions of the Homestead Air Force Base as a regional airport with a projected 150,000 annual air operations by 2015, and an estimated 231,000 air operations at maximum use. As a point of comparison, Reagan National Airport has about 300,000 air operations and Miami International Airport has over 500,000 air operations. 
   The draft supplemental EIS presents three mixed use development plans and a commercial spaceport as alternatives to the regional airport. The draft supplemental EIS was circulated for public comment in December 1999. The Air Force is currently evaluating the comments on the EIS and plans to make a final decision on conveying the property later this year. 
   If we look at this map, here is the Homestead Air Force Base in Homestead, FL. Ten miles away is the Everglades National Park, 2 miles away from that is Biscayne National Park, and about 10 miles away is the National Marine Sanctuary. This is the Everglades project. We can see that the use of this base will have a large impact on this very fragile area of Florida we are trying to restore. 
   I agree with the assessment of the Natural Resources Defense Council and eight other national and local environmental groups, that the information generated in preparing the draft supplemental EIS does not support the proposed action of regional airport development. 
   This information reinforces what common sense would dictate: the Homestead base is an inappropriate site for the proposed commercial airport. Indeed airport development would have a number of different adverse impacts: 
   It would significantly increase the noise in Everglades and Biscayne Parks, potentially affecting wildlife and detracting from the experience of visitors. At places within Everglades Park, the amount of time that aircraft noise would be above the ambient sound levels would increase more than two hours. Portions of Biscayne Park would experience similar increases up to 2 hours. 
   The proposed airport would be an air pollution source equivalent to a large power plant, with increases of emissions to about 392 tons per year in nitrogen oxides by 2015. 
   The secondary and cumulative impacts of commercial airport development would result in residential and commercial growth in the surrounding area that would frustrate planned Everglades restoration activities, specifically, the Biscayne Coastal Wetland feature of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 
   Private environmental groups are not alone in raising objections to the commercial airport development. Federal and State environmental agencies have also raised strong objections. 
   The Department of the Interior, commenting on the EIS, indicated that the development of a commercial airport near Biscayne and Everglades National Parks could have a series of negative consequences on these nationally and internationally recognized resources including significant noise impacts, increased contaminants in Biscayne Bay and impacts on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt also has publicly expressed his personal opposition to the airport development. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency has serious environmental objections to the airport proposal. 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service does not recommend the commercial airport development because of the loss of buffer areas between the airport and Biscayne Bay. 
   The Florida Department of Environmental Protection is opposed to this development. They say it poses a threat to the protected terrestrial and marine environment within the Florida Keys' Area of Critical State Concern. 
   The South Florida Water Management District is concerned about the impacts of off-site growth generated by the airport redevelopment plan on 40,000 acres of wetlands owned and managed by the Management District. 
   I recognize the argument that the City of Homestead has made regarding the economic boost that the airport would provide to the city and surrounding area. When I was a member of the Ohio legislature, these same kinds of economic arguments were advanced in pressing for my support of oil and gas exploration leases in Lake Erie. 
   However, I believed that the environmental health of Lake Erie was more important in the long run to the economic health of Ohio than the short term revenue from oil and gas exploration. 
   I believe the same is true of redevelopment of Homestead Air Force Base. The environmental health of Biscayne Bay, the Everglades National Park and the Florida Keys are much more important to the long term economic future of Homestead than any airport proposal. There are alternative uses of the base property that are compatible with South Florida environmental restoration--uses that would also make significant contributions to the economy of the region. 
   Clearly if it was my decision to make, I would not redevelop the Homestead Air Force Base as a commercial airport. We are approving a Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan which will involve Federal and State expenditures of $7.8 billion. I believe it would be irresponsible to approve an investment of billions of dollars in the restoration of the south Florida ecosystem, while at the same time ignoring a re-use plan for Homestead Air Force Base that is incompatible with the restoration objectives.  
   My preference would have been to elevate the decision on Homestead redevelopment from the Secretary of the Air Force to the Secretary of Defense to make the decision in conjunction with the Department of Interior, the EPA, and the Department of Commerce. 
   This approach was not acceptable because of perceptions that it would interfere with the process and cause a delay in the decision. I have agreed instead--and it is in this bill--to a sense-of-the-Senate provision that conveys the concern of the Senate about potential adverse impacts of Homestead redevelopment and about the need for consistency in redevelopment and restoration goals. This approach was endorsed by environmental interests, and it is my hope that it will make a difference in the ultimate decision on Homestead. 
   I know that through all of this I have been sometimes categorized as an opponent of Everglades Restoration. Nothing could be further from the truth. I believe my efforts have helped assure that this effort can move forward. I look forward to passage of WRDA 2000 and the opportunity to get started on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the other critical water resources projects contained in the bill. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to support the Warner-Voinovich-Inhofe amendment regarding operation and maintenance of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 
   I join my colleagues in rejecting the current language contained in the legislation which unfairly grants the State of Florida a 50-percent non-Federal and 50-percent Federal cost share on the operation and maintenance of the Everglades project. I note this is even more generous than the administration's bill which provided for a 40-percent Federal share. 
   This amendment is an issue of equity among all of the 50 States, where, to date, operation and maintenance has been a State and local responsibility. I remind my colleagues that the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers was that the operation and maintenance of the Everglades restoration project be 100-percent non-Federal, consistent with WRDA 1986 and national policy, as pointed out by my colleague from Virginia. 
   The annual operation and maintenance costs for the construction features of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan currently contained in S. 2796 are $172 million per year. 
   These operation and maintenance costs would be shared on a 50-50 basis, which means the Federal share of these costs would be almost $90 million. The current operation and maintenance appropriation nationally is about $1.8 billion. This means the Everglades operation and maintenance responsibility of the Corps could represent 5 percent of the total current national appropriation for operation and maintenance. 
   The stark reality is that the Corps of Engineers is in no position to assume a large additional maintenance burden. By 2001, the Corps will have a backlog of critical maintenance nationwide of $450 million. 
   Chart 1, which I have before the Senate, shows a breakdown of that backlog by project purposes. As my colleagues will note, 61 percent of the maintenance backlog is in navigation, both inland navigation on our rivers and maintenance dredging of our coastal harbors. The Corps is not meeting its critical needs today for the infrastructure we depend on for our increasingly trade-based economy. 
   My colleagues should realize these unmet needs are in each of our States, not only in Florida but throughout the United States. Further, my colleagues can also see that maintenance of the flood control projects that are essential in protecting lives and property makes up a significant part of the backlog at 18 percent. 
   Finally, I want to highlight recreation which is especially important to my colleagues from the West. The Corps is second among Federal agencies in recreation visitation to the land and water resources it manages. Many people associate the Corps with its lake projects, and yet the Corps does not have the resources it needs to meet its maintenance responsibilities at these projects. 
   This next chart shows the maintenance shortfall by State as a percentage of the maintenance backlog. As one can see, California has the largest, followed by Florida and Louisiana. It is ironic to me that Florida is among the States already most severely impacted by the maintenance backlog whose situation is likely to become much more severe if the Corps takes on a larger 
   portion of the operation and maintenance responsibility for the Everglades. I ask my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, how do you believe the Corps will be able to meet the maintenance needs in Florida, such as dredging its harbors, maintaining its waterways, and operating portions of the central and south Florida project while taking on this additional $90-million-a-year maintenance burden? 
   This last chart I have before the Senate shows a few examples of maintenance needs that are not being addressed in some of the other 49 States. 
   The reason I bring these charts to my colleagues' attention is that this maintenance problem is not in a few States; it goes across the United States of America. Every Senator in some way is impacted because we do not have enough money for paying for the operation and maintenance on these projects. 
   Operation and maintenance activities to accommodate the large influx of recreation visitors to Corps projects along the route of the Lewis and Clark exploration during its bicentennial celebration is underfunded. It deals with the Missouri River basin--the Dakotas, Montana, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska. 
   How about the dredging in New York Harbor? That needs to be done.  
   How about seismic studies on projects throughout the New England States which are not able to be done because we do not have enough money? 
   How about recreation facilities in Oklahoma or flood protection in North and South Dakota? 
   The point is, it is not a Florida issue. Adding to a maintenance burden that the Corps already cannot meet will impact all of us who have Corps-managed resources in our States. 
   This is a matter of equity. The Senator from Virginia has spoken to that eloquently. We had it right in WRDA 1986. The operation and maintenance responsibility for new Corps of Engineers investments must rest with the non-Federal sponsors. We cannot afford at this time to deviate from principle. 
   This is my first term in the Senate, but I have been here long enough to know that if we begin to make exceptions, there will be no end to it. We must stick to our principles, and that is why I am asking my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. I make it clear I am a supporter of this Florida restoration plan. 
   Second, I point out there is this representation that we have all of these Federal resources in Florida that are going to benefit from this bill. And the answer to that, yes, they are. On the other hand, as a former Governor of Ohio, the Everglades are not only a tremendous resource for the United States, but they are also a tremendous resource for the State of Florida because they bring tremendous numbers of people to Florida from which the State benefits. We don't talk about that, but that is the other side of the coin. 
   Senator GRAHAM from Florida mentioned page 118 of the restoration projects. I point out that none of the restoration projects mentioned include municipal water supply. This proposal benefits the municipal water supply to the extent of 20 percent of the overall cost of the project. 
   In my State, the municipal water supply is paid for 100 percent by the people in the community. If we look at the numbers on this project and subtract the benefit to the State of Florida for the cost of paying for this public water supply that they would have to pay for entirely themselves, they are benefiting to the tune of $1.6 billion. If we take the $1.6 billion the State of Florida is benefiting from, the $3.9 non-Federal share they are putting into it, it works out to be $2.3 billion as what they are really paying out because they are saving on the $1.6 billion that they would have to spend on the public water supply. 
   Looking at those numbers, the relationship is basically 35 percent, the State of Florida; 65 percent, the Federal 
   Government. I want the Senators to look at the numbers: 20 percent of this overall project is for the public water supply. Fine. But the fact is that if this project wasn't being undertaken, that public water supply would have to be supplied by the State of Florida or the communities within the State of Florida. 
   This argument that it is a 50-50 cost sharing on the construction costs does not state the facts. It is more like 35-65. Therefore, to say we are paying 50 percent of the construction costs; therefore, it should be 50-50 in operations, I don't think is a proper argument on their part. 
   In addition, I conclude with reference to the equity to the rest of the projects throughout the United States of America. In 1986 we decided O&M would be taken care of by the restoration project beneficiaries. I point out to the other Senator from Florida that as to the St. Luci project and many others mentioned, the Federal Government is picking up 100 percent of the cost that took place before 1986. Perhaps maybe one of the reasons why the Federal  Government decided not to pay 100 percent is because a lot of people thought that was not fair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. As mayor of Cleveland, we had to increase water rates 300 percent in order to do the job we needed to do and we didn't get any money from the Federal Government. I think it is really important to recognize that 20 percent of this total cost is municipal water supply. We are paying for the cost of the municipal water supply. They are avoiding some $1.6 billion of cost for this municipal water. That is an enormous contribution. 
   If you subtract out that $1.6 billion from Florida's share on it, it works out to be about 35-65, so that the argument, 50-50, and therefore we ought to do 50 percent of the operation and maintenance I do not think is as relevant as it might be if it was really 50-50.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. The point is, I am not referring to wastewater. I am talking about public water supply which is very important to developing any State. You have people coming in, and you need a public water supply. In order to provide it, you have to go to the local people, the ratepayers, and say: Come up with the money. And the Federal Government does not participate. 
   In this project, we are saying to the State of Florida: If you have future municipal water needs, 20 percent of this project is for that. It is an equivalent of $1.6 billion, and you are going to be saving that cost in the future.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the remarks of the chairman of my committee for whom I have a great deal of respect. I would beg to differ in terms of the interpretation of what this water restoration project comes under. 
   This is not a fish and wildlife enhancement under 906(e). This is an environmental restoration under section 103 of WRDA 1986, as amended, which basically calls for: 100 percent of the operation, maintenance, replacement and rehabilitation costs for projects are to be paid by the local participant in the project. 
   Last, but not least--and, again, with all due respect to my chairman--as a former Governor of Ohio, I can tell you that 
   if this amendment is adopted, the Governor of Florida is not going to walk away from this wonderful legislation that is going to help restore the Everglades and commit the Federal Government to--based on our hearing this week--half of some $14 billion. 
   If anyone is going to vote against this amendment because they think it is a deal breaker, in my opinion, it is not a deal breaker. This bill will pass. If this amendment is adopted, the bill is still going to pass, and we will move on with this project.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the primary reasons I came to the Senate, was the fact that I believed we had spent money over the years on many things that, while important, we were unwilling to pay for, or, in the alternative, do without. We had a policy of ``let the next guy worry about it'' or more precisely, ``let the next generation worry about it.'' I have said this before and I will keep on saying it until everyone realizes that we have a national debt that is costing us $224 billion in interest payments a year, and that translates into $600 million per day just to pay the interest. 
   Out of every Federal dollar that is spent this year, 13 cents will go to pay the interest on the national debt. In comparison, 16 cents will go for national defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary spending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we spend more Federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the entire Medicare program. 
   It still amazes me to think that 38 years ago, when my wife Janet and I got married, only 6 cents out of every dollar was going to pay interest on the debt. It is high time for our nation to make some headway into bringing down our national debt and lowering those interest costs. 
   As my colleagues know, our nation currently enjoys the greatest economic expansion in our history. We have a robust economy, and across the nation, states are reporting record low unemployment rates. Congress should take advantage of this incredible opportunity to create a lasting legacy for the young people of our country, and pay down our national debt and get this burden off the backs of our children and off the backs of our grandchildren. 
   All the experts say that paying down the debt is the best thing we could do with our budget surpluses. 
   Indeed, CBO Director Dan Crippen said earlier this year:  
   ..... most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying down the debt held by the public, is probably the best thing that we can do relative to the economy.  
   Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan also said:  
   My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.   
   Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main Street. It encourages more savings and investment which, in turn, fuels productivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest rates, which in my view, is a real tax reduction for the American people. 
   Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the only way we can ensure that our nation will not return to the days of deficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn down or a national emergency arise. 
   In the time that I have been in the Senate, I have worked tirelessly to ensure that our on-budget surplus is used to pay down the national debt. 
   In fact, during consideration of the fiscal year 2000 and the fiscal year 2001 budget resolutions, I offered amendments that would direct whatever on-budget surplus we received in each particular fiscal year towards debt reduction. 
   In addition, I have been a staunch advocate of ``lock boxing'' both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to prevent the expenditure of these funds. 
   Further, I offered an amendment with Senator ALLARD this past June to direct $12 billion in FY 2000 on-budget surplus dollars toward debt reduction. By the way, it passed by a vote of 95-3. 
   It was a great victory, but the celebration did not last long. 
   Unfortunately, all but $4 billion of that $12 billion disappeared: used for other spending in the Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report. 
   My disappointment was somewhat tempered by the news that the on-budget surplus that had been predicted earlier in the year was entirely too low an estimate. 
   As my colleagues know, in July, the CBO announced that our fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus had grown to $84 billion--$60 billion more than was projected in January. 
   We have to be careful not to squander this windfall, because if we are able to maintain some fiscal restraint--and resist the temptation to spend it in the time we have remaining--at the end of this fiscal year, that $60 billion will be used for debt reduction. 
   We must resist the temptation to tap it before the end of this month--particularly in light of the fact that as of the first of this month, Congress had increased non-defense discretionary spending in fiscal year 2000 to $328 billion: a 9.3 percent boost over the previous fiscal year, and the largest single-year increase in non-defense discretionary spending since 1980. 
   If we do resist the temptation to spend it, I think we should celebrate the fact that we have made a major dent in our national debt; the most significant payment using on-budget surplus funds in more than 30 years. Think of that. 
   But, the fiscal year 2000 budget cycle is just about over. The issue today is what are we going to do to strike a blow for fiscal responsibility in the coming fiscal year. 
   As my colleagues are likely aware, Majority Leader LOTT and Speaker HASTERT have developed legislation, the Debt Relief Lock-Box Reconciliation Act for Fiscal Year 2001, H.R. 5173, that will allocate 90 percent of the fiscal year 2001 surplus towards debt reduction. 
   What will that mean? 
   Under H.R. 5173, both the Social Security and the Medicare surpluses will be ``lock-boxed,'' and approximately $200 billion will be protected from those who would use those funds for more spending. 
   I think the public should know, so there is no confusion, that it is not a literal ``lock box''--like a safety deposit box--but it is an iron-clad commitment that Congress cannot touch these funds for spending. Instead, those surplus dollars could only be used to pay down the debt. 
   It took Congress until just last year to finally stop using our Social Security surplus as a means to mask more than three decades of spending and instead, use it for debt reduction. We should continue this ``hands off'' approach of the Social Security trust fund. 
   Sadly, we have not yet been able to do the same with respect to the Medicare surplus--having used nearly all of it on spending in fiscal year 2000. Now is the time to treat the Medicare surplus the same as we have treated the Social Security surplus and make sure that it is subject to the same ``hands off'' policy as well. 
   Putting these trust funds in a ``lock box'' doesn't mean that we will have solved the problems of Social Security and Medicare, but using them to lower our debt now gives us added flexibility in the future to address the long-term solvency of these two programs. It is about time we reform Social Security and Medicare. 
   Also under this bill, some $42 billion of the on-budget surplus that the CBO is estimating for the next fiscal year will be used strictly for debt reduction. No smoke-and-mirrors, no gimmicks, just straight debt reduction. 
   Therefore, under H.R. 5173, 90 percent of all fiscal year 2001 surplus funds will be used for debt reduction. 
   I have heard the President and some of my colleagues say that this is just going to squeeze the ability to meet ``pressing needs'' in the coming fiscal year. I do not agree. 
   If the disparity between the preliminary and supplemental surplus projections of fiscal year 2000 are any indicator, there will likely be an upward readjustment of the surplus projections in FY 2001. 
   If our economy should slow and these projections turn out to be too optimistic, then we could cut spending--which would be fine as far as I am concerned. But in the meantime, this proposal will hold our feet to the fire with respect to spending, and our feet need to be held to the fire. 
   My colleagues and I are not asking for a lot, simply that this body stand up and be counted. I hear people every day saying let's do something about the national debt. I hear the President of the United States say it is a problem and we need to address it. So, I say to my colleagues that if we agree that we need to bring down the debt, then let's take advantage of the chance to do so and let's enact this proposal. 
   Reducing the national debt has been a principle of my party. It has been a principle of mine throughout my political career. First of all, you don't go into debt. But, if you do, you get rid of it. 
   Here we have an ability to put our money where our mouths are, and say, yes, we do believe in reducing the national debt. We are going to take this money, put it aside, and pay down the national debt. 
   And while I personally would like to see as much of the on-budget surplus used for debt reduction as humanly possible, I believe this is the best proposal we are going to see as negotiations get underway over the fiscal year 2001 budget. 
   Nevertheless, I believe by capping spending and tax cuts for fiscal year 2001, and locking in set amounts of debt reduction, as this proposal does, we will have effectively established a good first step towards further fiscal responsibility in fiscal year 2002 and beyond. In other words, it establishes a down payment for us to do even more meaningful debt reduction in years ahead. 
   I think GAO Comptroller General David Walker said it best when he testified last year before the House Ways and Means Committee. Here is what he said:  
   This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal wave.  
   When I came to the Senate, I had one grandchild. Today, I have three. Like all other Americans, I think about what the future has in store for them and about the legacy I want to leave to my grandchildren. 
   We have a moral obligation to remove the debt-burden that we have placed on their backs. It is up to this Congress--in the weeks we have left--to pass the Debt Relief Lock-Box Reconciliation Act for our children and grandchildren and for the future of our Nation. 
   The House of Representatives has already stepped up to the plate and passed this bill overwhelmingly, by a vote of--listen to this--381 to 3. It is up to the Senate to do the same.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to improve upon the District of Columbia's process for measuring and reporting on its performance. This legislation derives directly from a letter sent to me by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, in which he requested that Congress consider making minor changes to the District's reporting requirements so that the city can take one step closer to establishing a system of performance budgeting, in which the city's budget can be linked directly to the performance goals set by the city's agencies. I am pleased that Senator DURBIN joins me as an original cosponsor of this bill. 
   Similar to the intent of Congress in passing the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, which re-engineered the management practices at federal agencies, the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 (DCFRMA) mandates that the District begin submitting performance accountability plans to Congress preceding each fiscal year. These plans are to establish objective, measurable performance goals for all agencies and departments within the government of the District of Columbia. The legislation also requires the District to submit to Congress a performance accountability report, following each fiscal year, that evaluates the city's ability to meet the performance goals it laid out in the performance accountability plan for that fiscal year. 
   For the past three fiscal years since the DCFRMA legislation took effect, the performance plans and reports have provided the District with a valuable tool to establish a system of accountability in its operations. The Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, which I chair, has held two oversight hearings on the District's progress in improving performance, and we are scheduled to hold another hearing in the coming weeks to evaluate the District's progress in accomplishing the goals it set out in its FY2000 performance accountability plan. 
   Although the performance accountability plan legislation has provided the District with an effective framework for establishing a system of performance budgeting, our bill proposes minor changes to the law to improve the utility and relevance of this strategic planning exercise. First, current law provides that the performance accountability plan is due no later than March 1st preceding each fiscal year. However, in order to tie together the city's budget with the performance goals for each year, the Mayor requested that we consider harmonizing the submission deadline for the performance plan with the city's budget to Congress. In order to align the submission requirements, this legislation we are introducing today would change the submission deadline for the performance accountability plan from its current March 1st deadline, to a deadline that is concurrent with the submission of the District of Columbia budget to Congress. By making this change, we hope to align the budget and the performance measures more closely, and help guide the city toward a system of performance budgeting. 
   The second change made by this legislation is to streamline the performance goal requirements that were initially established in the DCFRMA. The current law mandates that, for every goal, the District must establish both an acceptable level of performance and a superior level of performance. Our bill proposes that the multiple levels of performance goals by replaced by one set of ambitious performance targets. This would clarify the goals District managers are expected to meet and align congressional mandates on the District with what is required of federal agencies. 
   Senator DURBIN and I hope these technical amendments to the performance plan requirements will allow the District to reform its management system more efficiently, and the subcommittee intends to actively monitor the city's progress in this regard.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 4444, legislation that will extend permanent normal trade relations status to China. 
   In the past few days, the Senate has held a number of votes on amendments that address issues about which I care deeply. We have debated amendments that deal with such issues as ensuring religious freedom in China; organ harvesting; Tibet; and Senator THOMPSON's amendment dealing with Chinese nuclear proliferation--an issue that needs definite action. 
   However, I have reluctantly voted against including these, and other amendments, to H.R. 4444. I am committed to passing PNTR, and I believe we must pass a clean bill and present it to the President for his signature as soon as possible. It is long overdue. 
   Fortunately, as we approach a final vote on PNTR, the Senate is poised to pass a clean bill, which, in my view, will help continue the growth of our economy, and help bring us closer to realizing many of the reforms in China that my colleagues wish to see implemented. 
   For the past several years, the United States has enjoyed one of its longest periods of economic expansion in our history. International trade has been a vital component of this remarkable economic boom. In fact, the growth in U.S. exports over the last ten years has been responsible for about one-third of our total economic growth. That means jobs for Americans and of particular concern to this Senator, jobs for Ohioans. 
   As my colleagues know, America's trade barriers are among the lowest in the world, and as a result, American workers face stiff competition from overseas. Nevertheless, it is this competition that has made American workers the best and the most productive anywhere, and the U.S. economy the strongest and most vibrant in the world. 
   In my state of Ohio, tearing down trade barriers has helped us become the 8th largest exporter in the United States, and part of Ohio's export-related success can be linked to passage of NAFTA. 
   Thanks to NAFTA, historic trade barriers that once kept American goods and services out of Canadian and Mexican markets either have been eliminated or are being phased out. The positive economic effects have been astounding, including a growth in U.S. exports to Canada of 54 percent and a growth of U.S. exports to Mexico of 90 percent since 1993--the year before NAFTA took effect. 
   My State of Ohio has outperformed the nation during that time period in the growth of exports to America's two NAFTA trading partners. Ohio exports to Canada have grown 64 percent and Ohio exports to Mexico have grown 101 percent. In the last several years, Mexico has moved from our seventh largest trading partner to fourth. 
   Since 1994--the same year NAFTA went into effect--nearly 600,000 net new jobs were created in Ohio. Although NAFTA did not create all of these jobs, the boom in export growth triggered by NAFTA, as well as the overwhelming success of the ``New Economy'' have contributed significantly to this job growth. 
   As in many States in America, unemployment in Ohio today is at a 25 year low; and some areas of the State are even facing worker shortages--in fact, too many. The claims that ``countless numbers of workers'' would lose their jobs due to NAFTA and become ``unemployable'' have rung hollow. 
   According to the most recent data from the United States Department of Labor, the number of workers who have been certified by the DOL as eligible for NAFTA trade adjustment assistance benefits between January 1, 1994, and September 28, 1999, is 6,074. 
   However, not all workers who have been certified for NAFTA trade adjustment assistance have actually collected benefits. Additional data from the Department of Labor suggests that only 20 to 30 percent of all certified workers have collected benefits. This means that most workers have moved on to other employment. It also means that NAFTA works. 
   Building on the success of NAFTA, we have an opportunity to watch lightning strike twice. 
   In November of last year, the U.S. signed an historic bilateral trade agreement with China, a crucial first step in China's effort to gain entry into the World Trade Organization. This agreement--a product of 13 years of negotiation--contains unprecedented, unilateral trade concessions on the part of China, including significant reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. 
   In return, China would receive no increased access to U.S. markets, no cuts in U.S. tariffs and no special removal of U.S. import protections. This is because our market is already open to Chinese exports, and by signing the bilateral agreement, China has agreed to open its market unilaterally to the United States in exchange for U.S. support for Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization. 
   If implemented, this agreement would present unprecedented opportunities for American farmers, workers and businesses. In fact, according to the Institute for International Economics, China's entry into the WTO would result in an immediate increase in U.S. exports of $3.1 billion. 
   An analysis produced by Goldman Sachs, which took into account investment flows, estimates that China's entry into the WTO could translate into $13 billion in additional U.S. exports by the year 2005. 
   As good as this may sound, the United States risks losing the substantial economic benefits of this agreement unless permanent normal trade relations status is extended to China. Currently, China's PNTR status is annually reviewed by the President and is conditioned on the fulfillment of specific freedom-of-emigration requirements established in 1974 by the Jackson-Vanik law. 
   However, WTO rules require all members to grant PNTR status to all fellow members without condition. If the U.S. fails to extend PNTR status to China, then both this trade agreement and WTO rules may not apply to our trade with China. 
   I understand that many Americans oppose PNTR for China because of China's record on a number of important issues, including trade fairness, human rights, labor standards, the environment, and China's emergence as a regional and global military power. I share those concerns, but I believe that rather than unilaterally locking the United States out of the Chinese market, the best way to address these issues is by opening China up. 
   For years, American businesses have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to penetrate the Chinese market and get through numerous trade barriers used by China to protect its uncompetitive state-owned enterprises. In signing the November agreement, China has agreed to remove and significantly reduce these trade barriers. This would open up one of the world's fastest growing and potentially largest markets to American goods and services in a wide range of sectors, from agriculture to automobiles and banking to telecommunications. It would eventually allow U.S. exporters to freely distribute their products to any part of China without interference from government middlemen. 
   This agreement also maintains and strengthens safeguards against unfair Chinese imports. It preserves a tougher standard in identifying illegal dumping. What's more, with this agreement, we will have better protections from import surges than under current U.S. law. Most importantly, this agreement sets the stage for China to join the WTO and, hence, become subject to both its trade rules and its binding punishments for breaking these rules. 
   The United States has worked for more than a decade to secure freer access to the Chinese market. If the U.S. does not capitalize on this agreement  by giving China PNTR status, America's competitors in Europe and Asia most certainly will. 
   Like most Americans, I am deeply concerned about human rights, labor and environmental conditions in China. Some opponents argue that granting PNTR status would somehow remove pressure on China to improve its poor record on these issues. I don't agree. 
   It is important to remember that China already has the privilege of full access to the U.S. market. Let's get that clear. They already have the privilege of full access to the U.S. market. While Congress has repeatedly criticized China's record on these issues, it has never once revoked China's trade status in an annual review. 
   Furthermore, granting China PNTR status would not prevent Congress or the administration from continuing to speak out on any and all issues of concern that have been raised, nor would it preclude sanctioning China in the future. 
   In addition, I regard the expansion of our economic relationship as a far more effective method of influencing change in Chinese behavior than the status quo. If China joins the WTO, the United States will have an unprecedented opportunity to not only export more of our goods and services to China, but also our culture and values. This increased interaction will allow the United States to expose the Chinese people to Western standards of political freedom, human rights, business practices and environmental protection. 
   No one can predict with any degree of certainty the path China will ultimately choose for itself. But I firmly believe that opening China economically to the rest of the world can only help efforts to open up its political system and improve the lives of its people. 
   Some argue that China has become a major military rival to America and that increased trade would finance China's military buildup, thereby enhancing China's threat to our national security. I think this logic as inherently wrong. 
   History has shown that economic integration diminishes military tension and the threat of war, even among historical enemies. The European Union, which brought together two longtime adversaries, France and Germany, is a prime example of this phenomenon. 
   Nations that trade together share a common interest in remaining at peace and preserving the mutual benefits of free trade. Conversely, rejecting opportunities for economic cooperation would only play into the hands of the old hard-line elements in China who are already hostile to both free trade and the United States. 
   As the final vote on PNTR approaches, the question that this body must consider is not whether China deserves to enjoy the benefits of WTO membership. 
   At this point, that is not a decision the U.S. can make wholly on our own, because China will be able to join the WTO if it has the support of its other major trading partners. Nor does the Senate need to determine whether China needs to improve its record on human rights, labor standards and the environment. It is already clear that these issues need to be addressed. 
   What the Senate needs to do is to decide whether our Nation will be able to benefit from a hard-fought agreement that unilaterally opens China's markets to American products, and whether the United States should use this trade relationship to advance democratic reform, build a trusting relationship, and address grievances without hostility. In my view, granting China permanent normal trade relations status is the first step in that process. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Balkans, with Gavrilo Princip's assassination of Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Bosnia in 1914, started the devastation of World War I. World War II had deep ties to the region as well. The Truman doctrine, the basis of American policy throughout the cold war, began with President Truman's decision to support anti-Communist forces in Greece and Turkey, again, in the Balkans. To deal with the historic threat to peace, security and prosperity the Balkans poses, the United States and Europe made a commitment in the aftermath of the Kosovo crisis to integrate the region into the broader European community. This commitment is consistent with the pillar that has bound the United States and Europe since the end of World War II--a belief in the peaceful influence of stable democracies based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and support for a market economy in Europe. 
   However, the Balkans continue to be unstable. Slobodan Milosevic constantly stirs trouble in Kosovo and Montenegro. The minority communities of Kosovo are suffering under a systematic effort by extremist ethnic Albanians to force them out. Moderate Albanians in Kosovo are threatened for simply selling bread to a member of the Serb community. As long as this instability remains, the shared European and American goal of a whole and free Europe will not become a reality. 
   Inclusion of the Balkans in the European community of democracies would promote our Nation's strategic interests. By providing a series of friendly nations south from Hungary to Greece and east from Italy to the Black Sea, we would be in a much better position to deter regional crises and respond to them should they occur. The link to the Black Sea would also provide a link into central Asia in the event that the protection of our national security interests were ever threatened in this area.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in addition, Bishop Kyr Artemije, a leader of the Kosovar Serbs, presented similar statistics documenting the violence and bloodshed that has been carried out in Kosovo since the end of the war in testimony he gave before the Helsinki Commission this past February. His statistics were updated and verified at a recent meeting that I and several of my House colleagues had with the Bishop over the Fourth of July recess in Kosovo.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in addition, a July 3 article written by Steven Erlanger for the New York Times, discusses the observations Dennis McNamara, the U.N. special envoy for humanitarian affairs in Kosovo, had regarding the status of the situation in Kosovo today, particularly how minorities have been treated since the end of the air war and how minorities are being pushed out of Kosovo in a continuous and organized manner. 
   McNamara is quoted as saying that:

   Mr. VOINOVICH. The United States must not now--nor ever--condone this revenge approach in Kosovo in either thought, word or deed. We must maintain and promote our values as a nation--a respect for human rights, freedom of religion, freedom from harassment, intimidation or violence. 
   If this administration, and the next, does not acknowledge and seriously address the plight of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo, then I think that within a year's time there will not be any minorities still in Kosovo. To prevent this, I believe we should be more aggressive towards protecting minority rights in Kosovo immediately. 
   If we do not, I am concerned that the extremist members of the Kosovo Albanian community will continue to push out all minority groups until they have achieved their dream of an Albanian-only Kosovo. In other words, if we do nothing, there will be many who will argue that the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo was tacitly endorsed by the lack of leadership in the international community. 
   It is important to note that the problem does not rest with our KFOR troops, for they have been restricted in what they can and cannot do. These men and women are doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances. I know what they're going through because, last February, I walked through the village of Gnjilane with some of our soldiers, and saw first-hand the restrictions they were under. 
   While I was in Kosovo over the 4th of July recess, I had the opportunity to visit our troops at Camp Bondsteel. Every soldier that I spoke with talked of their commitment to their mission and ensuring the safety of the citizens of Kosovo. I fully believe that it is because of these troops that there is not further violence. 
   I do have hope that we can bring an end to the bloodshed in Southeastern  Europe, and I believe that there are some within the Kosovo Albanian community who can prevail upon the better instincts of their fellow man in a commitment towards peace. 
   Earlier this year, at the headquarters of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, in Pristina, Kosovo, I had the opportunity to sit down and meet with several key leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community and representatives on the Interim Administrative Council--Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, Mr. Hashim Thaci, and Dr. Rexhep Qosja. 
   All three leaders made a very clear promise to me that they were committed to a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo, one that would respect the rights of all ethnic minorities. I was heartened to hear these comments. This commitment could serve as the basis for long-term peace and stability in Kosovo. 
   I said that they could go down in history as truly great men were they to make this commitment a reality. I explained that the historic cycle of violence in Kosovo must end and minority rights must be respected--including the sanctity of churches and monasteries. 
   I also point out to them that ``revenge begets revenge'' and unless Albanians and Serbs learned to live in peace with one another, violence would continue to plague their children, their grandchildren and generations yet unborn. 
   It is my hope that they will realize that they and their actions will be keys to the future of Kosovo. 
   We all want peace to prevail in the Balkans, but we have a long way to go for that to happen. I believe we should listen to the words of His Holiness, Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox church, who states, ``in Kosovo and Metohija there will be no victory of humanity and justice while revenge and disorder prevail. No one has a moral right to celebrate victory complacently for as long as one kind of evil replaces another, and the freedom of one people rests upon the slavery of another.'' 
   The Patriarch's call for leadership in protecting all citizens in Kosovo is one that this nation should heed if peace and stability in Kosovo is our goal. 
   At the OSCE meeting in Bucharest, I introduced a resolution on Southeastern Europe that had the support of several of my legislative colleagues from the U.S. The main point of the resolution that I offered was to call to the attention of the OSCE's Parliamentary Assembly the current situation in Kosovo and Serbia, and made clear the importance of removing Slobodan Milosevic from power.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. My resolution put the OSCE, as a body, on record as condemning the Milosevic regime and insisting on the restoration of human rights, the rule of law, free press and respect for ethnic minorities in Serbia. I was pleased that the resolution passed--despite strong opposition by the delegation from the Russian Federation--and I am hopeful that it will help re-focus the attention of the international community on the situation in the Balkans. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that we are approaching a crossroads in Kosovo with two very different directions that we can choose. 
   The first direction--the wrong direction--involves more of the same of what we have seen in recent months. More bloodshed, more grenade attacks on elderly minorities as they sit on their porch. More land-mines on roads traveled by parents taking their children to school. More intimidation, threats and harassment of minorities walking the streets in mixed villages and towns. All this would lead to the continued fleeing of minorities from Kosovo and the establishment of an Albanian-only Kosovo. Again, ethnic cleansing carried-out under the nose of NATO and the U.N. 
   The second direction--the right direction--involves the international community, led by the United States, protecting the human rights of the minority communities of Kosovo. With this protection, the minority groups would feel safe in their homes and be comfortable enough to be involved in UNMIK municipal elections this fall, a key priority for UNMIK. Places of historical significance, especially Serbian Orthodox monasteries, would be safe from destruction from extremists. 
   Minorities would be safe to travel to the market in their own communities without needing KFOR protection, something that does not happen today. Kosovo Albanians who sell goods to minorities would not be threatened, harmed or killed, again, something that does not happen today. In short, bloodshed would stop under the watch of the international community. 
   And there is encouraging news. 
   Just this last weekend, at Airlie House in Virginia, leaders of Kosovo's Serb and Albania communities met under the auspices of the United States Institute for Peace. 
   Among other provisions, the representatives agreed to launch a new initiative--a Campaign Against Violence--whereby the representatives of both communities agreed to a Pact Against Violence to promote tolerance, condemn violence, prevent negative exploitation of ethnic issues, and enable physical integration and political participation by all. In addition, the communities agreed on two key provisions to help reduce the power of extremist elements by calling on KFOR and UNMIK to guard and control more effectively all entry into Kosovo, and requesting that UNMIK move immediately to start-up a functioning court and prison system. 
   Also, the Serb and Albanian representatives agreed on several items regarding the return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes, including the recognition that the return of such individuals is a fundamental right and essential to the future of Kosovo. In order to facilitate such returns, the parties insist that UNMIK and KFOR pursue fresh efforts to provide greater security for individuals to return to their homes, and to expand aid for reconstruction and economic revitalization in those communities. 
   They further agreed that a new model of security and law enforcement is needed, and that the international community must overcome its differences to that UNMIK and KFOR can take much stronger measures to carry out their security and law enforcement responsibilities. 
   Last but not least, the representatives recognize that the international community will not support a Kosovo cleansed of some of its ethnic communities. Rather, all these communities must work together to build a multi-ethnic Kosovo respecting the rights of all its citizens. 
   I say ``Amen and Hallelujah'' to the fact that these two communities can come together and develop such an outline for peace. 
   There should be a loud voice coming out from this administraiton--the same loud voice that we heard last year--to the United Nations, to the UNMIK, and to our NATO Allies that we cannot allow ethnic cleansing of any kind to continue. 
   And I just want the administration to know that I am holding them responsible to make the same commitment to Kosovo now that they made during the war, specifically, to go in and make sure that NATO, UNMIK, and KFOR give the same priority to protecting minority rights today. 
   It is up to the United States to provide the leadership to make sure that the items that the representatives at Airlie House identified as important are actually carried out by the UNMIK and by KFOR in cooperation with the Serb and Albanian communities in Kosovo. 
   Individually, none of these entities can guarantee peace and stability in Kosovo. It is only by working together that peace will occur, and it is the primary reason that the U.S. needs to re-commit itself to Kosovo. 
   We, the United States, with our strength and commitment to the protection of human rights, can largely determine which direction is taken in Kosovo. It is in our hands to live up to that potential. 
   It is in our national security interest. It is in our economic interest in Europe. It is in the interest of peace in the world that we make that commitment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I could not help but hear the words of Senator WYDEN and Senator DOMENICI about the terrible situation we have across this country today in regard to HMOs dropping senior citizens off the Medicare Plus Choice Program. 
   While I was Governor of the State of Ohio, we had several instances where people were thrown off the rolls of their HMO and forced to be without any kind of supplemental insurance or prescription drug benefits. It is a growing epidemic today in the United States of America. I want to go on record in support of the legislation of Senator WYDEN and Senator DOMENICI. In fact, earlier today I asked Senator DOMENICI if I could be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   It is important to point out that some of the on-budget surplus that we now have in the year 2000 and the projected $102 billion in 2001 is generated by the fact that projected Medicare costs are coming in far below what they anticipated because of the formula that was adopted in 1997. It seems to me we ought to look at the situation as it really is, increase the reimbursement to those HMOs so individuals can stay in those programs, and so they don't have to buy Medigap insurance to cover out-of-pocket expenses and prescription drugs. 
   It seems to me it should be our responsibility to make sure those who are now covered remain covered and not be thrown out on the street. I have read so often: Don't worry about those people, somebody else will pick them up, or they can go to fee for service. When they go to fee for service, they don't get their 20 percent out-of-pocket paid for, nor does Medicare pick up prescription drugs. 
   It is time for this Congress to step in and change the system, increase the reimbursement, keep those individuals who are on Medicare Plus Choice Programs so they can maintain coverage for out-of-pocket expenses and maintain the prescription drug coverage they have.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul Coverdell, our friend and colleague. Paul was an extraordinary human being who really cared. He looked at his opportunity to serve in the Senate as a way to make a difference in the lives of his fellow man. 
   I will never forget Paul Coverdell. He was one of the first people who reached out to me when I first came to this body, greeting me with a warm welcome and caring advice. Although he was in leadership and had many demands on his time, he always had time for me and truly listened to what I had to say. He had common sense and a common touch. I have truly enjoyed working with him on several legislative initiatives, particularly education and the Ed-Flex bill we passed last year. 
   Paul had a wonderful knack for being able to work with people and to get things done. He led by example. He understood that to be a leader one had to serve. There was no job so small that he would not take it. His commitment and ability always made you want to be on his team. His enthusiasm was contagious. He made you feel good just being around him. 
   My regret is that because of my short tenure in the Senate, I did not get to know Paul or spend as much time with him as many of my colleagues. 
   He gave witness to his Christian faith every day. He will continue to be my role model in the Senate. Paul Coverdell will be missed by all of us, but my faith tells me that he is eternally happy with our Father in Heaven. I pray that thought will give comfort to his wife Nancy and the members of his family.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in the year-and-a-half that I have been in the Senate, I have taken several opportunities to come to the floor to talk about the need to reduce our national debt. 
   Every chance I get, I remind my colleagues that we cannot let the excitement of having a record-high surplus allow us to lose sight of the fact that we must keep spending in check, and use our Social Security surplus and on-budget surplus dollars to pay down our $5.7 trillion national debt. 
   I can't help but wonder why the media is quick to report that we have such tremendous surpluses, but is virtually silent when it comes to reporting that we have such a huge national debt. 
   I think the people need to know that we have a national debt that is costing us $224 billion in interest payments a year, and that translates into $600 million per day just to pay the interest. Out of every federal dollar that is spent this year, 13 cents will go to pay the interest on the national debt. In comparison, 16 cents will go for national defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary spending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we spend more federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the entire Medicare program. 
   This debt didn't accumulate overnight. In fact, it took decades of misguided fiscal policies on the part of the Congress and the Executive Branch to get this way. But, fortunately, we have an opportunity, with our strong economy and low unemployment, to make some headway on paying down our debt. 
   Nearly every family in America or every business owner in America, when they come into some extra money, would use that surplus money to pay off their loans, their credit cards, etc.--whatever debt they had accumulated. 
   And that's precisely what the U.S. government should do. 
   I don't think our Nation is any different from our families. If we have some extra money, we ought to get rid of the debt we are carrying on our back. 
   As my colleagues know, because of the expanding economy, CBO's April surplus estimates showed that we had attained a $26 billion on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. 
   And I would like to remind my colleagues that $22 billion of that $26 billion surplus was from payroll tax overpayments to the Medicare Trust Fund. 
   However, of that $26 billion surplus amount, the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution assumed we would spend $14 billion of it. 
   That left $12 billion, which I felt should be used for debt reduction, and so I sought to find a legislative remedy to have those funds allocated solely for the purpose of debt reduction. 
   On June 15th, by a vote of 95-3, the Senate passed an amendment to the Transportation Appropriations bill that Senator ALLARD and I sponsored, directing the remaining $12 billion on-budget surplus to be used for debt reduction. It was a tremendous victory, but, recognizably short-lived. 
   Over the last two months, Congress has spent $13.8 billion in an ``emergency'' supplemental appropriations package that was included as part of the Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, and an additional $5.5 billion has been allocated for payments for another ``ag bailout'' bill with the passage of the Crop Insurance Reform package. 
   Thus, nearly all but $4 billion of the $26 billion surplus has been spent, including just about all of the $22 billion in overpayments to the Medicare Trust Fund--money that we in Congress have been talking about ``lock-boxing'' to prevent it from being spent in just such a manner. 
   With all this added spending, I would like to remind my colleagues that we are significantly raising discretionary spending this year--a habit Congress seems reluctant to break. For example, in fiscal year 1998, Congress spent $555 billion on discretionary spending. In fiscal year 1999 we increased discretionary spending to $575 billion--a 4% increase over that one year. 
   In fiscal year 2000, if you factor in the emergency supplemental appropriations we approved two weeks ago, discretionary spending will be $618 billion. Compared to last year's $575 billion, if my figures are right, that is a 7.5% increase so far in discretionary spending. 
   How many people in this country can say that they received a 7.5% pay increase from last year? 
   This is outrageous, and all the more reason we can't allow spending to grow any further in FY 2000. 
   When given the opportunity to spend more or bring down our national debt, Congress has to learn to make the tough choices--the fiscally prudent choices. 
   Fortunately, we will have another opportunity to curb spending and make a dent in our national debt. 
   Today, we have received the expected news from CBO that our fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus has grown to $84 billion--$60 billion more than was projected in January. 
   With such a large amount of on-budget surplus dollars at stake, I fear that, again, the temptation will be enormous to spend these dollars--and with even greater zeal than before. We must ignore the allure of spending these surpluses, and remember that the best thing we could do with these funds is use them to pay down the debt. 
   For those of my colleagues who support tax cuts, I would like to remind them that the only thing that we can do with these FY 2000 surplus funds this year is use them to increase spending or pay down the national debt. That's it. They cannot be used for tax cuts because the fiscal year is almost over. 
   I have recently read an excellent paper written by Peter B. Sperry, who is the Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at the Heritage Foundation, regarding our obligation to use our surplus dollars to pay down our national debt.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I agree with the conclusion that Mr. Sperry reaches in his paper, and that is, Congress needs to enact legislation that will automatically take the $60 billion windfall we just received for fiscal year 2000 and use it to pay down the debt. 
   The bill that Mr. Sperry says that Congress needs to pass is H.R. 4601, the Debt Reduction Reconciliation Act of 2000. Fortunately, on June 20th, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4601, by a vote of 419-5. An overwhelming majority--just think of it. 
   I have reviewed this bill, and I believe H.R. 4601 is our last hope to pass meaningful debt-reduction legislation this year. That is why I asked that this bill be held at the desk and put on the Senate's calendar, instead of being sent to Committee. We must consider this legislation now, and we need to let the American people know that Congress is serious about reducing the national debt and not merely paying lip-service towards that goal. 
   In particular, the bill establishes an off-budget account at the U.S. Treasury that would be called the Public Debt Reduction Payment Account. Any funds that are over the amount specified in CBO's January surplus estimate of $24 billion would be transferred to the Account, where they would be automatically used to reduce the debt. Thus, $60 billion in on-budget surplus funds for FY 2000 would be directed towards debt reduction. 
   My fear is that before any of the extra FY 2000 funds actually go towards debt reduction, Congress and the President--especially the President--will say, ``well, we've got the money, let's spend it and get out of town.'' But Mr. President, that's definitely not how it should work. 
   We have a moral obligation to use this money to pay down the debt, and I would like to read a quote from General Accounting Office (GAO) Comptroller General David Walker that hits the nail right on the head regarding that obligation. In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee last year, Mr. Walker said:  
   This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal wave.  
   To me, the most important thing that we can do on behalf of our children and our grandchildren is to remove the yoke of this debt burden from their backs. If we do so, it will strike a blow for their future and for the future of our nation. 
   It is the responsibility of the House and the Senate to ``stop the hemorrhaging of spending'' by agreeing to let the remaining on-budget surplus for FY 2000 go towards paying down the national debt. H.R. 4601 will meet that challenge, and it is now up to the Senate to pass this bill. Let's get it done, Mr. President, and let's get it done now. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. 
   Exhibit I  
   How To Protect the Surplus From Wasteful Spending  
   Although most Americans assume that a federal budget surplus in any year is automatically used to reduce the national debt, or at least the debt held by the public, this actually is not the case. The U.S. Department of the Treasury must implement specific financial accounting procedures if it is to use a cash surplus to pay down the debt held by the public. If these procedures are not followed, or if they proceed slowly, then the surplus revenue just builds up in the Treasury's operating cash accounts. 
   This excess cash could be used in the future to further reduce the debt, but only if it is protected from other uses in the meantime. Until the excess cash is formally committed to debt repayment, Congress could appropriate it for other purposes. Consequently, the current surplus will not automatically reduce the publicly held national debt of $3.54 trillion unless Congress acts now to make sure these funds are automatically used for debt reduction and for no other purpose. 
   There is a parallel to this in household finance. When a family with a large mortgage, credit card debt, and several student loans receives an unexpected financial windfall, it usually deposits the funds in a checking account and takes a little time to consider how best to allocate the revenue--whether to refinance the mortgage, pay off credit cards, or establish a rainy day fund. Meanwhile, the family's debt remains, and will not be reduced until the family formally transfers funds to one or more of its creditors. If the family does not take some action in the interim to wall off the cash, it often ends up frittering away the money on new purchases, and the debt remains. 
   The federal government faces a similar situation. Surplus revenues are accumulating in the Treasury Department's operating cash accounts faster than the Bureau of the Public Debt can efficiently dedicate them to reducing the public debt. Consequently, surplus balances in these accounts have reached historic levels, and they are likely to accumulate even faster as the size of the surplus grows. Unless Congress takes formal action to protect these funds, they are available to be used or misused at anytime in the appropriations process. Fortunately, the House soon will consider a bill (H.R. 4601) that would protect the budget surplus from being raided by appropriations until prudent decisions can be made about its use.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from West Virginia. He has done a good job of explaining why this amendment is not well taken and not good public policy. As Governor of the State of Ohio, I worked to increase our share of highway funding from 79 cents to 87 cents in ISTEA to 90.5 cents in TEA-21. As Chairman of the National Governors' Association, I helped negotiate TEA-21, which provides some substantial support for highway construction and maintenance in this country. It gave us a predictable, reliable source of revenue to get the job done. That's why this proposal really doesn't make sense: it jeopardizes that funding. 
   If this Senate rejected the proposal earlier this year to reduce the gas tax by 4.3 cents, certainly we should reject any proposal that would reduce it by 18.4 cents. 
   One point I would like to make is that the real problem we have in this country is that we do not, as Senator BYRD pointed out, have an energy policy. That is the problem. Reducing this gas tax by 18.4 cents really is not going to do anything to correct that problem in the long-term, and it would take the attention of the Senate away from the real issue here, which is, this country does not have an energy policy. 
   I want to point out one other thing. Under this amendment, we would reduce the gas tax and make it up by using the general revenue fund, the surplus. If I am not mistaken, some of my colleagues would like to use that surplus for proposed tax reductions and some would like to increase spending on various programs. It has been the tradition in this country that people who use the highways pay for them through the gas tax and not with the general fund of the United States of America. It seems to me that those of my colleagues who propose to use the on-budget surplus for health care or for other things, including tax relief, would be offended by that. I think this amendment is bad public policy and I hope it will be defeated overwhelmingly. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, on June 30, the Senate passed S. 2553, the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, by a vote of 52-43. I voted against this measure because of my belief that it provides an unjustified increase in federal spending and employs a variety of gimmicks that are meant to hide the true size of its costs. 
   As my colleague from Texas, Senator GRAMM, recently pointed out, the fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS bill increases discretionary spending by more than 20  percent when compared to last year's bill. As it is, this is incredible growth in discretionary spending; however, to truly emphasize the enormity of this increase, my colleagues should consider that this growth in spending is roughly 10 times the current rate of inflation. 
   The bill hides this massive increase in discretionary spending by using a variety of gimmicks. First, it proposes to offset the new spending by making cuts in crucial mandatory programs, such as the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). After a number of colleagues and I expressed our concern over using these programs as spending offsets, Appropriations Committee Chairman STEVENS pledged his support to vitiate these cuts when the Labor-HHS bill is considered in Conference. While I commend Chairman STEVENS for his commitment to restoring these funds, it is my belief that the Appropriations Committee never should have tapped into these programs in the first place. It is my hope that the Conferees will, as they remove these offsets, look to decrease the overall level of discretionary spending in the bill rather than search for other sources. 
   Second, the bill moves up by 3 days the first Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment date of Fiscal Year 2001 so that it falls, instead, in Fiscal Year 2000. Although such a change sounds innocuous, the ramifications of this action are tremendous. 
   As my colleagues know, the start of the next fiscal year begins on October 1, 2000. By moving the first SSI payment date of the year a few days earlier, it will fall in the waning days of fiscal year 2000 and be paid for out of the fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus. The end result of this gimmick is that not only does it increase spending in FY 2000 by $2.4 billion, which is, by the way, money I would rather see go to debt reduction. But it also frees up another $2.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2001 for Congress to spend. 
   Finally, despite the fact that the bill increases discretionary spending by a whopping 20 percent, it still fails to prioritize and target resources towards those programs that are the responsibility of the federal government, such as fully funding our commitment under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The high cost of educating disabled students continues to place a heavy burden on our local school districts. If the federal government met its obligation to fund IDEA at the level it promised in 1975, local communities would have resources left over to fund their own education priorities. 
   Instead, this appropriations bill, while increasing funding for IDEA by $1.31 billion over last year's bill and by $984 million above President Clinton's request, does not make enough progress on IDEA. Before the federal government increases spending on new programs, it should be fully funding its promise to supply up to 40 percent of the cost of educating disabled children. 
   Mr. President, what Congress has done in this Labor-HHS bill proves that we must face facts: Congress is addicted to spending. We will use any gimmick, any trick, any scheme we can think of to spend money. Often, it is for things that we don't need, things that are not a federal responsibility or things that we cannot afford. 
   Instead of using cuts in mandatory programs and accounting shifts to pay for massive increases in discretionary programs, we need to prioritize our spending and make the hard choices when necessary. We have used budgetary shenanigans far too often to obfuscate the size of spending increases, and it is long past time for this practice to end. 
   It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that I felt compelled to vote against the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill, and I do not believe that I am alone in my concerns regarding this legislation. It is my sincere hope that when the conferees meet to put together the final version of this legislation, they will consider and address the items that I have mentioned. 
   Mr. President, I also would like to take this opportunity to voice my concern over the conference report to H.R. 4425, the Military Construction Appropriations bill, which the Senate approved on 
   June 30 by a voice vote. If it had been the subject of a roll call vote, I would have voted against final passage of this bill. 
   My concern with this legislation does not rest with the Military Construction portion of the conference report. Indeed, I voted for the bill when it originally came before the Senate in May. Rather, my concern lies with what was added to the bill since the time the Senate first passed it. 
   While in conference, the Military Construction Appropriations bill became the vehicle to which Fiscal Year 2000 emergency supplemental appropriations were attached. In times of true emergency, Mr. President, I believe that Congress has an obligation to ensure that supplemental funds are provided to cover unexpected expenses. That is why I have no objection to providing emergency funds for our operations in Kosovo and to those unfortunate Americans who have been the victims of natural disasters. 
   However, I do not believe that we should provide emergency funding for items that are not true emergencies in an effort to avoid budget rules. Unfortunately, that is precisely what H.R. 4425 does. This bill provides taxpayer dollars for such ``emergencies'' as the winter Olympic Games, a sea life center in Alaska and a new top-of-the-line Gulfstream jet aircraft for the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. 
   In recent years, we have seen remarkable growth in the use of emergency designations as a way to bypass the spending caps so that Congress can avoid making tough choices. Fiscal year 2000 is certainly no exception. In fact, we will be setting a new record for ``emergency'' spending in this fiscal year with a final tally of more than $40 billion. 
   I should also add, Mr. President, that H.R. 4425 speeds up government paydays and uses other accounting shifts to move nearly $12 billion of fiscal year 2001 spending into fiscal year 2000. Just as with the Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill, the conference committee used this gimmick in order to free up an additional $12 billion for Congress to spend in Fiscal Year 2001. 
   Mr. President, rather than devising new, more ingenious ways to avoid fiscal discipline, we should be endeavoring to restore honesty and integrity to the congressional budget process. As I have stated on previous occasions, if any American was to cook his or her books the way the federal government does, that individual no doubt would be sent to jail very quickly. We cannot continue to apply a double standard. We must live within our means, delineate responsibility between the state and local governments and the federal government and pay for those items accordingly, and for Heaven's sake, if we have any on-budget surplus funds, use those funds to pay down the National Debt. 
   I will continue to monitor the progress of the remaining appropriations bills, and I encourage my colleagues to work with me to make sure that we spend federal tax dollars wisely. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, before I speak on this amendment I sent to the desk, I would like to say just a couple of words in regard to the point of order the Senator from Texas has just made. 
   I was one of the Members of the Senate who worked with the Senator from Texas to place in the budget resolution certain points of order which we believed we needed to have to make sure spending did not increase more than what the budget resolution provided for. 
   His point of order is directed at exactly what we were concerned about. It is what I might refer to, in all due respect, as a gimmick. In considering the 2001 budget, money that was put into the FY 2001 budget is being moved back into the 2000 budget in order to make available $2.4 billion more than could be spent otherwise. 
   What does that mean? That means that when you shove the cost back into the year 2000, you are going to use $2.4 billion of the on-budget surplus that many of us recently voted to use to pay down the national debt. 
   When we put a budget resolution together, at least--I thought it meant something. One of the things that disturbed me last year was that, at the end of the game, we did all kinds of things to exceed what we had originally anticipated to spend. So here we are today, trying to do the same kind of thing we did at the end of last year. 
   I think this Senate should sustain the point of order; that we ought to live by the budget resolution we agreed to earlier this year, and that the committee should make the hard choices. 
   One of the things that was brought up is that in order to pay for many of the new increases in spending in new programs, mandatory programs were cut, mandatory programs that I think are fundamental. Things such as the social services block grant, things such as the CHIP program. I have been told they will be taken care of later on. 
   My belief is that if we have a budget resolution and we agree to spend a certain amount of money, we ought to live within that budget resolution. I hope we sustain the point of order. 
   Mr. President, few will dispute that each and every child in this Nation deserves to be able to obtain a quality education, a fact Congress recognized 25 years ago when it passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
   Since that time, IDEA has helped ensure that all students, regardless of their disability, are able to receive the educational services they need in order to attend their local school. 
   In my State of Ohio, IDEA has helped thousands of young men and women go beyond their disabilities and obtain a quality education.  
   Thanks to IDEA, Ohio students with debilitating problems like Cerebral Palsy and autism have been able to receive help in reading and writing from special education teachers. They can use programs like Dragon Dictate--a speech recognition program that can be used to control a word processor-- in order to help them better understand their school work. 
   Before IDEA, these children would have been virtually forgotten elements in our education system. With IDEA, these children are in school, they are learning and they are growing. And IDEA doesn't just help disabled students. Alexandra Shannon, a 16 year old student from Beavercreek, OH, believes that ``enhanced educational opportunities help everyone.'' In a meeting with one of my staff members just a few months ago, she told of her friend, Peter, who had learned to walk at school with the help of his schoolmates. The entire school was brought closer together by the experience that Alexandra called, the ``joy of the year.'' 
   However, even with all the success of IDEA across the Nation, the fact remains that the cost to implement this program is draining money from our schools and significantly impeding the ability of State and local educators to fund their own priorities--priorities that include some of the items my colleagues here in the Senate think should be funded at the Federal level. 
   The cost of serving a handicapped student is typically twice as much as the average amount spent per pupil, while in some school districts, the cost is higher still. Think of this. In Centerville, OH, Centerville High School superintendent, Frank DePalma estimates that in his school, special education services cost 4 to 5 times as much as do services for nonhandicapped students. He said:  
   Costs for services such as occupational therapy, speech therapy and physical therapy continue to skyrocket.  
   Indeed, the Cincinnati Post wrote in an editorial just 2 months ago that the city's public schools spend:  
   $40.3 million a year on disabilities education. That's nearly 11% of its $365 million budget.  
   That is 11 percent of their budget. 
   Many school districts recognize that students with disabilities require different, and often, expensive needs. They want to help their students, but they also need and want the financial help that the Federal Government has promised. 
   As many of my colleagues may recall, when IDEA was passed in 1975, Congress thought it was such a national priority, that it promised that the Federal Government would pay up to 40 percent of the cost of this program. 
   To date, the most that Washington has provided to our school districts under IDEA is 12.6 percent of the educational costs for each handicapped child; and that was in fiscal year 2000. 
   The remainder of the cost for IDEA still falls on State and local governments. 
   Because the Federal Government has not lived up to its commitment, IDEA amounts to a huge unfunded Federal mandate. When I was Governor of Ohio, I fought hard for passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in 1995 so that circumstances like this could be avoided in the future. 
   And just how large an unfunded mandate has IDEA become? 
   In fiscal year 2000, Congress allocated almost $5 billion for special education for school-age children. If we had funded IDEA at the 40 percent level that Congress had promised in 1975, we would have allocated $15.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 rather than $4.9 billion. 
   In essence, a $10.7 billion unfunded mandate was passed along to our State and local governments for IDEA. And that is on top of the 60 percent--or $23.3 billion--for which they are already responsible. So, for a federally created program, our State and local governments' ``share'' in this fiscal year will amount to $34 billion out of a total of $38.9 billion. 
   Indeed, Mr. R. Kirk Hamilton from Southwestern City School, Grove City, OH has written to me, stating that IDEA is:  
   an enormous, unfunded mandate which is so expensive and so cumbersome that the funds are not available to deliver needed services to children.  
   Mr. President, that is just wrong. 
   For all programs under IDEA, the President of the United States assumes an expenditure of $6.3 billion in fiscal year 2001. That is only a $332 million increase from the $6 billion level of funding in fiscal year 2000. 
   However, the President's fiscal year 2001 budget contained a whopping $40.1 billion in discretionary education spending. That is almost double the $21.1 billion in discretionary education spending allocated by the Federal Government just 10 years ago in fiscal year 1991, and nearly 5 times the $8.2 billion spent on discretionary education spending 25 years ago in 1976. Where is that money going? Think of that. Where is it going? 
   It is important to understand that the White House and some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very good at reading polls. They see that education is of high interest to the American people. 
   Even though the Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the funds for education in this country, the White House and these same colleagues consider themselves, sometimes, I think, to be members of a national school board. 
   They have other, new priorities that they believe Washington should fund instead of providing additional funding for the federally created IDEA--programs like school construction, afterschool programs, hiring more teachers, improving technology and training in schools, and creating community learning centers. They are all great ideas. 
   They are important initiatives, but they are the responsibility of our States and local communities. Of course, the politically expedient thing to do is to support funding for all these programs at the federal level; it makes us look as if we are ``for'' education. They are high in the polls. Nevertheless, I believe in the delineation of Federal and State responsibility, and increased funding for IDEA is a Federal responsibility. 
   It is one that we mandated on the school districts. It is part of our responsibility. We said we would pay for 40 percent of it. It is about time we paid for 40 percent of it, rather than going off on a lot of new initiatives. 
   During our debate on the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, I offered, and this body adopted, by a vote of 53-47, an amendment stating that before we fund new education programs, we should make funds available for IDEA. 
   The amendment that I am offering today makes good on the commitment we made in the budget resolution. 
   Specifically, my amendment would give local education agencies the flexibility to take $2.7 billion of Federal money under title VI of this appropriations bill and spend it on IDEA, if they choose. In other words, we are saying that school districts, if they choose, can use new money for IDEA. 
   If the Federal Government was fully funding IDEA, most of the education initiatives my colleagues are proposing--school construction, afterschool programs--could be and likely would be taken care of at the State and local level. That is how our State and local education leaders want it. 
   In February, with the help of the Ohio School Board Association and the Buckeye Association of School Administrators, I contacted Ohio teachers, superintendents, and educational leaders from urban, suburban, and rural districts in every part of Ohio to ask what they would prefer: a full Federal commitment to IDEA or new Federal funding initiatives. 
   More than 90 percent of the responses I received so far have shown that Ohio's education community leaders prefer a full commitment to IDEA over new programs. I am confident this same poll conducted in other States would produce a similar result. 
   Let me read a few responses I received. Mr. Philip Warner, Superintendent of Ravenna City School wrote:  
   I believe school districts would benefit the most if Congress met its obligations under IDEA, therefore allowing school districts to fund programs that would be specific in each school district.  
   David VanLeer, Director of Pupil Services, Euclid City Schools, right across the street from where I live:  
   Congress should honor that pledge to provide 40 percent of the cost of IDEA before any new programs are funded.  
   Doreen Binnie, speech language pathologist at Colombia local School District responded, ``Absolutely,'' to the  question of whether Congress should fund IDEA before new programs. 
   We must stop acting as if we are the Nation's school board, trying to fund every education program possible. The truth is, many of the programs that Members of Congress and the President want to enact should be funded at the State and local level. In my view, those programs would have a better chance of being funded if State and local governments didn't have to divert such a large percentage of their funds to pay for IDEA. The Federal Government has a commitment to IDEA and that commitment should be fully honored. I believe our State and local leaders should be given the flexibility they need to spend new Federal education dollars that are allocated under this bill to honor the commitment of IDEA. I appreciate the fact that the appropriations committee provided increased money for IDEA in this budget. 
   The fact is, we should say to our local school districts that with the $2.7 billion which is allocated in title VI one of the options we should give them is to fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, and I am pleased that my colleagues Senator BOB SMITH, Environment and Public Works Committee chairman and Senator MAX BAUCUS, ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee have joined as co-sponsors of this bill. 
   The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA2000) is the culmination of four hearings that the Committee on Environment and Public Works has held regarding a number of different water resources development issues and projects. The cornerstone of this year's WRDA bill will be the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, however, the bill that I am introducing today does not contain an Everglades Restoration Title. That title will be added as an amendment to this bill by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman BOB SMITH when the full Committee marks-up WRDA 2000 on Wednesday, June 28, 2000. 
   Some of my colleagues may question the need for a water resources bill this year since Congress passed a WRDA bill just last year. In reality, last year's bill was actually unfinished business from the 105th Congress, and if Congress is to get back on its two year cycle for passage of WRDA legislation, we need to act on a bill this year. The two year cycle is important to avoid long delays between the planning and execution of projects and to meet Federal commitments to state and local governments partners who share the costs of these projects with the Federal government. 
   While the two year authorization cycle is extremely important in maintaining efficient schedules for completion of water resources projects, efficient schedules also depend on adequate appropriations. The appropriation of funds for the Corps' program has not been adequate and, as a result, there is a backlog of over 500 projects that will cost the federal government $38 billion to complete. 
   I believe these are worthy projects with positive benefit-to-cost ratios and capable non-Federal sponsors. Nevertheless, the inability to provide adequate funding for these projects means that project construction schedules are spread out over a longer period of time, resulting in increased construction costs and delays in achieving project benefits. 
   Mr. President, I recognize that budget allocations and Corps appropriations are beyond the purview of the authorization package that I am introducing today, but I believe that the backlog issue should impact the way we approach WRDA2000 in three very important ways. 
   First, we need to control the mission creep of the Corps of Engineers. I am not convinced that there is a Corps role in water and sewage plant construction, and I am pleased to report that the bill that I am introducing today contains no authorizations for environmental infrastructure, such as wastewater treatment plants or combined  sewer overflow systems. Another example is the brownfields remediation authority proposed by the White House for the Corps. Brownfield remediation is a very important issue. It is a big problem in my state of Ohio and I am working to remove federal impediments to State cleanups. Having said that, I do not believe this is a mission 
   of the Corps of Engineers, and the bill that I am introducing today does not contain authority for the Corps to be involved in brownfields remediation. 
   We need to recognize and address the large unmet national needs within the traditional Corps mission areas: needs such as flood control, navigation and the emerging mission area of restoration of nationally significant environmental resources like the Florida Everglades. 
   The second thing that we need to do is to make sure that the projects Congress authorizes meet the highest standard of engineering, economic and environmental analysis. We must be sure that these projects and project modifications make maximum net contributions to economic development and environmental quality. 
   We can only assure that projects meet these high standards if projects have received adequate study and evaluation to establish project costs, benefits, and environmental impacts to an appropriate level of confidence. This means that a feasibility report must be completed before projects are authorized for construction. Thus, WRDA 2000 only contains projects which have completed feasibility reports. 
   Finally, we have to preserve the partnerships and cost sharing principles of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. WRDA '86 established the principle that water resources project should be accomplished in partnerships with states and local governments and that this partnership should involve significant financial participation by the non-federal sponsors. This bill contains no cost share changes. 
   My experience as Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio convinced me that the requirement for local funding to match federal dollars results in much better projects than where Federal funds are simply handed out. Whether it's parks, housing, highways, or water resources projects, the requirement for a local cost share provides a level of accountability that is essential to a quality project. Cost sharing principles must not be weakened, and I am pleased to report that they are not in this legislation. 
   Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today ensures that we only commit to those projects that are properly within the purview of the Corps of Engineers, it provides that each project meets the necessary criteria for federal involvement and it preserves the cost-sharing arrangement with state and local sponsors that has been in place for more than a decade. It is a responsible approach to meeting our nation's water resources needs, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance the goals of this legislation.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Jim Collins, editor of the Willoughby, Ohio, News-Herald newspaper on the occasion of his 50 years in journalism. 
   From an early age, Jim had newspaper ink flowing through his veins. By the time he was 12, he was working as a paper boy for the News-Herald, delivering the twice-weekly paper to homes all over town. It's hard to imagine today, but subscribers paid just six cents a week for the News-Herald back in 1941. 
   After graduating from Kent State University in 1950, Jim was hired as a full-time reporter for the News-Herald. He served in this capacity until 1952, when Jim answered the call of his government and served a two-year tour of duty in the Army.  
   When Jim returned to Willoughby, he resumed his duty as a reporter for the News-Herald until 1959. That year, the News-Herald's owners asked Jim to manage two other papers that they owned, the Parma News and the Brooklyn News. Jim became the one-person operation for both papers for 15 months whereupon he returned to the News-Herald. 
   By 1967, Jim had worked his way up to become editor of the newspaper. In fact, throughout his tenure with the News-Herald, Jim has held a variety of editorial positions including assistant editor, city editor, managing editor and executive editor. 
   All throughout his career, Jim has accumulated a number of well-deserved awards, including the Associated Press of Ohio's first place award for commentary in 1982, the first place award for column writing in 1991, and the first place award for editorial commentary just two years ago. Jim has also been named the 1987 Willoughby Chamber of Commerce's Distinguished Citizen of the Year and received the Lake Parks Foundation award in 1994. 
   I have always said that the measure of a person can be determined by the work he or she does individually, or through the organizations to which he or she belongs, that benefit others. Jim has given of himself to numerous organizations having served as the chairman of the West End-YMCA board of managers and president of the Lake County YMCA. He is also a member of the Willoughby Rotary Club, Willoughby School of Fine Arts, the Lake County Blue Coats, the Willoughby Jaycees and several area chambers of commerce. Jim is also the first person to become an honorary lifetime member of the Lake County Police Chiefs Association and is a member of the Cleveland Foundation Lake-Geauga Fund Committee. 
   Jim is a true man of integrity, and it is his integrity that has earned him the respect of journalists and politicians across the state. He can be brutally honest, but he is always fair and he is never afraid to tell the truth. It is his character that has allowed him to remain in journalism for five decades. 
   Throughout his years with the News-Herald, he has worked to put together one of the most competitive papers in northeastern Ohio. Jim provides his readers a broader level of reporting than most regional papers, paying attention not only to local news, but to state and national news as well. Because of his leadership, circulation has grown. In addition, Jim's initiative has allowed for the creation of a forum for candidates--in conjunction with Lakeland Community College--that makes available to the public where candidates stand on particular issues. 
   While some may think that 50 years in the newspaper business is enough for any person, Jim is not slowing down and is by no means even close to retiring. That's good news, because I would have a very hard time imagining the News-Herald without Jim. I have enjoyed working with Jim and I look forward to working with him for many more years to come. 
   Mr. President, Jim Collins has been a real friend to me in all the years that I have known him. He has been an inspiration to me and so many others throughout his life and his career. I congratulate him for his dedication to the citizens of Ohio and for his 50 years of accomplishments in journalism. He has much to be proud of, and I consider myself very lucky to know him. I wish him many more years of success. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, on June 6th, Senator DEWINE and I introduced legislation to help the Department of Defense move ahead towards addressing their future workforce needs. Our bill, the Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act of 2000, gives the Department of Defense the necessary flexibility to adequately manage its civilian workforce and align its human capital to meet the demands of the post-cold war environment. 
   The amendment that Senator DEWINE and I are offering today adds the modified language of our bill to this DOD authorization bill so that the U.S. military can more adequately prepare for tomorrow's challenges. 
   Mr. President, before I speak on the amendment itself, I would like to discuss the human capital crisis that is confronting the Federal Government. Since July of last year, the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, which I chair, has held six hearings on federal workforce issues. Some of the issues we have examined include management reform initiatives, Federal employee training needs and the effectiveness of employee incentive programs. 
   One point that I have emphasized at each of these hearings is that the employees of the Federal Government  should be treated as its most valued resource. In reality, Mr. President, Federal employees and human capital management have been long overlooked. 
   In fact, this past March, Comptroller General David Walker testified before the Oversight Subcommittee that the government's human capital management systems could earn the GAO's ``high-risk'' designation in January 2001. While there are several reasons why the Federal Government's human capital management is in such disarray, there are suggestions that an improper execution of government downsizing has played a larger role than has been previously recognized. 
   Walker stated that ``(GAO's) reviews have found, for example, that a lack of adequate strategic and workforce planning during the initial rounds of downsizing by some agencies may have affected their ability to achieve organizational missions. Some agencies reported that downsizing in general led to such negative effects as a loss of institutional memory and an increase in work backlogs. Although [GAO] found that an agency's planning for downsizing improved as their downsizing efforts continued, it is by no means clear that the current workforce is adequately balanced to properly execute agencies' missions today, nor that adequate plans are in place to ensure the appropriate balance in the future.'' 
   Furthermore, the Comptroller General testified that it appeared that many Federal agencies had cut back on training as they were downsizing; the very time they should have been expanding their training budgets and activities to better ensure that their remaining employees were able to effectively do their jobs. 
   While the problems associated with the downsizing of the last decade are becoming more apparent, the United States is faced with an even greater potential threat to the Government's human capital situation in this decade--massive numbers of retirements of Federal employees. By 2004, 32 percent of the Federal workforce will be eligible for regular retirement, and an additional 21 percent will be eligible for early retirement. That's a potential loss of over 900,000 experienced employees. 
   Mr. President, any other public- or private-sector manager who faced the loss of more than half of his or her workforce would recognize that immediate action was necessary to ensure the long-term viability of their business or organization. And over the next few years, the United States must seriously address this growing human capital crisis in the Federal Government workforce. It will not be easy--years of downsizing and hiring freezes have taken their toll, as will a pending retirement-exodus for ``baby boomer'' Federal employees. Add to that the lure of a strong private sector economy drawing more young workers away from government service, and the Federal Government will only find it harder to attract and retain the technology-savvy workforce that will be necessary to run the government in the 21st Century. 
   To meet this challenge, Senator DEWINE and I are offering this amendment that will help one critical department of our Federal Government--the Department of Defense--get a head start in addressing their future workforce needs. As I stated earlier, this amendment gives the Department of Defense the latitude it needs to manage its civilian workforce as well as re-shape its human capital for the 21st century. What the Defense Department is able to accomplish via this amendment may serve as a model for use throughout the government. 
   During the last decade, the Defense Department underwent a massive civilian workforce downsizing program that saw a cut of more than 280,000 positions. In addition, the Defense Department--like other Federal departments--was subject to hiring restrictions. Taken together, these two factors have inhibited the development of mid-level career, civilian professionals within the DOD. 
   The extent of this problem is exhibited in the fact that right now, the Department is seriously understaffed in certain key occupations, such as computer experts and foreign language specialists. The lack of such professionals has the potential to affect the Defense Department's ability to respond effectively and rapidly to threats to our national security. 
   Our amendment will assist the Department in shaping the ``skills mix'' of the current workforce in order to address shortfalls brought about by years of downsizing, and to meet the need for new skills in emerging technological and professional areas. In testimony before the Oversight Subcommittee, Comptroller General Walker recognized the need for such actions, noting that, ``(I)n cutting back on the hiring of new staff in order to reduce the number of their employees, agencies also reduced the 
   influx of new people with the new competencies needed to sustain excellence.'' 
   So what will workforce shaping mean to the Department of Defense? In the United States Air Force, workforce shaping will allow the Air Force research labs to meet changing requirements in their mission. For example, at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, they need fewer psychologists and more aerospace engineers; at Rome Air Force Base in Rome, New York, they need computer scientists rather than operations research analysts; and at Wright-Patterson Air Force Based in Dayton, Ohio, they need more materials engineers rather than physicists. 
   Also, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, there is a need to move from the mechanical/aeronautical engineering skills that their senior engineers possess to skills that are more focused on emerging technologies in electrical engineering, such as space operations, lasers, optics, advanced materials and directed energy fields. Changing the skills requirements at Wright-Patterson will help the Base meet their needs for the next 10 to 15 years.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, noting the objection, in discussing this amendment, I am going to proceed to give my statement and I will send my amendment to the desk following my remarks and the remarks of my colleagues. 
   Mr. President, when I first introduced S. 1144, the Surface Transportation Act, more than a year ago, I did so thinking that our State and local governments should have the maximum flexibility possible in implementing Federal transportation programs. 
   I still firmly believe that our State and local governments know best which transportation programs should go forward and at what level of priority. 
   As the only person in this country who has served as President of the National League of Cities and Chairman of the National Governors' Association, and one who has worked with the State and local government coalition, which we refer to as the Big 7, I have great faith in State and local governments, and I believe they should have maximum flexibility in determining how best to serve all of our constituents. 
   I think one of the best examples of how state and local governments work to benefit our constituents is what we have been able to do with the welfare system in this country when we let the States and local governments take it over. 
   That is why I am offering this amendment today--to give our State and local governments the flexibility they need to make some key transportation decisions that will best suit their needs. 
   The amendment I am offering will give States the ability to use their Federal surface transportation funds for passenger rail service, including high-speed rail service. 
   This amendment is identical to section 3 of S. 1144. It allows each State to use funds from their allocation under the National Highway System, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, and the Surface Transportation Program for the following: acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventative maintenance for intercity passenger-rail facilities as well as for rolling stock. 
   As my colleagues know, under current law, States cannot use their Federal highway funding for rail, even when it is the best transportation solution for their State or region. Since States are assuming a greater role in developing and maintaining passenger and commuter rail corridors, I think it makes sense that States be given the most flexibility to invest Federal funds in those rail corridors. 
   Part of being flexible is making sure we consider all of our options. It is similar to the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax repeal effort that we faced in the Senate this past April. High gasoline prices exposed that we have no national energy policy. With prices currently over $2 per gallon in several areas in the Midwest, the fact that we still have no national energy policy is now really being felt by the American public. 
   With the need for a national energy policy plainly evident, we need to put all our options on the table. We need to look at expanded rail transportation, conservation, exploration, alternative fuels, and so on. We need to put all of the right ingredients together that will make for a successful transportation policy. 
   In addition to the high gas prices, I think the Senate should recognize the fact that there is an appeal pending in the Supreme Court of the United States of America on the issue of the Environmental Protection Agency's new proposed ambient air standards for ozone and particulate matter. 
   If the Supreme Court overrules the lower court's decisions that those new standards are not justified, then we will find throughout the United States of America many communities, including communities in my State--where we have achieved the current national ambient air standards in every part of our State--that will be in nonattainment. If the new standards are implemented, we will need more tools to deal with the pollution. 
   With the need for a national energy policy plainly evident, we need to put all of our options on the table. We need to look at expanded rail transportation and conservation and all the rest. 
   As States are more able to turn towards passenger rail service as a safe, reliable, and efficient mode of transportation, we will relieve congestion on our Nation's highways. With fewer cars on the road, contributions to air quality improvements and lower gas consumption will be realized. 
   Again, the idea behind my amendment is simple. States understand their particular transportation challenges better than the Federal Government. I believe it is the States' right and obligation to use whatever tools are available to efficiently meet the transportation needs of their citizens. In this instance, the Federal Government should not stand in their way but work as a partner to give them the flexibility they need to develop a successful policy.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the things that is a little bit disturbing to me is that there is a feeling in the Senate that somehow Governors control their States: The Governors are going to do this; the Governors are going to do that. The Governors are unable to do anything unless they have the support and involvement of their State legislatures. 
   I was a Governor from a donor State and fought for ISTEA and TEA-21. When I came in, we were at 79 cents. We are up to 90 1/2 cents. I know how important money is for transportation. This is not an issue of Amtrak. I keep hearing Amtrak. I do not like Amtrak, and if we had the flexibility in my State, I am pretty sure we are not going to spend any money on rail. But I think the Governors should have an opportunity to have the flexibility to decide--with their legislatures--what is in the best interest of their people in dealing with their transportation problems. 
   There is one other issue that needs to be taken under consideration when talking about transportation, and that is the environmental policy of the United States. We are in a situation today where we have high gas prices. We are in a situation today where we need to put together an energy policy. Frankly speaking, rail ought to be part of the consideration in deciding that energy policy. 
   Some of the same people who are objecting to Governors having flexibility on rail supported welfare reform. I remember when we were down here lobbying for welfare reform. They said: If you give it to the Governors, it will be a race to the bottom. But, we got the job done. Some of the same people opposed to this are big advocates of giving Governors the opportunity to spend education dollars. That is what this is about. This is not about Amtrak. It is about flexibility. It is about States rights. It is about federalism. 
   The only reason I offered the amendment today is that I could not get a unanimous-consent agreement to bring up the bill, S. 1144, and it was stuck with a hold on it. With all due respect to the chairman, for whom I have the highest regard and understanding--and who was a cosponsor of this legislation, this issue of flexibility needs to be aired. We ought to have a vote on it. We ought to give the Governors the opportunity to have this flexibility. 
   To characterize the amendment as for rail or against--that is not the case. I am not here for that. I am here for flexibility for the Governors who have a big responsibility, and they ought to have an opportunity with their State legislatures to decide how they are going to spend this money. If they want to spend it on rail and debate it, fine. If they do not want it, let them decide that.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, my colleague from the State of Colorado did a very good job outlining for us how important it is that we address our national debt. There is a euphoria in America today over the fact that we have a tremendous surplus. Unfortunately, the fact that we have a surplus reminds me of a Dean Martin song that went something like ``Money burns a hole in my pocket.'' Everyone is trying  to figure out how to spend this money. No one seems to be making an issue of the fact that today we have a $5.7 trillion national debt which is costing Americans approximately $600 million a day in interest. 
   Most Americans do not understand that 13 cents out of every Federal dollar we spend goes to pay interest. National defense gets 16 cents per dollar. Nondefense discretionary spending is 18 cents per dollar. They do not understand that we are spending more money on interest each year than we spend on Medicare, five times as much on interest as we do for education, and 15 times more than we spend on medical research. 
   This debt was racked up over a number of years. At a time when our economy is better than it has ever been before, when unemployment is at the lowest we have seen in anyone's memory, we should do like you, Mr. President, would do in your family and I would do in my family, or what a business person would do, and that is, in times of plenty, get rid of debt, get out from under debt. 
   We have an excellent opportunity to do that. Because of the expanding economy, we have a $26 billion on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. Think of that, $26 billion. We already allocated $14 billion of that on-budget surplus when we passed the budget resolution to deal with what I consider to be, for the most part, emergency situations. 
   In order to guarantee we do not spend the rest of that money, we need to stand up and be counted and pay more than lipservice to reducing our national debt. We need to pass legislation that says the remaining on-budget surplus, this $12.2 billion, is to be used to pay down the national debt. It is something that all of us should think about as being a moral responsibility. 
   One of the reasons I came to the Senate, was the fact that I believed we had spent money over the years on many things that, while important, we were unwilling to pay for, or, in the alternative, do without. We had a policy of ``let the next guy worry about it''; ``let the next generation worry about it.'' 
   When I came to the Senate, I had one grandchild. Today, I have two more. Like all other Americans, I think about my grandchildren and about the legacy I want to leave to them. I remember a long time ago, almost 38 years ago, when my wife Janet and I got married. At that time, only 6 cents out of every dollar was going to pay interest on our debt. Think of it. Today it has gone up over 100 percent. 
   I think about the legacy we are leaving our children, and Congress, during this wonderful time of a great economy, with a low unemployment rate, should take advantage of this opportunity to take our on-budget surplus and pay down our national debt and get this burden off the backs of the young people in our country; off the backs of our children and off the backs of our grandchildren. 
   The other thing we need to point out to the American people is something we have kept kind of a secret. It is a secret about which nobody is talking; it has been kept quiet, and that secret is we have been spending money like drunken sailors. 
   In fiscal year 1998, we spent $555 billion on discretionary spending. That is before I came to the Senate. In fiscal year 1999 we increased spending to $575 billion. 
   In this year's budget, if we spend the entire on-budget surplus, discretionary spending will be $624 billion. Think about it, $624 billion, compared to last year's $575 billion. If my figures are correct, that is an 8.5-percent increase in discretionary spending. 
   I want to know how many people in this country had an 8.5-percent increase in their paycheck last year. Why is it that the Federal Government is different than most of the families in this Nation? Families should understand, the citizens of this country should understand, if we spend all of this money--and it looks like we could--and if we do not adopt this amendment that we are suggesting be adopted today, we will have increased spending by 8.5 percent. 
   It is time for this Congress to be willing to make tough decisions. The cynicism that I hear so often is: We need the money to get out of town. 
   We need to talk about our kids. We need to talk about this national debt. We need to talk about the moral responsibility that we have to America's families. 
   We are not asking for a lot here today. We are asking that this body stand up and be counted. I hear people every day talking about: Let's do something about the national debt. It is a problem. We should do it. 
   Reducing the national debt has been a principle of my party. It has been a principle of mine throughout my political career. First of all, don't go into debt. If you are in debt, get rid of it. 
   Here is a chance to stand up and put our actions where our mouths are, and say, yes, we do believe in reducing the national debt. We are going to take this money, put it aside, and pay down the national debt, and we are going to do it now. We are going to do it now because we know if we do not do it now, the temptation will be to spend every dime of it. 
   One other thing we ought to remember; and that is, in July CBO will be coming back with some new numbers and the on-budget surplus will be even higher, perhaps maybe $20 billion, $25 billion more. The question is, What are we going to do with that on-budget surplus? Are we going to keep that around so we can get out of town? 
   It is time to make the tough decisions. It is time to stand up and be counted. 
   I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with Senator REID to be recognized to offer his amendment regarding computers, and following debate on the Reid amendment, Senator BOXER will be recognized to offer an amendment regarding medical privacy. 
   As a reminder, the Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 for the weekly  party conference meetings. Upon reconvening, there will be 2 minutes of debate on the Boxer amendment regarding pesticides, with a vote scheduled to occur at approximately 2:20 p.m. It is hoped that consideration of the Defense appropriations bill can be completed by this evening, and therefore Senators can expect votes throughout the afternoon. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator ALLARD, in offering this amendment. It is an important amendment if we are ever going to make a dent in our tremendous national debt. 
   Like all of my colleagues, I am thrilled that the United States is in the midst of the greatest economic expansion in the history of our nation. It has provided opportunity and prosperity for millions of Americans. 
   However, even with all of our good fortune, we cannot ignore the tremendous debt that we owe, and we certainly cannot allow the booming economy to blind us to this reality. 
   For nearly a year and a half now, Mr. President--throughout my service in this body--I have made it my mission to remind my colleagues of the size of our national debt. Right now, the debt of the United States of America stands at $5.7 trillion. Right now, it costs us more than $224 billion a year to service that debt--which is more than $600 million a day in interest costs alone. 
   Thirteen cents out of every Federal dollar goes to pay interest on the national debt, at a time when 16 cents goes for national defense, 18 cents goes for nondefense discretionary spending and 53 cents goes for entitlement spending. We currently spend more on interest to the national debt than we spend on Medicare. 
   I agree with General Accounting Office (GAO) Comptroller General David Walker, who, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee last year, said:  
   This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal wave.  
   That is a wonderful quote. 
   We should also listen to other experts, such as CBO Director Dan Crippen, who, earlier this year, testified before the Senate Budget Committee that ``most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying down the debt held by the public, is probably  the best thing that we can do relative to the economy.'' 
   And then there is Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has testified that ``my first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.'' 
   Logic dictates that the money we are spending for our debt interest payments could be better spent elsewhere, and in my view--as well as the experts' view--the sooner we can pay down that debt, the sooner we will be able to use tax dollars where they are most needed. 
   In other words, if we pay down the debt and get rid of the interest, we can use that money to reduce taxes or to address some of the priorities that we continue to talk about every day on the floor of the Senate. 
   That is why I believe our top fiscal priority should be reducing the national debt. It is the best thing we could do with our on-budget surplus. And as I have said a number of times on the Senate floor, if families and businesses use their surplus cash to pay off debts, then our Nation should do the same thing. 
   If I have big credit card debt, or if I am in business and I owe debt, and I have an opportunity to pay off that debt, most families and most businesses would do so. 
   It is also interesting to note that if you look at the companies today on the New York stock exchange, the ones whose values have held up are those companies that do not have a substantial amount of debt. I think we know that if families in America were in the same position we are in, they would pay off that debt and get rid of that interest cost. 
   The amendment that Senator ALLARD and I propose would take the first step in putting us on a course of fiscal responsibility. 
   According to the latest estimates put forth by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States is projected to achieve an on-budget surplus of $26 billion in fiscal year 2000. 
   We are talking about fiscal year 2000 money. For my colleagues who want to cut taxes, we are talking about the on-budget surplus for the year 2000. We can't use it to reduce taxes. The only thing we can do with it is to spend it or use it to pay down the debt. There is no other alternative. We have already set aside $14 billion in the budget resolution to pay for military operations in Kosovo, natural disaster relief in the U.S., Colombian drug eradication assistance, and other supplemental spending. 
   Under the Allard-Voinovich amendment, the remaining $12 billion on-budget surplus would be applied towards debt reduction, not more spending. In addition, when the CBO releases its re-estimates of the FY 2000 on-budget surplus in July, Senator ALLARD and I intend to offer another amendment that will allocate any additional on-budget surpluses to debt reduction. 
   I remind my colleagues that this money can't be used to reduce taxes. It can only be spent. We want to get it off the table before it is spent. 
   Of the $26 billion on-budget surplus that we have today, $22 billion of that is overpayment into Part A of Medicare. This extra money we have is Medicare money that has been paid into Part A. 
   The concern that I have is if we don't pay down the national debt with whatever on-budget surplus we achieve, Washington will spend the money. 
   Ever since the CBO first projected we would have a budget surplus back in 1998, Congress and the administration have looked for every possible way to spend the money. 
   I remind my colleagues, if you include the supplemental appropriations, fiscal year 2000 discretionary spending will increase by $37 billion, a 6.4 percent increase over fiscal year 1999. When compared to the Consumer Price Index, that is nearly three times the rate of inflation. This is tremendous growth in Government spending. We have to stop it. We have to put a lid on our spending. 
   Our amendment strikes a fair balance that allows us to use a portion of the on-budget surplus for debt reduction instead of just spending the entire on-budget surplus for the sake of spending. We have to show discipline and use our on-budget surplus to pay down our debts. 
   I am proud we have worked in the last couple of years in the Senate to rein in spending. I believe we must use whatever on-budget surplus that we have to pay down the debt. When we reduce the national debt, we send a positive signal to Wall Street and Main Street. Lowering the debt encourages more savings and investment, the kind that fuels productivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest rates, which is a real tax reduction. In addition, it ensures we won't return to deficit spending. 
   If we can't at this time with the economy booming do something about reducing the national debt, we will have missed a golden opportunity. We will have said to the young people of this country: We don't care about your future; we are going to let you pay for those things that we weren't willing to pay for or do without during the last number of years.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, according to the latest estimates put forth by the Congressional Budget Office, the United States is projected to achieve an on-budget surplus of $26 billion in fiscal year 2000, the current fiscal year. What many Americans do not realize is that Medicare Part A, that portion of every person's paycheck that is deducted for hospital insurance, is the largest component of our Nation's on-budget surplus. It accounts for approximately $22 billion of the $26 billion fiscal year 2000 surplus. Of the on-budget surplus of $26 billion, $22 billion is actually money that has been paid into Medicare that is not being used for Medicare recipients today. It is overpayment. 
   Of that $26 billion on-budget surplus, the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution assumed that $14 billion of that on-budget surplus would be used to pay for military operations in Kosovo, natural disaster relief in the United States, Colombian drug eradication assistance, and other supplemental spending. Fourteen billion of the $26 billion has been spoken for, and for all intents and purposes, it is off the table. It is gone. 
   That leaves approximately $12 billion in on-budget surplus dollars available and unallocated--quite a tempting target. 
   If we don't use this $12 billion to pay down the national debt, I am concerned Congress will just spend the money. However, there is another option. In the very near future, Senator ALLARD and I and several of our other colleagues will propose an amendment that will direct the remaining $12 billion to be used for debt reduction instead of allowing it to be squandered on additional spending. We have given a lot of lipservice to being in favor of reducing the national debt. We have heard it in the House and the Senate. This will be a wonderful opportunity for everybody to vote to put $12 billion of the on-budget surplus into debt reduction. 
   In addition, once the CBO releases its revised baseline this summer, we will come back again and propose another amendment that will allocate whatever additional fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus dollars are achieved towards debt reduction. We know in July we will have new numbers so there will be more money. At that time, we will come back and say: Let us use that additional money to pay down the debt. 
   Ever since the Congressional Budget Office first projected we would have a budget surplus back in 1998, Congress and the administration have been falling all over themselves to spend our on-budget surplus dollars. Indeed, if we include the supplemental appropriations, fiscal year 2000 discretionary  spending will increase $37 billion, or 6.4 percent, over fiscal year 1999. Again, when we use the $14 billion of the on-budget surplus and add it to what we have already allocated for 2000, we are now talking about a 6.4-percent increase in 
   spending in the year 2000 over 1999. That is tremendous growth in Government spending. 
   On another note, we hear that Vice President GORE now supports a Medicare lockbox, a lockbox similar to the one we created. 
   As I stated earlier, Medicare Part A is the largest component of our Nation's on-budget surplus, accounting for approximately $22 billion. Because of our strong economy and high employment, more money has come into the Medicare program via the payroll tax than has been spent in benefits. Again, we are either going to spend those on-budget surplus dollars on unrelated Government spending, or we can use it to reduce the national debt. 
   Last November, Senator ASHCROFT introduced the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Act to wall off both the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust fund surpluses; in essence, to put them in a lockbox so the only other purpose for which they could be used would be to pay down the national debt. That is what we were going to do with it. The Senate had a chance this year to vote on a Medicare lockbox on April 7, when Senators ASHCROFT, BROWNBACK, GRAMS, and I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. Unfortunately, Senator ASHCROFT had only 2 minutes to speak on the subject. I didn't get a chance to speak on it at all because no one was very interested at that time. 
   I remind my colleagues, the vote on the Medicare lockbox amendment was opposed by 43 Members of this Senate on the opposite side of the aisle; that is, 43 Democratic Members of the Senate voted ``no'' on the Medicare lockbox amendment. I thought the Medicare lockbox was a good idea then; I think it is still a good idea. Now, apparently, the Vice President thinks it is a good idea. 
   We need to lockbox Medicare to make sure that the excess money paid into Medicare Part A goes for debt reduction and is not going to be used for more spending or tax cuts. We need to use it for debt reduction, period, just as all the experts have said. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Daniel Crippen, head of CBO; David Walker, head of the GAO--all have said we should take the on-budget surplus and use it to pay down debt. I am pleased the Vice President is on board with a Medicare lockbox. I hope he will be able to convince Senators on the other side of the aisle that we need to make sure the on-budget surplus funds coming into the Treasury, which are mostly Medicare Part A dollars, are used to pay down the debt. 
   If my colleagues on the other side agree with the Vice President that we need to lockbox the Medicare surplus, which comprises $22 billion of the on-budget surplus, then they should have no problem supporting using $12 billion to pay down the debt. 
   We are going to have an opportunity twice this year--once perhaps this week on the Defense appropriations bill--to use the remaining on-budget surplus to reduce the national debt or to pay for more spending. I think it will be one of the best budget votes my colleagues will have all year long. Not only will it keep down spending, it will help bring down our publicly held debt. We have to make sure we make the right decisions in terms of our on-budget surplus. 
   I would like to also take advantage of this opportunity to quote the Vice President. This quotation was in the Washington Post:  
   The temptation has always been to treat Medicare the way Social Security used to be treated--as a source of money for spending or tax cuts. And now that we have succeeded in taking Social Security off budget and using it to pay down the debt, we need to do the same thing with Medicare and put it in a lockbox.  
   I remind my colleagues that when the issue of the Social Security lockbox came up on the floor of the Senate, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, on six occasions, all 45 of them voted against--voted against--the Social Security lockbox. My feeling is that we will find out this year whether or not the administration is in favor of lockboxing Social Security and lockboxing Medicare. 
   I think it is time we level with the American people and let them know that the on-budget surplus we have been talking about is primarily made up of overpayment of Medicare Part A payroll taxes, and that what we have been doing is proposing to use that for more spending or for reducing taxes. Let's lock it up. Let's put it in a lockbox. Let's make sure that the money that is being paid into Medicare is money for insurance for the elderly and is not used for tax reductions or, in the alternative, used to pay for other Federal spending. Now is the time to make that point. Now is the time to be counted. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators DEWINE, THOMPSON, FRIST, THURMOND, MURKOWSKI, BINGAMAN, REID, BRYAN, KENNEDY, HARKIN, and MURRAY in support of an important amendment that will provide financial and medical compensation to Department of Energy workers who have been made ill while working to provide for the defense of the United States. 
   Since the end of World War II, at facilities all across America, tens of thousands of dedicated men and women in our civilian federal workforce helped keep our military fully supplied and our nation fully prepared to face any threat from our adversaries around the world. The success of these workers in meeting this challenge is measured in part with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
   However, for many of these workers, their success came at a high price. They sacrificed their health, and even their lives--in many instances without knowing the risks they were facing--to preserve our liberty. I believe these men and women have paid a high price for our freedom, and in their time of need, this nation has a moral obligation to provide some financial and medical assistance to these Cold War veterans. 
   Last month, I introduced legislation, along with many of the Senators who have co-sponsored this amendment, that would provide financial compensation to Department of Energy workers whose impaired health has been caused  by exposure to beryllium, radiation or other hazardous substances. Our bill, S..2519, the ``Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of 2000,'' also provides that compensation be paid to survivors of workers who have died and suffered from an illness resulting from exposure to these substances. 
   Need for this type of legislation was further solidified when on May 25th, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson released a Department of Energy report on safety and management practices at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio. The report, which was based on an independent investigation authorized by Secretary Richardson, highlighted unsafe conditions at Piketon and deemed past management practices as shoddy and in many cases, inadequate to protect the health and safety of Piketon's workforce. The report confirmed many of the fears that these workers have quietly faced for years, and it is why it is imperative that we pass legislation this year that will compensate these cold war heroes. 
   Mr. President, the amendment that is being offered today by my distinguished colleague Senator THOMPSON is similar to S..2519 except for minor differences. 
   Under S..2519, a federal program is created for all workers who are due compensation because of an illness suffered due to the nature of a person's job. This amendment creates a federal program for workers suffering from beryllium disease, silicosis and cancer due to radiation exposure. Workers suffering from illnesses due to other chemical exposures would be covered under state workers compensation programs. The Department of Energy's Office of Workers' Compensation Advocate--created by this amendment--will help employees apply for compensation with their particular state's worker compensation program. 
   In addition, S..219 allows a broad burden of proof to be placed on the government, one that provides a greater number of Department of Energy workers who have cancer related to radiation exposure to receive federal compensation benefits. This amendment maintains that burden of proof for workers at the nation's three Gaseous Diffusion Plants, but, the amendment assumes that other workers will be able to find records showing whether or not their federal service made them sick. If it is not possible for the Department to find an employee's records, or, adequately estimate dose history, then the burden of proof threshold established for workers at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants will apply to that particular employee. 
   Some of my colleagues may question whether or not the Federal Government should be making an expenditure of this amount of money. Some may ask how we will know which worker or family member has a bona fide claim for compensation. These are legitimate concerns. However, the nature of the illnesses involved suggests more than a coincidental relationship with their victims. 
   For example, beryllium disease is a ``fingerprint'' disease. That means it is particularly identifiable and cannot be mistaken for any other disease, leaving no doubt as to what caused the illness of the sufferer. Additionally, the processing of the beryllium metals that cause Chronic Beryllium Disease is singularly unique to our nuclear weapons facilities. 
   In cases of radiation exposure at DoE facilities, it is understandable that some may question whether a person was exposed to radioactive materials from another source, primarily because records may not reflect that an employee was exposed to such materials. The Department of Energy's independent investigation at Portsmouth showed that, in some cases, the destruction and alteration of DoE workers' records occurred. There have been anecdotes indicating similar occurrences at other DoE facilities around the nation. 
   Additionally, dosimeter badges, which record radiation exposure, were not always required to be worn by DoE workers. And when they were required, they were not always worn properly or consistently. Workers at the Piketon plant also have stated that plant management not only did not keep adequate dosimetry records, in some cases, they chanted the dosimetry records to show lower levels of radiation exposure. There have been reports that DoE plant management would even change dosimeter badges to read ``zero''--which means the level of exposure to radiation would be officially recorded as zero, regardless of the exposure level that actually registered on the badge. 
   In too many instances, records do not exist, and where they do exist, there is adequate reason to doubt their accuracy. The amendment recognizes that this is the case at the Department of Energy's three Gaseous Diffusion Plants--Piketon, Ohio, Paducah, Kentucky and Oak Ridge, Tennessee--and takes the unusual step of placing the burden of proof on the government to prove that an employee's illness was not caused by workplace hazards. 
   This amendment allows for sound science where it is available, specifically, if it is possible to adequately and accurately estimate radiation doses, and scientifically assure that a worker's cancer is work-related or not. However, if it is not reasonably possible to adequately and accurately reconstruct doses, then ill workers covered under this amendment would be eligible for compensation that is based on criteria that exists for workers at our nation's Gaseous Diffusion Plants. 
   To be clear, Mr. President, under normal circumstances, I am not one who would advocate a ``guilty until proven innocent'' approach. I firmly believe that we should use sound science to determine exposure levels and relationship to illness. Yet, these are not normal circumstances, and the reason we are offering this amendment today is because in too many instances, sound science either does not exist in DoE facility records, or it cannot be relied upon for accuracy. 
   For example, in my own state of Ohio, at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant--a plant that processes high-quality nuclear material--workers had little or no idea that they had been exposed to dangerous levels of radioactive material. As the Department of Energy's own independent investigation has shown, such exposure went on for decades. 
   The independent investigation at Portsmouth, also demonstrated that until recently, proper safety precautions at Piketon were rarely taken to adequately protect workers' safety. Even when precautions were taken, the use of protective standards was inconsistent and in some instances were deemed only ``moderately effective.'' 
   If consistent, reliable and factual data is not available, Mr. President, then it will be quite difficult if not impossible to utilize sound science in order for employees to prove their claims. 
   Similar situations like those that have been documented at Piketon have been reported at other Ohio facilities including the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio and the Mound Facility in Miamisburg, Ohio, not to mention a host of other facilities nationwide. At this time, the Department of Energy is only acknowledging these situations at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant. 
   In addition to shoddy or non-existent record keeping, the DoE has admitted that at some facilities, workers were not told the nature of the substances they were handling. They weren't told about the ramifications that these materials may have on their future health and quality of life. It is truly unconscionable that DoE managers and other individuals in positions of responsibility could be so insensitive and uncaring. 
   Last year, the Toledo Blade published an award-winning series of articles outlining the plight of workers suffering from Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD). While government standards were met in protecting the workers from exposure to beryllium dust, many workers still were diagnosed with CBD. Were the standards too low? Was the protective equipment faulty? Whatever the cause, it is estimated that 1,200 people across the nation have contracted CBD, and hundreds have died from it, making CBD the number-one disease directly caused by our cold war effort. 
   Mr. President, there may be some who think that this amendment costs too much, so we shouldn't do it. I strongly disagree. 
   Congress appropriates billions of dollars annually on things that are not  the responsibility of the federal government--and I have voted against most of the bills that include this kind of funding. Here we have a clear instance where the actions of the federal government is responsible for the actions it has taken and the negligence it has shown against its own people. Peoples' health has been compromised and lives have been lost. In many instances, these workers didn't even know that their health and safety were in jeopardy. It is not only a responsibility of this government to provide for these individuals, it is a moral obligation. 
   My belief that we have a moral obligation to these people was strengthened last October when I attended a public meeting of workers from the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. I learned an incredible amount about the integrity of the hard-working men and women and what they have been through. 
   I heard heart-wrenching stories from people like Ms. Anita George, a 23 year employee at Piketon who testified that ``I only know of one woman that works in my department that has not had a hysterectomy and other reproductive problems.'' Ms. George described a situation where she and two of her colleagues were exposed to an ``outgassing'' on a ``routine'' decontamination job. 
   After the exposure, the women started to experience health problems, including heavy bleeding, elevated white blood cell counts and kidney infections. Plant physicians told them that they should ``just lie down and rest'' if they had any problems while they were working. Three years after the exposure, all three women had had hysterectomies. The plant denied their workers' compensation claims. 
   I also heard from people like Mr. Jeff Walburn, another 23-year plant employee and former councilman and vice mayor of the city of Portsmouth, who testified that while working in one of the buildings, he became so sick that his lungs ``granulated.'' When he went to the infirmary, they said he was ``okay for work.'' Later that day, he went to the hospital because in his words, ``my face was peeling off.'' According to Mr. Walburn, he couldn't speak, his hair started falling out, his lungs started ``coming out'' and his bowels failed to function for more than 6 days. When he went to get his records to file his worker's compensation claim, he was told that his diagnosis had been ``changed, been altered.'' 
   The Department of Energy has held similar public meetings at facilities across the nation--these stories are not unique to the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. 
   Mr. President, it is unfortunate that this amendment is necessary in the first place; the compensation it will provide is little consolation for the pain, health problems and diminished quality of life that these individuals have suffered. These men and women won the cold war. Now, they simply ask that their government acknowledge that they were made ill in the course of doing their job and recognize that the government must take care of them. 
   Until recently, the only way many of these employees believed they would ever receive proper restitution for what the government has done to them is to file a lawsuit against the Department of Energy or its contractors. But, in the time that I have been involved in this issue in the Senate, the Department of Energy has come a long way from its decades-long stance of stonewalling and denial of responsibility. Today, they admit that they have wronged our cold war heroes. Still, we must do more. 
   I believe that all those who have served our nation fighting the cold war have a right to know if the federal government was responsible for causing them illness or harm, and if so, to provide them the care and compensation that they need and deserve. That is the purpose of our amendment, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues in support of its acceptance in this bill.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. I rise today to support the amendment offered by my distinguished colleagues, Senator MCCAIN and Senator LEVIN. 
   Between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001, defense spending in our Nation will increase by more than 6 percent, nearly three times the rate of inflation. Under normal circumstances, I would likely oppose legislation that would increase defense spending at such a rate. However, we have a crisis in the military right now with respect to readiness, recruitment, retention, procurement, modernization; and the crisis must be met immediately. I will support more money for defense. 
   Having said that, I believe in the long term the Defense Department must focus on those activities that will help bring down their overall costs. Part of the problem we run into in this body is our inability to admit that priorities can and should be established by the Department of Defense. We need to focus on ways in which the Department can cut back on some of its expenditures and use the moneys allocated more wisely. In other words, we need to get a bigger bang for our buck. We need to work harder and smarter, and we need to do more with less. 
   One of the ways we can do that is to eliminate those military facilities that no longer serve a useful purpose. I know that is not easy. We have experienced the pain of closing bases in Ohio with the closure of Newark Air Force Base, Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, and the Defense Electronic Supply Center. Even with the closures and the pain we went through, we understood that it was necessary if we were going to allocate resources where they were really needed in the Department of Defense. 
   According to a 1998 Department of Defense report, and as stated by Secretary of Defense William Cohen, our Armed Forces currently have 23 percent more military base capacity than is needed in this Nation. Think of that, 23 percent. Keeping this much extra capacity adds up. Right now, we spend billions of dollars annually. We will keep on spending that money until we  acknowledge that we have excess capacity and exercise the will to shut it down. 
   As difficult as this may sound, we have been through this process before. We know that. The Department of Defense reports that because of the base closings that have been conducted, we will have saved $14 billion a year by the end of 2001. The projected net savings, annual savings, for the first four rounds have been estimated at nearly $5.7 billion in fiscal year 2001, a savings that should occur annually. We have that money, and it has been reallocated. 
   This amendment initiates another two rounds of base closings in 2003 and 2005. In his testimony earlier this year before the Armed Services Committee, Secretary Cohen stated that if we initiate two more rounds of base closings, this will save about $3 billion per year that we can use for some of the needs we have today in our Defense Department. 
   I am here today to urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think there are those who say we ought not to do it at this time. I think we all know that if we don't get started now and start the procedure and do it today, do it this year, we are not going to be able to move forward in 2003 and 2005 when we project the base closings will occur. 
   I say again, I know this is a tough amendment to support for some of my colleagues, but for the good of our Nation I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Federal Government is facing a little-known, yet serious problem that jeopardizes its ability to provide services to the American people--a crisis in human capital. The federal workforce has endured years of downsizing, hiring freezes, and inadequate investment in the dedicated men and women who comprise the federal civil service. As a result, the Federal Government is ill-equipped to compete with the private sector for a new generation of technology-savvy workers to replace the nearly 900,000 ``baby boomers'' who will be eligible for retirement from the civil service in the next 5 years. 
   To meet that challenge, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator MIKE DEWINE, that will help one critical department of our Federal Government--the Department of Defense--get a head start in addressing its future workforce needs. Our bill, the ``Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act of 2000,'' provides the Department of Defense with greater flexibility to adequately manage its civilian workforce and align its human capital to meet the demands of the post-cold-war environment. 
   During the last decade, the Department of Defense underwent a massive civilian workforce downsizing program that saw a cut of more than 280,000 positions. In addition, the Defense Department--like other federal departments--was subject to hiring restrictions. Taken together, these two factors have inhibited the development of mid-level career, civilian professionals; the men and women who serve a vital role in the management and development of our nation's military. The extent of this problem is exhibited in the fact that right now, the Department is seriously understaffed in certain key occupations, such as computer experts and foreign language specialists. The lack of such professionals has the potential to affect the Defense Department's ability to respond effectively and rapidly to military threats to our nation. 
   The need to address the pending human capital crisis in the federal workforce is increasingly apparent, as more and more leaders acknowledge that our past policies did not consider future federal workforce needs. Indeed, in testimony before the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, which I chair, the head of the General Accounting Office, Comptroller General David Walker, stated, ``(I)n cutting back on the hiring of new staff in order to reduce the number of their employees, agencies also reduced the influx of new people with the new competencies needed to sustain excellence.'' 
   The bill that Senator DEWINE and I are introducing today will help respond to these concerns by giving the Department of Defense the assistance it needs to shape the ``skills mix'' of the current workforce in order to address shortfalls brought about by years of downsizing. Our bill will also help the Department meet its needs for new skills in emerging technological and professional areas. 
   Another area of concern for the Department of Defense--as well as many other federal agencies--is the serious demographic challenges that exist in its workforce. The average Defense Department employee is 45 years old, and more than a third of the Department's workforce is age 51 or older. In the Department of the Air Force, for example, 45 percent of the workforce will be eligible for either regular retirement or early retirement by 2005. 
   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH, is an excellent example of the demographic challenge facing military installations across the country. Wright-Patterson is the headquarters of the Air Force Materiel Command, and employs 22,700 civilian federal workers. By 2005, 60 percent of the Base's civilian workforce will be eligible for either regular retirement or early retirement. Although a mass exodus of all retirement-eligible employees is not anticipated, there is a genuine concern that a significant portion of the Wright-Patterson civilian workforce, including hundreds of key leaders and employees with crucial expertise, could decide to retire, leaving the remaining workforce without experienced leadership and absent essential institutional knowledge. 
   This combination of factors poses a serious challenge to the long-term effectiveness of the civilian component of the Defense Department, and by implication, the national security of the United States. 
   Military base leaders, and indeed the entire Defense establishment, need to be given the flexibility to hire new employees so they can begin to develop another generation of civilian leaders and employees who will be able to provide critical support to our men and women in uniform. 
   That is the purpose of the legislation we are introducing today. The Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act addresses the current imbalance between the federal workforce and the skills needed to run the Federal Government in the 21st century, as well as the age imbalance between new employees and the potential mass retirement of senior public employees in the next 5 years. If we wait for this ``retirement bubble'' to burst before we begin to hire new employees, then not only will we be woefully understaffed in a number of key areas, but we will have fewer seasoned individuals left in the federal workforce who can provide training and mentoring. 
   The provisions in our bill will allow the Defense Department to conduct a smoother transition by bringing new employees into the Department over  the next 5 years. The new employees will have the opportunity to work with and learn from their more experienced colleagues, and invaluable institutional knowledge will be passed along. 
   While this proposal does not address all of the human capital needs of the Defense Department, it will help ensure that the Department of Defense recruits and retains a quality civilian workforce so that our Armed Forces may remain the best in the world. It is extremely important to the future vitality of the Department's civilian workforce and the national security of the United States that we address the human capital crisis while we have the opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in full in the RECORD.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this Sunday, May 28th, the Catholic diocese of Cleveland will observe the 50th anniversary of the ordination of Bishop A. Edward Pevec into the priesthood. I rise today to pay tribute to this wonderful man and to offer my thanks for the spiritual guidance he has given to Catholics throughout the City of Cleveland and northeastern Ohio. 
   Born in Cleveland, Ohio on April 16, 1925, Bishop Edward Pevec is the oldest of four children born to Anton and Frances Pevec, immigrants from Slovenia. On April 29, 1950, at the age of 25, Edward Pevec was ordained into the priesthood. Over the fifty years since his ordination, Bishop Pevec has served northeastern Ohio in a number of capacities. He has been the Associate Pastor at St. Mary Church in Elyria and at St. Lawrence Church in Cleveland. He has been a teacher, assistant principal/vice rector and principal/rector at Borromeo Seminary High School in Wickliffe and a graduate instructor at St. John College in Cleveland. During his service at Borromeo Seminary High School, Bishop Pevec continued his own education at two well-respected Cleveland institutions, earning a Masters degree from John Carroll University and Ph.D. from Western Reserve University. In 1975, he became pastor of his home parish, St. Vitus Church in Cleveland, and four years later, became the President-Rector of Borromeo College of Ohio. In 1982, Edward Pevec was ordained Auxiliary Bishop of Cleveland by His Holiness, Pope John Paul II. 
   Over the years, I have personally come to know Bishop Pevec, not only as a devout Christian, but as a man of deep caring for all mankind. I still remember the first time that my wife, Janet, and I saw Bishop Pevec celebrate mass. We were so impressed at the manner in which he conducted himself, that I said to my wife on our way out of the church that there's a priest who ought to be a Bishop! We were both grateful that the Holy Father recognized his good work for the diocese of Cleveland by appointing him Bishop. 
   Bishop Pevec's warmth and compassion have been felt by many in the City of Cleveland over the past half-century, and I am certain his light shall shine upon us for many years to come. I join all my fellow Cleveland parishioners, and all who have come to know Bishop Pevec in congratulating him on his 50 years of service to the Lord and to his fellow man. He is a true inspiration to us all.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we are approaching the one year anniversary of the end of the NATO air campaign in Kosovo. But just like a year ago, we find ourselves debating U.S. military involvement in Kosovo and what the U.S. mission in southeastern Europe should be. 
   With respect to southeastern Europe, I believe the Byrd-Warner language that has been included in this Military Construction Appropriations bill is the wrong approach at the wrong time. In addition to our direct national security interests in Europe that would be threatened by this provision, our efforts to encourage the establishment of the rule of law, universal respect for minority rights and market economies throughout southeastern Europe would be devastated by the Byrd-Warner language. 
   In the aftermath of the air war over Kosovo, we have an opportunity to work with the international community to integrate the nations of the region into the broader European community; an action I believe will help avoid the continuation of the bloodshed and destruction we've seen over the last decade. To effectively threaten a troop pull-out--which the Byrd-Warner language does--jeopardizes our efforts to take advantage of the worldwide interest in the region, and our ability to make an historic positive change for the future in southeastern Europe. 
   Mr. President, we have American military resources on the ground and in the skies in southeastern Europe with the specific intent of bringing peace and stability to the region. 
   Unfortunately, the Byrd-Warner amendment will be viewed by friend and foe alike in the region as a unilateral troop pull-out of Kosovo and an end to the commitment the United States of America has made to our European allies to help bring peace to the war-torn Balkans. 
   The Byrd-Warner language requires the next president to make a difficult determination on American presence in Kosovo soon after his election--a time when he should be working to establish and implement his foreign policy agenda for our nation with his senior management team including his National Security Advisor, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   It will be a period when he will need to measure his allies and become intimately familiar with a myriad of foreign policy challenges. His decisions will have a wide national security impact and must not be made hastily, but that is what the Byrd-Warner language does. 
   Mr. President, if we are to succeed in opposing aggression around the globe, we need to work with our allies. However, what the Byrd-Warner language would do is show our NATO allies that as far as peace and security in Europe is concerned, particularly in southeastern Europe, it is Congress' intention to extricate ourselves. I don't believe that is the message that the U.S. wants to convey. 
   For those of my colleagues who are interested in seeing Europe take on more responsibility in southeastern Europe, the issue is, does the Byrd-Warner language help or hurt? 
   I believe it would hurt, because I know that the Europeans have made the commitment, and are continuing to make the 
   commitment, to their southeastern European neighbors. 
   This past February, I was in Brussels to make my feelings known on the subject of fair-share burdensharing to the leadership of the European Union. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the Europeans basically understand that unless the Balkan region is fully integrated into the broader European community, the region will ``Balkanize Europe.'' I was further pleased to see the Europeans taking the necessary steps that will eventually include the nations of the region in the EU and NATO. 
   Of the total financial support committed to Kosovo by the international community, including humanitarian, development, economic recovery and reconstruction assistance, the U.S. has pledged 15 percent, while the rest of the world has pledged 85 percent. 
   Of the total amount pledged for the operations of the UN Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, the EU and its member countries have pledged 74 percent, and the U.S. 13.2 percent. 
   In addition, at the Stability Pact conference in Brussels this past March, four dozen countries and three dozen organizations pledged $2.3 billion--well above the $1.7 billion goal to fund regional economic development and infrastructure projects in southeast Europe over the next twelve months. I believe this commitment represents one of the first positive steps that has been taken since the end of the air war towards restoring peace and stability to the region. 
   What I am saying is: on the whole, the Europeans are meeting the challenge. They are supplying the funds and they understand the importance of involvement in the region. They are surpassing the thresholds established in the Byrd-Warner language. 
   What the U.S. needs to do is encourage them. For those nations that are responding to the challenge, pat them on the back. And for those that aren't, coax them into contributing. We should be working with our allies in a cooperative fashion and not a confrontational one. 
   We need to understand that while the Europeans are handling the bulk of the spending in the region, we must also be willing to come to the table to provide leadership and a little bit of a financial commitment. When I was in Brussels, the importance of the United States to provide leadership was underscored by members of NATO and the EU alike. 
   In addition, our leadership is absolutely desired and sought by the benefactors of the Stability Pact. Just last week, I received a letter from the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Nadezhda Mihailova, who reiterated the need for the United States to stay at the table. She said:  
   ..... the importance of U.S. leadership in southeastern Europe during reconstruction and beyond cannot be overestimated--it is critical to the future success of the region.  
   It is imperative that we stay focused and interested in what happens in this region of the world. 
   We should try to imagine what actions Slobodan Milosevic will take if he knows that the United States has given up its commitment to restoring peace in Kosovo. Imagine the last U.S. plane, the last armored personnel carrier, the last U.S. soldier leaving 
   Kosovo. How confident can we be that Milosevic will not renew his reign of terror against the people of Kosovo in an effort to solidify his power. What if he moves aggressively into Montenegro to quell the Djukanovic threat in the vacuum created by the American withdrawal. What will the United States do then? 
   We are also trying to get the Kosovo Albanian community, especially former members of the KLA, to support the rule of law and help establish a governmental framework to make it work. Can any of my colleagues imagine the psychological blow to this cause if they believe that the U.S. is pulling the plug and leaving? There is no way they will disarm. And, as a matter of fact, without U.S. support, the moderate factions could be swept-up into the arms of the zealots. 
   Can you also imagine what the prospect a U.S. pull-out will have on the Kosovo Serbs who have not fled; who chose to stay and try to live in peace with the Kosovo Albanians? What about those we encouraged to stay to help be a part of the interim government? With Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing still fresh in the minds of many Kosovo Albanians, what will become of the Kosovo Serbs without the protection of the United States? What will become of the fragile peace and the fledgling government that we are trying to establish? It is my belief that even the possibility of departure will destroy any chance for stability in Kosovo, as well as end the prospect of reconciliation in Kosovo. 
   And what about extremist factions throughout the region, in Bosnia, Macedonia, Croatia, etc.--factions that have remained relatively dormant due to the U.S. presence? I think about Mr. Arber Xhaferi in Macedonia, one of the key leaders of the Albanian community there, who's working with President Boris Trajkovski to create a truly multi-ethnic Macedonia. President Trajkovski's democratically elected government has made it clear that the ethnic Albanian community, which makes up roughly 25 percent to 30 percent of the population, is an integral and respected component of society. 
   However, there is evidence of an extremist element within the ethnic Albanian community. These individuals are willing to resort to violence in order to destabilize the government of Macedonia, and put in its place a government run by Albanians, for Albanians. There is genuine concern in Macedonia, as well as other nations, that if the United States leaves southeastern Europe, the deterrent factor on the extremist elements will have been removed, allowing for further regional instability. 
   Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my distinguished colleagues, Senators WARNER and BYRD, but their amendment to this bill puts us on a course that will unravel the prospect of a peaceful integration of southeastern Europe into the whole of Europe. 
   We have the ability to help keep the peace in southeastern Europe, and I believe we should continue to provide our leadership and our fair share of the costs during the next several years as we deal with the transition in Kosovo and the fall from power of Slobodan Milosevic. We should ensure the countries of the region that we do care about their future, and that we understand how fragile the political situation is in countries like Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania and Croatia. We need to let them know that we understand how important it is to support their new democratic leadership as they transition to multi-ethnic societies that respect human rights, the rule of law and which embrace market economies. 
   A commitment on the part of the United States to the Balkans on all of these items will help ensure stability for generations to come. I believe by working together--Congress and the White House--we can come up with a solution that will allow for the United States to continue to live up to such a commitment in southeastern Europe. 
   Our allies are willing to stay the course; they have made a commitment to southeastern Europe and have put their money where their mouth is. It's no time for us to leave them high and dry. It is not in the interest of our national security, our economic interests or the cause of peace in the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will provide incentives to clean up abandoned industrial sites--or brownfields--across the country and put them back into productive use and preserve our greenspaces. 
   It is time to create more certainty in the brownfields cleanup process. Parties that clean up non-Superfund sites under state cleanup laws need certainty about the rules that apply to them, particularly that their actions terminate the risk of future liability under the federal Superfund program. 
   The bill that I introduce today, the Brownfield Revitalization Act of 2000, creates that certainty by allowing states to release parties that have cleaned up sites under state laws and programs from federal liability. This bill has strong bipartisan support from our nation's Governors who have written to me expressing their support for this legislation. 
   I strongly believe that there should be no requirement that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pre-approve state laws and programs. State brownfields programs address sites that are not on the National Priorities List (NPL) and where the federal government has played little or no role. 
   States are leading the way in cleaning up sites more efficiently and cost-effectively. According to state solid waste management officials, states average more than 1,400 cleanups per year. And they are addressing approximately 4,700 sites at any given time. 
   This is helping to recycle our urban wastelands, prevent urban sprawl and preserve our farmland and greenspaces. These programs are cleaning up eyesores in our inner cities, making them more desirable places to live. Because they are putting abandoned sites back into productive use, they are the key to providing economic rebirth to our urban areas, and good-paying jobs to local residents. This bill makes sense for our environment and it makes sense for our economy. 
   The bill I am introducing today is similar to the brownfields provisions in S. 1090, the Superfund Program Completion Act of 1999, by Senator BOB SMITH and the late-Senator John Chafee. The purpose of my bill is to build upon the success of state programs by providing even more incentives to clean up brownfield sites in order to provide better protection for the health and safety of our citizens and the environment. What we don't need are delays caused by the U.S. EPA's second-guessing of state decisions. 
   A good example of second-guessing occurred in my own state of Ohio. One company, TRW completed a cleanup at its site in Minerva under Ohio's enforcement program in 1986. Despite these cleanup efforts, the U.S. EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1989. However, after listing the site, the U.S. EPA took no aggressive steps for additional cleanup. The site has been untouched for years. In fact, it is now likely that the site will be delisted. 
   To enhance and encourage further cleanup efforts, Ohio has implemented a private sector-based program to clean up brownfields sites. When I was Governor, Ohio EPA, Republicans and Democrats in the Ohio Legislature and I worked hard to implement a program that we believe works for Ohio. Our program is already successful in improving Ohio's environment and economy. 
   In almost 20 years under the federal Superfund program, the U.S. EPA has only cleaned up 18 sites in Ohio. In contrast, 103 sites have been cleaned up under Ohio's voluntary cleanup program in 5 years. And many more cleanups are underway. 
   States clearly have been the innovators in developing voluntary cleanup programs, and Ohio's program has been very successful in getting cleanups done more quickly and cost effectively. For example, the first cleanup conducted under our program--the Kessler Products facility, near Canton--was estimated to cost $2 million and take 3 to 5 years to complete if it had been cleaned under Superfund. However, under Ohio's voluntary program, the cost was $600,000 and took 6 months to complete. These cleanups are good for the environment and good for the economy. 
   Mr. President, Ohio and other states have very successful programs that clean up sites more efficiently and cost effectively. This bill would help build on their success by providing assurances to parties that when they clean up a site correctly, they will not be held liable under Superfund down the road. The bill precludes the federal government from taking action at a site where cleanup is being conducted under a state program except under certain circumstances, such as when a state requests federal action, when the U.S. EPA determines that a state is unwilling or unable to take appropriate action, or when contamination has migrated across state lines. The bill does not take away the U.S. EPA's authority to conduct emergency removals or their authority to conduct tests at a site to determine if a site should be listed on the NPL. 
   This legislation also ensures that Federal facilities are subject to the  same environmental cleanup requirements as private sites. In 1992, Congress enacted the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA), which holds Federal facilities accountable to meet State and Federal environmental laws regulating hazardous waste. However, subsequent Federal court decisions have undermined the intent of FFCA and similar language in other statutes. We should be reminded that contamination problems at Federal facilities are largely the result of years of self-regulation by Federal agencies. It is essential that States have the authority to oversee cleanup and enforce their own laws and standards. My bill merely ensures that Federal agencies are held accountable to the same state and federal regulations that govern private entities. 
   This bill is just plain commonsense. It provides more protection for the environment by providing incentives to clean up hazardous waste sites. It helps preserve our greenspaces. And it helps our economy by putting abandoned sites back into productive use, providing jobs and better places to live in our urban areas.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have been very impressed with the words of my colleagues, the two Senators from Massachusetts, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Vermont, and now the Senator from Missouri. 
   One of the things I decided on doing when I came to the Senate was to bring my passion for early childhood development to the Senate and to encourage my colleagues to give a much higher priority to children age prenatal to 3 than we have been giving in this country. Early childhood development, especially covering children age prenatal to 3, is fundamental if this Nation is to achieve the first of our eight national education goals, and that is, ``all children in America will start school ready to learn.'' 
   There are great programs for children, such as Head Start, which Congress has supported for 35 years. I am proud that when I was Governor of Ohio, we increased spending for Head Start by 1,000 percent. So in our State today, every eligible child whose parent wants them in a Head Start Program has a slot for that child. Even though Head Start has made a tremendous impact on our children, we must recognize that the program is designed for 3- and 4-year-olds. The period in a child's life in which we have not invested enough in this country, and the period on which we need to start concentrating, is the period in a child's life from prenatal to age 3. It is the time in a child's life that has the most impact on their overall development. 
   Thanks to decades of research on brain chemistry, and through the utilization of sophisticated new technology, neuroscientists are now telling us that within the first 3 months in the womb, children start to develop the 100 billion neurons they will need as adults. By the time they reach the age of 3, children have all the necessary connections--what we call synapses--between brain cells that cause the brain to function properly.  
   What I am saying is almost frightening. If we do not create an appropriate environment for our children prenatal to age 3, they physically do not develop these synapses in their brains, and they are incapable of using what God has given them in the most efficient way possible. 
   In terms of priorities, the experiences that fill a child's first days, months, and years have a critical and decisive impact on the development of the brain and on the nature and extent of their adult capacities--in other words, who they are going to become. The window of opportunity can be impacted by things that are within our control. 
   We found, for example, children who lack proper nutrition, health care, and nurturing during their first years tend also to lack adequate social, motor, and language skills needed to perform well in school. That is why all young children, parents, and care givers of those children should have access to information and support services appropriate for promoting healthy early childhood development in the first years of life, including child care, early intervention services, parenting education, health care, and other child development services. 
   This new revelation requires that States streamline and coordinate healthy early childhood development systems. It also necessitates that the Federal Government reorder its education priorities to reflect the importance of a child's learning and growing experiences from prenatal to age 3. 
   This amendment responds to the obvious shortcomings of the Federal Government's partnership with State governments and encourages States to coordinate and galvanize all public and private assets on the State and local level. 
   The amendment authorizes the expenditure of some $3.2 billion over the next 3 years to make grants available to our States, and subsequently to the counties, in order to provide or improve early learning services for young children. 
   I want to underscore, this is not a new entitlement. I want 
   to emphasize, what we are trying to do is prioritize money we are already spending for education and put more of it into early development programs where it is going to make the biggest difference for our children. 
   In order to receive this money, it does one other thing I think is very important. In too many communities in the United States, local social service, public, and private agencies do not cooperate and combine their resources. They do not collaborate enough to deliver services to children in their community. This amendment will require that:

   Mr. VOINOVICH. 
   Mr. President, over the last half century, and at facilities all across America, tens of thousands of dedicated men and women in our civilian federal workforce helped keep our military fully supplied and our nation fully prepared to meet any potential threat. Their success is measured in part with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, for many of these workers, their success came at a high price; the sacrifice of their health, and even their lives, for our liberty. I believe we have a federal obligation to live up to our responsibilities with these Cold War veterans. 
   The bill I am introducing today, along with Senators REID, DEWINE, KENNEDY, MCCONNELL, BRYAN, HARKIN, THOMPSON, FRIST, and BUNNING is titled the ``Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of 2000.'' This bill will provide financial compensation to Department of Energy workers whose impaired health has been caused by exposure to beryllium, radiation or other hazardous substances while working for the defense of the United States. The bill will also provide compensation to survivors of workers who have died while suffering from an illness resulting from exposure to these substances. 
   Many will express concern that it will be hard to prove if someone was made chronically ill by their work environment, however, such concerns can be refuted. For example, beryllium disease is a ``fingerprint'' disease, in that it leaves no doubt as to what caused the illness of the sufferer. Additionally, the only processing of the materials that cause Chronic Beryllium Disease is unique to our nuclear weapons facilities. Skepticism is understandable in many cases of radiation exposure at DoE facilities because the records may not generally reflect employee exposure to radioactive materials. However, concerns have been raised that the DoE destroyed or altered workers' records. Additionally, dosimeter badges, which record radiation exposure, were not always required to be worn by workers. When they were required to be worn, they were not always done so properly or consistently. DoE plant management would even ``zero'' dose badges. Therefore, many records do not exist, and where they do exist, there is adequate reason to doubt their accuracy. That is why this bill places the burden of proof on the government to prove that an employee's illness was not caused by workplace hazards. 
   As one who believes we should rely on sound science, I would certainly support a method for compensation based on this principle if it was available. Unfortunately in this case, sound science either does not exist in DoE facility records, or it cannot be relied upon for accuracy. That's precisely what happened in my state of Ohio. 
   In a series of newspaper articles from the Columbus Dispatch, it was shown that for decades, some workers at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio--a plant which processes high-quality nuclear material--did not know they had been exposed to dangerous levels of radioactive material. That's because until recently, proper safety precautions were rarely taken to adequately protect workers' safety. Even when precautions were taken, the application of protective standards was inconsistent. In addition, workers at the Piketon plant have stated that plant management not only did not keep adequate dosimetry records, in some cases, they changed the dosimetry records to show lower levels of radiation exposure. If consistent, reliable and factual data is not available, then it will be quite difficult to utilize sound science. 
   Similar occurrences have been reported at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio and the Mound Facility in Miamisburg, Ohio as well as other facilities nationwide. 
   The DoE has admitted that at some facilities, workers were not told the nature of the substances with which they were working, nor the ramifications that these materials may have on their future health and quality of life. It is unconscionable that DoE managers and other individuals in positions of responsibility could be so insensitive and uncaring about their fellow man. 
   Last year, the Toledo Blade published an award-winning series of articles outlining the plight of workers suffering from Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD). While government standards were met in protecting the workers from exposure to the beryllium dust, many workers still were diagnosed with CBD. The stories of these workers who are suffering from this often debilitating disease are heart-wrenching. It is estimated that 1,200 people have contracted CBD, and hundreds have died from it, making CBD the number one disease directly caused by our Cold War effort. 
   Title one of this bill provides compensation to individuals suffering from Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD). Beryllium, which is a toxic substance, can cause major health problems if proper precautions are not taken while it is being handled. Individuals who suffer from Chronic Beryllium Disease experience a loss of lung function, and in many cases face a painful death. While there is a blood test that can detect CBD, and there are treatments for it, there is no cure. Under this bill, if the disease is confirmed, it is presumed work-related and workers compensation at benefit levels established under  the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) is paid--roughly two-thirds of six years worth of wages and health care coverage. Alternatively, a claimant can elect a one-time lump sum payment of $200,000 (with healthcare benefits related to their disease) in lieu of wage replacement payments. Employees at DoE sites and DoE beryllium vendors would be covered under the bill. 
   Title two of this bill covers illnesses related to radiation and other hazardous substances. The first part of this title covers workers at all DoE sites who contract cancer that has been potentially caused by exposure to radiation (radiogenic cancer), worked at the site for at least one year and wore a radiation dosimeter badge or should have worn one. Causation is presumed if the covered cancer is a primary cancer. Again, benefits are paid at FECA levels, or in the alternative, a claimant can elect a one-time lump sum payment of $200,000 (with healthcare benefits) in lieu of wage replacement payments. The presumption is modeled after the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. This proposal incorporates all DoE sites across the nation, plus four vendor facilities. 
   The second part of this title covers workers at DoE sites for illness, impairment, disease or death, using a FECA level of benefits. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to create a panel of occupational doctors to review the claims for the Department of Labor, and the threshold for eligibility is whether exposure was a significant contributing factor to a worker's illness. The bill allows claimants to seek a second medical opinion. Further, the bill directs the HHS to empanel occupational physicians to develop additional presumptions for use in guiding future HHS and Labor Department decisions. 
   To obtain restitution under the bill, claimants would file with the Department of Labor's Office of Worker Compensation Programs under a FECA-like program but not FECA itself. The claims reviewer, after obtaining all the necessary information, would have 120 days to render a decision. If a denial is issued, the claimant can appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ has 180 days to render an opinion. If an opinion is not rendered, the appeal can be brought to the federal Benefits Review Board (BRB). The BRB has 240 days to render an opinion, after which appeals can be brought to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Failure to meet deadlines by the DoL results in a default in favor of the claimant. This approach is intended to remedy the major defects in FECA, which excludes any rights to the Courts and results in years of delay in many cases. 
   Mr. President, there may be some who will say that this bill costs too much, or we can't afford it so we shouldn't do it. I strongly disagree. 
   Congress appropriates billions of dollars annually on things that are not the responsibility of the federal government. And here we have a clear instance where our federal government is responsible for the actions it has taken and the negligence it has shown against its own people. This is an issue where peoples' health has been compromised and lives have been lost. In many instances, these workers didn't even know that their health and safety was in jeopardy. It is not only a responsibility of this government to provide for these individuals, it is a moral obligation. 
   Mr. President, it is unfortunate that a bill establishing this type of compensation program is necessary; it is little consolation for the pain, health problems and diminished quality of life that these individuals have suffered. These men and women who won the Cold War have only asked that the United States government--the government of the nation that they spent their lives defending--acknowledge that they were made ill in the course of doing their job and recognize that the government must take care of them. 
   Sadly, because of the government's stonewalling and denial of responsibility, the only way many of these employees believe they will ever receive proper restitution for what the government has done is to file a lawsuit against the Department of Energy or its contractors. That should not have to happen and it is my hope that this legislation will preclude any perceived need for such lawsuits. 
   I believe that all those who have served our nation fighting the Cold War deserve to know if the federal government was responsible for causing them illness or harm, and if so, to provide them the care that they need. I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation and I urge the Senate to consider this bill during this session of Congress.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in the last couple of days I have had an opportunity to preside over the Senate. I feel compelled to make some overall comments about what I have heard and the difference between the Republican approach and the Democratic approach on this education reauthorization bill. 
   First of all, I think it is important everyone understand that the Federal Government only provides about 7 percent of the money for education in the United States of America. Sometimes when I listen to my colleagues, I think they think they are members of the ``School Board of America'' and do not understand that the overwhelming majority of contributions for education come from State and local government. 
   I have also listened to Senators depicting the Republican approach as a ``revolution'' that will change the way the Federal Government is going to be dealing with our schools. In fact, it was depicted by one Member of the Senate as giving ``a blank check to the States to conduct business as usual.'' 
   I want to let you know that the States are not conducting ``business as usual.'' As the former chairman of the National Governors' Association, I worked with my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to reform education in this country. I think it would be wonderful if the Members of the Senate would really become familiar with what is going on throughout this country as State and local government change the way they deliver education and recognize the improvements that have been made. 
   The Republican approach that has been titled as ``revolutionary'' is the Straight A's Program. So that everyone understands, it basically says: Straight A's, of which I am a cosponsor, builds on Ed-Flex and allows up to 15 States to enter into a 5-year agreement with the Secretary of Education where the State can consolidate their formula grant programs, including title I, and use them for the educational priorities set by the State. In return for this flexibility, States will be held accountable for academic results. States that reduce the achievement gap will receive additional funds. 
   In effect, this is a waiver, given by the Department of Education, to 15 States that want it, for 5 years, to use education money differently from what is provided in the current categorical programs. 
   Now, another issue is title I portability. It applies to 10 States plus 20 school districts. The States and districts will apply if their education communities desire it. No district will be required by the Federal Government to have this portability. In other words, these are voluntary programs where States would come to the Department of Education and say: We would like to use this money differently from how it is now allocated under the categorical titles. 
   This is not what I would refer to as ``revolutionary.'' This sounds to me like the waiver program we had many years ago where the States could go to the Department of Health and Human Services and say: We want a waiver to do welfare a little differently in our State. 
   What I am hearing on the floor of the Senate is ``block grants are awful.'' I will tell you something. As a former mayor, I fought for the CDBG Program, Community Development Block Grant Program, which is one of the most successful block grants in the United States of America. 
   I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say some of the same things I heard when I was Governor and I was down here with six or seven other Governors to reform the welfare system. I heard ``it's going to be a race to the bottom. The Governors do not care. The local government doesn't care. We in Washington, we in the Senate, care more about the people than the Governors and the local government officials.'' 
   I would like to remind this body that on October 4, 1998, the President of the United States said:  
   This great new experiment that we launched 2 years ago has already shown remarkable signs of success. Two years ago, we said welfare reform would spark a race to independence, not a race to the bottom. And this prediction is coming true.  
   Many Members of this Senate said it would be a race to the bottom, that this was not the right thing to do. 
   Again, on December 4, 1999, the President said:  
   Seven years ago, I asked the American people to join me in ending welfare as we know it. In 1996, with bipartisan support, we passed a landmark welfare reform bill. Today, I am pleased to announce we have cut the rolls by more than half. Fewer Americans are on welfare today than at any other time since 1969. We are moving more than a million people a year from the welfare rolls to payrolls, 1.3 million in 1998.  
   He goes on to say what a great program it is. 
   How did it come about? It came about because we gave the people closest to the problem the opportunity to use money in a different way. We ended the entitlement, and we had a block grant for the States and said: You use the money the best way you can to make a difference in the lives of our welfare recipients. 
   That is fundamentally what we are asking for in our approach to education reform. We want to try something different. 
   We have had Title I for years and in the title I schools, we are not getting the job done. That is one of the reasons we passed Ed-Flex early this year. We want to build on that, give the schools the flexibility to use those dollars in the way they can make the most difference for our boys and girls. 
   I have heard: ``Build new schools, hire more teachers.'' We are building more schools. We are providing more teachers on the local level. I heard about ``a digital divide.'' In almost every State in the Union, the States have put fiber optics out to the schools, and put computers in the schools that the States have paid for. In my State, we have wired classrooms for voice, video, and data. 
   Parents ought to know how their child's school is doing. Most States have report cards now, so people can compare their kids' performance in their school versus another school down the block. 
   Let's take the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. We are talking about rewarding teachers. I am a former member of the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. In our State, people who apply and receive their certificate from the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards receive another $3,000 a year from the State of Ohio to recognize their extra professional competence. In the State of North Carolina, Governor Jim Hunt gives them $5,000. 
   We've talked about all kinds of new things Members of this Senate would like to see happening at the local level. I am saying most of it is happening on the local level. We talk about building new schools. Let me say that once you get started with building new schools, it is a never ending process. 
   The American public ought to understand that the backdrop of what we are doing here is shown on this chart. We are paying 13 percent of each federal dollar on interest; we are paying 16 percent on national defense; nondiscretionary is 18 percent; mandatory spending is 53 percent. 
   We have some real problems in this country. We have to take care of Social Security and Medicare. We have a problem with readiness in our Defense Department. And we have people saying: Let's get into new programs. Let's get into areas that are not the responsibility of the Federal Government. 
   I am saying that the States have more of a capacity to deal with it. I went through the numbers. The National Governors' Association says there isn't one State in debt like we are--not one. Most of them have surpluses. If you talk about capacity to get the job done, they have more capacity to get it done than we have. 
   It is hard for me to believe that when you are in debt this much, when you are paying out 13 cents in interest on every dollar, you are saying we are going to get involved in some programs that fundamentally are the State's responsibility, and where the States have  more capacity to deal with the problems. So what I am saying today is that we must change our approach to education. All we are saying is give the States an opportunity to apply for a waiver, to use the money differently than what is in the categorical programs. They can use it for teachers. In my State, we have reduced class size in urban districts down to 15 students per class, and we have done a lot of the things in the states that we are talking about here. Let's just fund IDEA and make the money available so States can do that on their own. 
   We need to understand we have a role to play in education, but fundamentally it is a State and local responsibility. Our job is to become a better partner to the State and local governments, give them the flexibility to get the job done and then hold them accountable. That is what this is all about. I think that should be the debate. I hope that maybe by the time we get through with this bill, we can come together on a bipartisan basis and do something so we walk out of here and say to the American people that we have done something this year in education.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, when the bombing ceased, and Serbian military forces withdrew from the Kosovo province, most Americans believed that the end of the air war meant the end of the United States' involvement in the Balkans. Such a misconception is due primarily to the fact that the political and military situation in the Balkans, as well as U.S. foreign policy towards the region, remains largely unknown to the vast majority of Americans. 
   Because of my belief that the Balkan region is key to our strategic interests in Europe, earlier this year, I traveled to the Republic of Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo and Brussels, Belgium in order to examine the humanitarian, economic, political and security situation in Southeastern Europe. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of my observations with my colleagues and the American people. 
   Before I proceed further, I would like to publicly thank U.S. Ambassador to Croatia, William Montgomery, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, Michael Einik, Chief of the U.S. Mission to  Kosovo, Larry Rossin, U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Sandy Vershbow and U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Richard Morningstar. They are fine representatives of our nation, and they are doing an outstanding job to help bring peace and stability to this sensitive part of the world. 
   I would also like to thank our U.S. embassy staff in Croatia, Macedonia, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU). In addition, I would like to thank the personnel who comprise the U.S. Mission in Kosovo, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Army--especially Colonel Timothy Peterson, who accompanied me on this trip and also provided his valuable insight and expertise on the region. 
   I would further like to thank Senator FRED THOMPSON, my chairman on the Governmental Affairs Committee, for giving me the opportunity and the Committee authorization to take this trip. 
   Finally, I would like to thank our men and women in uniform who provided such invaluable assistance during my travels in the region. They have my gratitude, and I believe the gratitude of our nation should go out to our peacekeeping force in Kosovo. We have a tremendous team working on our behalf in the region, and all Americans should be proud of their tireless efforts to help promote peace and protect the interests of the United States in southeastern Europe. 
   Mr. President, one of the more encouraging developments I observed in my trip to the Balkans was a new positive spirit that seems to be emerging in a number of nations in the region. 
   In my visit to Croatia, I had the opportunity to meet with the newly-elected president of Croatia, Stipe Mesic. 
   President Mesic is a bright, engaging, well-spoken gentleman with a tremendous understanding of the varied and complex issues facing his country. More importantly, he has a clear concept--supported by his electorate--of the direction his country should take for the future. 
   President Mesic is pleased that the region finally seems to have abandoned the two terrible ideas that have caused so much bloodshed over the last decade--the dream of a ``Greater Serbia'' and the dream of a ``Greater Croatia.'' In an indication of his commitment to ending these disastrous notions, he expressed to me his support for sending individuals responsible for war crimes that have taken place over the last decade to the International Criminal Tribunal for prosecution. 
   He is also committed to fully returning to Croatia those refugees who were displaced after conflict swept the nation in the 1990's. He understands that a functional economy, the establishment of private property rights and the rule of law are key to the return of these refugees. 
   President Mesic appeared to understand that the future of southeastern Europe is linked to minority rights and that redrawing international boundaries along ethnic lines is fundamentally unworkable--we need only witness the ongoing debacle in Bosnia for such an example. With this realization on the need to consider minority rights, he plans on appealing to the best instincts in his people to put aside ethnic hatred, so that they and their nation may move ahead. He has stated that he looks forward to serving as the President of all of the Croatian people, regardless of their ethnicity. If lines are not going to be redrawn, then a major hurdle to domestic peace in Croatia will have been removed. 
   It is my understanding that Prime Minister Racan, who I did not have the opportunity to meet since he was out of the country during my visit, seems committed to these principles as well. I'm also encouraged that Parliamentary President Zlatko Tomcic, Deputy Parliamentary President Zdravko Tomac, Serbian Member of Parliament Milan Djukic and Serbian Democratic Forum President Veljko Dzakula--all of whom I met in Croatia--appear to be supportive. 
   I was also pleased to meet with Macedonia's President Boris Trajkovski, the Macedonian Prime Minister, Ljubco Georgievski, and Arben Xhaferi, the leader of Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community. They seem to have been able to successfully bridge the domestic ethnic problems that have been at the heart of the various conflicts that have decimated southeastern Europe over the last ten years. 
   As many of my colleagues may recall, Macedonia was seen as another potential flashpoint during the course of the Kosovo bombing campaign as the Macedonian people became polarized either in favor, or against, NATO's actions. This possibility seems to have been successfully averted because Macedonians do not generally possess the same kind of ethnic hatreds towards their minority community that have plagued other nations in the region. 
   Domestic peace and stability has been achieved in Macedonia by appealing to the best instincts in people, rather than the worst. The elected leadership has made it clear that the ethnic Albanian community, which makes up roughly 25% to 30% of the population, is an integral and respected component of society. Because of this, minority rights are, by and large, protected, and the rule of law is, for the most part, very well respected. The importance of these trends cannot be understated. 
   I was particularly interested to hear President Trajkovski discuss the amazing recovery of Macedonia's economy. When the nation separated from the FRY in 1991, Macedonia's per capita income immediately started sliding downward, dropping 40 percent. This decline was clearly exacerbated by the Kosovo bombing campaign. 
   Nevertheless, in recent months, the economy has staged a dramatic turnaround because of stable and progressive leadership, market reforms and economic activity as a result of Macedonia's serving as a staging point for KFOR. Macedonia is beginning the slow process of returning to its pre-independence level of economic activity. More importantly, the EU, as a part of its new focus on the Balkans region, has established a relationship with Macedonia intended to lead to its eventual membership in the European Union, a commitment that had never been made before the Kosovo war. Given my belief that integration of the nations of the region into the broader European community is essential to long-term peace and stability, this is a dramatic development. 
   At the headquarters of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in Pristina, Kosovo, I had the opportunity to sit down and meet with several key leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community and representatives on the Interim Administrative Council--Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, Mr. Hashim Thaci and Dr. Rexhep Qosja. This was an extraordinary meeting given the historical animosity between these leaders. 
   All three leaders made a very clear promise to me that they were committed to a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo, one that would respect the rights of all ethnic minorities. I was heartened to hear these comments. This commitment could serve as the basis for long-term peace and stability in Kosovo. 
   In response, I said that they could go down in history as truly great men were they to make this commitment a reality. I explained that the historic cycle of revenge in Kosovo must end and minority rights must be respected--including the sanctity of churches and monasteries. This would be the key to the future of Kosovo. 
   I traveled to Brussels to make my feelings known to the leadership of the European Union (EU) regarding their lack of leadership and commitment to the problems facing southeastern Europe. I met with U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Richard Morningstar and U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Alexander Vershbow and with other leaders of NATO and the EU. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the Europeans basically ``get it.'' That is, they understand that unless the Balkan region is fully integrated into the broader European community, the region will ``Balkanize Europe.'' This is the same message I have been saying for months. I was pleased to see the Europeans taking the necessary steps that will eventually include the nations of the region in the EU and NATO. 
   I think it is important to highlight the level of support the Europeans are providing the region. They have budgeted six billion euros (basically $6 billion) over the next six years to help bring Romania and Bulgaria into the EU. They have also prepared to provide  5.5 billion euros (again, roughly $5.5 billion) over the same time period to implement the three initiatives of the Stability Pact--democratization, security, and regional infrastructure development. 
   Of the total financial support committed to Kosovo by the international community, including humanitarian, development, economic recovery and reconstruction assistance, the EU has pledged 35.5 percent. The U.S. has pledged 15.4 percent. 
   Of the total amount pledged for the operations of UNMIK, the EU has pledged 41.4 percent, the U.S. 13.2 percent.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. We need to understand that while the Europeans are handling the bulk of the spending in the region, we must also be willing to come to the table to provide leadership. The importance of the United States to provide leadership was underscored by members of NATO and the EU, particularly those countries benefitting from the Stability Pact. 
   One of the highlights of my trip was the opportunity I had to spend time with our troops in Macedonia and Kosovo. There are few things that make me more proud of being an American than seeing the pride, professionalism, sense of duty and commitment in the faces of our young people in uniform. 
   I was especially happy to spend time with the 321st Psychological Operations Company, Task Force Falcon, which was deployed from Ohio and stationed at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. It gave me the chance to interact with these fine men and women from Ohio and hear their views on their mission in Kosovo. It also gave me the opportunity to visit with my friend, Major Wendell Bugg, whom I've known since my days as Governor. He is with the 321st and is doing a wonderful job. It was great to see him and get reacquainted. 
   And, Mr. President, I can't forget the unsung heroes of Kosovo--the men and women of the various humanitarian missions. I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from all of the major humanitarian aid organizations involved in Kosovo and Macedonia. I truly admire the service these people provide their fellow man. They are on the front lines daily, helping people, making a difference. To all of them I say, keep up the good work. Their efforts are key to stability in southeastern Europe and in responding to basic human needs. 
   While I encountered many encouraging prospects for regional peace and prosperity during my trip, I also identified a number of challenges the region and the international community are facing. 
   While there is ample reason to be optimistic about the future of Croatia under the leadership of President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan, there are also reasons to be concerned. The Croatian economy has been struggling for years. Unemployment and inflation rates are high. The country is deep in debt internationally. Many skilled, well-educated young people have left the country for better job prospects elsewhere. This has effectively created a ``brain drain,'' which, unless it is stemmed, will have a negative impact for decades. For Croatia to continue on its new path, away from its nationalist past, the economy must improve. If a solid market economy cannot take hold, there is a very real possibility that the Croatian people will grow impatient with President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan and seek to replace them; possibly with individuals who would rule the country under nationalist communist ideology. 
   The other problem facing the Croatian economy is in the area of refugee returns. As my colleagues may know, the majority of the civilians forced out of their homes during the conflicts of the early 1990's still have not returned to their homes. Even as President Mesic works to implement his campaign commitment to create a legal environment where minority rights are protected, people will not return to their homes--if their home still exists--if there is no work for them when they return. Thus, Croatia's struggling economy does impact and will continue to impact the entire region. 
   Current trends in Macedonia suggest the existence of an extremist element within the ethnic Albanian community. These individuals are willing to resort to violence in order to destabilize the sitting democratically-elected government of Macedonia, and put in its place a government run by Albanians, for Albanians. These extremists are beginning to make their presence felt with the government in Macedonia. It will take a tremendous commitment on the part of the current government to maintain a democratic, multi-ethnic form of government in Macedonia in the face of this threat. 
   A major impediment to peace and prosperity in southeastern Europe is the rise in organized crime. There have been a number of recent reports indicating that the Balkans region is being used more and more frequently as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics and arms. These reports were echoed by nearly everyone I spoke with on the trip. With this illicit trade comes violence, corruption, a lack of foreign investment and general societal havoc. As the nations of the region work to establish the rule of law, a functional judicial system and prosperous economies, I believe America and European nations must offer their crime-fighting expertise in order to help the Balkan nations shape their own future and steer clear from the menace of organized crime. 
   A tremendous concern that Dr. Bernard Kouchner, civilian head of the UNMIK operation, brought to the forefront was that the international community must be more active in their dispersal of aid-money pledged to the region, and in particular, the EU needed to be a more active participant in this area. Indeed, the EU has only dispersed 13.3 percent of the money they have pledged to UNMIK thus far. The EU has a number of strong arguments to explain their delay, including the nature of their fiscal cycle, the various mechanisms in place to prevent fraud and abuse, the unwieldy nature of the body, etc. Regardless, the fact is that the money has to be put on the table. As I mentioned before, the U.S. is doing its fair share given the role we played during the course of the bombing campaign. Now is the time for the Europeans to do theirs. 
   Throughout my trip to the Balkans, all signs pointed to the fact that the Stability Pact was not being implemented to the benefit of the region. 
   I believe that the Stability Pact represents one of the few good things that resulted from the Kosovo bombing campaign. Under the Stability Pact, the Europeans, with the leadership of the Germans and the French, agreed to work towards the gradual integration of the nations of southeastern Europe into the broader European community. In practice, this means EU and NATO membership. In exchange, the nations of the Balkan region must agree to put aside the ethnic divisions and nationalism that has caused so much death and destruction in recent years. This compact, if implemented, would be a gigantic leap forward. 
   Unfortunately, so far, not much has happened with the Pact. Meetings and conferences between government bureaucrats have been held. There have been a lot of speeches, studies, conversations, debates, and the like, but nothing has really happened ``on the ground'' in the region. I believe the Pact must move ahead with infrastructure projects that benefit the economies of the region. Start building bridges. Start cleaning the Danube River. Start building ``Corridor Eight,'' which will create an East-West railway/roadway travel corridor to stimulate commerce. Just start doing something! 
   I am somewhat heartened by the results of the Stability Pact conference in Brussels 2 weeks ago. There, 4 dozen countries and 3 dozen organizations pledged 2.4 billion Euros to fully-finance a 1.8 billion Euro ``Quick Start'' package of regional economic development and infrastructure projects and initiatives in southeast Europe over the next twelve months. I believe this commitment represents one of the first positive steps that has been taken since the end of the air war towards restoring peace and stability to the region. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the RECORD at the  end of my remarks a statement that was made by the Honorable Nadezhda Mihailova, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, regarding Bulgaria's perspective on southeastern Europe prior to the Stability Pact Conference.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. The deeds of the Kosovar Albanians are not matching the rhetoric of the Albanian leadership. As recent press reports have made clear, NATO is facing another potential crisis in Kosovo. Extremist members of the ethnic Albanian community--some have argued under the direction of Hashim Thaci--have refused to put down their arms, put aside their desire for revenge against the Serbs, and work towards peace. Rather, they are intent on pushing the Serbs, with bombings, assassinations, threats, etc. to force a response from Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. Today, Kosovo Serbs are being killed, their monasteries are being burned, and they are afraid to leave their homes. This is not KFOR's fault. This is not UNMIK's fault. Radical elements within the Kosovo Albanian community are responsible for continued attacks against the dwindling Serb community in Kosovo. I am concerned that many in the Kosovo Albanian community want to force another confrontation between NATO and Milosevic so Kosovo can finally be rid of the Serb community and establish itself as an independent nation. 
   Let me be clear. The same group our State Department once called a terrorist organization--the KLA--whom we embraced as our friends and allies when NATO was bombing, are again becoming terrorists. They are working against the healing of Kosovo. Our message must be clear to Thaci, Rugova, Qosja and their Kosovo Albanian followers--stop this violence against the Serb community or the U.S. will pull out our troops. I said this directly to Thaci, Rugova and Qosja when I met them. As much as I want southeast Europe, including Kosovo and Serbia, to be integrated into the European community, I will work against it if the cycle of violence continues. The Kosovo Albanians have a historic opportunity to choose between two very different paths for the future--integration or continued isolation. The choice is theirs to make and the world will be watching. 
   Let me now turn to the Kosovo Serbs. They have suffered a great deal since the end of the Kosovo bombing campaign at the hands of certain elements within the Albanian community seeking revenge. However, the Kosovo Serbs' continued refusal to participate in UNMIK's Interim Administrative Council is unacceptable. I took the same message I made to the Albanians to the Serbs--stop the cycle of violence and move ahead towards reconciliation. 
   Decisions are going to be made regarding the future of Kosovo with or without Serbian participation. It is in their best interest to become involved. I am somewhat heartened that Bishop Artemjie's visit to the U.S. has prompted some progress towards getting the Kosovo Serbs to participate in the Interim Administrative Council. I understand that as a result of his visit, discussions are taking place that would allow the development of several media outlets within Kosovo. I am hopeful that this will serve as the impetus to get the Serb community in Kosovo involved in the Interim Administrative Council. It will require diligence and co-operation on a multi-ethnic approach, but I believe it will ultimately serve to draw the whole of Kosovo society together and stop the killing and violence and fear for life, limb and property that permeates the minority community in Kosovo. 
   Meanwhile, NATO continues to struggle with Milosevic's meddling hands in Kosovo. He has a group of extremist Kosovo Serbs, mainly situated around Mitrovica, agitating the situation in Kosovo whenever possible in an effort to encourage NATO to pack up and go home. He must not succeed. NATO must stand strong and refuse to accept any more provocations. They should seize illegal weapons and jail law-breakers and agitators. NATO forces should take the enemies of peace off the streets and shut-down the extremists of both sides. De-fusing the situation will lower tensions and allow the mainstream people of Kosovo to move forward with their future. 
   Last month, I introduced S. Res. 272 which I believe effectively addresses this issue, and many more. On Milosevic, the Resolution makes it clear that he continues to be the heart of the problem in the region. In order to encourage democratic change, the Resolution: 
   Expresses the readiness of the Senate, once there is a democratic government in Serbia, to review conditions for Serbia's full reintegration into the international community; 
   Expresses its readiness to assist a future democratic government in Serbia to build a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous society, based on the same principle of respect for international obligations, as set out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations, which guide the relations of the United States with other countries in southeastern Europe; and 
   Calls upon the United States and other Western democracies to publicly announce and demonstrate to the Serbian people the magnitude of assistance they could expect after democratization.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the NATO KFOR troops are in Kosovo to provide a secure environment for all citizens while civic institutions develop. The UNMIK structure, which I will address momentarily, has been charged with this civic development--this nation building. One of the key elements in this process is the establishment of a functional judicial system, including a functional police force. It is hoped that once properly trained, this police force will eventually take the responsibility for domestic law enforcement from the KFOR troops. 
   The international community has promised to supply 4,433 police for this UN force in Kosovo. Our European friends have committed the bulk of this total. However, only 2,359 police are in place in Kosovo. This is appalling. 
   As a rule, our European allies have national police systems rather than state or provincial police forces like we do in the U.S. This matters because it gives the national governments--governments that have promised to put their police in Kosovo to serve in the UN body--the ability to simply direct redeployments to meet their commitments. This lack of will and action is truly appalling. To provide context, I think it is important to note that we have had to recruit the American men and women serving with the UN in Kosovo from our state and local police departments. The best information I have shows that we have put 481 people, out of our total commitment of 550, in place in Kosovo. If we can meet our promises through recruitment, surely our European friends can meet theirs through directives. 
   This all matters because the sooner the UN police force and a judicial system is operational in Kosovo, the sooner our troops can come home. 
   One of the issues hardly considered when NATO became involved in Kosovo was the development of an end game. Well, now we know why. We are, in fact, building a nation. I understand no one is willing to say this publicly but we need to be truthful: the international community--using UNMIK as its tool on the ground--is building a new nation in Kosovo. It's all-encompassing. From schools, to roads, to power grids, to taxation, to local elections, to municipal councils, to the judicial system--it is all now our responsibility because we won the war. 
   In conclusion, I would like to address those cynics who believe we should immediately pull out of Kosovo and the Balkans because they believe we will never successfully bring about peace in the region. These cynics often point to the historical hatred between the ethnic groups in the region as an indication that NATO and the UN are doomed to fail. I disagree. We can make a difference and history supports my view. 
   Consider the centuries of animosity and hatred between the nations of western Europe. Few would have thought that the bitter adversaries at the heart of two world wars last century could be looking to a new century  where borders are crossed without passports, where there is freedom of labor movement, and where there is no military presence on the borders. It happened because the nations of western Europe were willing to put aside centuries of hatred, revenge and ethnic prejudice and break the cycle of violence. If it could happen there, it can happen in southeast Europe. 
   One of the Beatitudes states that ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God'' (Matthew 5:9). With these words in mind, our efforts must be redoubled so that we may help bring peace, stability and prosperity to southeastern Europe. 
   Southeastern Europe Funding 
   Southeastern Europe (includes humanitarian, development, economic recovery and reconstruction assistance--military, security and assessed expenditures are not included)  
   The international community, led by the United States, the European Union and international financial institutions, has pledged $4.033 billion in support for southeastern Europe for the year 2000. A complete list of the nations involved in this effort appears below: 
  [In billions of dollars]   EU   U.S.   EU + \1\   Amount pledged   $1.398   $0.3764   $1.853.2     Amount pledged as a percentage of the total   34.7%   9.3%   45.9%

   Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank Senator BYRD for yielding time. 
   I speak against the repeal of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax for the third time on the floor of the Senate. Although I disagree with my colleague from Alaska in regard to this matter, I do agree this debate has given us an opportunity to identify the real problem of why we have high gas prices in this country, and that is, we lack an energy policy. Our reliance on foreign oil could increase to 65 percent or more by the year 2020. 
   As a matter of fact, a couple of weeks ago in the Committee on Governmental Affairs, we had a representative from the Energy Department appear before the committee and I asked him: Just how reliant should we be on foreign oil? What is the number? He was unable to give a number. 
   I mentioned that, as a former Governor, if I had a problem, I would identify what the goal was to solve that problem and put in place strategies to achieve that goal. The fact is, we are here today because we have no energy policy in this country. That is the main issue. 
   The other issue is whether or not reducing the gas tax by 4.3 cents a gallon is going to make any real difference. I argue it may not bring down the price of gas at the pump. In some States, if the gas tax is reduced, their State laws provide that the state gas tax is increased to make up for the loss of the Federal gas tax. I point out that in terms of the traveling public, the motoring public, getting rid of the 4.3 cent gas tax is only going to save about $43 a year. 
   This is one of the factors which I think adds to the cynicism of the American public in regard to some of the things we do in the Senate. We argue this is going to make a difference, and then the people realize all we are talking about over a year's period, if they drive 15,000 miles a year, at 15 miles-per-gallon is about $43. 
   I have been involved in this matter as a Governor and as the former chairman of the National Governors' Association. The Governors were opposed to the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax in 1993 because it was used for deficit reduction and we thought it should be used for building highways. 
   In 1998, when TEA-21 was negotiated, everyone agreed to put that 4.3 cents a gallon into the highway trust fund so we can use it for new construction of highways and to maintain and repair highways. It also guaranteed to many of the donor States--that is, a State that sends more money to Washington than they get back, like Ohio--that they will get at least 90.5 cents per dollar back every year. It gave us a predictable, reliable source of revenue to get the job done. We thought we had resolved this issue once and for all. 
   Today we have the issue before us of reducing the gas tax by 4.3 cents a gallon. Someone said: Do not worry about it because we will make up the lost funding from the surplus. I argue, if I have listened carefully to my colleagues on the floor, there are lots of other good things that they want to do with our surplus. If one looks at it from an equity point of view, the tradition in this country is, the people who use the highways pay for them. We are saying reduce their tax and make it up by hitting everybody else in the country and taking it out of the general fund, which can be used for other things that would benefit the rest of America. 
   I cannot buy the argument: Do not worry about it, we will make it up from the surplus. 
   I also point out the National Governors' Association, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, all the major State and local 
   organizations are opposed to repealing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax. 
   I do not care what the polls say, the one organization I listen to in Ohio which represents the motoring public is the American Automobile Association. This is the premier organization representing the people who drive in this country. 
   One would think they would be for reducing the gas tax, wouldn't they? The fact is, they are opposed to it because they know that repair and maintenance of our highways and new construction are important to the motoring public, particularly to their safety. They also realize that this country, in so many areas, has turned into a gigantic parking lot, with gridlock, bottlenecks, and hours wasted in America on  the highways because our infrastructure is in such bad shape. Gasoline is being wasted sitting in these traffic jams, polluting the air, let alone the stress and strain on the drivers and their loss of time. 
   Today, the only good thing I can say about the fact we are debating this 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax reduction is the fact that it is bringing to the American people's attention that we do not have an energy policy. 
   As I have said over and over on this floor, gas prices are going to come down. They are going to come down because the administration is going to make sure they come down before the November election. 
   The real question is: Are we just going to treat it as we have in the past? Do my colleagues remember 1973 when we had the crisis and the prices went up? Are we just going to treat this like we treat a barking dog and say: Give it a bone, it'll stop barking and we will go back to doing things the way we've always done in this country? 
   I hope not. 
   What we should resolve--Republicans and Democrats, Congress and the administration--is to put together a real energy policy for the United States of America before the end of this year so we can bring down our reliance on foreign oil, which is a threat not only to our nation's economy, but it is a threat to our national security. 
   So I urge my colleagues, please, today, on the cloture vote, please vote against cloture so that we can get on with other business. And part of that ``other business'' should be, let's put together a bipartisan energy policy. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, my amendment is easy to understand. Rather than reduce taxes by $150 billion over the next 5 years, about $13.5 billion in this particular budget, my amendment would use those dollars to reduce the national debt. Most families and businesses that finally had a surplus of funds like we have would be paying off their debt. Today, 13 cents out of every dollar we spend goes to pay interest on the debt. That is almost as much as we spend on defense, and more than we spend on Medicare. 
   All of the leading economists in this country say we should take the on-budget surplus and use it to pay down the debt. It encourages more savings and investment, and it lowers interest rates, which is a real tax savings. 
   Last, but not least, it fulfills a moral obligation to our children and grandchildren to remove the debt Congress has put on their backs because Congress did not have the courage to either pay for the things it wanted, or do without. 
   We have the resources now. We ought to use those resources to pay down the national debt.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the budget resolution provides a generous increase in spending in education, just as the FY 2000 education appropriations bill did. Basically, this amendment says that within the framework of the budget resolution, IDEA should be given priority. We have increased discretionary spending on education 100 percent during the last 10 years, but during that same period, the most we have spent is 12.6 percent of the cost of IDEA, and we are supposed to be spending 40 percent. This amendment gives priority to IDEA without spending another $31 billion over the next 5 years, as suggested in the underlying amendment.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, earlier I offered an amendment to provide for a tax reduction. At this time, I speak on behalf of the Allard-Enzi-Grams amendment because I believe it is a responsible way in which to deal with the problem of reducing the national debt. 
   First, we need to pay down our national debt so we can decrease our interest payments on that debt, a debt which stands at $5.7 trillion. The way I calculate it, the interest we'll pay this year comes out to over $224 billion. We pay about $600 million a day on interest costs alone. Out of every Federal dollar we spend, 13 cents goes to pay interest on the national debt compared, for example, with 16 cents for national defense and 18 cents for nondefense discretionary spending. We will spend more money on interest this year than we do on Medicare. 
   These numbers make me determined to do all I can to decrease our debt even further. I believe every fiscal decision we make in Congress should be measured against the backdrop of how it will decrease our national debt. And I am not the only one who believes that. In fact, in Congressional testimony in January of this year, CBO Director Dan Crippen stated:  
   Most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying down the debt held by the public, is probably the best thing we can do relative to the economy.  
   On that same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:  
   My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.  
   Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and Main Street and encourages more savings--and we need more savings in this country--and investment which, in turn, fuels productivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest rates which, in my view, is a real tax reduction for the American people. 
   Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the only way we can ensure our Nation will not return to the days of deficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn for the worse or a national emergency arise. As Alan Greenspan has testified before Congress:  
   A substantial part of the surplus ..... should be allowed to reduce the debt, because you can always increase debt later if you wish to, but it's effectively putting away the surplus for use at a later time if you so choose.  
   Many in the Senate have argued that putting the Social Security surplus in the lockbox will be enough to pay down the debt. I remind my colleagues, we will have to use some of the surplus everybody is talking about for paying down the national debt in order to fund reform of the Social Security system, if we are going to solve the problems of Social Security. 
   We cannot keep putting off our responsibilities. If we have the ability, as we do now, we have a moral obligation to pay down the debt. 
   When I go back to Ohio, people say: we're not asking for more tax cuts; I want you to do something about Social Security, Medicare, health care, and if you have some money, for goodness sake, pay down the debt. 
   That is what we do in our own families. If we get a little extra money and we are in debt, we pay down the debt. That is what the people want this Government to do. That is the message I am getting from the people in the State of Ohio. I am sure my colleagues who are supporting this amendment are hearing from the people in their states. 
   Last but not least, I agree with GAO Comptroller General David Walker. In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee last year, he said something that is really very important to those of us who have children and grandchildren, as most of us in this body do, about our obligation to future generations. David Walker said:  
   This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today--  
   We have to make the tough choices today--  
   while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal wave.  
   We should support this amendment. It makes sense. It is good for America, and it is good for fiscal responsibility.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for offering this amendment. He knows and the rest of us know that repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax is not going to solve the problem of high gasoline prices which today confronts this country. In my opinion, the administration's lack of an energy policy and total inability to react to OPEC's production cut has pushed gasoline prices to $2 per gallon in some places in the nation. 
   The fact of the matter is, the American people are angry, and I share their frustration. The real problem we have today is that we do not have an energy policy in this country. 
   Two weeks ago, when Department of Energy officials testified before the Governmental Affairs committee, I asked them whether or not they had an energy policy. I asked them if we were too reliant upon foreign oil. Their answer to that was yes we are too reliant on foreign oil. 
   I said: Your department is predicting that in the next 10 years we are going to be 65-percent reliant on foreign oil. How reliant should we be? Is it 45, 50 percent? 
   They had no answer. 
   I said: As a former Governor, if I had a problem, I would set a number and say it is going to be 45 or 50 and then put a plan together and move forward and get it done.  
   I hope in this debate over whether or not we ought to reduce the gas tax, the administration and Members of Congress take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to come together to look at the environmental concerns, look at the issue of exploration, look at the problems of the stripper well producers in this country who are out of business because the cost of a barrel of oil has been too low. 
   We need to get it all on the table so that we do not have a repeat performance, and so that we are not at the mercy of foreign oil producing nations, some of whom are actually avowed enemies of the United States of America. 
   I've said many times the price is going to go down because the administration is going to put the pressure on these nations. But what I would like to know is, what are the promises they are going to be making in order to get the price down? We ought not to be in this position. 
   I happen to have been chairman of the National Governors' Association when Congress did TEA-21. Most Governors were opposed to the 4.3-cent gas tax in 1993 but we came back and said: If you move that from deficit reduction to the highway trust fund, we will support it. 
   I want everyone to understand that for the donor States--and Ohio is a donor State--without that 4.3 cents, we would not have a guarantee of 90.5 percent of the money we are sending to Washington. This is the way we helped get some of our money back into our State. 
   I think if you ask most of the highway directors of the States in this country, they will tell you that without that 4.3-cent gas tax, they are not going to have any new construction programs. All of the rest of our gas tax money goes for the maintenance and repair of our highways. The new construction is being paid for by that 4.3-cent gas tax. 
   There are some people who say: Don't worry about it because the money will come from the on-budget surplus or from someplace else. My answer to that is, we have a users' tax. The people who use the highways pay the tax for the highways. I do not think it is fair that we should say to the people of the country what we are going to do is reduce the highway users' tax and we are going to make everyone else pay to make up for the tax reduction. 
   I would like to say I am just prayerful that this amendment passes, that it passes overwhelmingly, that we send the message that we are not for repealing the 4.3-cent gas tax and that we take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to come together and develop an energy policy for this great Nation of ours.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the amendment that I have submitted is a simple one. In fact, it's the same one that I offered last year, and it takes the tax cuts proposed in this fiscal year 2001 budget resolution and uses that money, instead, to pay down the debt. 
   Let me say again: under my amendment, we would take $150 billion that is projected to accumulate as a result of our on-budget surpluses over the next five years, and use those funds, not for  tax cuts, but for debt reduction instead. 
   Why should we do this rather than use this money to reduce taxes? 
   First of all, if we pay down the debt, we are going to decrease our interest payments on the national debt--a debt which stands at $5.7 trillion today. This fiscal year, it will cost us more than $224 billion to service our national debt--more than $600 million a day in interest costs alone! 
   Out of every federal dollar that is spent this year, 13 cents goes to pay the interest on the national debt. 
   In comparison: 16 cents goes for national defense; 18 cents goes for non-defense discretionary spending; and 53 cents goes for entitlement spending. 
   We'll spend more on interest this year than we'll spend on Medicare. 
   When I consider these numbers, it makes me determined to do all that I can to decrease our debt even further. 
   That's why I believe that every fiscal decision we make in this Congress should be measured against the backdrop of how it will decrease our $5.7 trillion national debt. And I'm not the only one who believes that. 
   In fact, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee this past January, CBO Director Crippen stated that ``most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying down the debt held by the public, is probably the best thing that we can do relative to the economy.'' 
   And on the very same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said, ``my first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.'' 
   Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main Street. It encourages more savings and investment which, in turn, fuels productivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest rates, which in my view, is a real tax reduction for the American people. 
   Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the only way we can ensure that our nation will not return to the days of deficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn for the worse or a national emergency arise. 
   As Alan Greenspan has testified before Congress, ``a substantial part of the surplus ..... should be allowed to reduce the debt, because you can always increase debt later if you wish to, but it's effectively putting away the surplus for use at a later time if you so choose.'' 
   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose the tax cuts, preferring instead to use the money to increase spending. I believe that spending the surplus is an even worse use of the money. 
   Now, many have argued that putting the Social Security surplus in a ``lock-box'' will be enough to pay down our debt. However, I should remind my colleagues that in the near future, we might not have Social Security surpluses available for debt reduction, because we may need them for Social Security reform, especially if we go to a system of private accounts. 
   We cannot keep putting off our responsibilities. If we have the ability--like we do now--we have a moral obligation to pay back our debts. 
   We must face the fact that because of 30 years of irresponsible fiscal policies our national debt has increased 1,300%. During that time Congress and our Presidents weren't willing to pay for the things they wanted, or, in the alternative, do without those items they could not afford. 
   I agree with General Accounting Office (GAO) Comptroller General David Walker, who, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee last year, said:  
   ..... this generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal wave.  
   As most of my colleagues know, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures show that the United States will achieve a $26 billion on-budget surplus this current fiscal year, FY 2000. 
   However, it is of utmost importance that we oppose the temptation to squander this surplus. 
   In that regard, I have to commend Majority Leader TRENT LOTT for sticking to his guns on not moving forward on a fiscal year 2000 supplemental appropriations bill. He has stated his opposition to a separate bill, preferring instead, to include funding in the regular appropriations bills. 
   And we need to get moving on those bills quickly, especially because of the need for money to ensure our nation's defense readiness, our Kosovo peacekeeping mission and Colombia's drug eradication efforts. 
   All we need to do is look at the version of the supplemental that passed in the House of Representatives to see why we should not move forward with a supplemental bill. Indeed, the House started with the President's request of $5.1 billion, reported a bill out of the Appropriations Committee that was some $9 billion and passed a final bill that was $12.7 billion. 
   Imagine the size of the supplemental once the Senate got through with it? 
   The worst thing that Congress could do now is throw away any portion of that $26 billion on-budget surplus that was achieved in FY 2000 on non-emergency spending. 
   And another reason that we should not pass the supplemental is that it can be argued that $22 billion of the $26 billion on-budget surplus that Congress would be tapping into comes from the Medicare Part A trust fund. 
   Instead of squandering this surplus, let's use it to pay down the debt. It will be our first sizable on-budget surplus that we've been able to use for debt reduction in 40 years, and a truly historical accomplishment. 
   And let's continue to make history by using future on-budget surpluses to pay down our national debt. 
   Mr. President, I believe that if we can pass this amendment, and add it to the fine work that the Budget Committee Chairman has accomplished in this resolution--and with the promise from the Majority Leader on the supplemental--I believe we will have made a real difference. 
   We will have provided a decent budget that should address some of our most pressing problems, and, we will take whatever on-budget surplus dollars that come in and use them to reduce the national debt. Not spending increases, not tax breaks, but simply paying down the debt. 
   Mr. President, again, my amendment is simple: it takes the $150 billion in tax cuts assumed by this budget resolution and instead says to spend it on debt reduction. I urge my colleagues who believe that we should do all that we can to bring down our national debt to support this amendment. 
   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, to introduce a bill that will provide a commonsense approach to promulgating regulations under the Clean Air Act. We are pleased that Senators INHOFE and LANDRIEU have joined us as original cosponsors. We introduce this bill today in a bipartisan manner to increase public health, safety and environmental protection. 
   As a father and grandfather, I understand the importance of ensuring a clean environment for our future generations. Throughout my 33 years of public service, I have demonstrated a commitment to preserving our environment and the health and well-being of all Ohioans. I sponsored legislation to create the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency when I served in the state legislature, and I fought to end oil and gas drilling in the Lake Erie bed. As Governor, I increased funding for environmental protection by over 60 percent. While in the Ohio House of Representatives, I was responsible for creating the Environment and Natural Resources Committee and was honored to serve as the first vice chairman of that committee. 
   In addition, the state of Ohio has made significant improvements in air quality in recent years. When I first entered office as Governor in 1991, most of Ohio's urban areas were not attaining the 1-hour ozone standard. By the time I left, all but one city was in attainment. However, the Cincinnati community has worked together, through a variety of programs, to attain the 1-hour standard and is now awaiting final action by the EPA to redesignate it as in attainment. 
   Overall, the ozone pollution level in Ohio has gone down by 25%, and in many urban areas, it has gone down by more than 50% in the past 20 years. Ohio is doing its part to provide cleaner air. Nevertheless, over the years, I have become more and more concerned that just in order to comply with federal laws and regulations, our citizens, businesses and state and local governments must pay costs that can be inordinately burdensome or totally unnecessary. 
   In the 104th Congress, I worked closely with a coalition of state and local government officials and members of the House and Senate to pass effective safe drinking water reforms. The results of our efforts culminated in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments, legislation which was enacted with broad bipartisan support in 1996. In addition, the bill had the support of environmental organizations, and I was pleased to attend the President's bill-signing ceremony when these reforms were signed into law. In fact, at that time the President praised the bipartisan work and said, ``Today we helped ensure that every family in America will have safe, clean drinking water to drink every time they turn on a faucet or stop at a public water fountain. From now on our water will be safer and our country will be healthier for it.'' 
   This cooperative effort is notable because it showed that a law could include commonsense reforms that make the government more accountable based on public awareness of risks, costs and benefits. I believe it set a key precedent for reform of other environmental regulations. 
   I specifically mention the drinking water program because it is the model for the bill we are introducing today. This bill includes the very same risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis provisions that govern our drinking water. This bill clarifies EPA's obligation to identify risks, consider costs and benefits of a proposed rule and consider incremental costs and benefits of alternative air quality standards. However, EPA would retain flexibility in making final regulatory decisions. 
   If we can agree these tools improve rulemakings for something as important as the water we drink, where a regulatory mistake could endanger millions of lives, they certainly must be good enough to protect the air that we breathe. 
   When I was Governor of Ohio, I became more and more concerned that the EPA was not taking into consideration sound science, costs and benefits during the rulemaking process. I was particularly concerned about the standards for ozone and particulate matter. In fact, I was very concerned that the costs to this country to implement the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and particulate matter far outweighed the benefits to public health and the environment. 
   In fact, according to EPA's own estimates, the costs for implementing the NAAQS standard for ozone exceeded the benefits. The President's own Council of Economic Advisors predicted that the benefits would be small, while the costs of reaching full attainment could total $60 billion. 
   Just last spring, a U.S. appeals court remanded EPA's ozone and PM  
   2.5 standards, ruling that EPA did not justify its decision with sound scientific evidence. Ohio was a party to this lawsuit, which began when I was Governor. The court didn't say that EPA couldn't regulate at these levels, but that EPA didn't give sufficient justification for doing so. 
   That has been my point all along. I have argued that the NAAQS standards were going to be costly and that we didn't even know if making those investments was going to make a difference. I believe this bill would help us avoid some of the legal and legislative wrangling that has occurred in the past few years with respect to how we achieve clean air. 
   Federal agencies should not force businesses and consumers to throw billions of dollars at a problem without knowing if they're hitting the right target. Yet, the EPA is asking all of America to pay for these new regulations simply because the EPA said it is the right thing to do and that it has the authority to do so. However, they have failed to adequately determine the effects of changing the ozone and particulate matter standards. 
   The challenge facing public officials today is determining how best to protect the health of our citizens and our environment with limited resources. We need to do a much better job of ensuring that regulations' costs bear a reasonable relationship with their benefits, and we need to do a better job of setting priorities and spending our resources wisely. 
   I believe the bill we introduce today will help achieve these goals in air regulations. First, I believe this bill will increase the public's knowledge of how and why the EPA makes air regulations. In essence, this bill asks EPA to answer several simple, but vital questions: 
   What science is needed to help us make good decisions? 
   What is the nature of the risk being considered? 
   What are the benefits of the proposed regulation? 
   How much will it cost? 
   And, are there better, less burdensome ways to achieve the same goals? 
   It will also improve the quality of government decision-making by allowing the EPA to set priorities and focus on the worst risks first. Careful thought, reasonable assumptions, peer review and sound science will help target problems and find better solutions. 
   Mr. President, Executive Order 12866 already requires agencies to conduct risk assessment and cost benefit analysis. What this bill will do is clarify  that EPA must conduct risk assessment and cost benefit analysis. This bill does not mandate outcomes. In fact, it does nothing to circumscribe the EPA Administrator's ability to propose and implement regulations to protect public health. Quite simply, it imposes commonsense discipline and accountability in the rulemaking process by confirming that EPA has the flexibility to take risks and costs into consideration when setting standards that are going to affect public health or the environment. 
   I want to make very clear that this bill does not mandate how EPA sets standards. The Administrator will have discretion to set appropriate standards to protect human health. EPA would be required to conduct an analysis of incremental costs and benefits of alternative standards, but would have the flexibility to choose between a standard where the benefits justify its cost or, when health considerations dictate, the maximum feasible standard. 
   In addition, this bill does not keep information about air quality from the public. To the contrary, this bill is a public right-to-know bill that requires EPA to tell the public what information it considered before making a final decision. 
   Nor does the bill ``gut'' the Clean Air Act, as some contend. In fact, it strengthens it by asking EPA to tell the public what the risks are that warrant regulation and what options are available to most efficiently and effectively reduce those risks. This bill will ensure that the Agency sets priorities and it makes sure that our limited resources are being spent to address the real risks to public health and the environment. While many air regulations set by EPA are well intended, we want to ensure that these regulations are going to achieve their purpose and not unnecessarily pass significant burdens onto our citizens and state and local governments. 
   I strongly believe our challenge is to determine how best to meet our obligation of protecting the environment and health of our citizens with the limited financial resources we have available and with the scientific evidence to back up our actions. It should not be the government's policy to initiate or enact regulations simply because it sounds like a good idea. It should be because the evidence shows that it is the right thing to do. 
   I have spoken to my colleague and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee's Clean Air Subcommittee, Senator INHOFE, and he has agreed to include this bill in a package of bills that will be introduced in the near future to advance discussions on Clean Air Act reauthorization.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. First of all, I thank the Senator from Virginia for relieving me in my responsibility of presiding over the Senate, and thank him also for his very kind words about my involvement in this issue that I think is very important to our fellow Americans. I commend the Senator from Virginia for his ability to stand up on an issue that is fairly controversial, and to speak from his heart. I also appreciate the kind words from the Senator from Nevada. 
   I speak today as a Senator from Ohio, and also as a lucky freshman who is chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee in the Environment and Public Works Committee of the Senate. 
   I also speak from a perspective as a former Governor of the State of Ohio, and the former chairman of the National Governors' Association, the chairman of the association when we negotiated TEA 21 with this Congress and the President; one of the most significant pieces of legislation that this Congress passed. As the Senator from Nevada has pointed out, it was a piece of legislation that responded to the tremendous infrastructure needs that we have throughout this great country of ours. Even in spite of that wonderful piece of legislation, we still have some great needs to fill in order to really have a transportation system that will allow us to compete in this 21st century. 
   One of the things we were concerned about in that legislation was the issue of being able to depend upon a flow of money for a certain period of time so that we could properly plan for new highway construction in our States. 
   We needed something that was dependable and something that we could work with our contractors and others that do work in our States, so we could say we are going to be doing this program over a period of years and not have these peaks and valleys that so many States experience. 
   We were pleased Congress decided to take the 4.3-cent gas tax that had been used for deficit reduction and use it for our highways. I might say, in 1993 I was not in favor of Congress using the gas tax for deficit reduction because it was a user's tax. From a federalism point of view, our feeling was that that was a tax that should be earmarked for the user--the user being the people who use our highways--in order to repair and maintain and build new highways, to allow them to move goods, and also to eliminate some of the traffic problems and the pollution problems created by traffic jams that we have throughout the country. 
   I was pleased that Congress decided to take that and say: We are going to make it a user tax. We all felt good about that and we felt relieved. 
   We now have before us the situation where our gas prices have increased substantially. I am not going to go into all the reasons for it. 
   A 4.3-cent reduction in the gas tax, frankly, may have some short-term political benefits. But when people consider the fact that if they drive 15,000 miles per year, and they average 15 miles per gallon, that they will save $43 with our 4.3-cent reduction in the gas tax. They will be very cynical about Congress' response to a problem that they are confronting at the gas pump--particularly when they come to realize that it will have, even on a short-term basis, an interruption in some of the highway projects that are underway throughout this country. 
   As the Senator from Virginia said, in the State of Ohio, we are talking about, over 3 years, $650 million. That 4.3 cents is the construction money that Ohio needs to move forward with their new highway construction. I would suspect in Nevada and Virginia it is the same thing. Other money is used just for maintenance and repair. This is the money we are using for new construction. 
   In addition--this is something that has not been even spoken about--that 4.3 cents, when Congress agreed to allow it to be used for the highway trust fund, was the money that guaranteed donor States, such as Ohio--and I do not know whether the Presiding Officer's State is a donor State or not--but it was the thing that allowed us to be guaranteed 90.5 cents on every $1 we sent to Washington. 
   I want you to know this is a big deal because one of the first things I did when I became Governor of Ohio in 1990 was to say, we are a donor State. At that time, we were only getting back 79 cents per $1. So one of the first things I did was to try to lobby, through the National Governors' Association, an increase for the donor States. You may remember, ISTEA brought up a lot of the donor States. I think we went from 79 cents up to 87 cents. With TEA 21, we are now at 90.5 cents. That is very important in terms of our guaranteed funding. It is also very important in terms of our new construction program. 
   I know there are some who suggest that we use the budget surplus to make up for the money we would lose from reducing the highway gas tax. 
   But the fact of the matter is, if you want to look at the big picture, what we are saying is, we are going to use the budget surplus that could be used to reduce taxes or reduce the national debt, or be used for prescription drug benefits in Medicare, and so many other things--we're going to use that general pot of money to fund highways, which are used by a certain select group of people in this country, mainly, highway users. 
   We are basically saying to the highway users: You are having a problem at the pump. Therefore, we are going to reduce your taxes by 4.3 cents, and we are going to find the money from the general fund of the United States. So we will make everybody in the United States subsidize that 4.3 cents we are reducing on the gas tax. 
   In spite of the fact that I am not happy about the high cost of gasoline, I think the people who use the highways ought to be the ones who pay for the new highways, and the repairs, and for new construction. This bill would say we are going to open up the general fund of the United States and use it to make up the difference. I think from an equitable point of view, that is not fair. I think this proposal, from a public policy point of view, is one that is not well taken. 
   The passage of this reduction may take away from the fact that we have a real problem in this country. The problem in this country is that we have no energy policy. The reason we have the increase in the price of gasoline in this country, in my humble opinion, is the fact that this administration was asleep at the switch. They didn't do their homework. As a result of that, the price of oil crept up. 
   Now they are cramming in every way possible to try to influence the people who supply the oil to bring the price down. What we should be doing is following the leadership of Senator Frank MURKOWSKI and others who have come to the floor of the Senate, and work conscientiously to develop an energy policy for the United States of America. We should be concerned about the fact that we are relying too much upon foreign oil. 
   Last week, Senator THOMPSON had a hearing of the Governmental Affairs Committee which included people from the administration. I asked them: Do you believe we should be less reliant on foreign oil? Their answer came back: Yes. I said: Statistics show we are going to become more reliant on foreign oil. 
   I then asked the question: Do you have a number where you want to be; i.e., 50-percent reliant, 45-percent reliant? They didn't have an answer. They didn't have a number. Then I said to them: Logically, one would say that if you wanted to reduce your dependence on foreign oil, you would set a goal and say we are going to reduce it to 45 percent, and we are going to reduce it by X year, and here is the way we are going to achieve that goal. That would involve opening up more opportunities--ANWR, for example. That would also mean looking at alternative fuels. That would mean looking at our Tax Code to encourage our small oil strippers who can't afford to be in the business, to get back in the business. That would mean having a national policy, that puts all of these things on the table, and that looks at environmental concerns.  
   Yes, we want to protect the environment. Yes, we want to protect our national defense, which is something we're not talking about. The national defense of our country is in jeopardy. Reports have said that. We can't be reliant on these other nations, particularly those who are our enemies. We have been at war with one of them for 10 years now. 
   I think this situation with these high gas prices should be an opportunity, on a bipartisan basis, to bring everybody to the table to develop and start talking about what should be the energy policy of the United States. It should not to be like so many instances around this country where, when something happens, we treat it like a barking dog. You give it a bone, the price will go down, everybody will continue to do the same thing they did before, and we will have another crisis. It is time to get this problem out of the drawer and onto the table, and deal with it in a responsible fashion. We need to set out a plan we can feel confident in that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil and protect our national economy and our national defense. 
   We should not be participating in a short-term proposal to reduce the gas tax which will not make a whole lot of difference 
   and may indeed take the focus away from the real problem; that is, that the United States of America does not have an energy policy.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. I think one of the significant things about this proposal is the number of people who are opposed to it. 
   The AAA--a very respected organization in this country which represents the folks who drive on America's highways--with the high gas price, you would think they would be saying reduce the tax, or, get rid of the tax. But the AAA is saying: No, we don't want you to reduce the tax. We know it is not going to make a lot of difference in terms of the price, and we are more concerned about having highways that are safe and well-maintained and that are repaired. They are more interested in seeing new construction projects undertaken. 
   Last but not least, I want to correct something that was said on the floor. The Senator from Nevada indicated that Governor Bush supports the repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. I talked with Governor Bush yesterday or the day before. He clearly said he did not support--how did he put it? I want to be very careful about how I say this--he is not in favor of reducing the 4.3-cent gas tax. That is what he said, and it was spoken as the Governor of the State of Texas who understands how important highways are. 
   I also point out that the National Governors' Association has said they are opposed to this proposal. The National Association of Counties, the National Council of State Legislators, all of the people who have been dealing with highways and the users are saying this is not going to make a real difference. Let's get on with dealing with this problem.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Still is. In consideration of their giving us more oil, we are shipping them some technology they say they need in order to produce more oil. This is an awful position for the United States of America to be in, that we are at the mercy of someone who has been an enemy of ours, whom we went to war against and lost American lives over, and we are negotiating with them. It underscores how vulnerable we are because of a lack of an energy policy.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Mr. Bruce Akers on the occasion of his retirement as senior vice president for Civic Affairs at KeyBank in Cleveland, OH. Bruce's accomplishments are not limited to his 40 years of service in the banking industry, but extend to the difference he has made in the lives of countless citizens. His decades of leadership and generosity have helped make Cleveland the great city it is today. 
   Bruce has served the public at many levels--in government, the private sector, and in civic organizations. From 1975 to 1977, he served as executive secretary to Cleveland Mayor Ralph Perk. Today Bruce continues to show his dedication to civic responsibility and action in local government through his service as mayor of Pepper Pike, OH. 
   Bruce is also committed to a number of Cleveland's cultural, educational, charitable and civic institutions including service as chairman of the KeyFoundation, a trustee of the Cleveland Council on World Affairs and president of the Cleveland Opera. I don't believe I will ever forget Bruce's ``cameo'' appearance in the Cleveland Opera's rendition of Aida in 1984. He gave a tremendous performance that is still talked about to this day. 
   Bruce's community commitment also extends to service as a trustee of the Citizens League Research institute, membership on the Executive, Central, and Policy Committee's of the Cuyahoga County Republican Party, membership on the Advisory Council of the Alzheimer's Association, membership on the Cleveland Leadership Prayer Breakfast Steering Committee, and chairman of Cleveland's Promise, the local branch of America's Promise which strives to create an environment for a better future. 
   Bruce's belief in volunteerism was recently celebrated in ``Cleveland Live,'' a news and information ``on-line'' publication serving the Cleveland community, where he shared his philosophy on volunteering. Bruce stated, ``volunteering is a four-way win: a win for the organization benefitting from the volunteers' services; a win for the volunteers who gain new perspectives and feel self-fulfilled; a win for the employer because the employee-volunteer is a better-rounded employee; and a win for the community whose quality of life is improved, thanks to effective, dedicated volunteers.'' I could not agree more with Bruce's assessment. 
   In 1975, Bruce's outreach to others earned him the Big Brother of the Year Award from Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Greater Cleveland. In 1993, he received the Volunteer of the Year Award from Leadership Cleveland for his dedication to making Cleveland a better place. Bruce has supported the Salvation Army in a variety of initiatives throughout the years, and for donating his time and energy, in 1997, he received the General William Booth Award, the Salvation Army's highest award to a civilian. 
   Bruce's career is an inspiration to those who look to form a better future through active participation in the community. While I know Bruce Akers will enjoy his retirement with his wife Barbara, I also know that he will not cease giving of himself in service to his fellow man. 
   On behalf of the citizens of Cleveland and of Ohio, I would like to congratulate Bruce Akers and thank him for all he has done for his community and his State.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in 1975, Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which was designed to ensure that all students with disabilities would receive the educational services they needed in order to attend ``mainstream'' schools. This legislation has been effective in increasing access to quality education for disabled students all across the nation. 
   In my state of Ohio, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has meant so much to thousands and thousands of young men and women over the last 25 years. It has opened up whole new worlds and shown them that their disabilities cannot bind the limitless possibilities that are provided by the gift of education. 
   IDEA has helped students like John Hook, from Elgin High School in Marion, Ohio. IDEA has given John's school the resources to hire a special education teacher who is able to help John with his reading and writing. 
   Before IDEA, students with learning disabilities like John might have dropped out, but now, many are thriving. And because of the help he's received and his hard work, John is on his school's honor roll and is ``on track'' for college. 
   IDEA has also been a tremendous help to Todd Carson, an 18 year old student from Highland High School in Highland Local School District outside Medina, Ohio. Todd has Cerebral Palsy and is confined to a wheelchair. Todd is unable to write and he cannot use a keyboard to communicate. 
   Through IDEA, Highland District was able to purchase a speech recognition program called ``Dragon Dictate'' which can be used to control a word processor. This has been like a ray of sunshine for Todd. Now, Todd has the ability to take class notes and write papers. Dragon Dictate also lets him use the Internet and send e-mail. This program has been a big difference for Todd, allowing him to read, write and participate in class. 
   I am pleased with what we've been able to do with IDEA in Ohio. Before its passage, there were close to 25,000 children who were institutionalized in Ohio because of conditions like Cerebral Palsy and autism. Now, according to the Ohio Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities, there are no kids institutionalized in Ohio. IDEA is a big factor in this success because instead of being hidden-away and forgotten about, these kids are in school--learning and thriving--preparing to add their contributions to society. 
   However, even with all the success of IDEA, the thousands and thousands it has benefitted, there is a startling reality to this program that no longer can be ignored: IDEA is crushing our schools financially. 
   Many of our state and local governments have found that the costs of serving handicapped students are typically 20% to 50% higher than the average amount spent per pupil. This, in itself, is not the problem; state and local governments understand that students with disabilities require different, and many times, expensive needs. 
   Congress, too, understood the expense involved when it passed IDEA, promising that the federal government would pay up to 40% of the costs associated with the program. 
   Congress said, we think IDEA is so needed as a national priority, that we will pay up to 40% of the costs. 
   The problem rests in the fact that the federal government has not provided nearly as much funding as they told state and local leaders they would provide, and which our children need. Indeed, in fiscal year 2000, the federal government only provides enough funds to cover 12.6% of the educational costs for each handicapped child, not the 40% it promised. 
   As in past years, our State and local governments will be forced to pay the leftover costs. That is what is going to happen. They are going to have to pay that leftover cost. 
   Because the Federal Government has not lived up to its expectations, IDEA amounts to a huge unfunded mandate. When I was Governor of Ohio, I fought hard for passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act so that circumstances such as this could be avoided. 
   I was one of only a handful of State and local leaders who lobbied Congress to pass legislation that would provide relief to our State and local governments. I felt so strongly about this that in 1995 I asked Senator Dole to make unfunded mandate relief legislation S. 1. I was privileged to be in the Rose Garden 5 years ago this month when the President signed S. 1 into  law. I will never forget the President saying how opposed he was to unfunded mandates since he had been a Governor for a number of years and had seen the effects of such unfunded mandates. 
   Unfortunately, the President has done nothing--nothing--to address one of the most costly unfunded mandates; that is, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
   The President's fiscal year 2000 budget contains $40.1 billion in discretionary education funding. That is more than a 37-percent increase over the fiscal year 2000 discretionary education total, including advanced funding, and nearly double the $21.1 billion in discretionary education spending allocated by the Federal Government in 1991--just 10 years ago. 
   Think about that for a moment. The President is looking to increase federal education discretionary spending so that it will have grown by almost 100% in ten years. And that's at a time when inflation will have grown only 20.7% during the same ten years. That's incredible! 
   What's even more incredible is what we're doing to our states and localities. Of the discretionary total for fiscal year 2000, we allocated $4.9 billion for IDEA. If we had funded IDEA at the 40% level that Congress had promised in 1975, we would have allocated $15.7 billion in fiscal year 2000. In essence, we have passed along a $10.8 billion mandate on our state and local governments. 
   Think about it--a $10.8 billion mandate. 
   For anyone who thinks about it, they are asking, What does that mean? That is more than we spent on the entire budget for the Department of the Interior. Think of it. 
   When our Nation's Governors were in Washington recently for the annual Governors' Association winter meeting, one of their more prominent issues--I would say the most prominent issue they brought up with Congress and the President--was the need to fully fund IDEA. 
   The Governors made it patently clear that if the Federal Government paid their 40-percent share of IDEA, it would free up $10.8 billion across America and would allow them to better respond to the education needs in their respective States. 
   They also pointed out that many of them were building schools, hiring teachers, and doing most of the things Washington wants to do with that $10.8 billion that should have gone to the States to fund IDEA. 
   With the help of the Ohio School Boards Association and the Buckeye Association of School Administrators, I am contacting superintendents of education, leaders from urban, suburban, and rural districts in every part of Ohio--I have a letter going out to all of them--asking them about their experience with the fiscal impact of IDEA and their advice on what would be the best way the Federal Government could be a better partner. 
   The main question I have asked Ohio's educators is: What will help you more--fully funding the Federal commitment to IDEA, or funding at the Federal level programs that, by their very nature, are the responsibility of our State and local governments, such as hiring new teachers, building new schools, and a host of other programs that may or may not be needed in school districts across America? 
   I am going to be reporting back later this spring with the results of that survey. In the meantime, I believe it is incumbent on the Senate, as it considers the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to find money to fully fund IDEA. This body for sure should not support expensive new Federal education programs until IDEA is fully funded. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the administration released its budget for fiscal year 2001--its last and its biggest, totaling $1.8 trillion and proposing a whole host of new programs. 
   So begins our annual budget process. 
   From now until September 30, Congress will conduct dozens of hearings and hold countless meetings, while members of both Houses deliver innumerable speeches and spend long hours of debate over every subtle nuance of the Federal budget process. 
   Over the next 8 months, Congress will consider a budget resolution, a budget reconciliation package and as many as 13 separate appropriations bills--the latter only if we do not combine those appropriations bills into one massive spending bill, as has been the practice in recent years. 
   By the time Congress adjourns--currently scheduled for October 6--a majority of votes taken in the Senate will relate to the budget process. 
   Indeed, as my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, has pointed out, 73% of the Senate's votes in 1996 were budget-related, 65% in 1997, and 51% in 1998. It is no wonder--each year, it is quite common for the same subject to be voted upon 3 or 4 times during the course of the entire budget process. 
   Despite the inordinate amount of time and effort that Congress will put into fashioning a budget that will meet our Nation's spending needs in a fiscally responsible way, a veto threat still looms on each of the appropriations bills if spending does not approach what the President wants. 
   At that point, high-stakes negotiations between the Congress and the President will ensue. In an effort to avoid a Government shutdown--and the blame that goes with it--these negotiations inevitably yield a spending compromise that neither Congress nor the President particularly likes, but both agree is necessary. 
   It is a heck of a way to run a railroad, but what is really unbelievable is this whole process is repeated each year. 
   I say enough is enough. It's time to bring rationality to our nation's budget process. 
   It's a fact that Congress spends too large a portion of its time debating and voting on items related to the Federal budget. Meanwhile, most other Congressional functions are not given proper attention. 
   We need to reestablish our priorities so we may effectively do the work of the people, make sure that the Federal Government is running at peak efficiency and deliver value, which is quality service for the least amount of money. 
   I believe we have an excellent opportunity to do that this year. 
   One of the first bills I cosponsored when I became a Senator was a measure introduced by Senator PETE DOMENICI that would establish a 2-year budget--just like we have in about 20 States including the State of Ohio. I believe enactment of this bill, S. 92, will provide an important tool in the efficient use of Federal funds while strengthening Congress' proper oversight role. 
   Because Congress produces annual budgets, Congress does not spend nearly as much time as it should on oversight of the various Federal Departments and agencies due to the time and energy consumed by the budget resolution, budget reconciliation, and appropriations process. 
   Not only is this a problem for Congress, but each executive branch agency and department must spend a significant amount of its time on each annual budget cycle. 
   Again, as my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, pointed out in his statement on S. 92, the executive branch spends 1  year putting together a Federal budget, 1 year explaining that Federal budget before Congress, and 1 year implementing the budget eventually passed by Congress. 
   Even the most diligent Cabinet Secretary cannot keep track of all the oversight he or she is supposed to accomplish if they are trapped in this endless budget cycle. 
   A biennial budget will help Congress and the executive branch avoid this lengthy process. Since each particular Congress lasts only 2 years, a biennial budget would allow us to consider a 2-year funding proposal during 1 year, while reserving the second year for the Government oversight portion of our job. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and Restructuring in the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have noted that even though the General Accounting Office conducts numerous reports documenting Government inefficiencies that need to be corrected, most GAO reports sit on the shelf because there is no time to conduct detailed hearings. 
   When oversight hearings are held, nearly everyone in the executive branch knows--from career bureaucrats to Cabinet Secretaries--that they need only weather the immediate storm when they are asked to come to the Hill to testify. 
   That is because once they answer the criticisms that have been leveled in these GAO reports, and explain how they are going to improve the situation, it is over; the worst has passed. Rarely do they have to worry about followup hearings to make sure they have implemented the proper remedies because they know Congress just will not have the time to conduct future hearings. 
   Unfortunately, that reality can lead to problems later on that impact public safety or national security. 
   Last year, the Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings regarding Dr. Wen Ho Lee and the security situation at the Los Alamos National Lab. I was shocked to learn that for 20 years we have had a problem with security at the Department of Energy, and no one did anything about it. But GAO knew: they had released 31 major reports on nuclear-security problems at the Department since 1980. 
   Congress needs the time to conduct proper oversight--including followup investigations--in order to make sure that situations like this do not repeat. Without having to devote the majority of its time and energy to annual budget bills, Congress will be able to make sure that the Federal Government operates harder and smarter and does more with less. I am confident that the Senate will pass S. 92--biennial budget legislation--during this session of Congress. 
   Regardless of the Senate's actions on passing this bill, I believe the House of Representatives needs to be more engaged in this process. Unfortunately, the news reports that I have seen indicate that there is not much support at the leadership level in the House for such a bill. 
   I urge my colleagues in the House to reconsider their views on biennial budget legislation, or in the alternative, pass a better legislative proposal. Congress should not continue to come up with reasons why budget reform can't pass, but find ways to make sure that it can. 
   It should be plainly obvious to my colleagues in both Houses--including those on the Appropriations Committees--that the annual appropriations process is not working. As I stated earlier, each year Congress ends up negotiating a spending deal that is higher than Congress wants in order to avoid the Presidential veto pen. If we are ever going to get a handle on our debt, we have to end this bad public policy. It would definitely be in the best interest of our Nation. 
   I believe this biennial budget legislation, S. 92, is one of the most important pieces of legislation we could consider this year. I will continue to press for its passage. 
   For my colleagues who are tired of the seemingly endless budget and appropriations cycles and are frustrated at the inability to devote enough time to the oversight duties of their committees, I urge them to join in cosponsoring this legislation. I also urge my House colleagues to review the merits of the biennial budget process and act upon legislation as expeditiously as possible for the good of America. 
   The point I am making is this. It is time for this Congress to adopt a 2-year budget cycle instead of the one we have had for too many years. It will help us do a better job in terms of budgeting and certainly get us to do the oversight that is so badly needed by this Congress.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, released figures last week showing that the United States is on track to achieve a $23 billion on-budget surplus this fiscal year. If CBO's figures hold up, then the United States will have achieved a true, on-budget surplus for the first time in 40 years. 
   In addition, the United States could enjoy an on-budget surplus ranging somewhere between $11 billion and $69 billion in fiscal year 2001, depending on which set of figures you use. 
   But what I find truly amazing is what CBO reports could occur over the next 10 years. Under the most realistic assumptions about discretionary spending, CBO estimates we could achieve an on-budget surplus of nearly $900 billion. 
   As good as this sounds, we must remember not to get ahead of the game. Just because we could obtain an on-budget surplus, does not mean we have obtained an on-budget surplus. 
   Whatever on-budget surplus we actually achieve this year--and the years that follow--is predicated on the ability of Congress and the President to resist the urge to spend it. Unfortunately, with an amount of unobligated money that large, there will be calls from all segments of society and Government to increase funding for this program, or create that program, or institute massive tax cuts. 
   That is why the very first priority for this year must be to oppose the temptation to squander this year's surplus on a pork-laden supplemental appropriations bill. I implore my colleagues to maintain the necessary discipline that will let these surpluses grow. 
   Even though I am cautiously optimistic about the on-budget surpluses projected for this year and the next, I still do not believe we should treat CBO's projections as the gospel truth as we plan 10 years, or even 5 years, down the road. 
   That is because, as most any economist will tell you, the only thing certain about projections is their uncertainty. 
   In testimony before the House Banking Committee last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:  
   ......it's very difficult to project with any degree of conviction when you get out beyond 12, 18 months.  
   In addition, he stated:  
   Projecting five or ten years out is a very precarious activity, as I think we have demonstrated time and time again.  
   Last July, CBO Director Dan Crippen said, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee that ``10-year budget projections are highly uncertain'' and that ``economic forecasting is an art that no one has truly mastered.'' And that is from the Director of CBO--the man in charge of making Congress' surplus projections. 
   More alarming, as we all know, these surplus projections don't reflect the ticking time bomb of Social Security and Medicare costs that will explode when the baby boomers begin to retire--something that Congress and the President must address now. 
   More importantly as we bask in the euphoria of these projected surpluses, we must not forget the sobering fact that we still have a $5.7 trillion national debt--a national debt that costs us more than $224 billion a year to service. That is more than $600 million a day in interest costs alone. 
   Out of every Federal dollar spent, 13 cents goes to pay the interest on the national debt. 
   In comparison: 16 cents goes for national defense, 18 cents goes for nondefense discretionary spending, and 53 cents goes for entitlement spending. 
   Here is the chart. I think most people are not familiar with it. This shows where the Federal dollar goes: net interest, 13 percent; national defense, 16 percent; nondefense discretionary spending, 18 percent; and 53 percent for mandatory spending. 
   Think about it. We spend more on interest each year than we spend on Medicare. It is easy to understand our difficulty in reforming Medicare or providing a prescription drug benefit or funding countless other beneficial programs when the money we could use to pay for such programs or activities is being spent on interest. 
   That is why I believe every fiscal decision we make from here on must be measured against the backdrop of how it will decrease our $5.7 trillion national debt. 
   In fact, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee last week, CBO Director Crippen stated:  
   Most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying down the debt held by the public, is probably the best thing that we can do relative to the economy.  
   On the very same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said,  
   My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.  
   Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main Street. It encourages more savings and investment which we really need in the country, and, in turn, it fuels productivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest rates, which in my view, is a ``bird-in-the-hand'' cost reduction for most Americans, and better than the ``two-in-the-bush'' tax-reduction proposals floating around this Congress. 
   Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the only way we can ensure that our Nation will not return to the days of deficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn for the worse or a national emergency arise. 
   As Alan Greenspan recently testified:  
   A substantial part of the surplus.....should be allowed to reduce the debt, because you can always increase debt later if you wish to, but it's effectively putting away the surplus for use at a later time if you so choose.  
   Even as most economists agree that the best use of any surplus is to apply it against the debt, the bad news is, the President and some of my colleagues believe the best use of this possible surplus is to increase spending and provide tax expenditures. 
   By merely proposing his plan, as he outlined at his State of the Union Address, the President has assured a path of confrontation both with this Congress and within this Congress. 
   I believe that Congress and the President need to avoid such partisan politics and work together on reaching an agreement as to how best to utilize these surpluses. 
   Further, I believe the best option available to us is to agree on a realistic  adjustment to the 1997 budget caps, do the best we can to respond to the needs of the American people within that limit, and use the balance of the surplus to pay down the national debt. 
   If we can't start paying down our national debt now, with the longest period of economic growth in the history of our Nation, with record low unemployment and low inflation, when will we ever be able to do it? 
   We have a moral obligation to do it now. 
   I am ashamed, and so should my colleagues be ashamed, that because of 30 years of irresponsible fiscal policies our national debt has increased 1,300 percent. My granddaughters, Mary Faith and Veronica, and my 2-week-old grandson, John, have each inherited a debt of nearly $21,000 because Members of Congress and our Presidents weren't willing to pay for the things they wanted, or, in the alternative, do without those items they could not afford. 
   I agree with General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Walker, who, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee said:  
   This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal wave.  
   Fortunately, that message is starting to be heard. Last month, Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, announced his goal of eliminating all federal debt held by the public by 2015. Not soon enough, but Speaker Hastert gets it. And I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join us in supporting debt reduction as our primary fiscal goal because it is in the best interest of this nation. 
   In order to ensure fiscal discipline and prevent us from ``backsliding'' into the fiscal mess we've been in for the past 30-plus years, I am introducing today a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, or what I like to refer to as the ``backbone budget amendment.'' 
   I believe it is the only guarantee that we will never return to the days of deficit spending and the accumulation of debt, and we should do it now. Now! The time is right, and those of my colleagues who have championed this in the past should seize upon this opportunity to join me in this effort, because, as they know, or should know, a Balanced Budget Amendment is the most effective method of keeping a handle on spending. 
   My proposal is a departure from previous proposals by stipulating that Social Security surpluses be exempt from deficit calculations. That is, a true balanced budget must be achieved without using off-budget Social Security surpluses to finance spending in other areas. A federal balanced budget constitutional amendment will help Congress and the President make the hard decisions because they will no longer be able to tap the Social Security surplus. 
   It is a simple matter of fact that without constitutional and statutory balanced budget provisions at the state and local level, many of our state and local governments would be in the same degree of debt as the federal government. 
   And let me just touch on my own personal experience, because I've had to deal with very real financial problems in my state. Without a charter provision and a constitutional requirement, it would have been virtually impossible for me to bring the City of Cleveland out of the default I inherited when I was Mayor, and to deal with Ohio's $1.5 billion deficit when I was Governor. 
   Think about it--if we had a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, and if we were to have a President who didn't want to make tough budget choices on his or her own, the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment would give the President the backbone he or she needs to make those tough choices. 
   And believe me, I've discovered after just 1 year in the Senate, this Congress needs the ``Backbone Budget Amendment'' to force us to make those tough choices. If we pass the amendment, I'm confident that three-fourths of our state legislatures would ratify it without question, because most of them are required by laws in their respective states to balance their budgets. 
   And there is one other thing we need to do now, and that is enact Senator DOMENICI's biennial budget legislation. 
   I am a co-sponsor of this legislation because I believe it is an important tool to help use federal funds more efficiently and strengthen Congress' proper oversight role. 
   Right now, we spend far too much time debating the federal budget, particularly discretionary spending. Conversely, we don't devote nearly as much time as we should on oversight of the federal agencies because of the time and energy consumed by the budget resolution, budget reconciliation and the appropriations process. 
   Indeed, when he introduced his legislation last year, Senator DOMENICI pointed out in his statement that in 1996, 73% of the votes taken in the Senate that year were related to the budget--often the same subject is voted upon 3 or 4 times a year. 
   A biennial budget will help Congress and the Executive Branch avoid the annual, lengthy budget and appropriations process and allow us to increase our attention on the government oversight portion of our job. 
   As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and Restructuring, I have noted that GAO report after GAO report sits on the shelf and no one does anything about them because no one has the time to conduct the follow-up. 
   And from career bureaucrats to Cabinet Secretaries, nearly everyone in the Executive branch knows that when they're asked to come up to the Hill for an oversight hearing, once it's over, it's over--rarely do they have to worry about any follow-up hearings because Congress just doesn't have the time. 
   Unfortunately, that reality can create problems that impact public safety or national security. 
   As a freshman Senator, I was shocked to learn when we had hearings this past year regarding Dr. Lee and the situation at the Los Alamos National Lab that for 20 years we've had a problem with security at the Department of Energy, and no one did anything about it. But GAO knew: they've released 31 major reports on nuclear-security problems at the Department since 1980. That's just incredible! 
   We need the time for oversight, and the 2-year budget cycle will make that possible, just like it did when I was Governor of Ohio. 
   There is an old saying, ``prepare for tomorrow, today.'' The President and Congress must make a real commitment to fiscal responsibility, and if we need an example, all we have to do is emulate what most American families do when they have extra money. They don't go out and start spending wildly. They look to pay off their debts--their credit cards, their loans and their mortgages. 
   With our booming economy and with inflation and unemployment at historically low levels, there exists the best opportunity in a generation to pay down the national debt, reform and preserve Social Security and Medicare and ensure that our Nation meets its constitutional obligations. Such a legacy of fiscal responsibility would be the best possible gift we could give to our children and grandchildren, and to our Nation. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of my legislation in the RECORD.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as the first session of the 106th Congress comes to a close, I want to remind my colleagues that the aftermath of our nation's largest foreign policy initiative this year and a 78-day air war, will be our nation's biggest foreign policy concern next year. 
   As my colleagues are aware, I opposed our nation's ``sign or we'll bomb'' diplomacy that ultimately led to the decision to conduct the air war over Kosovo and Serbia earlier this year. Instead, I believed that we should have done all that we could to negotiate a real diplomatic solution. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the conflict, I came to the Senate floor and commented that ``some good always blows in an ill wind.'' 
   The ``good'' that I saw in the ill wind of the bombing campaign was the opportunity for NATO and the United States to provide the impetus for a lasting peace throughout Southeastern Europe. Since that time, my staff and I have spent hours working hard to ensure that some good does blow in and that we do not lose this opportunity to promote peace, stability and prosperity in that region of our world. 
   To ensure the future of Southeast Europe, it is important to understand its past. Every student of history is well aware that this century's two  most horrific wars had deep roots in the Balkans, but few people are aware of the level of violence, bloodshed, hatred and destruction that has been commonplace in the region for centuries. Indeed, the Balkans have been the site of numerous wars and countless battles, and have been fought over by every major regional power since the days of the Roman legions. 
   Over the last 10 years, regional ethnic tensions have resulted in yet another nightmare for the people of the Balkans. And for the third time this century, Europe, reluctantly, has turned its attention to their southern neighbors. 
   Their concern can be attributed to self-interest; an attempt to get Southeast Europe to settle down so as to avoid any possible spillover that could bring unrest to their nations, and a genuine concern over the ethnic cleansing and human rights violations in the region. To do this, Europe has involved the international community, and in particular, the United States, which, for the first time in our history, has immersed itself politically and militarily in the region. 
   Our willingness to get involved and lead should have come earlier. Indeed, when conflicts began in Bosnia in the early 1990's, it was reported that a key foreign policy official of the Bush Administration made the statement that ``we have no dog in this fight.'' History records that nothing could have been further from the truth. According to Ambassador Richard Holbrooke in his book, ``To End A War'':  
   Europe believed it could solve Yugoslavia without the United States; Washington believed that, with the Cold War over, it could leave Yugoslavia to Europe. Europe's hour had not dawned in Yugoslavia; Washington had a dog in this particular fight.  
   The overconfidence of Europe and the disengagement of the United States contributed greatly to the tragedy of Slavonia, Krijna and Bosnia-Herzegovina. When we finally realized it was important for the U.S. to get involved, we dealt with, and thus, legitimatized three war criminals--Slobodan Milosevic, Franco Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic--at the Dayton Peace Accords. 
   Unfortunately, the legitimitization of Milosevic caused us to continue to have a relationship with him at a time when we should have been working with opposition leaders to get rid of him. Then, when he showed his true colors, we were reluctant to be as aggressive as we should have been. We misjudged him, we underestimated him, and now we're paying the price for our mistake. 
   As a result, we have spent at least $18 billion in operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia and elsewhere. We will, no doubt, spend billions more. In addition, we have placed a tremendous strain on the equipment and personnel of our Armed Forces due to our past and present involvement in peacekeeping missions in Southeast Europe. Also, the State Department has paid an incredible amount of attention to the Balkans. And finally, we have complicated our relations with other nations on the international scene--primarily, Russia and China.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the trade legislation package which constitutes the manager's amendment to H.R. 434, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This trade legislation will provide economic opportunity to millions of people in the United States and throughout the world. 
   Under this package, African and Caribbean nations will be able to use trade as a tool to spur economic development where foreign aid and other means clearly have not worked. Stronger economies in these two regions of the world will, in turn, lead to bigger markets for U.S. exports, and consequently more and better paying jobs for American workers. 
   On the issue of open foreign markets for U.S. products, I would like to express my support for an amendment on carousel retaliation being offered by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DEWINE. If the newly formed World Trade Organization and the promise of a rules-based system of international trade is to survive, then we cannot--and should not--tolerate flagrant disregard for internationally agreed trading rules by other WTO members such as the European Union. We need to use the tools that are now available to us to ensure that our trading partners comply with WTO decisions. And its important to those of us who believe in free trade that the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce use all the tools available to them to guarantee that we have fair trade. Too often we have amendments like Senator DEWINE's amendment-- which I have co-sponsored--because the U.S. trade representative has not been as aggressive as they should be and they do not use the tools they have been given by Congress. 
   This is very important, because trade is the economic lifeblood of the United States. Twelve million American jobs depend directly on exports. And exports are a major reason why our economy continues to do so well. In fact, one-third of our economic growth since 1992 can be attributed directly to exports. 
   Ohio is a textbook example of why international trade is good for America. When I was Governor, I had four goals in the area of economic development--agribusiness, science and technology, tourism and international trade. We pursued each of these aggressively in order to maximize Ohio's business potential, especially in the trade arena. 
   For example, Ohio has outperformed the nation in terms of the growth of exports to our NAFTA trading partners. Since 1993, U.S. exports to Canada have grown 54 percent and U.S. exports to Mexico have grown 90 percent, while Ohio exports to Canada have grown 64 percent and Ohio exports to Mexico have grown 101 percent. 
   Thanks in part to such trade-liberalizing agreements as NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of GATT, overall Ohio exports have risen 103 percent in just the last decade. 
   And because export-related jobs tend to require higher-skilled workers and provide higher-paying salaries, when America's exports of goods and services increase, so do the number and quality of American jobs. Just in Ohio, the increase in exports has created 182,000 jobs over the past ten years. And these export-related jobs tend to pay, on average, 15% more than a typical private sector job. 
   Eliminating trade barriers has not only helped Ohio companies sell more overseas, but it has also allowed more foreign companies to invest in Ohio, creating more, good paying jobs for Ohioans. According to Site Selection magazine, from 1991-1997, Ohio had more growth in non-U.S. owned firms than any other state--some 300 new manufacturing facilities and plant expansions took place during that time. 
   In addition to creating more, better-paying jobs, trade openness has an enormous impact on the earnings for average Americans who invest in companies that increase their international trade presence. These earnings help increase the amount of money people have to reinvest in the growth of our economy or to invest in their savings, retirement and education funds. 
   This chart lists 35 of the biggest U.S. corporations as measured in market value. None of these companies is majority-owned by a family or individual. In other words, they are all in the stock market. For 25 of these 35 companies, trade makes up more than one-third of their global operations, and for 12 of these companies, international trade accounts for more than half of global sales or revenues--including Cincinnati-based Procter and Gamble, which can attribute about 51 percent of its global sales to international operations. Thus, in the case of Procter and Gamble, there is a genuine interest on the part of thousands of employees, and even more thousands of individual shareholders, in the ability to expand internationally. 
   In my State of Ohio, there are many more companies that understand that robust two-way trade is the key to creating more jobs and increased investment. These are companies like--Cincinnati Milacron, Federated, American Electric Power, The Limited, Inc. and Intimate Brands, TRW Inc., Chiquita Brands, The Andersons, Battelle, ElectraForm, General Electric Jet Engines, Lincoln Electric, NCR, R.G. Barry Corporation and hundreds of other small businesses, many of which traveled with me when I was governor, on nine trade missions around the world. 
   In Ohio and across America, the future of companies like these is a crucial link to the vitality of our communities because of the jobs they support and their contribution to the local tax base. In addition, these companies provide philanthropic support to local hospitals, schools and colleges and universities as well as countless charities and institutions. 
   The support these companies provide is linked directly to the overall quality of life in many of our communities. For example, Atlanta would be a much different city without the civic and charitable contributions of a company like Coca-Cola. Companies like Coca Cola--their workers, their stockholders--know that 95% of their potential customers for their products live outside the United States, and that's why trade expansion is so fundamental to the economic future of all Americans. 
   Many of my colleagues may ask why the average American should care about the importance of trade and the expansion of markets overseas. The reason they should care is because it's average Americans who are the stakeholders--the millions upon millions of individual investors. 
   Indeed, according to a survey in this past Sunday's Washington Post, nearly half of all Americans are invested in the stock market. Twenty-two million American households, or roughly 22%, are invested in corporate America through employer-sponsored retirement plans. And those Americans referred to as ``Generation X''--individuals in their 20s--reportedly hold 80 percent of their assets in stocks. Baby boomers, who own about half of all outstanding stock, have about 57 percent of their assets in equities.  
   As these figures show, international trade does matter to the average American. The economic stimulus sparked through increased international trade and investment allows millions of Americans to plan for their children's college education, for retirement nest eggs and for long-term financial security. 
   While the passage of this legislation is important to the economic future of America's workers and citizen stock-holders, it will also provide a lasting impact on the economic and political development of our African and Central American trading partners--an impact that is sure to fulfill our hopes for world peace and prosperity. 
   With respect to increased U.S. trade and investment in the nations of Africa and the Caribbean, it is far better to stimulate the economies of the nations of these two regions than to simply offer these nations foreign aid year after year. Increasing investment and trade opportunities in these regions means that more people can work and raise their own standard of living. 
   It's like the old adage ``give a man a fish, and he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime.'' 
   International trade not only allows nations to become productive members of the world community, but it is probably the best way to ensure international stability. 
   In fact, back in 1994, U.N. Secretary General Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali visited Columbus, Ohio and I said to him that ``nations that trade together, stay together and help sustain world peace.'' 
   Promoting peace and prosperity through trade was one of the aspects I pursued on each of my nine foreign trade missions when I was Governor of Ohio, including trips to India, Thailand, Chile, Hungary and China. 
   Unfortunately, that particular aspect of international trade is too often ignored. We ignore the impact of international trade on stability and peace in the world. 
   What amazes me, Mr. President, is that so many so called protectionists lament about deplorable conditions in the world's poor nations, and this Nation, the United States of America, doesn't respond to the needs of people in Africa and other parts of the world. Yet it is these protectionists who are content to criticize free trade proponents for wanting to take down trade barriers, invest in poorer nations, and provide the tools for economic growth, jobs, and self-reliance in those countries. There is no way the U.S. Government can provide the billions of dollars needed for these countries to develop and raise the standard of living for their people. It can only be done through private investment. The leaders of 47 African nations know this fact, and that is why they want us to support this trade measure. 
   As Senator BREAUX pointed out earlier today, international trade also contributes to the political stability of the countries in the world. Think about what has happened in South America since we opened up our economic relationships with them over the last number of years. 
   This trade legislation will help drive an economic expansion in Africa, as well as for our neighbors in the Caribbean and Central America. In addition, it will provide for the future of an energetic, export-driven American economy. It will sustain and create good-paying, high-quality jobs in Ohio and across America and allow millions of Americans to save and invest for their children's education and their retirement security. This legislative package stands on its own merits. It was unanimously reported out of the committee, and I really believe it deserves the support of our colleagues. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to John Chafee. Although I am a new Member of the Senate, I worked with John for many years as Governor of Ohio and as vice chairman and chairman of the National Governors' Association. I worked with him to reform Medicaid and welfare and to reform our laws to protect the environment. 
   I always found him to be a gentleman, a thoughtful man who listened and gave a fair hearing, whether it was in his office or before his committee. I also found him to be a man of profound principle with a deep and abiding sense of care for the less fortunate and the environment. 
   No environmental legislation emerged from this Congress without his imprint. I am sure he looked at the improving environment in this country as part of his public service legacy. In particular, I remember working closely with him on the effort to reform the Safe Drinking Water Act. I was one of the leads for the Governors of the State and local government coalition, and John, of course, was chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
   John was a visionary leader insisting on enhancing protection of public health and, for the first time, requiring the use of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment in setting environmental standards. 
   When we in the State and local government community started out, we were told we wouldn't succeed; that the environmental community would never accept these far-reaching reforms. 
   However, due to John's hard work and credibility, we did succeed and the enactment of the bill was celebrated at The White House. The result was that the bill was viewed as a model for environmental reform by state and local elected officials and as an advancement in the protection of public health by the environmental community. 
   Since I arrived in the Senate earlier this year, I have been privileged to serve on John's Environment and Public Works Committee. We had many oars in the water, so to speak, bills that we were working on. I am saddened that I did not have more of an opportunity to work with John as a colleague here in the Senate, as so many others did, who have spoken so eloquently of their high regard and treasured friendship with him. 
   However, it has been a privilege to work with him and serve with him. I have learned from him and his example. There is no one who ran a better or fairer hearing than John. When John chaired a hearing, you could count that it would start on time. In fact, I tried to get there before him to let him know that first, I respected his chairmanship and, second, to take advantage of his ``early bird'' rule. For those of you who are unaware of the chairman's ``early bird rule,'' it was his way of specially recognizing those who made the effort to show up on time for his hearings. The ``early bird rule'' provided that he would recognize Senators in the order they arrived--regardless of seniority--although on occasion he did make exceptions if a ``late arrival'' had a special issue to bring before the committee. 
   John reminded me of my father-in-law--if you weren't 5 minutes early for a scheduled meeting, he would be standing there waiting for you while looking at his watch. 
   I have decided that in the future I will no longer refer to the ``early bird rule,'' but will begin a new tradition honoring the chairman by now referring to the ``Chafee rule.'' 
   Others have spoken of John's military and civic service to his country with beautiful oratory, but I simply want to say that as a freshman he was my role model. John Chafee was an honest, hard working, decent, principled, and straight-forward man. I will miss him and the Senate will surely be the less for his loss.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to address in the Senate some matters that I believe are important as we approach the end of the fiscal year 2000 appropriations cycle. 
   Foremost among my concerns is the increasing role the Federal Government plays in our everyday lives in the area of education, and the budgetary impact on our nation that results from assuming this and other roles more properly and constitutionally the responsibilities of State and local government. 
   I have witnessed during my first year in the Senate a number of positively amazing and enlightening experiences that have made me feel proud to be able to serve in this body and at this level of government. Yet my pride is increasingly tempered by subjects which have caused me great concern. 
   You needn't be an experienced member of the Senate, a Governor, or public official to appreciate the dire situation our nation faces with regard to the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. However, as public officials and stewards of our Nation's finances, I believe that we must be all the more vigilant of this reality since every decision we make at this level in some way will impact whether we as a nation will be able to honor the commitments we have made. 
   I wish to highlight some recent examples as to how we in the Senate have, I believe, erroneously prioritized with respect to our federal responsibilities. 
   For example: Mr. President without a doubt, improvement in the quality of education is a top concern for parents, teachers, and employers across the country--in fact, improvement in the quality of education ought to be our number one priority as a nation. 
   As with all issues, when discussing education we must ask two key questions: 1. What level of government is responsible? 2. How are we going to pay for it? 
   Since the introduction of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by President Johnson, the Federal Government has gradually been increasing it's involvement in education. 
   Rather than the role of a very junior partner in education reform, the President has offered a number of initiatives throughout his term that would substitute the U.S. Department of Education for most local school boards. 
   Mr. President, we recently spent hours and hours of debate on the subject of education in the context of the fiscal year 2000 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Bill. 
   We allocated $2.3 billion more on education in this year's Senate bill compared to fiscal year 99, a more than 6% increase at a time when we have a problem balancing the budget. 
   Yet, the primary responsibility for our nation's education doesn't and shouldn't reside in Washington. 
   The text of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers indicate that responsibility for our Nation's education resides with State and local government--not the Federal government. 
   And indeed, States have upheld their constitutional responsibilities and have responded to our education needs by moving forward with appropriate reforms and spending. 
   State spending in education has increased dramatically in the past decade. 
   According to a recent report by the National Governors' Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers entitled The Fiscal Survey of States, elementary and secondary educational now accounts for slightly more than one-third of State general funds spending and about one-quarter of State spending from all funding sources. 
   The report goes on to say that:  
   ..... elementary and secondary educational has been the largest state expenditure category, with almost $182 billion in total expenditures in 1998. Its growth has outpaced the growth in total state expenditures, with overall state expenditures increasing by 6 percent between 1997 and 1998 and elementary and secondary education spending increasingly by 7.2 percent.  
   Governors' recommended budget for fiscal year 2000 include an average proposed increase for elementary and secondary education of 4.8 percent, and an average proposed 4.3 percent increase for post-secondary education. 
   During my two terms as Governor of Ohio, we increased education spending from our General Revenue Fund by $2 billion, or 50.7 percent. The amount of Basic Aid per pupil rose during my term from $2,636 to $3,851, or 46 percent--and a 56 percent increase in per-pupil expenditures was measured for the poorest one-fourth of Ohio's schools. 
   In addition, under my administration, State funding support for capital improvements for Ohio's primary and secondary school buildings totaled more than $1.56 billion. We have wired every classroom for voice, video, and data to the tune of $525 million. 
   We have increased accountability and established higher classroom standards in Ohio and are implementing a more stringent set of academic requirements that students must meet to earn a high school diploma. 
   In particular, State funding for Ohio's youngest children has grown tremendously. Child care spending alone increased by 681 percent under my administration! 
   I am especially proud of what we have done in Ohio with the Head Start program. Ohio is now the national leader in State support for Head Start. When I began as Governor, State support for Head Start in fiscal year 1990 was $18.4 million. In fiscal year 1998, State spending for Head Start had increased to $181.3 million, making Ohio the first State in the nation to provide a slot for every eligible 3- or 4-year-old child whose family desires quality early care and education services. 
   The first question we should ask is: whose responsibility is education--and mostly it is a State and local responsibility. The second question is: how are we going to pay for it? 
   A few weeks ago I spoke on the Senate floor in response to the President's announcement of a $115 billion surplus in fiscal year 1999, indicating that it would be wonderful if it were only true. 
   The President, however, neglected to mention during his remarks in the Rose Garden that OMB also projected an on-budget deficit. 
   The only way the President could claim an on-budget surplus was by using the employee payroll taxes coming into the Social Security trust fund. 
   During the recent debate over the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill, I heard a lot of talk in the Senate with respect to funding for schools, funding for 100,000 new teachers, funding for teacher training. 
   We spent a great deal of time discussing Federal class size initiatives.  Additional debate on the role of the Federal Government in providing funding for school construction is likely to follow in future debates. 
   The reality is, however, that many States already have class size initiatives in place--I know of at least 20 States that are doing this now. Additionally, it is also reported that at least 28 States have already proposed major initiatives in the area of school construction in their fiscal year 2000 budgets. 
   Governors of at least 13 states have already recommended using a portion of their tobacco settlement funds for education. Ohio itself would commit $2.5 billion of their tobacco settlement funds for school facilities under Governor Taft's plan. 
   You will recall that the States fought hard to keep the President from using any of the tobacco settlement funds recovered from State-initiated lawsuits for his own priorities in his budget. 
   Instead, many States are exercising responsible leadership by recommending these funds be used to honor a number of key state priorities and commitments such as education. 
   My point is this: The Federal Government is not the school board of America. The Members of the U.S. Senate are not members of the school board of the United States. The responsibility for education is at the state and local level, where they are in much better financial shape than the Federal Government, as I've illustrated. 
   We have a staggering $5.6 trillion national debt--a debt that has grown some 1,300 percent in the last 30 years. I remind my colleagues, with each passing day, we are spending $600 million a day just on interest on the national debt--$600 million a day! 
   Most Americans do not realize that 14 percent of their tax dollar goes to pay off the interest on the debt, 15 percent goes to national defense, 17 percent goes for non-defense discretionary spending, and 54 percent goes for entitlement spending. 
   We are spending more on interest payments today than we spend on Medicare and Congress needs to spend more money on Medicare as we all know--now! 
   When my wife and I got married in 1962, interest payments on the dept were at 6 cents on the dollar. If we would have only had to pay 6 cents on the dollar last year, Americans would have saved $131 billion dollars. We would have saved $229 billion if we didn't have to make any interest payments on the debt last year! 
   Meanwhile, States have been both cutting taxes and running true surpluses--a reality that does not exist here in Washington. 
   For fiscal year 1999, my last budget as Governor, Ohio had a budget surplus of $976 million, and operates a rainy day fund containing $953 million--up from 14 cents in 1992. And because of good management and a strong economy, we provided an almost 10 percent across-the-board reduction this year for those filing their 1998 returns. 
   As I said earlier, the States are in a much better position to spend money on education than we are, yet we continue to advocate more Federal spending--more than last year, more than the year before--dipping into our nation's pension fund. 
   As it is, the Federal Government does have responsibilities to the American people to uphold the promises we have given to them in Medicare, Social Security and national security--promises that we are desperately struggling to maintain. 
   We need to begin establishing just what our priorities are as a legislative body, and where our responsibility lies. 
   One instance in the context of the Labor, HHS, Education legislation we just completed where I believe the Federal Government has been particularly irresponsible is in the almost $1 billion decrease in funding for the Social Services Block Grant originally written into the bill. 
   As you know, States rely on the Social Services Block Grant to provide crucial services to low-income individuals, including children, families, the elderly and the disabled. 
   However, funding for this block grant has been cut repeatedly the last few years, despite the Federal commitment made in the 1996 welfare reform agreement with the States. Congress and the administration guaranteed that funding would be maintained at $2.38 billion each year from fiscal year 1997--fiscal year 2002. 
   Instead, funding for the Social Services Block Grant for fiscal year 2000 has only reached the level of $1.05 billion. 
   Yet, in the appropriations bill we have somehow managed to increase funding in a number of other areas, including a $2 billion increase above the fiscal year 1999 funding level of $15.6 billion for the National Institutes of Health. 
   In the process of providing for the 13 percent increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, we have cut the Social Services Block Grant, which provides for the most vulnerable and underserved in our population, by 45 percent. How do we reconcile these kinds of decisions based on our responsibilities here in Washington and with previous commitments to the States? 
   I should add I believe many of the services provided to young children under the Social Services Block Grant serve as preventive medicine for a number of ailments they may encounter later in life--ailments the Federal Government funds the National Institutes of Health to research. 
   In other words, if we do not take care of those kids during that prenatal period, they will develop many of the things that the National Institutes of Health are trying to take care of, like high blood pressure and diabetes. Why not take care of it earlier? That does not make sense to me--$2 billion more, and cutting the Social Service Title 20 block grant. It does not make sense. 
   Before we go off spending more money on new education initiatives, such as 100,000 new teachers and financing for new school construction, we should at the very least make it a top priority to honor the Federal Government's funding commitment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--currently the largest unfunded mandate by the Federal Government on the states. IDEA currently contains a provision authorizing the Federal Government to fund up to 40 percent of the services provided under Part B of the act. Since its enactment, however, the Federal Government has only appropriated funds for 10 percent of these services--only 10 percent. 
   In the meantime, we must begin taking a serious look at the billions of dollars we spend on education programs to determine whether these programs are effective, and whether the Federal Government should have a role in these programs in the first place. 
   According to GAO, there are 560 different education programs administered by 31 Federal Government agencies. I have asked GAO to formulate methodology that determines the overall effectiveness of Federal education programs. Currently, there is no methodology to do this. 
   Wouldn't it be nice to sit down and look at what we are doing as a country in education, identify the programs definitively, look at those that are really making a difference, get rid of those that are not, and put the money in the programs that are successful? 
   It all gets back to the fact that at each level--Federal, State and local--we all want value, which is getting the best product for the least amount of money, and we all want positive results. 
   To this end, we must work with State governments as partners to come up with a system where we can maximize our dollars to make a difference in the lives of our children. 
   Rather than enact more Federal mandates and raid Social Security to increase Federal spending on State and local responsibilities--we should be giving states greater flexibility to innovate and tailor their education programs to the unique needs of their children. 
   Congress has been talking about drawing a line in the sand, committing not to raid any more from the Social Security trust fund to pay for increased spending for Federal programs. Yet we recently learned from CBO Director Dan Crippen that the FY2000 spending bills that we've been laboring over are already eating up billions of the Social Security surplus--even while our promises to maintain the integrity of the trust fund still hang in the air! I have not forgotten the lockbox I had on my desk, and many other Members of the Senate, putting a firewall between spending and the Social Security trust fund.  
   When faced with honest choices, the American people will not accept the Federal Government paying for programs that are primarily the responsibility of the States at the expense of sacrificing our commitment to Social Security and Medicare, as well as to numerous other commitments the Federal Government has made under law and under the Constitution of the United States of America. That is absolutely unacceptable, and the American people have a right to be upset. We need to be doing better. 
   As the appropriations legislation is finalized in negotiations, I hope that we in the Senate can inject some common sense into the dialog, taking into account our priorities as a Federal legislative body, and weighing the extent to which we should or should not maintain our involvement in various programs that are more properly the responsibility of State and local government. Even now, however, I fear we are primarily driven to compete with the President for political oneupsmanship in the area of education which, while ranked first as a national priority according to polling data, is not the primary responsibility of State and local government. 
   Medicare, Social Security, and national security--these are the primary challenges before us. As fiscal stewards of our Nation's economy, we cannot afford to continue maintaining our involvement in so many other areas, spending at such a pace as we have and it has been enormous. We must define our responsibilities. We must prioritize. We mut exercise fiscal discipline and restraint and insist that we work harder and smarter and do more with less. 
   The current budgetary path that we are on is both dangerous and irresponsible and downright misleading. 
   I am sad to say that many of the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bills with which we have invested so much of our time, despite our best intentions, are flawed by the use of budgetary gimmicks that I cannot help but say overshadow the labors of so many of my colleagues who are shouldered with the difficult task of constructing a budget that both meets all of the perceived demands placed on this body and keeps us out of the red. That is why we must prioritize. 
   In the meantime, I cannot condone the sleight of hand that allows us to postpone making the kind of tough choices that are required to balance our books, and because of that I have voted against a number of these spending bills--bills that, to be sure, would benefit Ohio in a number of ways. 
   We have committed over $17 billion in emergency spending in these bills, and that does not even count the billions of dollars of other spending that's being hidden. We are plastering--and I mean plastering--this spending over with something called directed scoring. Instead of using CBO numbers--that is, the Congressional Budget Office numbers--we have been selectively using numbers from the Office of Management and Budget, the agency for which the President is responsible, whenever they allow us to spend more. 
   Incidentally, does anyone remember the last time we did not have an emergency for which we had to account? Let's end the charade and admit we use emergency spending to avoid the balanced budget spending caps and, while we are at it, admit we are spending every dime of the projected on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. 
   When I go back to Ohio, people say to me: What about the tax reduction? You guys are having a tough time just balancing the budget. 
   I want to say this: If we do not have substantially more revenues in fiscal year 2000 than what is currently projected, CBO will announce in January that we are using Social Security to balance the 2000 budget. We have to pray the dollars come in a lot more, but if the dollars do not come in more, then CBO is going to announce in January this budget uses Social Security. 
   It is time to bite the bullet and make the hard choices. Nobody else but us can exercise the fiscal responsibility that is needed. If we cannot do it now, with the lowest unemployment we have had and a booming economy, the question I have is, When will we ever be able to do it? If we fail to make the tough choices now, we will soon be facing a train wreck that will make it impossible for us to respond to the needs specifically delegated in the Constitution to the Federal Government and fail to keep the sacred Social Security and Medicare covenant we have with the American people. Let's get back on track so when we return to Washington at the start of the new millennium, which is just around the corner, we can say with confidence we have, indeed, been the stewards of a government the American people deserve. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I am grateful to the Senator from Pennsylvania for his courageous fight to ban this barbaric procedure. Any of us who has listened to him today and last night cannot help but be moved by his eloquence in regard to the importance of banning this procedure. 
   It is difficult even to talk about it because it is so gruesome, but we need to remind Members of the Senate that this is a procedure that is not done on an emergency basis. First, the woman  goes through 2 days of doctor visits to get dilated. On the third day, the baby is positioned for delivery in the birth canal. The fetus is turned so that it is delivered feet first, leaving only its head in the womb. An incision is then made in the base of the skull. Finally, with a suction device, the baby's brain matter is suctioned out. The skull collapses, enabling delivery of the dead baby. 
   I cannot understand how anyone can support this procedure or can support it being legal. There are some I have heard in this debate who say it is hard to believe we are even talking about this question on the floor of the Senate. When I think of other things that have been discussed on the floor of the Senate--for example, endangered species or animal rights--for anyone to say we ought not to be talking about this procedure on the floor of the Senate is hard for me to believe. 
   The subject of partial-birth abortion is not a new one for me. Four years ago, in 1995, Ohio was the first State to pass a partial-birth abortion ban. The bill prohibited doctors from performing abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy and banned completely the dilation and extraction procedure which we call the partial-birth procedure in this bill. The bill allowed late-term abortions to save the life of the mother. The women seeking abortions after the 21st week of pregnancy were required to undergo tests to determine the viability of the fetus. If the fetus was deemed to be viable, the abortion would be illegal. 
   The Ohio Senate passed that bill 28-4. The Ohio House passed it 82-15. These were overwhelming vote majorities which included Democrats and Republicans, pro-life and pro-choice legislators. This is not an issue today of Roe v. Wade or pro-life or pro-choice. If it were, the vote in the Ohio Senate and Ohio House would not have been so overwhelming to ban this procedure. 
   The truth is that most of these abortions are elective. According to Dr. Martin Haskell, to whom the Senator from Pennsylvania has referred, who happens to be from Dayton, OH, about 80 percent are elective. We are talking about 80 percent being elective. We are talking about 80 percent are healthy mothers and healthy babies. 
   We can all quote different statistics, but the bottom line is that there is no need for this procedure. It is never medically necessary. If a mother really needs an abortion, she has alternatives available to her that are not as torturous as partial-birth abortion. 
   One of the other main reasons we do not need these late-term abortions is, thanks to technology available today, we can identify problems really early in pregnancy so abortions can take place earlier. We do not need to have that type of procedure. Women today are being encouraged to come in early on, in the first trimester, for the various tests they need, so that if abortion is acceptable to them, they can have an early abortion while the baby is not viable. 
   The Senator from California earlier today talked about the OB/GYN doctors who have expressed opposition to this legislation. I think the significant thing about her statement today is the fact that she verified that there are other procedures available besides dilation and extraction. In fact, the Senator indicated doctors were worried about the possibility that these other procedures might be banned by the language in this bill. 
   So I want to make it clear to those who believe in abortion and have that tremendous decision in terms of whether or not they are going to deliver the baby that there are other procedures available to them. In fact, dilation and extraction are not even taught in medical school. 
   These babies are humans. They can feel pain. When partial-birth abortions are performed, as the Senator from Pennsylvania said, they are just 3 inches away from life and, for that matter, seconds away. 
   I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to stand up against what I refer to as human infanticide. This is not a vote on Roe v. Wade. This is a vote about eliminating a horrible procedure that should be outlawed in this country. I urge my colleagues to vote to ban partial-birth abortion in the United States of America.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, this legislation before us today has presented me a dilemma, and that dilemma is that I have been publicly in favor of banning soft money. At the same time, I understand, in my State particularly, our labor unions would not be impacted by this legislation, and for all intents and purposes, they are the Democratic Party in terms of things a party would do traditionally. 
   I also recognize the fact that we need to raise money for our own campaigns and we need to also support our parties so they can do the job a party should be doing in our respective States and nationally. I recall during my campaign for the Senate, I raised my money the hard way, hard dollars. But I kept worrying, toward the end of the campaign, whether or not soft money would appear from somewhere and whether or not I would be able to counteract that soft money coming into our State. In my particular case, it didn't. I suspect maybe it didn't because they thought I was going to win. 
   The fact is, I thought about this last weekend. I had intended to come here today and present an amendment that I think would improve the McCain-Feingold piece of legislation. Unfortunately, I understand no amendments are going to be accepted. I was going to ask that the Daschle amendment be laid aside, but I understand such requests have been objected to.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. My amendment would have leveled the playing field by empowering average Americans over special interests in their ability to participate in the electoral process. I believe the bill before us doesn't do that. I think it further tilts the balance toward a handful of powerful individuals, individuals who have the ability to determine how to spend the dues of some 16 million hard-working men and women. I am quite surprised we haven't heard more about that. 
   The good thing about this bill is that it will end the enormous corporate donations to political parties, donations that reach into six figures. I was glad the Senator from Michigan made a point of the fact that soft money from corporations does not go only to the Republican Party but goes to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Editorially, I suggest the invitations to join the Democratic National Committee or the Republican Committee, in terms of belonging to the club, regardless of what happens to McCain-Feingold, ought to be something to which all of us stand up and object. 
   I recall, being Governor of Ohio, I never had a fundraiser in the Governor's residence. I tried not to use my office to take money out of the pockets of people who were encouraged to contribute either to my campaign, someone else's campaign, or to the Republican Party. I hope after this is over, all of us will indicate to our parties that the days of the clubs and the rest of it should be over so that people such as Senator LEVIN can't get up and show the ways people are being asked to contribute. I think that is horrible. It sends a bad message to the American people. It certainly adds to the cynicism and is one of the reasons we have fewer people show up on election day. 
   Unfortunately, a soft money ban without other reforms has the potential to severely impact the ability of our parties to continue their worthwhile activities, including grassroots mobilization and party building. Banning party soft money is an objective I support. However, I am concerned about the devastating impact it could have on the ability of our national parties to cover operating expenses and grassroots activities. 
   Current contribution limits must be updated. Under current law, an individual can give up to $25,000 per year total in campaign contributions, with a sublimit of $20,000 of that amount to the parties. If we ban soft money contributions to the parties without adjusting total contribution limits, the parties will have to compete with their own candidates for a limited supply of money. 
   My amendment would fix the problem. It would eliminate soft money and  would create two separate aggregate limits for yearly hard dollar contributions--I am talking about hard dollar individual contributions--a $25,000 limit to candidates and a $25,000 limit to parties. These limits would be indexed to inflation, so once they went into effect, they would go up each year. 
   In addition to creating new aggregate limits, my amendment would adjust individual campaign contribution limits. As my colleagues know, our current campaign contribution limits are not indexed to inflation; they have remained the same since the law was enacted 25 years ago. Under current law, an individual cannot give more than $1,000 to the general election campaign of a particular Federal candidate in a given year. If this limit had been indexed to inflation, it would be approximately $3,000 today. 
   Adjusting the individual contribution limits is important for three reasons. That is what my amendment would have done. It would have increased it from $1,000 to $3,000, and then it would have indexed it up each year. 
   First of all, it would reduce the amount of time candidates spend raising money. The people in this country should know about the hours and hours candidates running for national office and local office spend dialing for dollars. I have already started to raise money for my next campaign for the Senate because I know if I don't spread it out over a long period of time, I will be unable, during my last 2 years in this body, to do the job the people of the State of Ohio have asked me to do. We need to increase that campaign contribution limit. 
   Second, it would level the playing field for candidates competing against wealthy opponents who are bankrolling their own campaigns. With all due respect to many Members of this body, if we keep going the way we are, people such as GEORGE VOINOVICH will not be able to be in the Senate because we are seeing more and more campaigns bankrolled by individuals who can win primaries and, once the primary is over, they can put their own money into the campaign. Money does have an impact on the results of an election. 
   Third, it also would relieve the pressure for groups to seek out loopholes to circumvent the campaign finance laws. In fact, many experts believe the reason we have the increase in sham issue ads in the past few years is the tightening of the amount individuals can give in hard dollars. My amendment would address these concerns by increasing the individual campaign contribution limit from $1,000 to $3,000 per election and then adjust it, as I say, each year. 
   Lastly, one of the greatest areas of abuse in the current campaign finance system is the involuntary use of membership dues by union leaders for political purposes. In addition to making soft money contributions to parties and engaging in issue advocacy, labor leaders also spend millions of unauthorized dollars each election cycle in order to explicitly advocate for labor's preferred candidates among its rank and file, a rank and file which is over 16 million. That doesn't include the millions more that are in their families. 
   These express advocacy activities include phone banks, get-out-the-vote drives, newsletters, and scorecards. In my State, the Democratic Party does not do it; it is the labor unions that do it. No one, not even union members, is exactly sure how much union leaders spend for these campaign activities because this money is unregulated and thus soft. It is all soft money. 
   Under McCain-Feingold, party soft money would be prohibited, just as it should be. However, MCCAIN-FEINGOLD would allow this key form of union money to remain entirely unchecked. I just can't understand why those who are promoting McCain-Feingold haven't been willing to take on this particular issue that seems to be put over on the side as not being something that is very important. It is really important to many of us around this country, particularly individuals such as myself who have been the victim of that soft money effort. 
   Union leaders would be allowed to continue spending millions of dollars of membership dues to support the candidates of their choice and to influence elections, thereby tilting the playing field in favor of union-backed candidates. 
   We have heard this over and over again today. According to AFL-CIO president John Sweeney, some $46 million in union funds is going to be used to influence this coming election. In the 1996 cycle alone, $30 million was spent. This $46 million is a 53-percent increase in spending from just a few years ago. Think of it, a 53-percent increase in the use of union dues for political purposes. 
   McCain-Feingold would not regulate any of that incredible amount of money--$46 million. That is just for the Federal candidates. It doesn't talk about the money that is going to be used at the State and local level. 
   I believe an effective and constitutional way to address this issue is by requiring union leaders to get written authorization from each of their members before they use any portion of their dues for political activities. 
   I heard earlier about the codification of the Beck decision. While the Beck codification contained in McCain-Feingold bill is a step in the right direction, it would only protect a very small group of people: dues-paying, nonmembers in non-right-to-work States. However, no one should be compelled to give campaign contributions without explicit approval. 
   I do not come from a right-to-work State. I have people in my State who, in order to get a job, must join the union. Many of those individuals complain to me that they have no control over how their union dollars are being spent. I think those individuals, those hard-working men and women, ought to have the opportunity to say whether or not they want their union dues to be used for political purposes. I can't help but believe that, if they did that, it would not be the great problem some think it would be. But it would cause the unions to go out and really get their people involved and let them make their own decision as to whether or not they want their dues to be used for political purposes. 
   My amendment would give them the right to know where their hard-earned dollars are being spent. Unfortunately, I have been denied the opportunity to offer that amendment. 
   The proponents of this bill have utilized parliamentary tactics designed to tie up the Senate without any meaningful discussion of some of these alternatives. That is their right. However, if we don't have a full discussion of this bill--with the ability to amend and make the bill stronger--the proponents of this legislation should not expect Senators to support its passage. 
   We can debate this bill, amend this bill, and pass this bill in the hope we can get some real change in our current campaign finance system. Unfortunately, it appears that some of my colleagues--and we see this a lot in this body--are interested in scoring political points. This is a problem, and I respect those who have tried to do something about it. But, from my perspective, if we don't allow working men and women who belong to labor unions, the opportunity to decide how their union dollars should be spent, this bill is flawed to the extent that I would vote against it. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator MIKE DEWINE, to introduce legislation that will remove the limit on the amount of federal Medicaid disproportionate share (DSH) payments for hospitals in Ohio. In 1993, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) in an effort to curb the rate of growth of federal Medicaid DSH spending to hospitals. Section 1923(g) of that bill placed maximum payment caps on hospitals. Subsequently, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) in 1997, in which Section 1923(f) placed funding caps on states. With the implementation of the aggregate state DSH spending limits, hospital-specific caps are no longer needed to assure the financial integrity of the program. 
   I have often spoken on the floor of the Senate in support of federalism. When the federal government makes overly prescriptive laws and regulations, it can erode the ability of state governments to protect consumers, promote economic development, and generate the revenue streams that fund education, public safety, infrastructure and other vital services. This is especially true in the case of Medicaid. Hospitals that provide care to indigent patients provide an invaluable service to their communities, often at great expense. DSH payments are intended to help reimburse those expenses. Congress should allow individual states to administer their DSH program in a way that provides the most funding for the most hospitals as possible. Without such leeway, we are imposing what is effectively an unfunded mandate on the private sector--telling these hospitals to treat Medicaid and uninsured patients without helping them pay for it. This is not good policy. 
   This legislation is federalism at its best. Section 1923(g) fails to recognize that each state implements its DSH program differently, and thus fails to recognize that the hospital-specific caps adversely affect Ohio hospitals. This legislation is budget neutral, yet it gives my state the flexibility to implement the Medicaid DSH program in the fairest and most equitable manner. 
   Under Ohio's DSH program, the Hospital Care Assurance Program (HCAP), all necessary hospital services are provided free of charge to persons below the federal poverty line. Generally, under HCAP, hospitals are taxed and those funds are used as the state's share to draw matching federal Medicaid DSH funds. The total pool is then distributed back to hospitals based on the level of each hospital's indigent care. Ideally, the DSH dollars should follow the indigent patients. However, partly because of the hospital-specific caps that were enacted in 1993, there are many HCAP hospitals that are reimbursed far less than the amount that would actually cover their indigent care expenses. The bill will give Ohio the ability to implement a new formula to correct this inequity within Ohio's overall spending limit. 
   Mr. President, Ohio deserves the authority to make health care decisions that are in the best interest of her citizens and their local hospitals. Ohio is not seeking additional federal dollars, merely the flexibility to allocate reimbursement funds under the DSH program where the funds are needed most. I urge passage of this legislation that will give relief to our hospitals and allow them to continue to provide quality care to each and every citizen in my state.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean Water Infrastructure Financing Act of 1999, legislation which will reauthorize the highly successful, but undercapitalized, Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) Program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
   As many of my colleagues know, the Clean Water SRF Program is an effective and immensely popular source of funding for wastewater collection and treatment projects. Congress created the SRF in 1987, to replace the direct grants program that was enacted as part of the landmark 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or as it is known, the Clean Water Act. State and local governments have used the federal Clean Water SRF to help meet critical environmental infrastructure financing needs. The program operates much like a community bank, where each state determines which projects get built. 
   The performance of the SRF Program has been spectacular. Total federal capitalization grants have been nearly doubled by non-federal funding sources, including state contributions, leveraged bonds, and principal and interest payments. Communities of all sizes are participating in the program, and approximately 7,000 projects nationwide have been approved to date. 
   Ohio has needs for public water system improvements which greatly exceed the current SRF appropriations levels. According to the latest state figures, more than $7 billion of improvements have been identified as necessary. In recent years, Ohio cities and villages are spending more on maintaining and operating their systems than in the past, which is an indication their systems are aging and will soon need to be replaced. For example, the City of Columbus recently requested SRF assistance amounting to $725 million over the next five years. 
   While the SRF program's track record is excellent, the condition of our Nation's environmental infrastructure remains alarming. A 20-year needs survey published by the EPA in 1997 documented $139 billion worth of wastewater capital needs nationwide. This past April, the national assessment was revised upward to nearly $200 billion, in order to more accurately account for expected sanitary sewer needs. Private studies demonstrate that total needs are closer to $300 billion, when anticipated replacement costs are considered. 
   Authorization for the Clean Water SRF expired at the end of fiscal year 1994, and the failure of Congress to reauthorize the program sends an implicit message that wastewater collection and treatment is not a national priority. The longer we have an absence of authorization of this program, the longer it creates uncertainty about the program's future in the eyes of borrowers, which may delay or in some cases prevent project financing. 
   The bill that I am introducing today will authorize a total of $15 billion over the next five years for the Clean Water SRF. Not only would this authorization bridge the enormous infrastructure funding gap, the investment would also pay for itself in perpetuity by protecting our environment, enhancing public health, creating jobs and increasing numerous tax bases across the country. Additionally, the bill will provide technical and planning assistance for small systems, expand the types of projects eligible for loan assistance, and offer disadvantaged communities extended loan repayment periods and principal subsidies. 
   At the local level, there are numerous areas like the town of Glenn Robbins in Jefferson County, Ohio, which cannot afford a zero percent loan to build the cost-effective facilities they  need. Estimates indicate that among towns of less than 3,500 population in Ohio, there are $1.5 billion in needs. 
   The health and well-being of the American public depends on the condition of our Nation's wastewater collection and treatment systems. Unfortunately, the facilities that comprise these systems are often taken for granted because they are invisible absent a crisis. Let me assure my colleagues that the costs of poor environmental infrastructure are simply intolerable. Recent flood disasters have been a stark reminder of the human costs that stem from the contamination of our Nation's water supply. 
   The Clean Water SRF Program has helped thousands of communities meet their wastewater treatment needs. My legislation will help ensure that the Clean Water SRF Program remains a viable component in the overall development of our Nation's infrastructure for years to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I urge it's speedy consideration by the Senate.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution that will prevent the implementation of an initiative in the District of Columbia that would allow the use of marijuana for medical treatment. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the voters of the District of Columbia passed a ballot initiative--Initiative 59--last November that would legalize marijuana use for ``medicinal'' purposes. 
   Supported by the Mayor and many elected officials in the District, Initiative 59 would permit marijuana use as a treatment for serious illness including ``HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, muscle spasms, and cancer.'' 
   Because physicians are not allowed to prescribe marijuana under federal law, Initiative 59 would allow individuals to use marijuana based on a doctor's ``written or oral recommendation.'' The initiative would also allow the designation of up to four ``caregivers'' who would be able to cultivate, distribute and possess marijuana for the purpose of supplying an individual with marijuana for medicinal purposes. 
   Proponents of the D.C. initiative, and similar initiatives elsewhere in the country, have argued that marijuana is the only way that individuals can cope with the effects of chemotherapy and AIDS treatments. 
   However, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), individuals who are using marijuana for AIDS, cancer or glaucoma may actually be doing damage to themselves:  
   AIDS: Scientific studies indicate marijuana damages the immune system, causing further peril to already weakened immune systems. HIV-positive marijuana smokers progress to full-blown AIDS twice as fast as non-smokers and have an increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia. 
   Cancer: Marijuana contains many cancer-causing substances, many of which are present in higher concentrations in marijuana than in tobacco. 
   Glaucoma: Marijuana does not prevent blindness due to glaucoma.  
   In addition, Dr. Donald R. Vereen, Jr., Deputy Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (commonly referred to as the office of the ``Drug Czar''), in an article titled, ``Is Medical Marijuana an Oxymoron?'' and printed in Physicians Weekly on February 1, 1999, stated:  
   No medical research has shown smoked marijuana to be safe, effective, or therapeutically superior to other substances. Synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, has been available for fifteen years in pill form (Marinol) to treat HIV Wasting Syndrome and chemotherapy-induced nausea. A legal drug, Marinol is the real ``medical marijuana.'' It is available in measured doses and guaranteed purity without the adverse side-effects of smoking tars, hydrocarbons, and other combustibles. Furthermore, newer drugs like ondansetron and grenisetron work better than Marinol, as clinical practice has demonstrated.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, this morning President Clinton announced we have set a new record budget surplus. It now stands at $115 billion, according to the President. That would be absolutely wonderful, if it were true. The President says our prosperity now gives us an unprecedented opportunity and an unprecedented responsibility to shape America's future by putting things first, by moving forward with an economic strategy that is successful and sound, and by meeting America's long-term challenges. 
   He continues to operate as if he has a $2.9 trillion surplus over the next 10 years to take care of every problem and pay for every program over the next decade. However, the numbers the President is relying on are nothing but a mirage, pure speculation. The $2.9 trillion surplus everyone seems to be talking about in the next 10 years is based on 10-year projections. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:  
   ..... it's very difficult to project with any degree of conviction when you get out beyond 12, 18 months.  
   In addition, he stated that:  
   ..... projecting five or ten years out is a very precarious activity, as I think we have demonstrated time and time again.  
   Again, the President continues to play games with the numbers and continues to use Social Security to puff up his inflated budget surplus numbers. How much of this $115 billion so-called surplus is actually offset, using our Nation's pension fund, Social Security? With today's pronouncement, he continues to perpetuate the myth that we have a huge, honest-to-goodness surplus. But he is using Social Security. 
   Just this last year--and I think this is really important for the American people to understand--there was a great celebration here about having a surplus. But the fact of the matter is that in 1998, when everybody celebrated, there was no on-budget surplus; actually, there was a $30 billion deficit. That is, the expenses exceeded the revenues, and we glossed it over with the Social Security surplus. 
   We have to stop playing games as if we had all this money to spend. I think the President is doing the American people a disservice. But it is the only way the President is going to be able to fund his expansion of the Federal Government--by claiming the surplus is bigger than it really is and that we are flush with cash. This is not how we should run the Government. It is just plain wrong. 
   When I was Governor of Ohio, if somebody had come to me from the schools, or from the cities, and said, ``Governor, we want to spend $100 billion on a program,'' and then they said to me, ``I want to use the pension funds from the State of Ohio to pay for it,'' I would have thrown them out of the office. That is what we have been doing in this country, and continue to do, is to pay for programs, frankly, that are the responsibilities of State and local government, by taking the money out of Social Security. 
   If the President was still the Governor of Arkansas, this wonderful program I have heard about from my Democratic colleagues, all this money for schools, and for all these other new programs, would be appropriate. But the President is not the Governor of the United States of America and this Senate is not the school board of America. The responsibility for education is at the State and local level. Today in this country, with our $5.7 trillion debt, with a deficit that has gone up 1,300 percent, with an interest payment of 14 cents out of every dollar --we are spending more money on interest today than we are on Medicare--we have a terrible financial problem. 
   I have listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the President's vision. I listen to them every day. I watch them on C-SPAN. They are talking about school construction, 100,000 teachers--they are all great priorities, but they are the responsibility of State and local government. 
   One of the things this Senate has to face up to, and this country has to face up to: There are certain responsibilities on the Federal Government and there are certain responsibilities on State and local government. 
   I am going to vote against the Democratic leader and his resolution which continues to raid the pension funds of the United States of America. Does everybody hear me? There is no surplus.  Let's stop talking about it. We have a Social Security surplus, and it is time we stop using the pension funds of the people of this country to pay for programs that are the responsibility of State and local government, particularly in terms of where the States are a lot more flush than we are on the Federal level. 
   Today I will vote against that resolution. I will support the Republican resolution which advocates giving the most amount of flexibility to our State and local school districts and in programs where we do have a proper role.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment to the Veterans' Affairs-HUD appropriations bill that was submitted by the Senator from Minnesota. 
   This morning, I had the privilege of presiding over the Senate to hear the presentation of the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland in what they tried to do to put together a very fair VA-HUD appropriations bill. 
   One of the things that was emphasized was the fact that after reviewing the needs of this country, particularly the health care needs of our veterans, they inserted in the appropriations bill another $1.1 billion for health care for our veterans. Subsequent to that, Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS came to the floor with an amendment to provide another $600 million for emergencies. 
   The reason I rise to oppose the request of the Senator from Minnesota for another $1.3 billion is the fact that we are reaching the end of the appropriations cycle. We are getting down to the nitty-gritty. The fact is, when anyone comes to this floor and asks for additional money over and above what the appropriators have appropriated, they should stand and point out where the money is going to come from to fund whatever it is they are asking for. 
   First of all, in this particular case, I think the committee did its very best to deal forthrightly with the needs of our veterans' health. 
   It seems to me from a logic point of view, the person who proposed this amendment should have laid out clearly where the money, the $1.3 billion, was coming from, what programs would be cut in order to come up with the money or, in the alternative, to explain which taxes will have to be raised to pay for the funding of the program. Last but not least, explain that it is not coming from Social Security. 
   I have noticed around here so many of the spending programs ultimately would be paid for out of Social Security. I believe anyone who looks at what the Appropriations Committee did in terms of this issue would think they did the very best they could under the circumstances. No one advocates taking money out of Social Security to pay for another $1.3 billion for health care for our veterans. 
   I think we have reached the point where we have to come clean on the fact that we will have a difficult time dealing with this budget. If we are not going to dip into Social Security, if we are not going to raise taxes, if we are not going to be fiscally irresponsible, we need to explain how we will be paying for these additional programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota for the additional $1.3 billion because the money to pay for that is just not there. If we don't find the money, it means we will end up using our Social Security pension funds. 
   I remind Members we have a $5.7 trillion debt. Part of that is because over the years we continued to use our Social Security funds to pay for things for which we weren't willing to pay. Today in this country out of every $1 we are spending, 14 cents is being paid for interest. In fact, we are spending more money in this country on interest than we pay for Medicare. It is time to be fiscally responsible. It is time for truth in budgeting. We have a wonderful opportunity in this session of Congress to forthrightly deal for the first time in anyone's memory with the financial responsibility of the fiscal things we need to do in this country to enter the new millennium, in what I refer as an ``intellectually honest'' way in terms of our budget.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, now that the tax cut bill will assuredly be vetoed, it is time to turn our attention to passing a budget that will respond to the needs of our citizens, keep our spending under control, maintain the integrity of the Social Security trust funds, and not increase our terrible national debt. 
   When I was back in Ohio during the August break, almost everybody I talked to said they were glad that I opposed the tax cut that was based on the 10-year rosy projections, which I referred to as a mirage. Every expert in America said that to base tax cuts or new spending on such projections was fiscally irresponsible. 
   The people who I spoke with told me that if it was not a mirage, then Congress should use the money to pay down the $5.6 trillion national debt and get out of dealing with the problems of Social Security and Medicare. 
   They also said if we got to a point down the road where we got real money for a tax cut, we should do it when the  economy needs stimulation and not right now. 
   Quite a few of these same Ohioans said to me: For goodness sakes, Congress should not sit down with President Clinton and negotiate a tax reduction for spending increases--just pass an honest budget. 
   As my colleagues know, the President has hinted that he may be willing to strike a deal for small tax cuts in exchange for a few spending increases. That would be an absolute disaster for our country's financial health, and I am pleased the majority leader has firmly rejected this approach. 
   I have no doubt that the President will promise future tax cuts while insisting on immediate spending. The problem will be, I fear, that the tax cuts will never materialize, and the spending will fund programs that will become entrenched. And what's worse, he will use the so-called surplus to pay for this new spending. 
   Let's get back to basics: There is no surplus. I have said it before and I will say it again: The only surplus we have is made up of Social Security funds. 
   Let me just say right here that I really wish the President, the Congress, and the media would start giving an accurate portrayal of the surplus and call it what it is--either the ``Social Security'' surplus or the ``on-budget'' surplus. And right now, the only surplus we have is a Social Security surplus. 
   I want to show a chart I have used in other speeches on the floor. It basically shows that even in 1999, when we are talking about a surplus, we are actually running a budget deficit of some $4 billion. The first time we are going to have the real on-budget surplus in approximately 30 years is next year, as projected by CBO. We have not yet accumulated, this year, all of the tax revenues necessary to meet and exceed our spending in fiscal year 1999. 
   The only way we can claim a budget surplus today is by taking the surplus that is accumulating in the Social Security trust fund and using it to mask the deficit, just as has been done in previous years. The $14 billion projected ``on-budget" surplus for next year--which would be the first on-budget surplus, as I said, in over 30 years--is by no means secure. 
   In fact, CBO Director Dan Crippen has already warned us that if we stay on the current path with the appropriations bills, we could turn the $14 billion projected ``on-budget'' surplus into an $11 billion deficit. And by doing so, we would be breaking our word with the American people to never again raid the Social Security trust funds. That would be outrageous given all the promises we have made to them and given all the debate I have heard on the Senate floor over Social Security lockbox legislation. 
   Right now, our primary responsibility is to be as conscientious as possible and come up with the best budget plan for fiscal year 2000. 
   We also need to resist the President's push to expand current programs and to create new entitlements. The President has consistently been bringing his case directly to the American people, proposing new spending programs wherever he goes. 
   At the same time, he says he is for debt reduction and saving Social Security. That is plain hogwash. What most people don't know is the President's latest budget proposal would boost spending in 81 Government programs, create budget deficits, and as a result, raid billions of dollars from the Social Security trust funds over the next 10 years. 
   This year, in accordance with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, which Congress passed and President Clinton signed, we are supposed to spend $27 billion less than last year. In other words, when the budget agreement was put together by Congress, they anticipated we would spend $27 billion less this year than last year. 
   Let's face the facts. The only way we are going to deal with the budget and handle all of these items that need to be addressed is one of four ways: 
   One, we can tighten our belts by finding places to cut spending in current Federal programs and reallocate those resources; two, we can raise taxes in order to provide services --a course of action I don't favor; three, we can use whatever on-budget surplus we may have next year, although in all likelihood it has already been spoken for; four, we can use the Social Security surpluses by raiding the trust funds. 
   Those are the alternatives. All in all, these are four difficult choices, but I think most Americans would agree that the most responsible choice is to cut unnecessary spending. 
   For example, we could start by eliminating the Welfare-to-Work Program. This program, which was initiated by the President, has had a total of $3 billion appropriated to it over the last 2 years. However, in the same period, the States and territories that chose to participate--and not all of them did--have only spent $182 million of those funds. 
   That's because the money comes with too many strings attached for States and because it is a complete duplication of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or, TANF. 
   Last year when I was governor, Ohio and five other States didn't even apply for the money under Welfare-to-Work. In Ohio, we rejected $88 million. I believed that Ohio and the Federal Government had made a deal; that we were going to take care of our responsibilities under the new welfare law with the money that Congress allocated to us in the welfare reform legislation. 
   After Welfare-to-Work, we should take the time, do the hard work and make the tough choices by determining what other Federal programs and pork-barrel spending we can trim in order to find the money necessary to meet our Nation's priorities. 
   We should be just as enthusiastic, in my opinion, in terms of reducing taxes as we are just as conscientious in terms of finding ways we can cut funding. 
   Most importantly, we need to instill truth-in-budgeting. The last thing we want to do is ruin our credibility by being dishonest. We need to end all the accounting gimmicks, such as extending the calendar to 13 months in order to accommodate excess spending, or ``forward funding'' certain programs to avoid having to pay for them this year. In fact, as I understand from Senator DOMENICI, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the President has $19 billion in his budget that encompasses forward funding. 
   We should let the American people know that we're doing such things. It's their money; they have a right to know. But, we should strive at all times not to use ``smoke and mirrors'' to make the debt look smaller or the budget appear balanced on paper when in reality, it is not. They are onto it. 
   We shouldn't be ``mixing and matching'' to give us the numbers that will give us the best budget results. We need to agree on a set of numbers exclusively. If we're going to use CBO numbers, then we should consistently use CBO's numbers. Same thing with OMB. It is intellectually dishonest to constantly change numbers --picking and choosing as we go along. 
   Well, we will use CBO's numbers and next we will use OMB's figures. 
   When I was Governor of Ohio, the first thing we did was sit down with the legislature and we said let's agree on the numbers. We agreed on the numbers. That is what we dealt with. 
   In addition, if we want to avoid dipping into Social Security, then we should be prepared to make the hard choices and not declare everything an emergency. As every Member of this body knows, ever since the statutory spending caps were first enacted in 1990 to rein in runaway discretionary spending, Congress has used the ``emergency'' loophole to get around them. 
   Mr. President, we have to stop these gimmicks! It's game playing! It's smoke and mirrors! And our constituents know it and they want us to put an end to it. 
   It's high time we start to give serious consideration to a two year budget cycle like many states have, including Ohio. It doesn't make sense that we go through this budget exercise each year; a process that just exhausts this body and prevents us from being able to work towards down-sizing government and lowering our expenses. 
   If we had 2-year budgets, we could spend some time on the oversight that this body has a responsibility to be doing. 
   Until then, if something is truly an emergency, then Congress should be more than willing to come up with the money to pay for it. Only in times of war or severe economic crisis should we even be talking about dipping into Social Security. As I have said before, Social Security is the Nation's pension  fund, and no responsible citizen would tap into their retirement fund unless it was an absolute last resort--and they would certainly look to pay it back. Congress must act accordingly. 
   Mr. President, all of us in Congress should take the equivalent of a blood oath that we are not going to touch Social Security. Period. It would be the most important thing we could possibly do to bring fiscal accountability to this country because we've been using the social security trust funds and public borrowing to fund tax reductions and spending for the last 30 years and in that same period of time, we've seen our national debt increase over 1,300 percent. 
   Think of that--1,300 percent. 
   We have to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, but there are such things as hard choices. That is what we should be about--making the hard choices. 
   I know that first hand because as Governor, I have been there; I had to make the $750 million in spending cuts, but because of the fiscally responsible choices we made, we had the lowest growth in 30 years and had 17% fewer employees--excluding prison workers. 
   In addition, we ultimately gave Ohio a general revenue rainy day fund of over $935 million--after it had been depleted to 14 cents. 
   Think of that. It was at 14 cents--a Medicaid rainy day fund of $100 million and real tax cuts. I am talking about real tax cuts for the last 3 years, including last year for all Ohioans who had an across-the-board reduction in their State income tax of almost 10 percent. 
   That is why I came to Washington--to try and bring fiscal responsibility to our nation and this Congress so that my children and my grandchildren as well as all children and grandchildren are not saddled with the cost of those things that my generation did not want to pay for, and guarantee our covenant to the American people in regard to Social Security and Medicare. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues that with each passing day, we're paying $600 million in interest payments just to service the national debt--a national debt that is $5.6 trillion. 
   Most Americans do not realize that 14 percent of their tax dollar goes to pay off the interest on the debt. Fifteen percent goes for national defense. Seventeen percent goes to non-defense discretionary spending. And 54 percent goes for entitlement spending. 
   So how much is our interest payment in comparison to other federal spending? It is more than we spend on Medicare. It's five times more than the federal dollars we spend on education. And it's 15 times more than we spend on medical research at NIH. 
   If we are fortunate enough that the projections of an on-budget surplus actually occurs--I would like to see that --the best possible course of action that we could take is to use those funds and pay down the debt. With debt reduction you get lower interest rates, a continued strong economy and lower government interest costs. 
   Indeed, as Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified before the House Ways and Means Committee ``(T)he advantages that I perceive that would accrue to this economy from a significant decline in the outstanding debt to the public and its virtuous cycle on the total budget process is a value which I think far exceeds anything else we could do with the money.'' 
   Mr. President, we must avoid using Social Security to meet our financial obligations. Instead, we should greet the millennium with a promise to our citizens that we will engage in truth-in-budgeting, not use gimmicks and re-order our spending to reflect our national priorities. 
   Mr. President, I believe that a statement I made in my 1991 Inaugural Address as Governor of Ohio is relevant today:  
   Gone are the days when public officials are measured by how much they spend on a problem. The new realities dictate that public officials are now judged on whether they can work harder and smarter, and do more with less.  
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, to submit a resolution recognizing the importance of expanding the amount of family friendly television programming, and to saluting the contributions that the Family Friendly Programming Forum is undertaking to make this goal a reality. 
   As nearly any parent will attest, it can be a very difficult task to keep track of what their children watch after school. It is particularly hard for working parents. Each week the average child watches 22 to 28 hours of television, which is more time than is spent on nearly any other activity, except sleeping. The trick for parents is to establish good family viewing habits that emphasize quality programming and which are suited to the age of these young viewers. Many parents have indicated their desire to have more program choices for family friendly viewing during the evening hours when everyone is home together. 
   To help in this endeavor, a number of our nation's leading companies have joined forces to establish the Family Friendly Programming Forum. The Forum's members, which includes some of the nation's largest television advertisers, are encouraging the production of more television programs geared toward the entire family. As sponsors of a wide range of programs, the Forum's members believe that there is a definite call for more family friendly movies, documentaries, series and other programs that are relevant and interesting to a broad family audience. 
   The members of the Forum are working on a variety of initiatives in an effort to promote more family friendly programs. They are: engaging in constructive dialogue with industry leaders, presenting awards to family friendly television programs, establishing a development fund for family friendly scripts, awarding university scholarships in television studies that highlight family television themes, as well as embarking on a public awareness campaign. 
   Mr. President, as a father and a grandfather, I am deeply concerned about the healthy development of all our nation's children. The future of our nation depends to a great degree on the safe and nurturing environment that will give children a positive outlook on life. Therefore, I encourage efforts that will increase the number and quality of family TV programs. I congratulate the Family Friendly Programming Forum on their leadership toward that goal. 
   I believe that the passage of the resolution that Senator LIEBERMAN and I are introducing honors the Forum's commitment and helps raise the awareness of others in the business community to align themselves with the goal of bringing quality television to our nation's families for the benefit of our children. I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this resolution and I urge the Senate to provide it's quick approval.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, to submit a concurrent resolution recognizing the importance of expanding the amount of family friendly television programming, and the contributions that the Forum for Family Friendly Programming is undertaking to make this goal a reality. 
   One of the more frustrating aspects of being a parent in the United States is the fact that we cannot always protect our children from what they see and hear. Images and descriptions of violence, sex and drug and alcohol consumption permeate our culture, but nowhere are these depicted more readily than on television. Recent studies support the theory that children exposed to violent video programming at a young age have a higher tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later in life. Even more distressing is that children witness an average of five violent acts per hour on prime-time television and 200,000 acts of violence on television by the time they are 18 years old. There is no doubt that this exposure threatens the healthy development of our children. 
   For families that have both parents working, it's becoming harder for them to keep track of what their children watch after school or during the summer months. More likely than not, a child will pick up the television clicker before he or she will pick up a book. Indeed, each week, the average child will watch 22-28 hours of television, which is more time than he or she spends on any outside activity other than sleeping. 
   The trick for parents is to establish good viewing habits for their child--as well as the entire family--that emphasize quality programming and are suited to the age of the child. While there is generally a variety of quality children's programming throughout the morning and afternoon hours, the concern for many parents is the content of evening programming. Right now, most parents indicate that the so-called ``family viewing'' time of evening--traditionally between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m.--often contains programming that they feel is inappropriate for their children. It is important that broadcasters recognize that the daily ``family viewing'' period needs to focus more on programming that is actually family friendly; shows that parents and children can readily watch together. 
   No one can replace the good judgment of a parent in determining what a child watches on television. However, parents can use all the help they can get in ensuring that more family oriented shows are aired during the evening hours. 
   To help in this endeavor, a number of our nation's largest companies have joined together to establish the Forum for Family Friendly Programming. Like many American families, the members of the Forum are concerned that fewer and fewer television programs are specifically geared towards the entire family. They are concerned, also, that too many of the programs that our children view contain story-lines, language and characters to which they should not be exposed. 
   Most of the companies that belong to the Forum are sponsors of a wide range of television programs, but they believe that more family-friendly television programming, including movies, documentaries, series or informational programs that are interesting or relevant to a broad audience, will actually appeal to more families. 
   Right now, the members of the Forum for Family Friendly Programming are working with and in the entertainment community on a variety of initiatives on family friendly programming including: meetings with industry leaders; speeches and discussions at industry meetings and conferences; award tributes to family friendly television programs; a development fund for family friendly scripts; university scholarships in television studies departments to encourage student interest in family friendly programming; and a public awareness campaign to promote more family friendly programming. 
   Mr. President, as a father and a grandfather, I am deeply concerned about the healthy development of all of our nation's children. Since the future of our country depends upon our children, we must do all that we can to limit their exposure to negative influences and provide them with as safe and nurturing an environment as possible. Therefore, I encourage efforts that will expand the number of quality  family programs that are shown on television, and I congratulate the Forum for Family Friendly Programming on their leadership towards that goal. 
   I believe that passage of this resolution honoring the Forum's commitment will help raise awareness and inspire others in the business world to align themselves with the goal of bringing quality television to our nation's families. I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN, who has been a leader in the Senate on addressing the needs of our children, and I urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this resolution, and calling for it's speedy consideration by the Senate.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, there is an old saying most of us learned as children that goes: If it sounds too good to be true, then it is. The news we have been hearing about bigger than expected budget surpluses for the next 10 to 15 years is precisely that--too good to be true. 
   Why is that? After all, our economy is strong and is still growing, unemployment is at record lows, and the strength of our economy means our Government is able to take in more revenues from taxpayers and businesses alike. Most people would say things are wonderful. Indeed, just ask anyone. Ask the President. Ask Congress. They will tell you there is money for increased spending, there is money there for tax cuts, and we will be able to meet all our needs. After all, we have these enormous surpluses for as far as the eye can see. 
   The truth of the matter is, there is no budget surplus. Let me say it again: There is no budget surplus. The truth is, we are actually running a budget deficit this year. According to both CBO and OMB, as this chart from CBO shows, we currently have an on-budget deficit of $4 billion, and the only way the President, or anyone else, can claim a budget surplus today is by taking that surplus and accumulating the Social Security trust funds and using it to mask the deficit, just as we used Social Security to mask the deficit in 1988. 
   I recall, as Governor of Ohio, everyone celebrating the great budget surplus. The fact of the matter is, in 1988, we were $30 billion in the hole, and what we did with that $30 billion in the hole was mask it with Social Security. For over three decades, Presidents and the Congresses have been using this gimmick: unifying the budget in order to make budget deficits 
   smaller than they really are. 
   It is disingenuous. It continues to jeopardize the stability of the Social Security trust fund, and it is about time we had our lockbox. The American people are smarter than Washington politicians give them credit. They know their Social Security pension funds are being raided for other Government spending programs. They are mad about it, and they want us to stop doing it. 
   We need to get honest budget surplus numbers, and in order to do that, we need to leave Social Security alone and pay attention to creating an on-budget surplus. 
   But here is the President's 15 years of projected surpluses. The whole bar is the unified surplus. The green part is the off-budget Social Security trust fund, and the red part is the true on-  budget surplus. As the President says, there is going to be $6 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2014. But under his projections, he will have an on-budget surplus of $2.868 trillion. The rest of his projection is Social Security. 
   Look at the line on this chart. It is not until fiscal year 2011--fiscal year 2011--before we even see 50 percent of the projected on-budget surplus. In other words, in order to get this great surplus we are supposed to have during the next 15 years, it is not going to be until 2011 that we are actually going to have 50 percent of the on-budget surplus available to us. 
   We will have to go into the 12th year of the President's 15-year projections to get a majority of those surplus dollars. How can we in good conscience talk about spending increases or tax cuts today when we do not even start to get the majority of the money until 12 years from now? It is inconceivable. That is the next President--8 years if he gets reelected--and then we are into a new President. 
   The most frightening aspect of all this is numbers are just predictions. They are not real. But both the Congress and the President are treating their projections as if they are gospel truth, and each is contemplating major fiscal decisions based on their particular beliefs and projections. That is not sound public policy. 
   In fact, last week, CBO Director Dan Crippen said in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee that ``10-year budget projections are highly uncertain'' and that ``economic forecasting is an art that no one has truly mastered.'' That is from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, the man in charge of making Congress' surplus projections. 
   Indeed, as most economists will tell you, the only thing predictable about projections is their unpredictability. So how can we be sure that 5, 10, 15 years from now we will actually have these budget surpluses? The truth is that we cannot. 
   In testimony before the House Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:  
   ..... it's very difficult to project with any degree of conviction when you get out beyond 12, 18 months.  
   Twelve to 18 months--not 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. He said 12 to 18 months. 
   In addition, he stated that  
   ..... projecting five or ten years out is very precarious activity, as I think we have demonstrated time and time again.  
   When the Nation's premier economist warns Congress not to invest in long-range projections, it makes sense for us to listen. 
   If we think back, we will remember it was only 2 years ago that CBO was projecting huge increased budget deficits as far as the eye could see. In fact, in 1997, CBO projected a $267 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2000. Think of it. But today, CBO is projecting a $14 billion surplus for fiscal year 2000--a $281 billion swing in just 2 years. 
   If you think a 2-year swing of that magnitude is incredible, in just the last 6 months, President Clinton's budget projections put together by OMB have swung by a mind-boggling $1 trillion--a trillion dollars. That is more than 10 percent of our national gross domestic product. 
   The important thing to remember is that a $1 trillion paper surplus can vanish just as easily as it appeared, and if we commit to spending hundreds of billions of dollars we do not even have yet, we are placing our Nation's economic future in serious jeopardy. 
   As former Senators Sam Nunn and Warren Rudman wrote in the Washington Post:  
   The surplus is only a projection that cannot be spent. If spending is increased or taxes are cut based on the expectation of huge surpluses and the projection turns out to be wrong, deficits easily could reappear where surpluses are now forecast.  
   Given all that uncertainty about whether or not we will have a budget surplus next year, it makes the most sense for us to remain cautious. We should wait and see if the budget surplus we are currently projecting for fiscal year 2000 even materializes before we embark on new spending programs, as the President and the Democrats in Congress want to do, or cut taxes as Republicans are proposing. 
   As Chairman Greenspan said:  
   I see no reason why we have to make decisions crucially at this point until we are sure that we really have got the surplus in tow.  
   That is Alan Greenspan who has been keeping things in pretty good shape for us the last several years. 
   Why does the President feel the need to quickly spend the surplus we may achieve over the next 15 years? Why are we talking about cutting taxes by $800 billion over 10 years when we do not have the surplus in hand yet? I think eliminating the death tax, relieving the marriage penalty, and lowering income-tax rates are great ideas, but how are we going to pay for them? 
   Personally, I do not think we have any business talking about new spending increases or tax cuts so long as we have this gigantic national debt. Right now, our Nation faces a whopping $5.6 trillion national debt, a debt that has risen 600 percent over the last 20 years. 
   I remind my colleagues, with each passing day, we are spending $600 million a day just on interest on the national debt--$600 million a day. 
   Most Americans do not realize that 14 percent of their tax dollar goes to pay off the interest on the debt, 15 percent goes for national defense, 17 percent goes for nondefense discretionary spending, and 54 percent goes for entitlement spending. 
   Look at this pie chart: entitlements, 54 percent; interest on the debt, 14 percent out of every dollar. We are only spending 15 percent on national defense--and the President knows we need to do better in that regard--and nondefense discretionary spending, 17 percent. 
   We are spending more on interest payments today than we spend on Medicare. We are spending five times as much on interest than we spend on education; 15 times as much as we spend on research at the National Institutes of Health. 
   Even if the on-budget surpluses do happen to come true, then what better way to keep our economy humming and secure for the future of our children and our grandchildren than by paying down the national debt. 
   Indeed, as Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified before the House Ways and Means Committee:  
   [T]he advantages that I perceive that would accrue to this economy from a significant decline in the outstanding debt to the public and its virtuous cycle on the total budget process is a value which I think far exceeds anything else we could do with the money.  
   I think we have a problem. Do you really think that Congress would make the tough choices we are going to need to make to get rid of $27 billion this year in order to maintain the budget caps? I do not think it is going to happen. I think many people today are saying that for defense spending, to deal with Medicare, we are probably going to have to break the caps. 
   If we break the caps, the $14 billion surplus of next year is gone; it is gone. We need to recognize there is no surplus. And if the economic circumstances provide an on-budget surplus--and, boy, we would love to have that--we need to use that money to pay down the debt: no spending hikes, no tax cuts, just pay down the debt. 
   If the President and Congress need an example, all we have to do is emulate what most American families do when times are good and they have extra money. They do not go out and start spending wildly. They look to pay off their debts--credit cards, loans, and mortgages. It is the responsible thing to do, and it is something that Government must do. 
   It was interesting. I was at a meeting the other day and asked the people at the table: What do you think about reducing taxes, with this projected surplus? And they came back to me--conservative businessmen--and said: You know, usually you reduce taxes when the economy is in trouble. 
   One of the gentlemen said: You know, today what people are concerned about is Social Security, and they are concerned about Medicare. 
   It doesn't make any difference whether they are old or young. If they are young, they are worrying about their parents in the future. 
   At this stage in the game, it seems to me the best thing we can do is cool it. I urge my colleagues to stop and look at the projected numbers because they are not real. And if we continue to treat them as if they really are, the consequences of spending money we do not have will be very real and, I think, very bad for the United States of America.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act, legislation that will give small businesses across the nation the time they need to correct first-time paperwork violations before federal fines are assessed When enacted, the provisions of this law would apply as long as the violations do not cause serious harm or threaten public health or safety. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague from Arkansas, Senator BLANCHE LAMBERT-LINCOLN. 
   To own one's business is, for many, the epitome of the American dream, knowing that you are your own boss and that you alone are responsible for the success of your business. It's what motivates thousands of individuals each week to take that initial leap of faith and it is their effort and their perseverance to succeed that constitute the economic and entrepreneurial backbone of this country. 
   Small business owners are reponsible for the employment of millions of individuals, providing the roots for families to settle in small towns and large cities all across America. Through their payroll contributions and their tax base, small businesses--whether it's a shoe store in Cleveland, Ohio or a diner in Arkadelphia, Arkansas--make up the final nucleus of many a community. 
   However, even with their many contributions, small business owners face a number of obstacles to success. One of the larger obstacles they face is the daunting task of meeting federal paperwork requirements. Small business owners spend an inordinate amount of their time filling out various forms to comply with a myriad of government requirements. In fact, small business owners spend about $229 billion per year on compliance costs and some 6.7 billion hours are used annually to fill out the expected paperwork. 
   In addition, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), small business owners are subjected to 63% of the nation's regulatory burden, and the paperwork regulations they are subjected to cost more than $2,000 per employee. 
   I believe whatever we can do to relieve the burden on the small business men and women of our nation will help increase productivity, save money and create more jobs. Obviously, to obtain these benefits necessitates a review of our paperwork requirements on our nation's small businesses. 
   When Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, many small business owners believed they would finally obtain relief from the blizzard of paper to which they are subjected. Unfortunately, it has done too little to stem the tide of Federal paperwork requirements. In 1996, the Act was supposed to reduce the amount of paper by 10%. Instead, it was only a 2.6% *.*.* . 
   When Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, many small business owners believed they would finally obtain relief from the blizzard of paper to which they are subjected. Unfortunately, it has done too little to stem the tide of federal paperwork requirements. In 1996, the Act was supposed to reduce the amount of paper by 10%. Instead, it was only 2.6% reduction. In 1997, the Act was supposed to provide another 10% reduction in the amount of paper. Instead, there was a 2.3% increase. In 1998, the Act was supposed to provide another 5% reduction in the amount of paper. Instead, there was another 1% increase. 
   In addition, under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, federal agencies were required to submit plans to Congress by March of 1998 for waiving and/or reducing fines as deemed appropriate for small business. However, a large majority of federal agencies, including at least half-a-dozen cabinet departments, did not even submit their plans by the March 1998 deadline. In addition, of the plans submitted, most are settlement policies, which force small businesses into negotiations to reduce or eliminate penalties rather than to help small businesses comply with paperwork reductions. 
   Mr. President, even with all the forms that they are required to fill out, and all the time it takes to complete them, small business owners want to comply with the laws of our nation. Their biggest concern, though, is the Sword of Damocles that hangs over them should they send in an incorrect form, or worse, not send one in at all. In the latter instance, it is almost always because they didn't know that they were supposed to fill out any paperwork, and unfortunately, it is such situations that generally bring about hefty fines for small business owners. 
   Clearly, we have an opportunity to help these business owners, and, in turn, help continue the growth of our strong U.S. economy, maintain stable and productive jobs and create new jobs and opportunities. 
   The legislation that Senator LINCOLN and I are introducing, the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act, is a companion bill to H.R. 391, which passed the House on February 11, 1999 by a vote of 274-151. Like the House-passed bill, our legislation will give small business owners a ``grace period'' to make amends for first-time paperwork violations before fines are assessed. The only exceptions would be for violations that cause harm, affect internal revenue laws or involve criminal activity. If a violation threatens public health or safety, each affected agency of jurisdiction would have the discretion to levy a fine as usual, or provide a 24-hour window to correct the infraction. 
   In addition, our bill would establish a multi-agency task force to study how to streamline reporting requirements for small business; establish a point of contact at each federal agency that small businesses could contact regarding paperwork requirements; and require an annual comprehensive list of all federal paperwork requirements for small business to be placed on the Internet. 
   So there is no confusion--our bill does not give small business owners carte blanch to skip their record keeping and reporting requirements. Thus, firefighters will not be threatened with injury on the job because a business doesn't have records of the toxic substances it has on its premises, or an elderly patient in a nursing home will be secure in the knowledge that their medical records will be maintained. 
   As I stated earlier, the men and women of America who own small businesses do not embark on a course of flagrantly violating the laws of our nation. If they did, they would soon be out of business and probably in jail. They just want an opportunity to make up what they didn't do or correct what they've done wrong. 
   Mr. President, compliance through cooperation should be the way our federal agencies do business, however, in many instances, federal agencies are all too eager to ``fine first, ask questions later.'' This legislation will give our nation's small business owners the time they need to correct small, non-threatening paperwork mistakes without having to pay a penalty that could jeopardize their very business. 
   Our legislation is a sensible approach that has the support of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the voice of small business owners across the country, who have written to me in support of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor our bill and I encourage the Senate to act expeditiously. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the NFIB in support of this legislation be inserted into the RECORD.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Certainly, I would be happy to clear up the misconceptions that this bill might endanger firefighters and nursing home patients. 
   Some have claimed that this bill would encourage fraud or abuse of elderly nursing home patients by allowing a penalty waiver for those who violate rules regulating their care. Still others have claimed that the bill would threaten the lives of firefighters by allowing a waiver for businesses that violate rules regulating hazardous substances in the workplace. Neither of these claims is substantiated. 
   Like the Senator from Arkansas, I care very much about the health and safety of all Americans and would not dream of putting seniors or firefighters in obvious jeopardy. Clearly, this is not the kind of negligent misbehavior this bill aims to reward with a civil penalty waiver for a first-time paperwork violation. And this is not the kind of violation covered by this bill.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Allow me to explain. Nursing homes that do not keep proper medical and treatment records for their patients are clearly endangering human health and safety. Small businesses that do not keep the required records of hazardous chemicals are also endangering human health and safety. As such, neither is covered by this bill.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. This bill goes even further than that. The language states that any violation that has ``the potential to cause serious harm to the public interest'' is exempt from this bill and cannot receive a penalty waiver. Where there is a potential to cause serious harm to the public, the agencies will be able to impose, in addition to all of their other remedies, an appropriate civil fine.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. My colleague raises a good point. This bill does not preempt state laws regarding collection of information. What it does say is that states my not impose a civil penalty on small businesses for a first-time violation under Federal laws that the State may administer. 
   Again--I want to make clear--this bill does not preempt state laws. Instead it provides consistency that a small business will not be fined under Federal laws whether the laws are being carried out by Federal or State government.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the achievements of the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring Program. Now in its third school year, this program, which is one of only two school choice experiments in the country, continues to offer hope and promise to nearly 3,700 inner city children and their parents by making private schools, including religious schools, affordable. I have been a longtime supporter of the Scholarship Program, as well as the school choice concept in general. Believing that competition fosters improvement, I made the implementation of this pilot school scholarship plan one of my education reform priorities by signing a 2-year budget package that included $5 million for the introduction of the program in 1995. 
   The Cleveland Scholarship Program is the first of its kind in the country that offers state-funded scholarships for use at both secular and religious private schools, giving low-income students access to an otherwise unattainable private school education in Cleveland, where schools graduate a mere 36 percent of its high school seniors. In September of 1996, during it's first school year, the program provided scholarships to approximately 1,855 students for the public, private, or religious school of their choice. Recent growth of the program's budget enabled the parents of nearly 3,700 students to use vouchers to enroll in 59 participating area schools during the 1998-1999 school year. 
   Two separate studies by Harvard University on the Cleveland Scholarship Program found parents of voucher recipients were more satisfied with many aspects of their school than were parents of students in Cleveland public schools. That satisfaction included the school's academic program, school safety, school discipline, teacher skills, the teaching of moral values, and class size. A separate study found that test  score results in mathematics and reading show substantial gains for Cleveland Scholarship Program students attending the Hope schools, two non-sectarian schools which were created in response to the establishment of the program. Additionally, parents of voucher recipients reported lower levels of disruption in their child's school--including fighting, racial conflict, and vandalism. 
   The results of these studies further underscore the success of this program. Time and again, data and surveys from the state have confirmed the Cleveland Scholarship Program meets the one true test of any taxpayer-supported program--it works. Although the program is not without its critics, I believe the best way to put these criticisms to rest is to continue demonstrating the program's effectiveness in Cleveland as we continue to look beyond the conventional and pursue creative and imaginative approaches to education. 
   I applaud the achievements of the Cleveland Scholarship Program and its contributions to the education of our children, and am proud to say that my hometown serves as a model for the rest of the Nation.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today, the Senate will cast a very important vote on whether we will stand up and honor our commitments to United States trade policies, or enact protectionist trade measures on steel imports that will have little or no favorable effect on the steel industry, yet will ultimately harm many segments of our nation's economy. 
   Let me first stipulate one point--I am now, and I always have been, a strong supporter of Ohio's steel industry. In fact, I believe my actions prove that I have been ``standing up for steel'' for two decades. 
   My support for Ohio's steel industry goes back to the days when I was Mayor of Cleveland. 
   In the early 1980s, when steel imports peaked at nearly 27% and U.S. steelmakers were losing billions of dollars in revenue, I lobbied President Reagan for Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs) in order to give the domestic industry five years of breathing room to modernize and restructure. I rallied with the steelworkers in Cleveland's Public Square to tell America about how our steel industry was being dumped on. 
   A year before the VRA program was set to expire, I began lobbying then-Vice President Bush for a temporary extension, to give the steel industry some protection while the Administration attempted to negotiate a multilateral steel agreement aimed at eliminating unfair foreign practices. 
   All throughout 1988, I fought for the VRA extension. My efforts were successful, because in 1989, President Bush agreed to extend the VRAs two and a half years. 
   And two years later, after I was elected Governor, I was back to lobby the Bush Administration to ensure that all of our trade laws would be vigorously enforced after the extended VRAs finally expired in 1992. 
   In 1991, I was the first Governor in the United States to set up a Steel Industry Advisory Commission--a public-private partnership designed to strengthen ties among the steel industry, the state of Ohio, and its citizens. 
   I also worked to bring steel companies, such as North Star Steel, to Ohio in order to create more, good-paying jobs. I have been there to lead the fight--to make sure that the federal government did not run roughshod over our steel industry. 
   In May 1992, I attended the opening of the U.S. Steel/Kobe Blast Furnace in Lorain, Ohio--a $100 million investment with 2,800 jobs that almost didn't happen. The EPA was going to halt the project, but I went straight to the White House and let them know that what the EPA was proposing in Ohio was ridiculous. 
   Ohio is now the largest steel-producing state in the country, a development I'm proud to say occurred during my tenure as Governor. 
   Last year, a building where state agencies were going to be located was built, and foreign steel was used in place of domestic steel in violation of state law. State law called for a fine of $3,000, but I insisted that the entity responsible for building this facility pay $50,000. I doubt there are very few other public officials in the country who would enforce an existing law so vigorously. 
   When imports of steel shot up last year, and Ohio steel producers started  to suffer, I was one of the first elected officials to speak out. I wrote the President several times, twice on my own and once with other governors, urging him to take all appropriate action under our trade laws to combat steel dumping. I also supported a resolution in the Ohio legislature urging the President to take action. 
   My support for the steel industry has been long-standing, and I dare say it is matched by few individuals. That's why I look seriously upon any proposal that purports to help this important industry. 
   The bill that is before the Senate today would impose a monthly limit on steel imports for the next 3 years. The quotas would apply to all steel mill products from all countries, regardless of whether they have engaged in dumping or not. 
   I have given this legislation much thought and careful consideration, and on its merits, I cannot vote in favor of this bill. 
   Mr. President, I have dedicated my entire 33-year public career to serving the people of Ohio. I am the last person who would want to see the Ohio steel industry and good-paying jobs dry up and go away. I would not vote against this Quota Bill if I believed it was a productive solution that would save jobs in my state. 
   It is because I care about Ohio's workers that I must oppose the Quota Bill today. I wish I could tell Ohio's and our nation's steelworkers that the Quota Bill would save steel jobs. I cannot. I wish I could tell them that the Quota Bill would give the industry a quick fix. It will not. 
   Not only is the Quota Bill bad policy, but voting for it today would be an exercise in futility, because we already know that the President will veto it. 
   In addition, I am concerned that too much emphasis has been placed on this legislation as being some sort of panacea that will help address all of the steel industry's problems. The fact of the matter is, if this legislation becomes law, it will only serve to compound the industry's problems. 
   Passage of this bill will provide a false sense of relief, when what we should really be doing is concentrating our efforts on a long-term solution--one that will make a difference in addressing the viability of our nation's steel industry within the framework of existing law. 
   I have often said that in Ohio, we are no longer the ``Rust Belt'' we are the ``Jobs and Productivity Belt.'' We made this transition thanks in part to the efforts of the steel industry to modernize and become more efficient and competitive. 
   And, it's easy to do when you have good labor-management relations which promotes empowerment, when you have businesses willing to invest in training and advanced manufacturing technology, and when you have partnerships with government and education. It's amazing what you can get. It's what has helped contribute to the importance and significance of steel in Ohio. 
   Overall, the American steel industry is succeeding. It produced record levels of steel in 1997 and 1998, and is now more efficient than it ever has been. It is strong. Its workers are strong. And it can compete in the world marketplace, if the playing field is level. 
   That is why it is so important that we continue to work to get other countries to follow the American example: to open their markets to American goods, to stop subsidizing their national steel industries and to stop dumping steel on our market at unfair prices. 
   We need all of Ohio's 35,400 steelworkers fighting for this approach, and applying the appropriate pressure to get other nations to change their protectionist ways. 
   However, the minute we succumb to the sort of trade practices that we so vehemently oppose, we lose all credibility in the international community. 
   Most every trade expert will attest that this Quota Bill violates World Trade Organization (WTO) rules--rules that are treaty-based and to which the United States is bound. Even supporters of this legislation must acknowledge that fact. 
   Since the bill does violate international trade rules, it would invite our largest trading partners to launch major trade cases against us, cases that, based on our treaty obligations, we would most surely lose. 
   This would give our trading partners the right to take retaliatory trade actions against us. They could slap high tariffs on all manner of American-made products in order to limit our access to their markets or kick us out altogether. Such actions would result in job losses in American industries that rely heavily on exports, such as agriculture, technology and telecommunications and a host of others. 
   One industry that would be particularly hard-hit by a trade war is agriculture. America's farmers grow and export more food than any other farmers in the world. They would be dealt a devastating blow by retaliatory action taken against them--probably the most affected segment regarding American jobs. In my state of Ohio that's crucial because we have some 80,000 farmers. 
   It's also important to farmers across the rest of the country. In fact, just yesterday, I received a letter from 20 major agriculture associations, including American Farm Bureau, outlining their opposition to the Quota Bill. 
   Moreover, for nearly 60 years the United States has been the primary advocate of a free--and, rules-based--system of international trade. The United States is constantly urging other countries to respect international trade agreements and to comply with WTO decisions. 
   The United States has set the example of being the one nation that consistently complies with the WTO. Indeed, the United States has won 19 of the 21 trade cases it has brought to the WTO for dispute resolution, such as the recently settled banana case the U.S. brought against the European Union. 
   How can we expect other countries to abide by international trade rules if the United States, the main advocate of those rules, flagrantly disregards them itself? If we want a rules-based system of international trade to work, so that we can have a level playing field across the board on all goods, America must continue to lead by example. 
   Proponents have argued that even if the Quota Bill violates WTO rules, it would take years for any cases filed against us at the WTO to run their full course. In the meantime, quotas on steel products would give the domestic steel industry some temporary relief from imports in order to recover from last year's import surge. 
   There are two flaws in that logic. First, imports have dropped off dramatically, and are now below the levels that the proponents of the Quota Bill seek to establish. 
   Second, analysts are predicting that the U.S. will actually have steel shortages this summer. This means that the industries that need steel to make their products--like the automakers--will not have enough steel to build new cars in order to meet consumer demand. 
   At the moment, the domestic steel industry can only make enough steel to meet 75% of the domestic demand. Not too many people realize that the remaining 25% must now be imported from overseas, and of that amount, the steel industry imports 25% for its own capacity. 
   In fact, there are steel products that many Ohio manufacturers need that aren't even made in the United States. 
   In short, regardless of what is said, the United States must import steel right now in order to meet domestic demand. 
   So, what happens under the Quota Bill, when there are steel shortages in the United States, while an oversupply of cheap steel remains in the rest of the world? It means that America's manufacturers will have to pay a comparatively higher price for the steel they need to make their finished products, such as cars, machine tools and dish washers. 
   As a result, the cost of American-made finished products will be higher, while the prices for the same goods made overseas will remain low. 
   So what will consumers in the United States and around the world do? They will do the logical thing: buy cheap, foreign-made goods, and at the end of the day, America's manufacturers and workers will lose out, and we will be right back at square one. Except this time, even more American jobs in a variety of other job sectors will be on the line, especially in Ohio. 
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 465,000 Ohio workers in downstream industries that use  steel. This means that for every Ohioan employed in the steel industry, there are 12 other Ohioans who work in steel-using industries and whose jobs would be directly jeopardized by the Quota Bill. 
   I cannot, in good conscience, vote in favor of a piece of legislation that would have the effect of jeopardizing the jobs of more than half-a-million Ohioans--including 80,000 farmers I previously mentioned--for a Quota bill that will have no long-term positive benefits. 
   All in all, this bill could have extremely serious consequences for jobs in Ohio. 
   When I was Governor of Ohio, one of my four economic development initiatives was exports. Because of our actions in the state, Ohio's exports increased by more than 62% during the time that I was Governor. And as most Americans know, as exports increase, so do jobs. 
   Our economy is intertwined with the international marketplace, and it becomes even more so on a daily basis. 
   As one who has argued vigorously to have others take down their trade barriers so we could get our goods into their countries, how can I talk about closing down our borders and keeping other products out? 
   We have also increased investment in Ohio by foreign companies. According to Site Selection magazine, from 1991-1997, Ohio had more growth in non-U.S. owned firms than any other state--some 300 new manufacturing facilities and plant expansions. 
   For me to come out in favor of quotas and trade barriers in today's marketplace would be detrimental to the economic well-being and growth of Ohio as well as jeopardize jobs in my state. 
   What we ought to do is improve the situation that we already have within the framework of current law and WTO rules. 
   I don't think anyone will deny the fact that the steel industry was affected by last year's surge in imports, and this surge was partly the result of a series of financial crises in Asia and Russia that precipitated a collapse in global demand for steel. 
   Naturally, imports were drawn to the United States, where the economy and demand for steel remained strong in comparison to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the collapse in global demand was exacerbated last summer by the 54-day strike at General Motors, the largest consumer of American-made steel. 
   However, the oversupply of steel on world markets is not a new problem facing the U.S. steel industry. It has been a persistent problem that has plagued American steel producers for decades, and it is the legacy of 60 years of foreign government intervention in domestic steel industries. 
   Since the 1930s, other countries have undertaken policies to expand their domestic steel-making capacity and employment, regardless of market conditions. These policies have included tariffs, quotas, heavy government subsidies, state ownership, and government toleration of cartel-like behavior. 
   The end result has been that foreign steel manufacturers are able to produce and sell steel under circumstances that would drive a U.S. steel manufacturer out of business. 
   Quotas will do nothing to address this fundamental problem. We learned from our experience with voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) in the 1980s that restricting steel imports--be it through VRAs or quotas--will do little to discourage other countries from subsidizing their industries or engaging in other market-distorting practices. 
   That's why we ended the VRA's. After trying to match our competitors step for step, the United States determined that only through sound economic and trade policies would we ever overcome the protectionist tendencies of other steel producing nations. That's why we continue to press for fair competition before the WTO and why we continue to win our cases. 
   A good majority of our American steel industry has modernized, restructured, and become more efficient in order to compete in the global marketplace. They are to be commended for making the decisions that make them the best steel industry and the most productive workers in the world. As I have said earlier, smart business decisions have made Ohio the number one steel state in the nation. 
   What we need to do now is level the playing field by going after the unfair, market-distorting practices that have insulated foreign steel producers from the same market pressures our American steel producers face. We need to win our fights in the proper venues and with the facts on our side. 
   If it is our intention to pass legislation in the Senate, we should look at solutions that will truly address problems that exist and that will not provoke an all-out ``trade war.'' 
   To that end, I have been working with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, to develop a legislative solution to deal with the global overcapacity of steel that we believe will more reasonably address the concerns of America's steel industry. 
   I believe the legislation will get to the root of the steel import problem, and is the type of solution we should be pursuing, not this Quota Bill. 
   The Roth bill, the Steel Trade Enforcement Act, would direct the U.S. Trade Representative to start an investigation of the unfair practices that have protected foreign steel manufacturers from the capital market pressures that the American steel industry faces and have protected them from true competition. 
   Once we identify those countries and practices, the proposal would then require the Administration to develop a comprehensive, government-wide strategy to eliminate those practices. There is a follow-up mechanism to make sure that action is taken. 
   The Roth bill would also establish a monitoring program to facilitate the timely release of data on steel imports. This monitoring program could serve as an early warning system for future steel import surges, giving industry and the Administration more time to respond. It will also put our competitors on notice that the United States is watching. 
   The Roth bill also would require the U.S. representatives to the international financial institutions--such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund--to oppose any financing to steel industries abroad. It's not fair to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to subsidize the steel industries of our foreign competitors. 
   Finally, the Roth bill has a provision dealing with so-called ``suspension agreements.'' 
   Under current law, when an antidumping or countervailing duty case is under way, the Administration has the authority to go out and negotiate a ``suspension agreement'' with the offending country. If the Administration is able to reach such an agreement, the pending antidumping or countervailing duty case is suspended. 
   Many steel companies and workers feel like they have been undercut by the recent suspension agreements that the Administration has negotiated with Brazil and Russia on hot-rolled steel imports. The industry would have much preferred that the pending antidumping cases be taken to their full conclusion so that the full antidumping duties could be imposed. 
   The suspension agreement provision would require that the Administration get the support of at least 50% of the industry before finalizing any future suspension agreements. I am particularly pleased that this provision was added to the bill. 
   Mr. President, I believe that Senator ROTH's legislation is a rational approach to the dumping that the United States has been subjected to over the years and is our best bet to effectively deal with those nations that subsidize their steel industries. 
   However, passage of this quota bill before us today will do nothing to assist our domestic steel industry--it will be ruled GATT illegal, which will draw retaliatory actions from other nations. In addition, it will not prevent future job losses in the steel industry and, in fact, could cause job losses in other employment sectors--some with no ties to steel whatsoever such as agriculture. 
   We must do all that we can to ensure continued economic growth in our nation. This legislation does not. Therefore, I cannot support this bill.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, 11 days ago, the American people were relieved to hear that the air war against Yugoslavia was ending. Yesterday, the air war was officially declared over. 
   In the end, I believe it was prayer and the Holy Spirit that brought enlightenment to our leaders that the death and destruction in Kosovo and Serbia must stop. Enough was enough. 
   I rise today to commend our men and women in uniform for their honorable, valiant and courageous service over the last several months in the campaign to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
   Conventional military wisdom has long held that a military victory could  not be achieved without the deployment of troops on the ground. Indeed, television pundits, newspaper editors and even some of my colleagues, advocated the introduction of ground troops to Kosovo based on this widely-held belief. 
   However, the incredible work of our pilots, logistics and support staff during the bombing has proven the conventional wisdom wrong--it is possible to achieve limited military objectives on the ground using air power alone given the quality of the American soldier using our technical superiority. 
   When I traveled to Southeast Europe last month to learn more about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's campaign, I was struck by the commitment and professionalism of our forces throughout the region. Faced with incredibly long working hours, the stress of a combat environment, isolation from family and loved ones and difficult living conditions, each soldier I spoke with strove to do their best in service to their grateful nation. We can ask no more. 
   The American people, and Congress, should especially be proud of these fine men and women in uniform. 
   We should also thank God that we have such soldiers as Chief Warrant Officer David Gibbs, from Massillon, Ohio, and Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Reichert of Wisconsin--two brave Apache helicopter pilots who gave their lives in service to their nation in the Kosovo conflict. 
   A few weeks ago, my wife Janet and I went to Arlington Cemetery to pay our respects to the David Gibbs' family. I shared our appreciation for the sacrifice that he made and that they will continue to make. I get upset when I hear our leaders say we did not have any combat casualties--a euphemism to mean no soldier died in ``actual'' combat. 
   Tell that to David Gibbs' widow, Jean Gibbs. Or to their three children--Allison, Megan, or David. Or his mother, Dorothy. Their lives will never be the same. 
   Since 1991, when I was Governor of Ohio, there have been 32 men and women from Ohio who have died serving their nation, not counting the 19 that died in the Persian Gulf War. 
   Tell the families of those who did not die in combat that their loss is any less significant because their loved one didn't die in battle. 
   We must thank God that we have brave men and women who choose to serve our country, and we must never forget those soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for this nation and the ongoing sacrifice of the families. 
   Mr. President, as you know, I opposed the bombing from Day One. We should have done all that we could to negotiate a diplomatic solution. 
   I was also violently opposed to sending in U.S. ground troops to Kosovo based on my belief that it would instigate an all-out war in southeastern Europe with tremendous repercussions throughout the world. 
   Just in the limited actions of the air war, we have witnessed several potential crises, the ramifications of which will be with us for who knows how long--China, Russia. 
   But I believe we must congratulate President Clinton for sticking to his guns and not letting others pressure him into getting the United States involved in a ground war; he no doubt saved the lives of hundreds, or even thousands, of American soldiers.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, no one cares about our Nation's steelworkers and steel industry more than I. 
   Since 1979, I have been at the forefront in support of Ohio's steel industry. As Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio, I pressured the Reagan and Bush Administrations to enforce the voluntary restraint agreements, VRAs, on steel and to make sure that all U.S. trade laws were enforced as soon as those agreements expired. In 1991, I set up the first Ohio Steel Industry Advisory Council as a public-private partnership to strengthen ties among the steel industry, the state of Ohio and its citizens. 
   And last year, when steel imports reached record levels, I was one of the first elected officials to pressure the Clinton administration to stop the illegal dumping of steel in our country. Since October of 1998, I have written the President three letters urging him to take action on behalf of the steel industry. 
   Ohio is now the largest steel producing state in the Nation--a development that occurred during my term as governor. Many have assumed that because steel is so important to the state of Ohio that I would vote in favor of this legislation. But it is because steel is so important that I cannot vote in favor of this legislation. There are three fundamental reasons why. 
   First, this bill does not provide industry-wide assistance. The legislation as it has been presented to the Senate provides loan-guarantee assistance to a few steel companies, and not all companies. In fact, the vast majority of steel companies in Ohio have not approached me indicating that my vote in favor of this legislation was crucial. Some steel companies in my state are opposed to this bill. 
   It does not make sense that in an economy as strong as ours, with steel production in the United States at record, all-time highs, with all the construction that is occurring in our nation, and all the cars that are being made and the record unemployment, that we should pass a package that is meant to assist only a handful of companies. 
   Which brings me to my second point: the government should not be in the position of picking winners and losers. What this legislation does is tell those companies that may have made poor business decisions that they will be given help. Meanwhile, we ignore those  companies that have done the right actions to make themselves competitive. This is not the spirit of American enterprise. 
   Indeed, I have to ask if we are going to make it the business of the federal government to help companies inside particular industries on a regular basis. We could be here in the Senate spending every taxpayer dollar bailing out specific businesses inside specific industries whenever we saw an economic threat or whenever we desired. Where will we draw the line? How will we decide which failing companies we'll bail out? What criteria will we use? Every time a company has a bad quarter or a bad year, should the federal government provide them with financial assistance? How are we different from those foreign countries we criticize for subsidizing their companies that are struggling to compete? These are the kinds of questions we need to ask if this is going to be the policy our government pursues. 
   Third, the history behind such loan programs points to a high default rate. The proponents of this legislation have indicated that they expect a default rate on the loans of 14%. That means of the $1 billion worth of loans that the government will guarantee for steel manufacturers, $140 million of that is expected to never be repaid. For the oil and gas industry, the expected default rate is higher, 25%, or $125 million on a loan guarantee of $500 million. 
   In essence, what Congress wants to do is allow the federal government to simply write off $265 million of taxpayer funds. That money has to come from somewhere, whether it's the Social Security trust fund, tax increases, or cuts in essential programs for our children. 
   The last time this nation established a steel loan guarantee program in 1978, the default rate was 77%. Five companies took out loans--all five companies defaulted and the U.S. taxpayer was forced to pick-up the tab for $222 million. The U.S. Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration said at the time, ``By any measurement, EDA's steel loan program would have to be considered a failure.'' In addition, EDA said, ``the program is an excellent example of the folly inherent in industrial policy programs.'' Now, I cannot guarantee that the companies today, if given these loan guarantees, will default at such a high rate, but I do not believe we should be making the same mistakes twice at the expense of other federal programs. 
   Mr. President, there have been scant few instances where the Federal Government getting involved in market decisions has been productive. I do not believe that we should do so here.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the Federalism Accountability Act of 1999, along with my colleagues Senator FRED THOMPSON and Senator CARL LEVIN. Our legislation is the culmination of months of bipartisan effort that we believe will restore the fundamental principles of federalism. 
   In my 33 years of public service, at every level of government, I have seen first hand the relationship of the federal government with respect to state and local government. The nature of that relationship has molded my passion for the issue of federalism and the need to spell-out the appropriate role of the federal government with respect to our state and local governments. It is why I vowed that when I was elected to the Senate, I would work to find ways in which the federal government can be a better partner with these levels of government. 
   I have long been concerned with the federal government becoming involved in matters and issues which I believe are best handled by state and local governments. I also have been concerned about the tendency of the federal government to preempt our state and local governments and mandate new responsibilities without the funding to pay for them. 
   In a speech before the Volunteers of the National Archives in 1986 regarding thee relationship of the Constitution with America's cities and the evolution of federalism, I brought to the attention of the audience my observations since my early days in government regarding the course American government had been taking:  
   We have seen the expansion of the federal government into new, non-traditional domestic policy areas. We have experienced a tremendous increase in the proclivity of Washington both to preempt state and local authority and to mandate actions on state and local governments. The cumulative effect of a series of actions by the Congress, the Executive Branch and the U.S. Supreme Court have caused some legal scholars to observe that while constitutional federalism is alive in scholarly treatises, it has expired as a practical political reality.  
   We have made great progress since I gave that speech more than a dozen years go. 
   An outstanding article last year written by Carl Tubbesing, the deputy executive director of the National Council of State Legislatures, in State Legislatures magazine, outlined what he called the five ``hallmarks of devolution''--legislation in the 1990's that changed the face of the federal-state-local government partnership and reversed the decades long trend toward federal centralization. 
   These bills are the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Safe Drinking Water Reform Act Amendments, Welfare Reform, Medicaid reforms such as elimination of the Boren amendment, and the establishment of the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Also, just this year, Congress has passed and the President has signed into law two important pieces of legislation which enhance the state, local and federal partnership. Those initiatives are the Education Flexibility Act, which gives our states and school districts the freedom to use their federal funds for identified education priorities, and the Anti-Tobacco Recoupment provision in the Supplemental Appropriations bill that prevents the federal government from taking any portion of the $246 billion in tobacco settlement funds from the states. 
   Although these achievements have helped revive federalism, it is clear that state and local governments still need protection from federal encroachment in state and local affairs. It is equally clear that the federal government needs to do more to be better partners with our state and local governments. As Congress is less eager to impose unfunded mandates, largely because of the commitments we won through the Unfunded Mandates law, there is a growing interest in imposing policy preemptions. The proposed federal moratorium on all state and local taxes on Internet commerce is just one striking example that could have a devastating effect on the ability of States and localities to serve their citizens. 
   The danger of this growing trend toward federal preemption is the reason the Federalism Accountability Act is so important. The legislation makes Congress and federal agencies clear and accountable when enacting laws and rules that preempt State and local authority. It also directs the courts to err on the side of state sovereignty when interpreting vague Federal rules and statutes where the intent to preempt state authority is unclear. 
   I am particularly gratified that this legislation addresses a misinterpretation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act as it applies to large entitlement programs. The Federalism Accountability Act clarifies that major new requirements imposed on States under entitlement authority are to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as unfunded mandates. It also requires that where Congress has capped the Federal share of an entitlement program, the accompanying committee and CBO reports must analyze whether the legislation includes new flexibility or whether there is existing flexibility to offset additional costs incurred by the States. This important ``fix'' to the Unfunded Mandates law is long overdue and I am pleased we are including it in our federalism bill. 
   The Federalism Accountability Act is a welcome and needed step toward protecting our States and communities against interference from Washington. It builds upon the gains we have already made in restoring the balance between the Federal Government and the States envisioned by the Framers of our Constitution. I am proud to have played a role in crafting it, and I hope all my colleagues will lend their support to this worthy legislation.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with several of my Senate colleagues that will address the physical, cognitive and social development of an often-overlooked segment of our nation's population--children from prenatal to three years old. 
   Our bill, the ``Prenatal, Infant and Child Development Act of 1999,'' will give states the necessary tools to help children cultivate the basic learning patterns and abilities that they will use throughout their lives. We need to do all that we can to create healthy, early childhood development systems across the country, and Senator GRAHAM and I believe it is within the most important years of a child's life--prenatal to three--that the most beneficial influence can be provided by parents, grandparents and caregivers. 
   Every field of endeavor has peak moments of discovery, when past knowledge converges with new information, new insights and new technologies to produce startling opportunities for advancement. For the healthy development of young children--we are faced with one such moment. Today, thanks to decades of research on brain chemistry and sophisticated new technologies, neuroscientists have the data that tells us the experiences that fill a baby's first days, months, and years have a decisive impact on the architecture of the brain and on the nature and extent of one's adult capabilities. It is the education, the love and the nurturing that our children receive during the years prenatal to three that will help determine who they become 10, 20 and 30 years down the road. 
   Consequently, a tremendous opportunity exists to assist those individuals and families most at risk in the area of prenatal care through age three. We must work to create systems that support and educate families expecting a baby and those already with young children. We must present a message that is perfectly clear--education does not and cannot begin in kindergarten, or even in a quality preschool. 
   Mr. President, in 1997, I served as Chairman of the National Governors' Association (NGA). My focus during my tenure as Chairman, was the National Education Goal One, that by the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn. 
   We developed goals, model indicators, and measures of performance of child and family well-being in order to impact school readiness. The results-oriented goals focused states on the improved conditions of young children and their families. We encouraged state and local governments to look across a variety of delivery systems--health care, child care, family support, and education--to make sure these systems would work together effectively for young children and their families. Based on that effort, between 1997 and 1998, 42 governors made early childhood development a keynote issue as they outlined their state agendas. 
   Improving education is really about the process of ``lifelong learning,'' which includes efforts based on what doctors and researchers have said about the importance of positive early childhood learning experiences. The traditional primary and secondary education community needs to recognize that investments in early childhood aid their ultimate goal--that is, a classroom that can continue to move the learning process forward. To achieve that goal, a significant tenet of our education agenda must be to ensure that our children enter school ready to learn. Thus, we must support parents and caregivers, to help them understand that day-to-day interaction with young children helps children develop cognitively, socially and emotionally. 
   To ensure that children have the best possible start in life, supports must exist to help parents and other adults who care for young children. Supports that are critical for young children from prenatal through age three include health care, nutrition programs, childcare, early development services adoption assistance, education programs, and other support services. 
   There are three ways we can enhance these supports and create new ones. The first is to build on existing programs well underway in the states and the local communities by protecting and increasing federal commitments to worthwhile programs such as WIC (Women, Infants, and Children), CCDBG (Child Care and Development Block Grant), and S-CHIP (State-Children's Health Insurance Program). 
   The second is to improve coordination among federal agencies in the administration of early childhood programs. As Chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia. I am taking steps to ensure, for example, that the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services communicate with each other about the early childhood programs for which they are responsible in order to determine which are duplicative and which are most successful. 
   The Results Act contemplates that agencies should be using their Performance Plans to demonstrate how daily activities, including coordination, contribute to the achievement of strategic goals. GAO evaluated the  Departments of Education and Health and Human Services 5-year Strategic Plans, and FY 1999 and FY 2000 Annual Performance Plans with regard to their coordination efforts. GAO found that both departments' plans are not living up to their full potential. While they address the issue of coordination, the plans provide little detail about their intentions to implement such coordination efforts. I met with both departments and asked that they submit an amended Performance Plan that provided a more detailed compilation of coordination activities and examples. We should emerge from this exercise with a consensus on the most promising programs for our children. 
   The third way to improve support services is to encourage states to make prenatal to three development a priority. Our bill gives state and local governments additional resources to provide these necessary support services. At the same time, it recognizes that tight spending restraints limit available resources. Consequently, it is a modest, incremental bill that encourages collaboration and integration among existing programs and services and provides additional flexibility to states and 
   local governments if they implement programs to provide coordinated services dedicated to meeting the needs of young children. 
   Most child advocacy groups rank collaboration on the local level as fundamental and essential to successful programs for healthy childhood development. Under the bill, funds will be provided through the CCDBG program and will reward states that initiate such collaboration in creating state and local councils. It will also encourage states with existing collaboratives to help them expand their focus to social, emotional and cognitive development so that children have the best possible start in life. Funds could be used for a variety of coordinated services, such as child care, child development, pediatric literacy, parent education, home visits, or health services. States will lay out plans that identify ways to further promote the importance of early childhood care and education. Plans should also identify existing supports available for these children and ways that state and local councils can work with already established early development programs. 
   In addition, the bill focuses on three particular areas to increase public awareness and enhance training opportunities for parents and other adults caring for young children. 
   The first would provide funding to expand a satellite television network nationally. In order to help parents and caregivers do a better job of creating an environment where kids can learn, the legislation provides funds to support satellite television network services directly connected to child care centers, preschools, colleges, Early Head Start sites and the Internet. These services include high quality training, news, jobs and medical information dedicated to the specific needs of the Head Start staff and others in the early childhood community. In my state of Ohio, we already have networks in place at 1,500 sites. 
   The bill provides for a partnership between at least one non-profit organization and other public or private entities specializing in broadcast programs for parents and professionals in the early childhood field. The goal is to blend the latest in satellite technology with sound ``prenatal to three'' information and training principles, potentially reaching more than 140,000 caregivers and parents each month. 
   The second would provide financial incentives for child-care workers to pursue credentialing or accreditation in early childhood education. Although many states do not have formal credentialing standards, there are several national organizations with accreditation curricula. The legislation encourages caregivers to pursue skills-based training (including via satellite or on the Internet) that leads to credentialing or accreditation by the state or national organization. Whatever qualified incentive program is initiated, employers would be required to match each dollar of the Federal contribution. 
   The third would reauthorize and expand the multimedia parenting resources through video, print and interactive resources in the PBS ``Ready to Learn'' initiative. These resources include: 
   Expanded Internet offerings that enable parents to reinforce PBS' ``Ready to Learn'' curriculum at home. ``Ready to Learn'' material would be directly accessible from the web for parents to utilize in reinforcing their child's appreciation of public television programs prior to and after program viewing. 
   Expanded national programming, such as Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street. 
   Formalized and expanded ``Ready to Learn Teachers'' training and certificate programs using ``The Whole Child'' video courseware, collateral print materials and the development of new video and print courseware. 
   Expanded caregiver/parent training which would include workshops, distribution of material, and broadcasting of educational video vignettes regarding developmentally appropriate activities for young children. 
   Deployment of a 24-hour channel of Ready to Learn-based children's programming and parenting training through digital technology. 
   Our bill would also allow the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to serve young children in a more effective manner by allowing states the ability to transfer up to 10 percent of a state's TANF grant to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). Originally, the 1996 welfare reform bill allowed states this flexibility. However, this was restricted in 1998 to allow states to transfer just 4.25 percent of their TANF grant as an offset to help pay for new highway investments in TEA-21. Social Services Block Grants (Title XX of the Social Security Act) are a flexible source of funds that states may use to support a wide variety of social services for children and families, including child day care, protective services for children, foster care, and home-based services. 
   The bill would also allow an additional 15 percent transfer of TANF money to the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) for expenditures under a state early childhood collaboration program. Currently, states are permitted to transfer up to 30 percent of TANF to a combination of the CCDBG and SSBG. The Welfare Reform Act restructured federal childcare programs, repealed three welfare-related childcare programs and amended the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG). Under current law, states receive a combination of mandatory and discretionary grants, part of which is subject to a state match. These funds would allow states to create or expand local early childhood development coordination councils (10 percent of the transfer authority), or to enhance child care quality in existing programs (5 percent of the transfer authority). 
   Using these new resources, states can implement coordinated programs at the local level, such as ``one-stop shopping'' for parents with young children. Under this particular program, parents could have a well-baby care visit, meet with a counselor to discuss questions and concerns about the baby's development or receive referrals for help in enrollment in child-care. 
   Further, the legislation would alter the high performance bonus find within TANF to include criteria related to child welfare. The current criteria are based upon the recommendations of the National Governors' Association (NGA) high performance bonus fund work group. The bonus fund currently 
   provides $200 million annually to states for meeting certain work-related performance targets, such as improvement of long-term self-sufficiency rates by current and former TANF recipients. The performance targets should be expanded to include family- and child-related criteria, such as increases in immunization rates, literacy and preschool participation. 
   Finally, our bill encourages States to use their Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant to target activities that address the needs of children from prenatal to three. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds a broad range of health services to mothers and children, particularly those with low income or limited access to health services. Its goals are to reduce infant mortality, prevent disease and handicapping conditions among children and increase the availability of prenatal, delivery and postpartum care to mothers. 
   States are required to use 30 percent of their block grant for preventive and primary care services for children, 30 percent for services to children with special health care needs, and 40 percent at the states' discretion for either of these groups or for other appropriate maternal and child health activities.  Using this existing funding, this legislation encourages states to design programs to address the social and emotional development needs of children under the age of five. It encourages states to provide coordinated early development services, parent education, and strategies to meet the needs of state and local populations. It does not mandate any specific model, nor does it require that states set-aside a specific amount of money from this block grant. Rather, it is intended to give states flexibility in finding money to devote more resources to existing or new healthy early childhood development systems. 
   Mr. President, the pace at which children grow and learn during the first three years of life makes that period the most critical in their overall development. Children who lack proper nutrition, health care and nurturing during their early years tend to also lack adequate social, motor and language skills needed to perform well in school. 
   I believe that all children, parents, and caregivers should have access to coordinated information and support services appropriate for healthy early childhood development in the first three years of life. The changing structure of the family requires that states streamline and coordinate healthy early childhood development systems of care to meet the needs of parents and children in the 21st century. 
   The Federal Government's role in the development of these systems of care is minimal; it must give states the flexibility to implement programs that respond to local needs and conditions. Although it's just a modest step, that's exactly what our bill does. 
   Our children are our most precious natural resource. They are our hope and they are our future. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor our legislation, and I urge the Senate during the 106th Congress to make prenatal to three a priority for the sake of our children.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, prior to being elected to the Senate, I served the people of Ohio for two terms as governor. Before that, I served for 10 years as the mayor of Cleveland. I have also been Lieutenant Governor, a County Commissioner, a County Auditor and a State Legislator. 
   I have 33 years of experience at every level of government, which I believe gives me wonderful insight into the relationship of the federal government with respect to state and local government. 
   It is the main reason why, over the length of my service to the people of Ohio, I have developed a passion for the issue of federalism--that is, assigning the appropriate role of the federal government in relation to state and local government. 
   That passion remains with me to this day, and I vowed when I got to the Senate that I would work to sort out the appropriate roles of the federal, state and local governments. 
   I have committed myself to find ways in which the federal government can be a better partner with our nation's state and local governments. 
   One of my concerns has been the overreaching nature of the federal government into areas I have always felt properly belong under the purview of state and local government. Another of my concerns has been the propensity of the federal government to pre-empt our state and local governments. In many cases, the federal government mandated responsibilities to state and local governments and forced them to pay for the mandates themselves. 
   In regard to unfunded mandates, I, and a number of other state and local elected officials finally got fed up enough to lobby Congress to do something about it, and in 1995, Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. I was pleased to be at the Rose Garden representing our state and local governments at the signing ceremony by the President. 
   And while we now know the cost of what the federal government is imposing on the state and local governments, Congress has still got to do more to reverse the tide of ``command and control'' policies in areas intrusive which are the proper responsibility of state and local governments. 
   Indeed, as syndicated columnist David Broder pointed out in a January 11, 1995 article, ``the unfunded mandate bill is a worthy effort. But in the end, the real solution lies in sorting out more clearly what responsibilities should be financed and run by each level of government.'' 
   I wholeheartedly agree. 
   It is imperative that we delineate the proper role of government at the federal, state and local level. 
   Our forefathers referred to this differentiation as federalism, and outlined this relationship in the 10th Amendment:  
   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.  
   The importance of the 10th Amendment was inherent to the framers of the Constitution, who sought to preserve for the states their ability to pass and uphold laws that were specific to each individual state. In this way, states would keep their sovereignty over what we consider the ``day to day'' running of society, reserving the more comprehensive functions of the nation to the federal government. 
   This was envisioned by James Madison, who defined the various roles of government in Federalist Paper #45. He wrote:  
   The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce ..... The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and property of the people and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the state.  
   In a speech before the Volunteers of the National Archives in 1986 regarding the relationship of the Constitution with America's cities and the evolution of federalism, I raised a concern about the trend in American government that I had witnessed since the 1960's. I said:  
   We have seen the expansion of the federal government into new, non-traditional domestic policy areas. We have experienced a tremendous increase in the proclivity of Washington both to pre-empt state and local authority and to mandate actions on state and local governments. The cumulative effect of a series of actions by the Congress, the Executive Branch and the U.S. Supreme Court have caused some legal scholars to observe that while constitutional federalism is alive in scholarly treatises, it has expired as a practical political reality.  
   Mr. President, we have made progress since I spoke those words 13 years ago. Not to the level sought by Madison, but progress just the same. As I mentioned earlier, Congress has passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. We've also passed Safe Drinking Water Act reforms in 1996. In addition, states are making the difference in Medicaid reform and because of the efforts of state leaders working with Congress, we now have comprehensive welfare reform. 
   Also, just this year, we've seen the passage and signing into law of the ``Ed-Flex'' bill, which gives our states and school districts the freedom to use their federal funds for identified education priorities and today we passed legislation preventing the federal government from recouping the tobacco settlement funds back from the states. 
   But we must still do more. 
   Today, we are voting on juvenile justice legislation that would impose certain new federal laws on what is now and has traditionally been a jurisdiction of our state and local governments. 
   I have great respect for the managers of this legislation; they have worked incredibly hard to put together this bill which contains a number of good provisions meant to fight juvenile crime and a smorgasbord of other things that on the surface look very appealing. 
   Unfortunately most of them deal with things that are the proper responsibility of state and local government and violate in spirit and in substance my interpretation of the 10th Amendment and frankly, the interpretation of Alexander Hamilton. 
   Hamilton, who was the greatest proponent in his day of a strong national government, saw law enforcement as a state and local concern. If Hamilton were alive today, he would be appalled at the use of the police power by federal agencies. 
   And to emphasize Hamilton's view, we need only look at Federalist Paper #17:  
   There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the province of the state governments, which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light. I mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice.  
   Crime control is a primary responsibility of local and state officials. They are on the front lines and they are best suited to tackle the specific problems in their jurisdictions. 
   Juvenile crime control measures are being enacted and carried out in the various states across the country. And sometimes it does take a tragedy such as the one that occurred in Littleton, Colorado or the shooting this morning in Atlanta to spur states on, but they fully recognize their responsibility to provide for the safety of their citizens. 
   The states understand their role and the need to prevent any further increase in juvenile crime. They are responding to that need. 
   Involvement by the federal government in this matter often duplicates the efforts of our state and local governments. 
   I'll never forget, in 1996, when I was Governor and I went to a crime control conference in Pennsylvania with then-Majority Leader Bob Dole. He was running for President at the time. The  head of the conference suggested 5 things the federal government should do to reduce juvenile crime. It made sense to me, but when I looked at the recommendations, I realized that in Ohio, we were already doing the things that were recommended. 
   In 1994, we instituted a program called ``RECLAIM Ohio'' which is an innovative approach to juvenile corrections. This program stresses local decision-making and the creation of more effective, less costly community-based correction alternatives to state incarceration. 
   Under ``RECLAIM Ohio,'' local juvenile court judges are given the flexibility to provide the most appropriate rehabilitation option. Since 1992, the population of juvenile offenders in Ohio's youth correction facilities has dropped 20% as a result of this and other innovative local and state programs. 
   Mr. President, the success we have had in Ohio might never have come about if we had to divert our resources towards a federally mandated program. We have seen results with ``RECLAIM Ohio;'' it is best suited for us. 
   In fact, our ``RECLAIM Ohio'' program was selected as one of the top ten innovative programs in government by the JFK School of Government at Harvard University--worthy of replicating elsewhere in the United States. 
   In 1995, Ohio crafted its own comprehensive juvenile crime bill. This bill imposed mandatory bind-over provisions for the most heinous crimes and longer minimum sentences. 
   I believe we should heed the words of Senator FRED THOMPSON, who gave an eloquent speech about this bill last Wednesday. He said ``Among other things, [this bill] makes it easier to prosecute juveniles in Federal criminal court. We have about 100 to 200 prosecutions a year of juveniles in Federal court. It is a minuscule part of our criminal justice system.'' To put that in perspective, Senator THOMPSON pointed out that in 1998, there were ``58,000 Federal criminal cases filed involving 79,000 defendants.'' 
   Think about what Senator THOMPSON says--58,000 total federal criminal cases filed; some 200 prosecutions a year of juveniles in Federal court. Do we honestly think that we'll have an extraordinarily dramatic increase in juvenile prosecutions under this bill? I have to ask: why on earth are we doing this? 
   He further stated, ``[This bill] would allow juveniles as young as 14 years of age to be tried as an adult for violent crimes and drug offenses--drug offenses, again, that are of the street crime category, where we have laws on the books in every State of the Union.'' 
   In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, the leaders of the National Governors' Association said ``the nation's governors are concerned that attempts to expand federal criminal law.....into traditional state functions would have little effect in eliminating crime but could undermine state and local anti-crime efforts.''

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the American Bar Association's Task Force on the Federalization of Criminal Law in its report issued at the end of last year stated that ``more than 40% of the federal criminal provisions enacted since the Civil War have been enacted since 1970.'' As a footnote, the report indicates that more than a quarter of the federal criminal provisions were enacted over the sixteen year period of 1980-1996. 
   Some change in the responsibility is legitimate, based upon the scope of particular offenses. However, many changes have simply evolved from current state and local laws that the federal government has either co-opted or the Congress has directed federal agencies to carry-out. 
   As we continue to assign a greater involvement for the federal government in law enforcement, the impact on other resources is also strained, primarily the federal court system. 
   And for those who understand the traditional role of state and local law enforcement, it becomes increasingly frustrating to see the shift in prosecuted crimes. 
   Earlier this month in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee, Federal Appeals Court Judge Gilbert S. Merritt said that his Court's docket and the case load of the U.S. Attorney's office for his jurisdiction consists of ``mainly drug and illegal possession of firearms cases and other cases that duplicate state crimes'' and that ``federal prosecution of drug and firearms crime is having a minimal effect on the distribution of drugs and illegal firearms.'' 
   Most compelling, Judge Merritt said ``our law enforcement efforts would be much more effective if Congress repealed most duplicate federal crimes and tried to help local and state street police, detectives, prosecutors and judges do a more effective job.'' 
   Judge Merritt suggested that before we federalize crime enforcement, we should ``concentrate federal criminal law enforcement in only the following core areas:

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this week in the Senate, we are discussing legislation that is meant to address the seemingly ever-growing problem of juvenile crime. Before we despair, let us recognize that the overwhelming majority of young people in America are good kids and don't get into trouble with the law and are making a substantial contribution to our society. In fact, in my State of Ohio, the adjudications of young people are down as well as incarceration of young offenders. 
   However, most Americans cannot turn on television, read a newspaper, or pick up a magazine without being told about the crisis facing our society because of young people who have turned violent. The fact that this problem exists at all is a sad commentary on our modern society. However, it is a reality, and we have got to deal with it. The question is, How do we deal with it? As we in Congress try to answer that question we have to make sure that we take the time to deal with juvenile crime from the proper perspective. 
   We cannot expect there to be a silver bullet or a quick fix that will solve our problems, although the recent tragedy in Littleton, CO, has intensified the urgency and our search for answers. 
   Naturally, part of the solution to juvenile crimes is traditional crime prevention, penalties and sentences. However, these remedies, while important, only treat the symptoms of the disease and not the disease itself. I believe our focus should not only be on the symptoms of juvenile crime, but on the root causes as well. 
   Two or three years ago, Princeton University Professor John DiIulio lamented over the upcoming ``predator generation'' because projected demographics showed a marked increase in the amount of young people who were going to become violent in our society. Professor DiIulio commented that we would have a real problem around 2010 to 2015 As Professor DiIulio stated, we have a generation, it seems, growing up in moral poverty. And that is the poverty of being without loving, capable, responsible adults who teach kids right from wrong. 
   Concerned about his pronouncement, I convened a juvenile crime summit in 1997 in Ohio and again in 1998, as Governor. We found that it wasn't longer sentences or boot camps or harsher penalties that were required. What we found we needed to do was to get into the lives of our children at an early age, including while they are in their mother's womb, to give them the positive influences they need. 
   Within the next two weeks, I will be introducing legislation along with Senator BOB GRAHAM from Florida that will help us address the needs of our children in the most critical times of their lives--pre-natal to three. 
   When I was Governor, I often said that if I had a magic wand to solve Ohio's problems, I would reconstitute the family. 
   It's the dysfunction of the family and the lack of moral and religious values that causes so many problems in our nation today. 
   Too often our children are groundless--they have no honor nor fear of the Lord, nor any understanding of the 10 Commandments. 
   I believe the best place to catch problems and prevent them from ever occurring is when children are at their youngest, when parents and young children are forming life-long attachments and when parents and other care-givers have an opportunity to construct lasting values. 
   Government is a lousy substitute for the family. Unfortunately, there are circumstances where the government is the only alternative because there is no family in place. 
   In these situations, we must look for the most effective way to give them our assistance. 
   I truly believe there is something we can do to help in that respect. 
   Today, thanks to decades of research on brain chemistry and through the utilization of sophisticated new technologies, neuro-scientists are telling us that the experiences that fill a baby's first days, months, and years have a decisive impact on the development of the brain and on the nature and extent of one's adult capacities. 
   As a result of the research, we know that throughout the entire process of development, beginning before birth, the brain is affected by environmental conditions such as nourishment, nurturing and sensory stimulation; early childhood care has a decisive and long-lasting impact on how people develop their ability to learn, and their capacity to regulate their own emotions; there are times when negative experiences--or the absence of appropriate stimulation--are more likely to have serious and sustained effects, the period of prenatal to three is such a time in a child's development; the human brain has a remarkable capacity to change, but timing is crucial and the first three years of life appear to be the most influential period for growth and change. 
   To ensure that children prenatal to three have the best possible start in life, we must establish specific support mechanisms to help parents and other adult care-givers. We have to become better partners. 
   These include health care, nutrition programs, childcare, early intervention services, adoption assistance, education programs, and other support services. 
   We must also reach out to parents--our children's first teachers and caregivers--to help them understand that the day-to-day interaction with children helps them to develop cognitively, socially and emotionally. 
   A mother comforting her crying baby, a father holding and reading to his toddler and a care-giver singing and playing with an infant are not just involved in ``feel-good'' interactions. 
   They are involved in biological activities that exert a powerful, enduring impact on the young child's physical, intellectual, emotional and social development. 
   Mr. President, you know, with your large family, that these positive early childhood experiences give children a jump-start or a life-long learning opportunity. 
   It is imperative that our nationwide education agenda be geared toward ensuring that children enter school ready to learn. Otherwise, we put our children at a grave disadvantage of not being well-rounded and productive members of society. 
   In 1991, in my first State of the State Address, I drew a line in the sand in Ohio and said that this was going to be the last generation of children to go on welfare, go to jail, to get pregnant while they are teenagers. 
   We make a commitment to Head Start, to enroll as many eligible children as possible and increasing the funding for that program from $18.4 million in fiscal year 1990 to $181.3 million in fiscal year 1998. 
   And, the fact of the matter is that today in Ohio, we have a slot for every child who is eligible for Head Start, public school, pre-school or special needs. Ohio leads the nation--and does so primarily with state tax dollars. 
   In addition, we established Early Start, which was designed to provide early intervention services for children from pre-natal to three who are at significant risk of abuse, neglect or future developmental delay. It's just a fantastic program.  
   I believe a Federal investment in our children at the most critical juncture of their lives--pre-natal to three--will do more to end the cycle of crime and violence in America than anything else the Senate could do. 
   Studies looking at resiliency in adolescents are finding that a stable beginning contributes significantly to the youth's ability to take control and turn their life around. 
   During consideration of this juvenile justice legislation, we have considered, and may still consider, controversial proposals associated with this bill that elicit either solid support of deep opposition. 
   Yet, when it comes time to consider our legislation to provide enhanced prenatal-to-3 services, I am hopeful that proposal will receive support from both sides of the aisle. 
   I will speak again on this issue when I introduce our legislation in the next 2 weeks. 
   However, with the context of the floor debate, I could not pass up this opportunity to express my views on how best we can get to the root of juvenile crime in this country. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. For the information of all Senators, it is expected that the Senate will resume debate on the juvenile justice bill on Monday afternoon. On Monday, it may be the intention of the leadership to postpone or vitiate the cloture vote with respect to Y2K, if an agreement can be reached regarding proceeding to the bill. However, until or if that vote is canceled, all Senators should be prepared to vote beginning at 9:45 on Tuesday. 
   Senators who have amendments on the list with respect to juvenile justice should be prepared to offer their amendments on Monday. However, no votes will occur on Monday. 
   As previously announced, the majority leader would like to consider the Y2K legislation later in the week, as well as the supplemental appropriations conference report and the bankruptcy reform bill. Therefore, next week, beginning Tuesday, it will be a busy week with rollcall votes throughout each day and evening, if necessary. Consequently, all Members' cooperation will be greatly appreciated.

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize Boston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resort in Peninsula, OH. Boston Mills/Brandywine recently was awarded the Times Mirror Company's Silver Eagle Award for Environmental Excellence for their efforts in the area of energy conservation. In response to the local community's increasing energy demands during seasonal snowmaking operations, Boston Mills recently installed a $1.5 million advanced snowmaking system which monitors data from a nearby pumping station, weather stations, and snowmaking machines to provide for maximum snow production at maximum power efficiency. This effort has enabled the area to produce the same amount of snow in less time, and at a savings of 962,000 kilowatt hours of electricity, which represents 69.5 percent of the community's electricity consumption. In addition, by leasing new grooming vehicles which operate on 33 percent less fuel and reduce grooming time, the area was able to reduce diesel fuel consumption by 46.9 percent, or 9,404 gallons. I am proud to report on the positive impact that the Boston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resort has had on the local community in Peninsula and commend them for the example they have set in civic leadership on this front. I congratulate them on their award and believe the praise they have received for their efforts in environmental stewardship is well deserved.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, yesterday, our Nation suffered our first casualties in the war of Yugoslavia. An Apache helicopter crashed in the Albanian mountains on what has been called a ``routine training mission.'' 
   Two brave American soldiers--Chief Warrant Officer Kevin L. Reichert and Chief Warrant Officer David A. Gibbs--lost their lives for our Nation. They are heroes. 
   Kevin Reichert, 28 years old, was born in Chippewa Falls, WI, and David Gibbs hailed from Massillon, OH, which is west of Canton and about an hour or so south of Cleveland. He was 38 years old, married and had three children. 
   David joined the Marine Corps right out of Washington High School back in 1980. After 4 years of service, he left the Marines, only to enlist in the Army 18 months later. 
   His mother, Dorothy Gibbs, said he enlisted in the Army so he could fly helicopters. She said it was ``his dream'' and ``he was so happy when he flew.'' She also said he hoped to retire in 2 years to pursue a career in airport management. 
   From all accounts, David had accepted the dangers of flying military aircraft. He knew there was a chance there could be a problem. 
   David told his mother that he was so concerned about his mission in Kosovo, and she is quoted as saying:  
   He didn't feel prepared enough because he didn't know enough about the terrain.  
   She also said:  
   He hadn't gotten the terrain map and he was concerned about that.  
   A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Senator WARNER, and I expressed my concern to him about the number of Ohioans who have been killed in helicopter accidents. 
   To illustrate, since 1991, 32 men and women from Ohio have died serving their Nation, not counting the Persian Gulf war. Of this number, 11 died in helicopter crashes. That is 34 percent of them. Why so many deaths from helicopters? All these deaths, but for one, were in noncombat situations. 
   Our military operates sophisticated machinery. Our mechanics are the best trained in the world. Our pilots are trained to meet and respond to all contingencies. Again, the question is: Why so many deaths due to helicopter accidents? 
   Remember, this is the second such accident in 9 days involving Apache helicopters in Albania. Are we giving our pilots specific and correct intelligence so they can avoid accidents or, worse, possible enemy fire? 
   Mr. President, I will not go into what is right or wrong about being in Yugoslavia, but we are at war and we have to ensure that our men and women have all the necessary tools to do their job and that the equipment they use is the best and we have the finest maintenance. 
   In the investigation that will follow the accident, I think it is imperative--in fact it is essential--that we find out whether there was a problem with the equipment in the helicopter or, in the alternative, whether it had proper maintenance. 
   War is serious business. People's lives are on the line, and there can be no room for error. If faulty equipment, lack of equipment, lack of communications, or improper information led to the death of these two men, it is critical that our military take necessary steps to correct such errors. 
   I am heartened in the knowledge that a peaceful settlement of this war appears to be in the works. However, I am saddened that it could not have come sooner to prevent the deaths of these two brave men and the destruction of Yugoslavia. 
   The United States owes David and Kevin a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to repay for they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. As John says in chapter 15:13, ``Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' 
   Our thoughts and our prayers go out to David's family and especially to his wife Jean and three children, Allison, Megan, and David, and also his mother Dorothy, who lost David's father just this past Christmas. 
   As one who has lost a child, I know the days and months ahead will be difficult as the family deals with their grief and the absence of the physical presence of their father. I pray that the words of Matthew 5:4, ``Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,'' apply to their family. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, on Friday, the official recognition of the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, will begin. 
   And even as the participants acknowledge 50 years of NATO achievements, a cloud of war hangs over the proceedings. 
   No doubt NATO's involvement today in Yugoslavia will be the most talked about topic among the attendees. 
   And as I have stated on this floor, I oppose the introduction of ground troops. I reiterate that opposition today. 
   As the members gather, it is my fervent hope that they will give their full devotion to those actions that can be done to prevent further bloodshed. I believe there is no greater challenge facing the United States, NATO, and the United Nations than finding a peaceful solution to this current crisis. 
   NATO must also look to the future to determine what its role will be in the world and what will be the responsibility of its respective members.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Today we have three new members in NATO--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
   I have long been an ardent supporter of what we use to call ``the Captive Nations.'' There are many events that I remember as mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio where we celebrated the resolve of these people to one day taste the freedoms that we have here in America. 
   In those days, I often wondered if I would ever witness a free Poland or a free Hungary or other nations hat used to be dominated by the then-Soviet Union. This morning I attended a reception sponsored by the Polish American Congress where Prime Minister Buzek shared with me that the wondered if it would happen in his lifetime that the would see a free and independent Poland--going from the iron curtain to solidarity to NATO. 
   And let me say--it's just wonderful that these nations now have self-determination and they are making great progress politically and economically from where they were 20 or even 10 years ago. 
   I am very proud that I was one of those who encouraged the inclusion of these three nations into the NATO alliance. 
   And as NATO opened its arms to these three nations, I hope NATO will open its arms to take-in the Republic of Slovenia as a member. This would be an additional of particular importance considering the events happening in Kosovo today. 
   SLOVENIA
   I strongly support the NATO membership of the Republic of Slovenia. 
   As many of my colleagues know, a large number of the countries of central and eastern Europe who formerly were considered ``Warsaw Pact'' nations have struggled economically and politically in the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
   The former Yugoslavia, with whom we are now at war with, has been one of our greatest foreign policy challenges in recent years. 
   However, despite facing many of the same challenges that have hampered other states, Slovenia has emerged as the one state in the Balkans that has established itself as the model of our democratic ideals. Slovenia possesses a stable political system, has committed to free market principles and has modernized their armed forces. It is clearly a beacon in the region. 
   I believe that Slovenia's involvement in NATO would powerfully underscore to the other nations of the region that reforms bring rewards, and that full acceptance by the international community is a real and attainable goal. 
   Further, and I think this is important, I believe that the Alliance would be strengthened by Slovenia's participation. 
   And let me just add that I know that my colleague, Senator ROTH has been a champion for the inclusion of Slovenia in NATO and I would be remiss if I did not mention his efforts in that respect.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today, my dear friend, and one of Ohio's and America's most successful businessmen, Carl Lindner, is celebrating his 80th birthday. I extend to him my sincere best wishes. 
   Carl got his business start in 1940, founding United Dairy Farmers along with his father and his brothers, Bob and Dick and his sister Dorothy. 
   From that first beginning, Carl Lindner fine-tuned his business acumen and has never looked back. As he says, ``only in America.'' Today, he is chairman of the board and chief executive officer and founder of American Financial Group, one of our Nation's largest insurance firms. 
   He is also chairman of the board and CEO of Chiquita Brands International as well as the Great American Group of Insurance Companies. 
   He is active in a number of organizations and institutions in the Cincinnati area and in Washington. 
   He is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades--and there are a number of them--including the Golden Plate Award by the American Academy of Achievement in 1978. He is also a 33rd degree Mason and is the recipient of the Van Rensselaer Medal--one of only 14 people worldwide to receive such a distinction. 
   In 1998, he was awarded the Gourgas Medal, which is the most distinguished honor given by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite ``in recognition of notably distinguished service in the cause of Freemasonry, country or humanity.'' 
   A religious man, Carl Lindner has given of himself to those of faiths other than his own. In 1989, the Hebrew Union College awarded Carl the Jewish Institute of Religion Interfaith Award. In 1995 he received the Jewish National Fund's International Peace Award--the highest international honor and award given by the Jewish National Fund. 
   Carl's civic and business accomplishments run the gamut, from the Friars Club's Centennial Award in 1985 to the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America's ``Silver Beaver'' award in 1995 to the Distinguished Service Citation by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. 
   He has also been inducted into the Greater Cincinnati Business Hall of Fame and the Junior Achievement National Business Hall of Fame. Further, in 1997, he received the Heritage Award from the Cincinnati Urban League. 
   Carl Lindner is also a great believer in quality education, and has devoted his time, energy and resources to encourage students and provide them with institutions in which to learn. His service and generosity have earned him three honorary doctorates from Judson College in 1983, the University of Cincinnati in 1985 and Xavier University in 1991. He was also presented with the Lincoln Award from Northern Kentucky University in 1993. 
   In addition, the College of Business Administration at the University of Cincinnati is housed in Carl Lindner Hall and the school has established the Carl Lindner Annual Medal for Outstanding Business Achievement and a new honors program--the Carl Lindner Honors-Plus program. Xavier University has dedicated the Carl Lindner Family Physics Building. Carl and his  wife Edyth are also major benefactors of Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, a school founded by their son, Carl Lindner III. 
   The generosity of Carl and Edyth Lindner has been felt by the Cincinnati Zoo with its Lindner Family Center for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife, the Museum Center with its Lindner Ice Age Exhibit, the Health Alliance of Cincinnati with its Lindner Center for Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, and the Scottish Rite with its Lindner Learning Center. 
   Carl Lindner's success in business is only surpassed by his outstanding service to his fellow man. He is not a man to point to his achievements; people only know a fraction of what he has contributed to the community. He has given to scores of charities that no one knows about, and he gives because he has a tremendous heart. In fact, he goes out of his way to avoid publicity. 
   I will never forget that when in 1996 the gambling interests in the country were trying to bring casino gambling into Ohio. As the Governor, I didn't think it was in the best interest of the State to have casino gambling, that the liabilities far outweighed the benefits. Those in favor of gambling were spending money like water on advertising. I wanted to oppose it, but I didn't have the money to match even a fraction of what they were spending. I called upon Carl Lindner. 
   I explained to him the other side of the story on gambling and why we needed to keep it out of Ohio. Fortunately, I didn't have to convince him. He, too, agreed that gambling was not the way for Ohio and he offered whatever assistance we needed to ensure that gambling did not come to our state. The proponents of gambling fought hard, but we fought back thanks to Carl. And we won--two-thirds of the voters rejected casino gambling in Ohio. I will say today on the Senate floor, without Carl Lindner's help we would not have won that battle. 
   It is because of his selflessness and humility that I felt it important to rise on the Senate floor today to pay tribute to this great American. There are few people in this nation who have the kind of strength of their beliefs that Carl Lindner has, and usually they end at people's wallets, but Carl backs up his beliefs with his support both in time and money. We need more people in this country like Carl Lindner. 
   And one more thing that impresses me about Carl is his relationship with his wonderful family. Carl rejoices in his marvelous family, his children and particularly his wife, Edyth. Edyth has been a wonderful partner of his over the years, and they have a great marriage. And I know Carl is especially proud of his sons. As a father, I understand that so often the successes of our children surpasses anything we do in our own right. 
   Mr. President, there are few Americans I know who have done as much and have given as much to their nation as Carl Lindner. I have been truly blessed with his friendship and I am inspired by his warmth and humility, and Mr. President, if you look up humility in the dictionary, there should be a picture of Carl Lindner. May Carl and his beloved family celebrate many more birthdays together. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along with my colleague, Senator BAYH, that will allow states to finally obtain relief from the seemingly endless stream of solid waste that is flowing into states like Ohio and Indiana and many others. 
   Our bill, ``the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and Local Authority Act,'' gives state and local governments the tools they need to limit garbage imports from other states and manage their own waste within their own states. 
   Ohio receives about 1.4 million tons of municipal solid waste annually from other states. While I am pleased that these shipments have been reduced since our record high of 3.7 million tons in 1989, I believe it is still entirely too high. 
   Because it is cheap and because it is expedient, other states have simply put their garbage on trains or on trucks and shipped it to states like Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. This is wrong and it has to stop. 
   Many state and local governments have worked hard to develop strategies to reduce waste and plan for future disposal needs. As Governor of Ohio, I worked aggressively to limit shipments of out-of-state waste into Ohio through voluntary cooperation of Ohio landfill operators and agreements with other states. We saw limited relief. But honestly Mr. President, Ohio has no assurance that our out-of-state waste numbers won't rise significantly with the upcoming closure of the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island in 2001. 
   However, the federal courts have prevented states from enacting laws to protect our natural resources. What has emerged is an unnatural pattern where Ohio and other states--both importing and exporting--have tried to take reasonable steps to encourage conservation and local disposal, only to be undermined by a barrage of court decisions at every turn. 
   Quite frankly, state and local governments' hands are tied. Lacking a specific delegation of authority from Congress, states that have acted responsibly to implement environmentally sound waste disposal plans and recycling programs are still being subjected to a flood of out-of-state waste. In Ohio, this has undermined our recycling efforts because Ohioans continue to ask why they should recycle to conserve landfill space when it is being used for other states' trash. Our citizens already have to live with the consequences of large amounts of out-of-  state waste--increased noise, traffic, wear and tear on our roads and litter that is blown onto private homes, schools and businesses. 
   Ohio and many other states have taken comprehensive steps to protect our resources and address a significant environmental threat. However, excessive, uncontrolled waste disposal in other states has limited the ability of Ohioans to protect their environment, health and safety. I do not believe the commerce clause requires us to service other states at the expense of our own citizens' efforts. 
   A national solution is long overdue. When I became Governor of Ohio in 1991, I joined a coalition with other Midwest Governors--Governor BAYH (now Senator BAYH), Governor Engler and Governor Casey, and later Governors Ridge and O'Bannon--to try to pass effective interstate waste and flow control legislation. 
   In 1996, Midwest Governors were asked to reach an agreement with Governors Whitman and Pataki on interstate waste provisions. Our states quickly came to an agreement with New Jersey--the second largest exporting state--on interstate waste provisions. We began discussions with New York, but these were put on hold indefinitely in the wake of their May, 1996 announcement to close the Fresh Kills landfill. 
   The bill that Senator BAYH and I are introducing today reflects the agreement that our two states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, reached with Governor Whitman. 
   For Ohio, the most important aspect of this bill is the ability for states to limit future waste flows. For instance, they would have the option to set a ``permit cap,'' which would allow a state to impose a percentage limit on the amount of out-of-state waste that a new facility or expansion of an existing facility could receive annually. Or, a state could choose a provision giving them the authority to deny a permit for a new facility if it is determined that there is not a local or in-state regional need for that facility. 
   These provisions provide assurances to Ohio and other states that new facilities will not be built primarily for the purpose of receiving out-of-state waste. For instance, Ohio EPA had to issue a permit for a landfill that was bidding to take 5,000 tons of garbage a day--approximately 1.5 million tons a year--from Canada alone, which would have doubled the amount of out-of-state waste entering Ohio. Thankfully this landfill lost the Canadian bid. Ironically though, the waste company put their plans on hold to build the facility because there is not enough need for the facility in the state and they need to ensure a steady out-of-state waste flow to make the plan feasible. 
   With the announcement to close the Fresh Kills landfill, it is even more critical to Ohio that states should receive the authority to place limits on new facilities and expansions of existing facilities. The Congressional Research Service estimates that when Fresh Kills closes, there will be an additional 13,200 tons of garbage each day diverted to other 
   facilities. However, CRS also points out that there is only about 1,200 tons per day of capacity available in the entire state of New York. Even if New York handles some of that 13,200 tons a day in-state, it is estimated that about 4 million tons per year will still need to be managed outside the state from that landfill alone. 
   In addition, this bill would ensure that landfills and incinerators could not receive trash from other states until local governments approve its receipt. States also could freeze their out-of-state waste at 1993 levels, while some states would be able to reduce these levels to 65 percent by the year 2006. This bill also allows states to reduce the amount of construction and demolition debris they receive by 50 percent in 2007 at the earliest. 
   States also could impose up to a $3-per-ton cost recovery surcharge on out-of-state waste. This fee would help provide states with the funding necessary to implement solid waste management programs. 
   And finally, the bill grants limited flow control authority in order for municipalities to pay off existing bonds and guarantee a dedicated waste stream for landfills or incinerators. 
   Flow control is important to states like New Jersey, which has taken aggressive steps to try to manage all of its trash within its borders by the year 2000. New Jersey communities have acted responsibly to build disposal facilities to help meet that goal. However, if Congress fails to protect existing flow control authorities, repayment of the outstanding $1.9 billion investment in New Jersey alone will be jeopardized. 
   I am deeply concerned that responsible decisions made by Ohio, New Jersey and other states have been undermined and have put potentially large financial burdens on communities and have encouraged exporting states to pass their trash problems onto the backs of others. 
   Twenty-four Governors, including Governor Whitman, and the Western Governors' Association have sent letters to Congress strongly supporting the provisions that are in our bill. 
   Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable restrictions on out-of-state waste shipments have been perceived by some as an attempt to ban all out-of-state trash. On the contrary, Senator BAYH and I are not asking for outright authority for states to prohibit all out-of-state waste, nor are we seeking to prohibit waste from any one state. 
   We are asking for reasonable tools that will enable state and local governments to act responsibly to manage their own waste and limit unreasonable waste imports from other states. Such measures would give substantial authority to limit imports and plan facilities around our own states' needs. 
   I believe the time is right to move an effective interstate waste bill. The bill we are introducing today is a consensus of importing and exporting states--states that have willingly come forward to offer a reasonable solution. 
   Congress must act this year to give citizens in Ohio and other affected states the relief they need from the truckloads of waste passing through their communities. We have waited too long for a solution. Congress must act now to prevent this problem from spreading further to our neighbors out West and to help our neighbors in the East better manage the trash they generate.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   I rise to support approval of the conference report on Ed-Flex. However, I would be remiss if I didn't respond to the remarks of Senator SCHUMER and Senator ASHCROFT in terms of the tragedy that took place in Colorado and expressing the sympathy of the people of the State of Ohio to those families who are suffering today as a result of that tragedy. As one who has lost a child from a tragic automobile situation--instant death--I can understand the trauma those families are experiencing right now. 
   I think it is a sad commentary on our society that this happened in Colorado, as well as other States, as mentioned by Senator ASHCROFT and Senator SCHUMER. There is something wrong with our society and I am not sure we can solve it here on the floor of the Senate. I think it has to be solved in the hearts and the minds of the people who reside in our country. I think a lot has to do with turning back to our family and our moral values that are so important and which inculcate in us respect for our fellow man. 
   I grew up in a family where I was taught to respect all individuals. It wasn't a man's color of skin, their religion, or their socioeconomic status that mattered; it was their character. 
   I think there may be lots of responses to this tragedy, but I cannot help but think if they go back to the Boy Scout motto, the Girl Scout motto, and some of the basic fundamental organizations that build character, that this country will be far better off. 
   In spite of everything we do, in my State I was ridiculed because we made a major capital improvement to put metal detector devices into our high schools. Many people said we shouldn't have to do that in our high schools, and that money went that quick. We wanted to guarantee that at least when kids were in school, they knew their classmates didn't have some kind of weapon. I am sure that perhaps in that school district, nobody even gave any thought that that kind of a situation could occur. 
   The other area I think we need to recognize is that, unfortunately, youngsters today aren't getting the kind of moral and family and religious training at home and the responsibilities are falling more on our schools. In Ohio, we aggressively pursued a mediation and dispute resolution program in kindergarten and first grade to try to teach children that when they have differences of opinion with other individuals, they sit down and talk them out; they don't use physical force to resolve their problems. We have recognized in our State that social service agencies have to be connected. We are locating them now in our schools. If we identify a youngster with a problem, that student can get the help they need. More important than that, most of the time the family gets the help they need so that they don't participate in antisocial behavior. 
   There are a number of things that need to be done. I hope we don't, as a response to this, think there is just one approach that will make a difference. It will require a multifaceted approach, and again, looking into our own heart and soul. 
   Ed-Flex, which I have worked on as well as the Presiding Officer, Senator FRIST, might also help because it will give school districts around this country the opportunity to take money which is available to them through the Federal Government, and if they feel there is a better way that money can be spent to make a difference in the lives of children, they are going to be able to do that. 
   Many children who don't do well early on in school become frustrated; as a result of that frustration, they turn to antisocial behavior. One of the things that stands in the way is that they are unable to read. 
   Because of Ed-Flex, school districts that are title I schools, school districts that can take advantage of the Eisenhower Professional Grant Program, are going to have the opportunity to change the use of those dollars and put them into reading. We found that in the State of Ohio, when we have taken the Eisenhower professional grant money that says you have to use it for science and math and it has allowed us to take that money and use it for reading. We did that because in the early grades, if a kid cannot read, he cannot do math, he cannot do science. If I had my way, every title I school, every Eisenhower grant in the primary and secondary grades that are eligible for those programs would take advantage of Ed-Flex, would come back to their State school organizations and say, we could use this money better so we can make a difference in the lives of these kids. 
   Just think what a difference that will make in America today. We have in Ohio now what we have called a fourth grade guarantee. No child will go to the fifth grade unless they are able to read at that fourth grade level. That in itself, I think, would help a great deal with some of the problems we have in our schools today. 
   I would like to finish my remarks by giving some people some credit for this work on Ed-Flex: The majority leader who helped make this a priority for this Senate; you, Senator FRIST, for the terrific work that you have done; Senator JEFFORDS, Senator WYDEN, and everyone who has come together; the National Governors' Association, on a  bipartisan basis, that supported this legislation. 
   I just want it known, I do not know what is going to happen with elementary and secondary education. I do not know whether our Republican block grant is going to work or Senator KENNEDY's various education programs are going to work. But one thing I do know is going to work: Ed-Flex is going to work. I think if we let it work for the next couple of years we will prove, just like we have with our welfare reform system, if you give people on the local level the flexibility to use the dollars and to use the brains that God has given them, they can really make a difference in the lives of people. That is the thing about which we really should feel very, very good. I am glad I had a little part of it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Lott-Domenici Social Security lockbox amendment. This is the first real step in the effort to save Social Security. I thank the Senator from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator ABRAHAM for their hard work in drafting this legislation and ensuring it comes to this Senate floor. 
   During my campaign last year for the Senate, I visited almost every region of the State of Ohio. During those visits, I asked the question of those in attendance, How many in this room pay a payroll tax? Every hand went up. Then I asked, How many of you expect to receive Social Security? Only those close to retirement raised their hands. 
   It was perplexing to me because it verified something my son George said to me--George, the summa cum laude graduate, undergraduate law school, CFE of a corporation--``Dad, I'm not going to see a dime of Social Security.'' 
   What a terrible thing, in a country like ours, where about two-thirds of the people who pay more into the Social Security funds than they do in taxes don't believe when the time comes for them to retire there is going to be anything there for them. I said during those visits that I was going to do everything I could to put a firewall between the Social Security trust fund and the general fund of the United States of America. 
   I think we all recognize that part of the problem that we have had in this country since the Vietnam war is that after that war we didn't have the money to pay for it, nor did we have the money to pay for the great society. So we took the trust funds and placed them into the general fund, using them to mask a deficit. In other words, we weren't willing to pay for those things that we were spending our money on. 
   Today, we have a chance to pass some legislation which gives honor to the sacred trust between the Federal Government and every American. I believe we need to get away from treating the Social Security trust fund as a part of the budget and wall it off from any temptation to use it for tax cuts or for new spending. We have been playing games with Social Security for too long. It is time to stop. 
   The Senator from Idaho in his remarks today mentioned the fact that the President will be sending up a request for some $6 billion to pay for the war in Kosovo. The American people should know that that money is going to come from Social Security. 
   Because the Social Security surplus is all there is. That is the surplus that we have today. There is not any onbudget surplus. There will not be any onbudget surplus until the year 2001, if we are lucky. 
   So it seems to me that one way we can guarantee to my son and to all those other people I visited during that campaign, and to the American people, that one way we can at least begin to guarantee there will be something there when they retire is to put that money away so it cannot be touched. 
   I wish there was a way you could put it into Fort Knox, so it could not be touched. But the fact of the matter is, the way this Government works today is that money in the Social Security trust fund is used to buy Treasury bills that are then used to pay for a lot of things that we do not have money to pay for. The thing about this lockbox proposal is that it takes all the Social Security trust fund and uses it to pay down the public debt, which means instead of it being used for spending programs, at least we are going to get the benefit for a period of time of paying down that public debt. 
   I think it is real important that we are candid with the American people and tell them this is not the end of the solution, we have to tackle reform of Social Security. But one step, one gigantic step is for the first time saying we are no longer going to use it to pay for spending programs. 
   In all due respect to the President of the United States, when this debate started several months ago, he said: I want to protect Social Security and I am going to use 62 percent of the unified budget, as Senator HOLLINGS just said here this afternoon, to protect Social Security. The fact of the matter is the only surplus we have is Social Security, so he is going to take 62 percent of the Social Security surplus to protect it and use the other 38 percent of it for spending programs or whatever. On my side of the aisle, they talked about using the 38 percent to reduce taxes. On the other side of the aisle, we are going to use it for a little tax reduction, we are going to use it for spending programs, protect this and protect that. But it was a fraud. The only surplus we have is Social Security. 
   So I am really quite concerned that today we hear the President saying: I am going to veto this legislation. Either you are for taking the first step to protect Social Security or you are not. You also ought to be in favor of putting all of this in the lockbox because you know what it is going to do? It is going to force us, if we want to keep the budget agreement, or if we want to maintain the budget caps, to find some other money; either reprioritize the dollars that are being spent on other programs or perhaps raise the dollars, raise more money to pay for these programs on which people want to spend money. 
   I repeat, all of this started back after the Vietnam war. We will have a big decision here one of these days to decide whether or not we are going to get involved in an all-out war with Serbia. That is going to cost a whole lot of money and the American people ought to know that one of the considerations is how are we going to pay for it? Are  we going to pay for it with the Social Security surplus? Are we going to borrow the money? Think about it. 
   I have a great deal of respect for Senator HOLLINGS. I think he and I are the only ones who had amendments to use the onbudget surplus to reduce the debt. I concur in that. I think that is what we ought to do. 
   I just had my second grandchild and my grandchildren's gift from the Federal Government was a bill for $187,000 to pay interest on a debt they had nothing to do with. I think it is horrible that this debt keeps going up. Senator HOLLINGS is right; the debt is going to continue to go up.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. It is my understanding what we would do with this lockbox money is to use it to pay down the public debt, which would lower the interest costs to our Federal budget every year. But at the same time it would mean that money ultimately would have to be paid back to the Social Security trust fund.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. I say to the Senator, in all due respect, that is a whole lot better than doing nothing at this time, when he knows and I know if it is there to be taken--let's just take what the President did. The President said, ``I want to protect Social Security,'' and said, ``but I want to use 38 percent of it for other spending programs.'' This would eliminate this money being used for those other spending programs. This would allow the money to be used to pay down the debt and give us a little time in the meantime to come up with a real reform of that Social Security program. We know that is something this Congress is going to have to do if we really want to guarantee to the next generation that there will be something there for them.

Based on all of the information that I have, the best thing that we could do at this stage of the game, if we really want to block it off, is this legislation. It may not be perfect, but the fact of the matter is that it is much better than the current situation which allows the Social Security surplus to be used for spending programs.

If the Senator will yield, the problem that we have is that currently under the law, my understanding is that you need to buy the special Social Security Treasury bills with this money, and when you do that, the Federal Government has those dollars. What they have been doing with those dollars is paying for programs that they would not be able to pay for if they had not been using those special bills. 
   This legislation at least stops that from occurring.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. The Senator yields back his time. Thank you. 
   I have enjoyed the discussion we have had. Obviously, there is a difference of opinion between the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Ohio. 
   Based on all of the research work that I have done, and the options that are available to us, to me this is the most practical way, Mr. President, to deal with the problem that we have had for too long in this country. I believe that with the passage of this lockbox legislation, we are going to go a long way in making sure that this money is not being used for spending programs that we are unwilling to pay for and have not been willing to pay for in the past. The real beginning of the deficits that we have had began when we merged the Social Security surplus in with the unified budget and started to spend it. 
   In fact, in 1979 the national debt was something like $860 billion. Today it is $5.7 trillion. I believe that this is the first step that we need to take to restore trust in those people in this country who are worried about Social Security, understanding that it is not perfect--understanding that it is not perfect--and understanding that this Congress needs to come together, on a bipartisan basis, hopefully with the leadership of the President, and tackle the problems that we have with the Social Security system in terms of guaranteeing its viability for the future. And that is something that hopefully we will get to this year; and if not then, hopefully next year; and if we do not then, when we elect a new President. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to vehemently oppose sending American ground forces into Kosovo and to demand that if the President contemplates sending in ground troops, that decision be deliberated and authorized by the Congress of the United States. 
   I am an American of Serbian-Slovenian ancestry. My father's family is from southern Croatia, which is known as Krijna, and my mother's family is from Ljubljana and Stranje in Slovenia. 
   I want to make it clear--I don't oppose sending ground troops into Kosovo because I am Serbian. I oppose it because it is bad policy. However, my ethnic heritage does give me a special insight into the situation that someone else might not have. 
   I have always opposed the leadership of Slobodan Milosevic. Like most Americans, I consider him to be a war criminal. 
   However, Mr. President, I was 1 of 41 Senators who voted against the bombing because I was concerned that this bombing would not achieve our end of bringing Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table as contemplated by the Clinton Administration and NATO. 
   These negotiations were designed to get Milosevic to sign the Rambouillet agreement or something very similar, thereby guaranteeing the basic human  rights of the Albanian Kosovars and avoiding ethnic cleansing. 
   I also feared the bombing would only solidify Milosevic's leadership with the Serbian people and ruin any chance of cultivating alternative leadership within Serbia. 
   I have to say that our problem has not been with the Serbian people, but with their ruthless leader. 
   The main thing this bombing campaign has managed to do is fan the flames of centuries-old Serbian nationalism. Individuals who until the bombing campaign had little support for Milosevic and his activities in Kosovo, now firmly believe their national pride is at stake. They have thrown their support behind Milosevic and have expressed a willingness to follow his leadership and fight for their country. 
   It is extremely important to remember--this is very important--Kosovo is to the Serbian people what Jerusalem is to Jews, Christians and Muslims. To the Serbians, it is a holy place. It is the scene of the most important event in Serbian history--the battle of Kosovo in 1389 between the Turks and the Serbs, led by Tsar Lazar. 
   The battle of Kosovo has lived for centuries in Serbian literature. To this day, Serbian children sing songs and read epic poems celebrating this event. 
   The interesting thing about the battle of Kosovo is how outnumbered the Serbian people were--and they knew it. And even though they lost, it is considered a glorious defeat because they fought valiantly against overwhelming odds. To quote from the epic poem ``The Battle of Kosovo'':  
   Then the Turks overwhelmed Lazar, And the Tsar, Lazar, was destroyed, With him was destroyed his army of seven and seventy thousand soldiers. All was holy, all was honorable and the goodness of God was fulfilled.  
   History, pride and heritage are deeply-seeded in Serb culture. That's why it is significant that Milosevic started his rise to political power in Kosovo and probably the most important event in his political career was when he spoke to 1 million citizens on the 600th Anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo--at the very site of the battle! I want you to also know, Mr. President, the most sacred Serbian Orthodox monasteries are located in Kosovo. 
   Considering Serbian history, and where Milosevic started his career, American and NATO leaders should have known that Milosevic couldn't give in without losing face. Especially when he was told ``either sign this or we'll bomb you''. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration presented Milosevic with an ultimatum which foreclosed all other options that could have led to a negotiated settlement. 
   Our bombing campaign has given Milosevic cover to move forward expeditiously with his policy of ethnic cleansing--precisely what we were trying to avoid in the first place. Now, because he and his forces are not being tightly monitored--and that's because all the observers were kicked out as soon as the bombing started--they can do as they wish. Therefore, we hear evidence of massacres and rape, and we have witnessed the forced relocation of hundreds of thousands of people and the total devastation of Kosovo. 
   To me there is no question that the decision to bomb Kosovo and Serbia was a terrible mistake in the first place, but now we face three bad choices--stop the bombing, continue the bombing, or go in with bombing and ground troops. 
   Although I disagreed with bombing in the first place, of the three, I believe the least objectionable is to continue the bombing campaign in hopes of securing the very negotiated settlement that has eluded us so far. 
   Many public officials and foreign policy experts are loudly advocating the introduction of ground troops to Kosovo in an effort to force Milosevic to yield his grip on the Kosovar Albanians and to ultimately ``win the war''. They claim it's the only way. 
   Let me say that I support the goal of restoring peace and stability to the region, returning to Kosovo those refugees that want to go back, negotiating a new agreement that will guarantee their safety and self-determination and establishing a multinational force to monitor the negotiated settlement. I support all this--but I absolutely oppose the use of American ground troops to implement this goal. 
   I oppose using American troops in this manner not because I don't think they can get the job done. Far from it. I believe our armed forces have performed magnificently, and I wholeheartedly admire the effort that each of them has been giving during the campaign in Kosovo. They are doing the job we have asked them to do. 
   However, I see a situation developing in the Balkans that could be just as brutal as that which developed in Vietnam. As opposed to the flat deserts of the Persian Gulf area, the Balkans are a very mountainous region that is ideal for a sustained campaign of guerrilla warfare. 
   A smaller, and less well-armed force could have the ability to use this natural terrain to impede the progress and mobility of a NATO invasion force for an extended period of time while racking up vast numbers of casualties. 
   Remember that in World War II, more than 500,000 Nazi soldiers thought that they could just roll through Yugoslavia. They did not, due in large part, to the determination of the Serbian people. 
   It has been reported that it will take 6 to 8 weeks to even prepare for a ground invasion. And I believe it will probably take even more than that because we don't even have the troops in the region, we haven't even mobilized and we haven't established a staging area. 
   This will give the Serbs ample time to disperse, fortify defensive works, stockpile their arms, and so on. The steps the Serbs take now will allow them to later harass the invasion force at every conceivable opportunity. It will make it that much more difficult for NATO to secure a victory without incurring heavy losses. 
   The most important thing I think the American people should know--if we put ground forces in Kosovo, we will go to war with Serbia. Period. 
   We will have to accept the fact that we will be at war, and that we will have to take out Milosevic. And that means a long, extended war with loss of life and a total destruction of the infrastructure in Serbia, in Kosovo, and what about Montenegro? 
   And another thing--we have to be seriously concerned about igniting the entire southeast Europe region with our actions. What will the neighboring nations do? What will Russia do? Will NATO's action perhaps cause the radical elements in Russia to come into power? 
   These are serious questions that may not be of concern now, but the consequences of our actions today may come back to haunt us tomorrow. 
   We must remember--our goal is to bring peace and stability to this region. I am concerned that the introduction of ground troops may have just the opposite effect and destabilize the region over the long term. 
   And what happens after we win that war? And it will be won, although at a high cost in terms of lives and infrastructure. What will happen? What will be the disposition of the Kosovar Albanians, hundreds of thousands of whom are now refugees? Are we going to have a greater Albania? 
   Who will monitor the ``peace'' and who will pay for the rebuilding of the infrastructure in Serbia and Kosovo? What kind of commitment will NATO have to ``Pick up the pieces'' and rebuild Serbia? Will it fall on the United States? 
   Make no mistake: the introduction of ground troops guarantees that we as a nation are committing to be involved for an extended period of time and the expenditure of many billions of dollars. In order to compare, my colleagues should remember that we have already spent--we have already spent--over $12 billion in Bosnia. 
   I can't help but feel touched at times like these, in the face of situations of national importance, to contemplate the times that I have visited the Vietnam Memorial. All of us who have done that cannot help but be moved. And I know on my part, tears always well up in my eyes. 
   Seeing the names carved on that wall, knowing that each name represents an individual who had loved ones and friends and had hopes, dreams and aspirations, is a poignant reminder of what it means to send young men and women into harm's way. 
   But let me just say that while I disagreed with the policy pursued to stop the humanitarian abuses in Kosovo, those abuses cannot be overlooked by the international community. You just  can't turn your head and forget about it. This morning, I participated in a commemoration of the Holocaust here in our Nation's Capitol. Let us remember so that we never forget. 
   I believe that in addition to pursuing our strategic interests and our trade interests, we must not forget that our status as a world power gives us a moral responsibility to defend human rights. I call upon my colleagues and all Americans to work toward a consensus on how we as a nation respond to acts of genocide internationally. 
   Looking away in Croatia was a failure when 250,000 Serbs were driven out. As President Clinton acknowledged, looking away in Rwanda was a mistake where almost a million people were killed between the Tutsi's and the Hutu's. And what about the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey, and all the other areas of the world where such troubles exist? We have it in many, many places in the world. 
   Thus far, full engagement through bombing has been a failure in Kosovo. Our moral responsibility is to identify the means and the goals available to us to deal with such incidents before they escalate beyond peaceful resolution. We would be well-served--we would be well-served--to have a coherent policy to guide us in the future as to when we go in and when we do not go in. 
   Mr. President, what this country does in the name of NATO over the next several weeks in regard to Serbia and Kosovo will have a dramatic impact on this country's future. It is our obligation to the American people to exercise our due diligence before we commit to a course of action from which we cannot extricate ourselves. This is very, very serious business that we are now considering. 
   We should pray to the Holy Spirit for the enlightenment to make the right decision for our country, for southeast Europe, and for the world. Let us be constantly reminded of Jesus's exhortation on the Sermon on the Mount that ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.'' 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, first, I want to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee for offering a budget resolution that stays within the spending caps and--for the first time--protects Social Security surpluses. 
   I also want to thank him for setting aside $131 billion in what I like to call a ``rainy day fund.'' This money can be used for possible contingencies in Medicare or agriculture, emergency spending, or debt reduction. 
   I respect the view of my colleagues who want to use on-budget surpluses to give the American people a tax cut. But before we give a tax cut, I believe we should pay down our massive national debt first. 
   My amendment would take out the tax cuts in the budget resolution and use that money to pay down the debt. 
   If my amendment is adopted, and if the projected surpluses materialize, then we will slash the publicly-held debt from $3.6 trillion today to $960 billion in 2009. 
   Paying down the debt is the right thing to do--it will reduce our net interest payments, expand the economy, lower interest rates for families, and reduce the need for future tax increases. 
   Has there been a request for the yeas and nays on this?

    Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues as an original co-sponsor of the Regulatory Improvement Act. I commend Senators THOMPSON and LEVIN for their bipartisan work to pass legislation to enable federal regulators to do a better job of protecting public health, safety and the environment. This is the same bill that the Administration, state and local governments and the business community supported last year. 
   I am a public servant who cares deeply about the needs of our environment and the health and well-being of our citizens. I sponsored legislation to create the Ohio Environmental Agency when I served in the state legislature, and I fought to end oil and gas drilling in the Lake Erie Bed. As Governor, I increased funding for environmental protection by over 60 percent. 
   However, over the years, I also have become increasingly concerned about the unnecessary and burdensome costs that are imposed on our citizens and state and local governments through federal laws and regulations. 
   Efforts to address these cost burdens began back in 1994 when I worked with Senators ROTH, GLENN and KEMPTHORNE and the state-local government coalition to draft an unfunded mandates reform bill. We succeeded in passing the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) in the 104th Congress. 
   Following this success, I worked closely with the state-local government coalition on our next priority--passage of effective safe drinking water reforms--which was enacted with broad bipartisan support in 1996. 
   These efforts are notable because they represent common-sense reforms that make government more accountable based on public awareness of risks, costs and benefits. These statutes set key precedents for the reforms that are envisioned in the regulatory Improvement Act. In many respects, this bill builds on these achievements. Senator THOMPSON has said that this bill represents phase 2 of UMRA and I strongly agree. 
   I specifically mention the drinking water program today because of its close similarity to the Regulatory Improvement Act. In both, agencies are required to conduct an analysis of incremental costs and benefits of alternative standards, while providing those agencies with flexibility in making final regulatory decisions. 
   If we agree that these analytical tools are good enough for the water that we drink, they certainly must be good enough for other regulations. 
   However, both UMRA and the drinking water amendments have had limited applications. The Regulatory Improvement Act is needed to provide across-the-board cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment procedures at all federal agencies. This bill will result in greater protection of public health and the environment while alleviating cost burdens on state and local governments and the private sector. 
   GAO reported last year that UMRA has had little effect on the way federal agencies make rulemaking decisions. The report specifically points out that the Regulatory Improvement Act  would improve the quality of regulatory analysis. I think it is time that we make federal agencies--not just Congress--accountable for the decisions they make. 
   While many federal regulations have been well intended, not all have achieved their purpose and many have unnecessarily passed significant burdens onto our citizens and state and local governments. 
   It is crucial that federal, state and local governments work in partnership to determine how we can best allocate resources for protection of health and the environment. As a nation, we spend vast sums on regulations. A report commissioned by the U.S. Small Business Administration estimates that regulations will cost the economy about $709 billion 1999--more than $7,000 for the average American household. 
   Unfortunately, this burden on consumers and American businesses has not always resulted in maximum health or environmental protection. At times, it has diverted scarce resources that could be used for other priorities such as education, crime prevention and more effective protection of health and the environment. 
   The challenge facing public officials today is determining how best to protect the health of our citizens and our environment with limited resources. We need to do a much better job ensuring that regulations' costs bear a reasonable relationship with their benefits, and we need to do a better job of setting priorities and spending our resources wisely. 
   I believe that the Regulatory Improvement Act will help achieve these goals. First, I believe this bill will increase the public's knowledge of how and why agencies make major rules. In essence, this bill asks regulatory agencies to answer several simple, but vital questions: What is the nature of the risk being considered? What are the benefits of the proposed regulation? How much will it cost? And, are there better, less burdensome ways to achieve the same goals? 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill provides opportunities for state and local government officials to consult with agencies as rules are being developed so that regulators are more sensitive to state and local needs and the burden of unfunded mandates. This only makes sense since states and local governments often have the responsibility of implementing and enforcing these regulations. 
   Second, requiring federal agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses, publish those results, disclose any estimates of risks and explain whether any of these factors were considered in finalizing rules will increase government accountability to the people it serves. 
   And finally, this bill will improve the quality of government decision-making by allowing the government to set priorities and focus on the worst risks first. Careful thought, reasonable assumptions, peer review and sound science will help target problems and find better solutions. 
   This bill does not mandate outcomes, but it does impose common-sense discipline and accountability in the rulemaking process. I think it is time to move forward with this bipartisan measure.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we are debating a budget resolution in the Senate that will provide an outline for our Nation's spending for the next fiscal year. With the assurances of the Republican leadership, we will be sticking to our guns on the spending caps that we agreed to in the 1997 balanced budget agreement. And we will lock away the Social Security trust funds in a lockbox. 
   Earlier today, the Senate reaffirmed its commitment to Social Security, voting unanimously 99 to 0 that current and future Social Security trust funds should remain only for Social Security. It was the right thing to do. But incredibly, President Clinton has threatened to veto a similar measure, the Abraham-Domenici Social Security lockbox bill. It is unconscionable for the President to undermine the efforts of Congress to save Social Security just so he can use the Social Security surplus to pay for his pet projects. 
   As cosponsor of the lockbox legislation, I believe it represents a golden opportunity to show that Washington is serious about keeping its word to our seniors and future retirees. Since the Senate voted 99 to 0 this afternoon, I expect that all of my Democratic colleagues will vote for the Social Security lockbox bill when it comes to the floor and urge the President not to veto this legislation. 
   The Senate meanwhile will have to make some tough budget choices in fiscal year 2000, and we will have to do more with less. It is not going to be easy, because we have so many competing demands chasing so few dollars--demands such as military pay and readiness, education, and perhaps Medicare. And, yes; now that the President has started to bomb Kosovo we may need a lot more money to pay for a brand new war. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues this evening that the cost of that war is coming out of the Social Security surplus. The money to pay for that war is being paid for out of the Social Security surplus.  
   I also recognize that we may have to deal with emergencies as they occur. I applaud the chairman of the Budget Committee for drafting a resolution that addresses those needs. Under his leadership, Senator DOMENICI has acknowledged that we must reserve $131 billion, or what I would like to call a rainy day fund, that may only be used--let me stress--may only be used for Medicare, agriculture, Federal emergencies, or debt reduction. 
   While the chairman and I agree on that point, I do respectfully have a difference of opinion on using the onbudget surplus for tax cuts. 
   The amendment that I am offering is a simple one. It takes the tax cuts proposed in the budget resolution and uses the money to pay down the debt. Let me say again, under my amendment, we would take the $778 billion in tax cuts and use the money to pay down the debt. If my amendment is adopted and we use the onbudget surplus for debt reduction, then publicly held debt will drop from $3.68 trillion today to $960 billion by the year 2009. 
   Mr. President, we can't let this opportunity pass by, because if we look at this chart, we can see how vital it is to bring down our debt. This is what our debt was back in 1940. As you will notice, at the end of the Vietnam war, this debt skyrocketed, like Senator Glenn going up in the STS-95. Once we commingled the Social Security surplus with the general funds of this country, we started to use that surplus and borrow money to pay for tax reductions and spending increases. We now have increased that debt. When I was mayor of the city of Cleveland back in 1979, it was $750 billion at that time. It is $5.6 trillion today, almost a 600-percent increase in the national debt. 
   Why should we do this rather than use this money to reduce taxes? 
   First of all, if we pay down the debt, we are going to decrease our massive interest payments on the national debt. 
   No. 2, we will expand the economy. 
   No. 3, we will lower interest rates for families. 
   No. 4, we are going to have less need for future tax hikes. It will decrease the overall interest paid on the debt. 
   Right now, this is hard to believe, but we are spending over $600 million per day--do you hear me--per day, just to service the interest on the national debt. 
   Let's look at what that means. Most of the American people are not aware of what is going on here. Here are the entitlements, 54 percent; net interest, look at this, 14 percent of the money going for net interest; national defense, 15 percent; and nondefense discretionary, 17 percent. 
   Look at what has happened. When Janet, my wife, and I got married back in 1962, we were spending 6 cents per dollar on the interest. Today it is 14 cents. 
   The next chart, let's look at what that interest is doing. The interest on the national debt, as you can see, is a little bit below defense. But look at Medicare. We are spending more money today in the United States of America on the interest on national debt than we are on Medicare. And for education, we are spending five times more money on interest than we are on education. And for medical research, we are spending 15 times more money on interest than on the National Institutes of Health. That is what is going on today. 
   No. 2, it will expand the economy. 
   No. 3, it will lower the interest rate for individual families. 
   As Alan Greenspan attests, a decreasing national debt will bolster a strong economy and allow individual interest rates to fall. 
   Everybody who is an expert--talk to Dan Crippen, of the Congressional Budget Office, or David Walker, who is the new Comptroller General at GAO. Ask them: If you have a surplus, what should you do with it? They will come back and say, ``Reduce the national debt.'' 
   These lower interest rates give middle-class Americans the ability to purchase homes. That is what keeps interest rates down. They are able to refinance mortgages and buy automobiles. The savings gives them some real money to either save, invest, or put it back into the economy. 
   With the low-interest rates that we have enjoyed, over 17 million Americans have refinanced their homes since 1993. Just think of the people that you know who have refinanced their homes because we have kept interest rates down. If we pay off or reduce the national debt, those rates will continue to come down. These homeowners have saved millions of dollars in mortgage payments per year. In fact, one of my staff members refinanced his modest duplex home in 1998. By refinancing, his yearly savings will be $2,160 a year. That is more than $50,000 he is going to save over the 25 years left on his mortgage. 
   If we could lower interest rates by 1 percentage point, an average family buying a home could save over $25,000 on a typical mortgage. Mr. President, that is a win-win for the American people. We will have less debt over our heads, and Americans will have more of their own money in their pockets in order to be able to buy things that they need for their families. 
   Finally, the fourth reason is that if we reduce the national debt, it will lower the amount of taxes necessary to run the Government. As the debt decreases, so does the overall cost of running the Government. This would allow us to maintain the current level of Government services and accommodate an increase in the use of those services by the baby boomers. It would also lessen the demand for future tax hikes that would result in a de facto tax cut for American people. 
   Just think if we could bring the amount of the net interest payments down, that money would be available for other things we need to spend money on. Or, in the alternative, the opportunity to reduce taxes. 
   From a public policy point of view, let's be serious in terms of our debt. You have a 10-year projection on an $800 billion reduction in taxes. We are going to have a tough time balancing the budget this year. We may not have a surplus. Next year we will be lucky to have a surplus. One thing we do know is if we use the money to reduce the debt and we do not spend it on more programs, or we do not use it to reduce taxes, we will not be in the position, if the economy doesn't go the way we expect it to, to have to go back to the American people and say: Folks, we gave you a tax cut, but we are going to have to take it back because our projections were wrong. Folks, we are spending money on programs, and by the way, we are going to have to cut those programs because these 10-year projections we have are not working out. 
   I want to say one thing and I think it is important. Mr. President, 5-year projections may be reasonable; 10-year projections, if you talk to CBO, they would tell you they could swing $300 billion over this period of time. I think what we need to do is understand we have a tough budget situation that, if we lock up Social Security and do not touch it as we have in the past, we are going to have a couple of tough years ahead of us. Rather than projecting out 10 years and talking about what we are going to be doing with the money, I think if we do have that additional money, let's pay down the national debt. 
   The last thing I would like to say is this: I just had a new granddaughter last week, Veronica Kay Voinovich. While I was campaigning in Ohio last year I talked about my first grandchild, Mary Faith. Her gift, when she was born on December 26, 1996, from this Government, was a bill for $187,000, interest on a debt that was racked up before her life, on something that she had nothing to do with. And we are asking her to pay for it. I think it is criminal. I think it is criminal that we have not been willing to pay for the things that we wanted, that we borrowed the money, and we have had an attitude: We have ours, let them worry about theirs. 
   That is not the legacy that was left to me and I do not want that legacy for my granddaughters or for the other grandchildren here in the United States of America. 
   We have a wonderful opportunity. For the first time, we can see the light to really do something that is responsible in dealing with this budget to get ourselves back on track, so going into the next century, the next 10 years are going to be good years for our country.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as a former Governor, I introduced my own tobacco recoupment legislation. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator HUTCHISON's and Senator GRAHAM's bipartisan legislation. 
   Under this settlement, the tobacco companies agreed to pay 46 States, including Ohio, $206 billion over 25 years. Four other States previously won a $40 billion settlement. Ohio was slated to receive $9.8 billion over 25 years, beginning with $400 million in 2000 and 2001. 
   I just want you to know that the Nation's Governors are adamantly opposed to imposing restrictions on State funding. I have distributed a letter from the chairman and vice chairman of the National Governors' Association. It will be on the desk of all of the Senators expressing their adamant opposition to the amendment.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. The proposition is clearly unsupportable, for the following reasons: 
   First of all, States filed complaints that included a variety of claims--consumer protection, racketeering, antitrust, disgorgement of profits and civil penalties for isolations of State laws. 
   Medicaid was just one of the many issues in many cases. Furthermore, State-by-State allotments were determined by the overall health care costs in each State and not based on Medicaid expenditures--not based on Medicaid expenditures. 
   Medicaid was not even mentioned in some cases. As a matter of fact, in Ohio the Medicaid claim was thrown out of court. The Federal Government was invited to participate in the lawsuits, but the Federal Government declined. States bore the risk of initiating the suits and the burden of the unprecedented lawsuits against a well-financed industry. It was not until after the States prevailed that the Federal Government became interested. 
   The tobacco settlement negotiated between attorneys general and the tobacco companies is completely different from the agreement that failed to pass in the 105th Congress. 
   With the failure of that legislation, the States were forced to proceed with their own State-only lawsuit and settlement. 
   States must be given the flexibility to tailor their spending to the unique needs of their citizens. And States will spend their funding on a variety of local needs--health, education, welfare, smoking cessation programs. 
   Many Governors, through their state-of-the-State speeches or proposed legislation, have already committed publicly to spending these funds for the health and welfare needs of their citizens. 
   The majority of the Governors have already made commitments to create trust funds and escrow accounts that will ensure that the tobacco settlement funds are spent on health care services for children, assistance for growers in the States that will be affected, education, and smoking cessation. 
   Two major programs--this is really important--in the settlement are already dedicated to reducing teen smoking and educating the public about tobacco-related diseases. Two hundred and fifty million dollars will create a national charitable foundation to support the study of programs to reduce teen smoking and substance abuse and prevent diseases associated with tobacco use. An additional $1.5 billion will create a National Public Education Fund to counter youth tobacco use and educate consumers about tobacco-related diseases. 
   In addition, the settlement agreement has significant restrictions on advertising and promotion--such as bans on advertising and lobbying against local, State, and Federal laws--which will have an impact on youth smoking. In other words, the tobacco companies can no longer lobby against legislation that will deal with cessation of use of tobacco. 
   States are already spending State funds on smoking cessation. They don't need the Federal Government to put a mandate in place. There is simply no way that States can spend 20 percent of these funds on smoking cessation programs. These programs cannot absorb this level of funding. As smoking levels decline, as expected under the settlement, it will become impossible for States to spend this level of funding effectively. 
   This amendment forces States to spend an incredible--listen to this--$49 billion on just one objective: Denying them the ability to use these funds to best meet the needs of their citizens. The notion that the compassion and wisdom of Washington exceeds that of our State capitals is not only wrong, it is offensive. The Governors and the local government officials in this country care as much about smoking cessation as the Members of this Congress. 
   I will never forget during welfare reform the people who were telling us that we didn't care as much about people as the people in Washington. They said it would be a race to the bottom. The fact of the matter is, it is a race to the top. 
   Mr. President, I think we should overwhelmingly defeat this amendment. It is not appropriate for this piece of legislation.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's attention the fact that we welcomed a new citizen into Ohio last night at 11:57, and that new citizen is my second grandchild, Veronica Kay Voinovich. Veronica is our second grandchild. Her grandmother and I welcome her and so do her other grandparents, Warren and Alice Fish. I apologize for not being in Cleveland last night for her birth, but it was necessary for me to be here to do the work of the Senate and to represent the people of Ohio and, hopefully, through those votes do something for her and the rest of the citizens of our great State.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, America's journalism pool got a little smaller last week as David B. Cooper, one of Ohio's most respected journalists, hung up his typewriter. 
   For almost 22 years, Dave was a powerful voice in Ohio, in charge of editorials and op-eds as the associate editor for the Akron Beacon Journal. Over the length of his career, Dave was never known to mince words or pull punches. He was brutally honest when he didn't think someone--usually a politician--was living up to expectations. And usually you didn't have to be reminded twice--you got the message. I will say that many politicians from the State of Ohio, including yours truly, worked very, very hard to live up to Dave's high expectations of us. 
   Dave's principles always shone through in the topics he wrote about. His analysis was precise and he showed genuine care about the issues in and subjects of his columns. And he worked hard to make sure that he was easily understood. 
   Dave's legacy is his journalistic leadership at the national, state and local level. He was outstanding. He began his career 44 years ago, writing for the Raleigh News and Observer and the Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel during the 1950's and 1960's. In 1968, he started his association with Knight-Ridder newspapers by accepting a position with the Detroit Free Press. 
   It wasn't until 1977 that Dave saw the light and realized his calling was in the State of Ohio with the Akron Beacon Journal. The Ohio journalism corps has truly been enhanced with his presence. 
   I have enjoyed a wonderful relationship with Dave. He didn't always agree with me--and I certainly never expected him to--but he was always fair. In fact, I always looked forward to reading Dave's editorials just to find out how he thought my administration was doing. 
   For the last 2 years, Dave and I have shared something in common--we're both grandfathers, although I'm a little newer at being one than he is. There is sort of an unspoken bond between grandfathers that is readily apparent in the smiles we wear and the glint in our eye, as we regale others with the exploits of our precious little ones. Dave has four grandchildren and I know that he is more proud of them than any editorial or column he has  written. In fact, Dave's best writing has been about his grandchildren! 
   One of the great things about the relationship Dave and I have is our mutual love of fishing. Many times when we've been talking about topics of the day, we've gone off the subject talking about fly-fishing techniques, favorite streams, or the one that got away. 
   Dave and I have done some fishing together, but not nearly enough. And even though Dave and his lovely wife Joanne are moving to California, I look forward to doing more fishing with him in the years to come. 
   And while I prefer polka, Dave loves jazz. Dave knows more about jazz--jazz records, jazz singers, and jazz history--than anybody I know. I suspect that his knowledge of jazz surpasses all but a few journalists in America. He even has a jazz radio show in Akron! He has written about jazz extensively and he never tires of speaking about it. 
   Mr. President, I want to close by saying I have immense respect for Dave. He is and always has been a true professional. And although I am sorry to see him retire, I am confident that the citizens of Akron have not heard the last from him. 
   Dave and I will always be friends. I wish him well as he and his wife Joanne embark on their new life together. 
   I notice that my colleague, Senator DEWINE, is on the Senate floor, and I yield the floor to him.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I stand before you today in strong support of Senator FRIST's Educational Flexibility Partnership Act. But then again, most of the Senate, and all 50 Governors, Secretary Riley, and even the President want this wonderful piece of legislation to pass today. 
   It is a big day personally for me. Some people are not aware of the fact that this effort for flexibility started in Ohio in 1981, when I commissioned a private-sector audit of the department of education to make it more friendly to our school districts. At the same time, it was command and control. The private-sector management audit came back and said it was riddled with paperwork, and the shocking thing was that half the paperwork the department had to do and the schools had to do was as a result of Federal regulations, and we were only getting 6 percent of our money from the Federal Government. 
   I recall going to Washington at that time and sitting down with Secretary Lamar Alexander and asking him if he could do something about it. Unfortunately, he could not. Later on when President Clinton became President and Dick Riley, a former Governor, became Secretary of Education, in the Goals 2000 legislation he provided for States to take advantage of some flexibility. 
   I want to underscore that a State cannot take advantage of this program unless they agree themselves to waive their regulations, and in some instances--for example, in Ohio--even waive statutes. This provided an opportunity for school districts to get waivers that, prior to Ed-Flex, had to go directly to Washington in order to get a waiver. It allows them to go to their superintendents of public instruction in their respective States. 
   I am proud that we have had an opportunity to take advantage of this. In Ohio we have 186 schools using a title I waiver, with over half of these schools increasing their proficiency test scores in math and science. Those school districts have taken advantage of waivers in the Eisenhower grants. As you know, in the Eisenhower grants, 85 percent of the money is supposed to be used for math and science. But in the elementary schools, how can a kid learn math or science if they cannot read? So as a result of the waiver program, we were able to get waivers to allow the money to be spent on reading, and today in those schools we have seen a dramatic increase in the math and science scores as a result of the fact that those schools were able to take advantage of the waiver. 
   There are some people who would argue that we need more accountability. I argue that we have accountability in most States. In Ohio, for example, we have our report cards, not only by districts but by individual buildings. With Ed-Flex, a building or a classroom that takes advantage of a waiver has to agree that within a year they will report back on how they are taking advantage of that waiver and whether it is making a difference in the classroom. 
   I would say that if I could get every title I school in the United States of America to become an Ed-Flex waiver school, we would have a lot more accountability with that title I money that is going into those districts--for those that are concerned about title I. 
   I think this idea is so overwhelming that last year, as chairman of the National Governors' Association, I made Ed-Flex one of my top priorities. I recall going to the White House and talking to President Clinton about it and his indicating that he thought it was a good idea. Last year, we almost got it done with the help of Tom Carper, the Democratic Governor of the State of Delaware. Again, we are bringing it back to Congress for their consideration. 
   To my Democratic colleagues I say this: There are a lot of ideas that have been proposed here on the floor. My attitude is that they all involve money. This is not a money bill. Ed-Flex does not require one additional dime from the Federal Government. What it does do is that it allows school districts to save the paperwork and the redtape so their administrators can spend time on education, and the teachers can, and they can take more of the money that is coming in from the Federal Government and put it in the classroom to improve the education of our children. 
   And if you want to talk about priorities: Rather than 100,000 new teachers, I would rather put the money in funding the Individuals With Disabilities Education Assistance Act or, in the alternative, my favorite: If I had the choice, instead of 100,000 teachers, I would put the money into 0 to 3, or conception to 3, a time in a child's life that is being, quite frankly, neglected in this country, not only by the Federal Government but by the local governments. We can prove that if you put money in during that period of time, when it is most important to the development of a child's ability to learn, you can get the best return on your investment. 
   So let's debate how we want to spend this Federal money and where we ought to be spending it, but let's not make that part of the debate on Ed-Flex. We will get to that. We will have that debate. We will look at what is available and decide how it is to be spent. 
   So today I ask the Members of the Senate to support Ed-Flex. Let's have a clean Ed-Flex bill. Let's get it done. It has made a great difference for the people of Ohio and those States that have taken advantage of it. I think it is long overdue to give the other 38 States of this Nation the same opportunities that we have. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have devoted more than 30 years of my life to public service. I have held elected office as mayor of the city of Cleveland, and I served as Governor of the State of Ohio. Now I am privileged to serve the citizens of Ohio as one of their U.S. Senators. I am deeply honored by the confidence they have bestowed upon me. 
   They have placed their faith in my ability and my judgment to consider and vote upon and bring to the forefront issues of national significance. It is for this reason that I have come to the Senate floor to discuss what I consider to be the most serious financial and economic threat facing our Nation today. 
   Through the tough choices made by Congress in passing the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and through our continued strong economy, the days of escalating, crushing budget deficits appear to be coming to an end. In Washington, politicians are saying we have turned the corner, and for the first time in 30 years, we have a budget that shows a surplus. 
   If it is true, it would be brand new territory for many Americans. Tens of millions were not even born yet when we had our last surplus. However, it is my contention that we do not yet have honest budget surpluses, and unless we take bold steps, our actions will continue to leave our younger citizens and future generations liable for three decades of massive deficits and a national debt that has made us the greatest debtor nation in the world. 
   Prior to 1968, surpluses were not uncommon. But through President Lyndon Johnson's expansion of the Vietnam war and the implementation of the Great Society, we started to lose fiscal restraint. 
   A budget trick was implemented by the Johnson administration. It took the off-budget Social Security trust funds, which were in true surplus, and commingled them with the regular budget which at that time was showing a deficit. In this manner, Congress and subsequent Presidents were able to mask annual budget deficits that contributed to a rising national debt. 
   I would just like to point out, however, the years Social Security has masked the true budget deficit that we have had and how it has improved our budget situation. 
   If you go back to 1995, we reported that we had a budget deficit of $164 billion. The fact of the matter is we had a budget deficit of $226 billion. And what we did was we reduced it by using the Social Security surplus of $62 billion. 
   In 1996, we reported that we had a deficit of $107 billion. The fact is our budget deficit was $174 billion, and again we used Social Security to reduce that deficit. 
   Then, in 1997, we reported, oh, it is wonderful news, we had just a minus $22 billion deficit. The fact of the matter is we had a $103 billion deficit, and we plastered it over with $81 billion of Social Security money. 
   Then, in 1998, we had the great celebration, the great surplus that we talked about. The fact of the matter is that even in 1998, when we reported the first unified budget surplus, we still had a real deficit of $30 billion. Again, we used the $99 billion Social Security budget surplus to hide the fact that we had a $30 billion deficit. 
   Again, this year, we are reporting we will have a $111 billion surplus. The fact of the matter is, even this year, we will have a $16 billion deficit; and again that has been covered over by the using of Social Security. 
   And for the year 2000--the budget we are working on right now--we are reporting we will have a $133 billion surplus. The fact of the matter is, even this year, we are going to have a $5 billion deficit on budget. We have covered that $5 billion up with $138 billion of surplus in the Social Security trust fund. 
   And next year we are celebrating the idea that maybe we are going to have our first real honest to goodness on-budget surplus of $11 billion. The fact of the matter is--and we will report a unified budget surplus of $156 billion--but the truth is that we only have a real--real--surplus of $11 billion. 
   Rather than attempting to enact policies that would bring us back to surpluses, 30 years of financial gimmicks have ensued, so much that we ran up a debt of $5.6 trillion in those intervening years from the time of Lyndon Johnson. Since the time my wife and I got married in 1962, interest payments on the debt have gone from 6 cents on the dollar to 14 cents on the dollar this past year. If we had had the same 6-percent interest payment when we got married in 1962, Americans would have saved $140 billion this year. 
   As the debt grew during the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to bring it under control. In 1985, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act which required the unified budget to be split and the Social Security trust funds kept separate. When Gramm-Rudman passed, I was encouraged that finally we were going to get some truth in budgeting. 
   At that time, I was mayor of Cleveland and I was serving as president of the National League of Cities. In 1985, the debt was $1.8 trillion. We mayors felt the need to do our part to help reduce the debt. We did our share when we lost the CETA program, revenue sharing, one half of our community development block grant, and a complete loss of the Urban Development Action Grant Program. When I left office after 10 years as mayor of the City of Cleveland, we had $79 million less a year from the Federal Government than we had when I came into office in 1979. 
   In order to make up that difference, first of all we did everything we could to reduce costs. In many instances, cities across this country had to increase their local income taxes or local taxes by over 50 percent to compensate for the loss of these Federal dollars. Much to our chagrin, our sacrifice did little to help reduce our annual deficits or shrink our national debt. Indeed, the debt was $1.8 trillion in 1985; today it is $5.6 trillion. If you go back to when I became mayor in 1979, the national debt was $780 billion; today, 20 years later, it is $5.6 trillion. Listen to this: A 700-percent increase in the country's national debt in a 20-year period. 
   We have a law that says Social Security trust funds are supposed to be off budget, and we have the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 that removes Social Security from deficit targets and other enforcement calculations. But it was another law, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, that forced tough spending choices on Congress and on the administration, making them live within their means for the first time in decades. 
   I congratulate the Members of Congress, those who supported the balanced budget agreement of 1997. It is this law more than any other that has given us the tools to help us now put our financial house in order. As a result, we are seeing a decrease in the on-budget deficit, we are cutting down on spending, people are projecting surpluses, and the Social Security trust funds are growing. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. But to get there, we must maintain our discipline and continue doing those things that will bring down our debt and honor our commitments to our citizens. 
   As this chart shows, if we stick to our guns, if we honor the caps in the 1997 budget agreement, we might have an on-budget surplus starting in the year 2001 and a growing surplus thereafter. Here is what it looks like: In 1999, if we stick to the balanced budget agreement, if we don't invade the budget caps we have for the first time in 30  years, we can begin the new century by having a true, real budget surplus that will continue to grow. 
   But along comes the President with his fiscal year 2000 budget and projections for 15 years into the future. In one fell swoop, he proposes a continuation of the ill-conceived policies that got us in trouble in the first place. Under his budget, we still have unified budget totals and the President has proposed to continue to use Social Security to pay for other government programs for at least the next 15 years. We can't even show the 5 years beyond 2009 because there are no hard numbers from the administration so the Congressional Budget Office can make projections. This is not truth in budgeting that the American people expect or deserve, and I think it will lead to disastrous consequences. 
   This chart shows what will happen if we follow the President's proposal to deal with the unified budget. In 1999, we will start developing annual budget deficits that will take us down this crimson path to where we have been for the last 5 or 6 years. 
   Let me point out where we are going: The red line on the chart is the deficit; this is the real deficit. Because we have had self-discipline, because we are honoring the budget agreement, we are seeing these red deficit numbers get smaller. If the President's proposal goes into effect, we are going to go back to the old days. Instead of having this scenario at the beginning of the next decade, this scenario will be had under the President's program. 
   Why is this important? First, the President says we have a budget surplus in fiscal year 2000. This is simply not true. If you look at the chart titled ``Real Budget Surplus,'' you will see again that fiscal year 2000 shows a real budget deficit of $5 billion. In fact, if you look at the chart, we don't have a 
   surplus this year--rather, a $16 billion deficit. 
   What the President does is take the off-budget Social Security trust funds and continue to use them to mask the deficit while saying he is saving Social Security. It is a fraud. The President's surplus for this fiscal year, the next fiscal year, in fact, and for 14 fiscal years after that, continues the gimmick of using the unified budget. It is disingenuous. It continues to use billions of dollars of the Social Security trust fund to mask the true size of the budget and allows the President to put off making those tough budget decisions that we must make. If we allow this to happen--the tough budget choices we have to make today--we are in deep trouble. 
   We have a growing economy and we have the lowest unemployment we have seen at any time. If we can't as a nation make the tough decisions that we need to make to turn things around and to have an on-budget surplus, if we can't do it now, we will never do it. 
   Second, the President not only busts the spending caps agreed upon in the 1997 budget deal, he destroys them. These targeted caps are meant to keep our spending in check. But even before we debate a budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, we learn from Congressional Budget Office Director Dan Crippen that the President proposes to increase, or ``blast,'' the caps by $30 billion--$30 billion. In fiscal year 2000, we are supposed to face budget caps that will force us to cut $28 billion. It will take tough choices to meet these caps, but we must show restraint if we are ever to bring our finances in order. 
   This is why I am pleased that the Republican leadership has given their assurance to maintain the caps so that we may demonstrate to the American people that we are serious about the commitment. The Republicans have also--this is really important, folks--committed to restoring truth in budgeting by ensuring that 100 percent of Social Security trust funds are protected and not used for additional spending or tax cuts. In other words, the Social Security trust fund is off, it is off. We are locking it up. There will not be any tax reductions or new spending with Social Security surpluses. 
   Third, the President is skirting a moral obligation that has been made to our seniors and all future generations to fully preserve the sanctity of the Social Security system. Social Security is a sacred trust between the Federal Government and every American. 
   That is why I firmly believe we need to get away from treating Social Security funds as part of the budget and wall it off from any temptation to use it for purposes other than Social Security. As I say, we need to ``put it in a lockbox.'' 
   The President, on the other hand, wants to use the Social Security trust funds to show that he has a budget surplus. As I said, there are billions and billions of dollars meant for the Social Security trust fund that are supposed to be off budget. But he can't resist trying to make those funds a part of the budget so he can mask the size of the deficit and use any so-called surplus to pay for his agenda. 
   We have been playing games with Social Security for far too long. Do you know what? It is time to stop. 
   Under the President's plan, only 62 percent of the unified surplus would be devoted to Social Security. In fact, recently, the head of the Senate Budget Committee said only 58 percent of the unified surplus is going to be used to protect Social Security. This represents an actual decrease from what we would allocate to Social Security if we were to treat it as an off-budget item. 
   This is budgetary sleight of hand, and the President knows it. It is unconscionable for him to say that he is ``protecting and preserving'' Social Security, when in reality he is taking money away from it and using it to pay for other programs. No matter how well intentioned those programs are, it is not the right thing to do. 
   Fourth, the President hinges his plan on budget surpluses that are calculated far into the future. 
   As our Nation's premier economist, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testified before the Senate Budget Committee:  
   We cannot confidently project large surpluses in our unified budget over the next 15 years, given the inherent uncertainties of budget forecasting.  
   Greenspan goes on to say:  
   How can we ignore the fact that virtually all forecasts of the budget balance have been wide of the mark in recent years?  
   In a January 1999 report to Congress, the Congressional Budget Office wrote that an error on the projection of the budget surplus in 2009, and based on previous averages, could be ``equal to 13 percent of projected outlays [and] would produce a swing of $300 billion.'' 
   The Cincinnati Post, in an editorial on February 10, said: ``There's one thing wrong with budget forecasts: they are inevitably wrong.'' 
   Is it prudent to take that kind of risk with our children's future? I don't think so. If we go along with these four points, we will have no credibility with the American people. And to regain credibility, we must put an end to the game playing and restore truth in budgeting. 
   When we--the Congress and the administration--are forced to make the hard choices that we were sent here to make, we often try to do what we believe our constituents want us to do. However, what they want, I think, is quite simple; they want us to tell the truth. They want us to stop using smoke and mirrors to say that the Nation's financial house is in order. They want us to give them enough credit to know the distinction between what we do and what we say. The American people want us to make the tough choices. 
   Two weeks ago, I was faced with one of those tough choices. The Senate debated legislation that would expand the pay and retirement benefits of our men and women in uniform. I want you to know that there is nobody who supports our Armed Forces more than I, and no one believes more than I that we should provide as many incentives as possible to retain these quality troops in our military. 
   However, we cannot continue to pass legislation without first dealing with its consequences. That bill would have authorized an increase in our country's financial liabilities by approximately $55 billion over the next 10 years. Because we had no idea how to pay for it or if it would fall within the budget caps, I felt it necessary to vote ``no.'' It was a tough choice, but I felt it was necessary. 
   When I became mayor of Cleveland, the city was in default. It was the first city in America to go into default since the depression. To get the city out of its financial abyss, I had to make tough choices. As a result of our actions, we were able to turn the city's default into a surplus, and Cleveland  now enjoys an economic renaissance it has not seen in generations. 
   As Governor, I again had to make hard choices in each and every budget in order to meet our constitutional obligation to balance our budget. When I became Governor of Ohio in 1991, our State faced an over $1 billion budget deficit. In order to balance the budget, I had to make four cuts over 2 years totaling $711 million. I was picketed by college students--5,000 of them outside the State House, who were told by the university people that I was cutting higher education and their tuition costs were going to go up. And I was picketed, at the same time, by welfare recipients who marched on the capitol because we cut out general assistance for able-bodied people. 
   But we had to get our financial house in order. Somebody had to make the tough decisions. 
   As a result, today Ohio is spending a record amount of money on programs to help children. In addition, we have been able to cut State income taxes for 3 straight years, including an almost 10-percent across-the-board tax cut this year. In other words, when the taxpayers of Ohio, this year, file their 1998 returns, their income tax will be almost 10 percent less than it would have been without our good management. 
   Ohio has a general revenue rainy day fund of over $935 million and a Medicaid rainy day fund of $100 million, so in the future we can avoid deep cuts in vital services or tax increases just in case there is a downturn in the economy. Ohio is in better shape today because we were able to make the hard choices. 
   Every day, millions of Americans have to make hard spending choices, too. They have to pay their bills, pay their mortgages, put food on the table, and buy clothes for their children. They have budgets and they know they have to live within their means. Unlike the administration, when most people have extra money, they don't go out and start to spend it wildly. They tend to their finances, they save, they pay off their credit cards and loans, and they invest in homes and businesses. 
   That brings us back to what we would do with whatever on-budget surplus we achieve. What are we going to do with it if we get it? The first thing is, I will believe it when I see it. I am a ``doubting Thomas'' about whether we really will see it. But if we do get an on-budget surplus, what we need to do is be wise and leave it alone. Why the rush to spend it? Why the rush to lower taxes? We don't even know if we have it. If we do get it, we should leave it alone and give it a chance to accumulate. 
   If we cannot guarantee--and we cannot--that we are going to have an on-budget surplus, then we have no right to start committing dollars that we don't have. 
   If and when we get an on-budget, or ``real,'' surplus, it is our moral obligation to our children to pay them back by using any such surplus to pay down our current debt. We have stuck these pages who are standing in front of me with a big bill. We have an obligation to pay that debt down so part of the income taxes they pay in the future aren't to pay off the interest on debts they had nothing to do with during their time of growing up. 
   I want you to know that this isn't just my opinion about paying down the debt. It is the opinion of experts like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, CBO Director Dan Crippen, and GAO Comptroller David Walker. They agree that it is the best use of these funds--pay down the national debt. 
   Not only is it a moral obligation, but this course of action makes great economic sense for four reasons. I think this is really important because a lot of people say: ``Reduce the taxes'' and ``This is really going to be the thing that is going to make a big difference.'' I say: Reduce the deficit, bring it down, and here are the reasons why. 
   First of all, it will decrease the overall interest paid on the debt, and that is important because paying off the debt lowers the interest. When you lower the interest, what do you do? You lower the cost of Government, and that makes more money available for other purposes. 
   No. 2, Alan Greenspan will tell you that it helps allow the economy to expand. 
   No. 3, it lowers the interest rate for individual citizens, which is a big deal. According to Alan Greenspan, it lets people afford to buy homes or refinance their mortgages, and it puts real money into the pockets of tens of millions of Americans. 
   Just think about it. As we got our house in order and interest rates came down, think of the millions of Americans who have refinanced their homes, and those who are able to buy automobiles today because interest rates are down. If we bring the national debt down and don't follow what the President wants to do, to use the unified surplus, we will keep those interest rates down. That is real money in your pocket. 
   Last but not least, paying down the debt lowers the amount of taxes the Government would need from the American people, according to the Business Roundtable. 
   Using only on-budget surplus funds for debt reduction prevents us from making false promises to the American people. One of the biggest assumptions associated with the treatment of surplus funds is an indefinite continuation of our current period of economic growth. 
   Blending that assumption with the use of a unified budget surplus is a volatile mix since no one can predict how long this period of growth will last. Optimistic surplus estimates could fluctuate wildly over the next few years, with unknown consequences. 
   As most of my colleagues know, within ten years, the ``baby-boomers'' will start to become eligible for Social Security and the sheer size of their numbers will present a challenge to maintain the viability of the Social Security system. In order to honor the contract we entered into with these individuals, it is our obligation to ensure that we have the necessary funds. 
   A unified budget surplus raids the ``offbudget'' Social Security funds and replaces them with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of IOU's for our children and grandchildren. This is not the legacy we should leave. 
   We are bankrupting the futures of generations yet unborn because we have a hard time saying no. Well, it is time to start owning-up to our obligations and meeting our responsibilities, because ladies and gentlemen, Social Security is a sacred trust. 
   Unfortunately, too many people have become cynical that we don't have a commitment to Social Security. For example, citizens like my son, George--people in their 20's, their 30's and even their 40's--don't ever expect to see a dime of Social Security in their lifetime. 
   What they know is that Uncle Sam has been taking money out of one pocket via payroll taxes, and taking money out of the other pocket via income taxes and the Government just puts it all together and uses it for what it wants. 
   They've been told that their money is ``in there'' for them when they retire, but when Congress and the Administration play shell games with the trust funds, no one believes it. 
   It is a sad commentary that there is such little faith in the promises made by our government. However, this cynicism is given credence when we continue to use Social Security trust funds to hide our excesses. 
   I firmly believe that it is our moral obligation to honor the commitments we have made to our citizens on Social Security, instill truth-in-budgeting, clean up the financial messes we have made and provide for all of the generations that follow, a nation that is better than we received. 
   Behind my desk on my computer, I have a screen-saver picture of my 2-year-old granddaughter, Mary Faith. She is the joy of our lives. She is a wonderful little girl. We have lots of hope and promise for her. But she has no idea the decisions we are making now are going to affect her financial future. And those decisions are being made by her grandfather, other Members of the Senate and Congress and the administration. 
   She has no idea that on the day she was born--Mary Faith was born on December 29, 1996--she immediately became responsible for a whopping $187,000 bill from the Federal Government on interest that she is going to have to pay over her lifetime. And that is on a debt her grandfather's generation ran up for our own benefit. 
   I prefer the picture of Mary Faith on my screen saver, this picture right here, which says ``Sentenced to  Repay.'' That is the next generation of Americans--``Sentence to Repay'' the debt we didn't have the guts to pay for during our lifetime. 
   Any day this week Mary Faith is going to have a new brother or sister. And, Mr. President, we are actually expecting her brother or sister on Friday of this week, and I want to let you know that for sure I will not be here if we have any rollcall votes on Friday. 
   While nothing can surpass the joy our family will feel on this special day, I can't help but think that like my granddaughter, Mary Faith, he or she is going to receive a bill from this Government for the interest on the debt that he or she had nothing to do with. And that bill is going to be even larger than the one we gave to Mary Faith 2 years ago. 
   We have been reaping all the benefits and putting the future of all our children and grandchildren in jeopardy through a ``we buy now, you pay later'' philosophy. I cannot convey how wrong I think it is to saddle them with such an excessive financial burden that we now, this Congress, have the ability to correct. 
   That is why I feel debt repayment is the wisest use of any on-budget surplus. It is plain common sense, and it would be the greatest gift we could ever give to our future generations. 
   Mr. President, each year, on the anniversary of President George Washington's birthday, a U.S. Senator is given the privilege of reading Washington's Farewell Address on the floor of this Senate. It is a tradition that dates back nearly 100 years. This year, I had the distinct honor to read this wonderful document, the first Ohioan who has had the privilege of reading that farewell address since Bob Taft gave it back in 1939, 60 years ago. 
   As I prepared for the speech and I read through his words, Washington's words, I was particularly taken by the relevance today of one of President Washington's admonitions to a young United States of America. Here is what he said 200 years ago.  
   [avoid] the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.  
   Those were very, very wise words of President Washington, and they ring true today as well as they rang true during his day. I believe it is our duty to heed them. We owe that to all our Nation's children and our grandchildren. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, as a newcomer to the Senate, I have been perplexed by the great debate over Ed-Flex. I would like to say that Ed-Flex is not the beginning and the end in terms of education. When we first talked about Ed-Flex early on in this session, the thought was that we would move it out early before we got into the great debate over the reauthorization of elementary and secondary education and to understanding that there are a lot of things we needed to discuss --more teachers, school construction; on our side of the aisle, block granting all the money into the classroom, and many other things. It was a bipartisan effort. 
   As chairman of the National Governors' Association a year ago, I was at the White House. I said to the President, ``We would like to see Ed-Flex for all the States.'' By the way, we don't need it in Ohio. We were one of the first States to get Ed-Flex. I thought it would be wonderful if the other States had the same opportunities we had in Ohio. The President said, ``I am for Ed-Flex.'' Tom Carper, now the chairman of the National Governors' Association, Governor Carper, was at the White House. Again, the President said, ``I am for Ed-Flex.'' 
   This bill is just aimed at giving the other 38 States in the United States of America the opportunity to use these waivers the way we have in Ohio. We believe they have helped us do a better job with the money that has been made available under various Federal programs. We can show, for example, where we have been able to get waivers under title I, and how it has improved the performance of our children in our title I schools. We have been able to show that by getting waivers to the Eisenhower professional grants that the money has been used better than it was before. 
   One of the things we all ought to be concerned about here in the Senate is you can't get an Ed-Flex waiver without putting a kind of Goals 2000 plan together, getting a State to waive their regulations and some of their statutes, and allowing a school district to look at all of these programs and come up with a plan that is going to do a better job of taking care of their boys and girls in their respective school districts. 
   I was saying to one of the Senators yesterday that in terms of Ed-Flex I wish every school district that was title I would ask for a waiver, because at least you would then be able to go back a year later and find out whether or not that title I money is really making a difference in the lives of those children. 
   I just think the issue of--a lot of these great things have been talked about, Senator KENNEDY and others have--but I think the thought was that we need to spend the time discussing those things as we move through the reauthorization of 
   elementary and secondary education. There were a lot of people on my side of the aisle who didn't want to go along with Ed-Flex because they thought it would spoil their bills that block grant money into the classroom. 
   So I just think that all of us who really care about the kids ought to get  on with Ed-Flex and talk about these other programs as we move through this session as we had originally anticipated. 
   As I say, the President agrees. All the Governors agree. It is an opportunity for the Federal Government to become a better partner to States and local governments to do a better job in providing help for our children. I just think this concept of ``one size fits all'' coming out of Washington doesn't work. We don't have a national school board. I must tell you that in Ohio what came out of Columbus, ``one size fits all,'' did not work. ``One size fits all'' doesn't work in individual school districts because of the fact that those districts are different. 
   This legislation gives all of the States an opportunity to take advantage of Federal money and meld it with money they are spending on the local and State level and make a real difference in the lives of our boys and girls in this country and achieves measurable improvement in the classroom. That is what people want--accountability. 
   I urge my colleagues to end the debate. Let's get on with it. Some of these other issues that are so very, very important which are near and dear to their hearts--I am not going to get into the argument about whether class size or the Federal Government should hire more teachers, and so forth; I will not get into that. I have feelings about that. But I think we need to do that later on and not on this piece of legislation. 
   One other thing that I think needs to be pointed out, Ed-Flex does not cost one dime--not one dime. 
   What we should think about is that I think it will allow us to use--I don't think--I know it will be able to use the money we are getting from the Federal Government in a more effective way of helping our children in the classroom. 
   Some of the other things that have been talked about here are the amendments to this legislation are going to cost money. The question is, Where is the money going to come from? That ought to be taken into consideration when we are looking at the whole smorgasbord of educational priorities and look at the dollars that are available, and then conclude that is it better to, say, fund IDEA rather than putting the money into new teachers or into new classroom construction? 
   As Senator KENNEDY notes, I am very interested in zero to 3. We would be better off taking money from new classrooms and for hiring new teachers and focusing it on zero to 3 where we know that a lot more needs to be done, and where we know that if we invest early on in the child's life we are going to get a better return. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote for cloture. Let's get Ed-Flex done. Let's get on with the debate over how we are going to spend the money available to make the biggest difference in the lives of our children in this country.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I share the concerns about the dropout rate in this country with the Senator from Nevada. I am very familiar with the dropout rate in the State of Ohio and what we tried to do to deal with the problem. 
   I contend that the passage of Ed-Flex will allow many States today to better utilize the money coming into their State to do a better job in those early years with youngsters so that they will be successful and they will stay in school. 
   For example, in the State of Ohio, we have used the Ed-Flex waiver on the Eisenhower Professional Grant Program to allow teachers to learn how to do a better job of teaching and helping children to learn. We have also allowed some of that money to be used in areas where kids are having the biggest problem, for example, in reading. We have seen that by using Ed-Flex, we have been able to do a much better job helping youngsters to learn, the same way with the waivers that we received in Ohio under Ed-Flex under title I, to be able to use those dollars in a more efficient way so that we can really make an impact in the lives of the children where the teachers feel that it will do the most good. 
   Again, we have seen the statistics from 1996 and 1998. Where we have had Ed-Flex, the kids are doing better, because they have had a waiver on the Eisenhower Professional Grant Program under title I. 
   There is no silver bullet in terms of the issue of dropout rates. When I became Governor of Ohio, I went to the head of the Department of Corrections and said to him, What can we do to keep down the prison population in the State of Ohio? His answer was, Head Start; we have to get involved with these youngsters earlier. So we went to town on the issue of Head Start, and today my State is the only State where every eligible child whose parents want them to be in preschool or Head Start is in the program. That is the responsibility, I believe, of the Governor of the State and the people involved in the State in education. They need to make these early childhood programs. 
   For example, you will be hearing from me later on in this session in terms of the use of TANF money. We have a very good program in our State called Early Start, where we are going to families as soon as that baby is born and intervening and trying to make sure that during those first 3 years of a child's life, they develop those learning capacities that they need to be successful in school. Too often these dropout programs are dealing with the end of the line, and that is what we, as a government, ought to be doing, making a commitment to intervene early on. That is where you can really make a difference in terms of having a program that deals with birth to 3, zero to 3, intervening earlier in the lives of our children to make that difference. 
   In addition, I think people should understand that there are lots of dropout programs in this country. I have been chairman of a group called Jobs for American Graduates for a couple of years. As a matter of fact, Senator ROBB from Virginia at one time was head of Jobs for American Graduates, and Senator JEFFORDS is very familiar with the Jobs for American Graduates Program. It is a program that has been in existence for 19 years and has served over 250,000 young people. 
   What we do is, we identify kids in the 12th grade who are in need of help. We get them into a job club. We intervene, and 90 percent of them stay in school. Then we follow them a year afterwards to find out what has happened to them, and they are either in secondary posteducation or they are in the service or they have a job. This program is in existence in about 28 States and territories in the United States. 
   I say to Senator REID of Nevada, we tried to get the program into the Las Vegas school system and they turned us down. Governor Miller tried to also do the same thing, and they turned us down. I suggest to Senator REID that he ought to talk with the people in the Las Vegas school system and ask them why they are not part of the Jobs for American Graduates Program, the most successful dropout program in the United States.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I point out that today our Jobs for American Graduates Program is utilizing--listen to the Federal programs that we are already utilizing. We are utilizing the Joint Training Partnership Act. We are using School to Work Opportunities Act. We are using the Wagner-Peyser Act. We are using the Carl Perkins Vocational Education Act funds. We are using the title IV Safe and Drug Free Schools funds. We are using the Criminal Justice Crime Prevention funds. We are using welfare reform funds. 
   The point I am making is that, No. 1, the dropout issue is a national problem, but it is primarily the responsibility of State and local governments. It  is up to the Governors and to the local people, local education people to respond to the problem. For example, in the JAG program, when I came in as Governor, we were spending about $4 million. Today we are spending $22 million in the State of Ohio, because we understand how important it is to try to identify these youngsters who are going to drop out of school and keep them in school. That is just a phase of it. 
   When you talk about dropout, you have to look at the entire specter of the cause of the dropout program. 
   I will go back to what Senator JEFFORDS has just said. It starts out with Early Start. It starts with Head Start. It starts out with technology in the schools. 
   An interesting story. I went to our prisons and visited those where they are ready to come out into society. I went in and I asked a question, How many of you graduated from high school? Not one hand went up. They were there working with these computers. I asked them what they were doing, and they pointed out to me that they were getting ready to get their GED. I remember after leaving there--it was about 7 or 8 years ago--I said to myself, we have computers in our prisons to help people get their GED and prepare them to go out, and we didn't have computers in our schools in Ohio. So we undertook a program to wire every classroom for voice, video and data. We brought computers into every classroom. It is amazing what is happening in elementary school. What you have to recognize is the reason why a lot of these youngsters drop out of school is they are not doing well. They have not had Head Start. When they get to school, they do not have the tools that are necessary to get the job done. 
   For example, in our State now, we have reduced the class size for first, second, and third grade to no more than 15 because we know those years are so important. So to stand here and say we need a program for dropouts, it seems to me that if we really want to get at the dropout problem in this country, this Congress should sit down and look at all these programs that we have and figure out how we can do a better job with the money we have to really make a difference. And we also ought to understand it is not our primary responsibility. It is the responsibility of the Governors; it is the responsibility of those local school superintendents and those local school boards and the people that are there to get this job done. 
   And for them to send money to Washington and then turn around and have it go back, I do not think is the best way to get the job done. On the other hand, the Federal Government should be trying to figure out how they can be a better partner. 
   I suggest a nice little task force that we could undertake in this Senate could sit down and look at these various programs, how do they fit together, how can we better maximize those dollars, and maybe look at some programs that we already have and say, if we put a little bit more money into this--for example, if we allow the States to use more of their TANF money to deal with this big problem, if they do not have education--they will not go on welfare. 
   There are a lot of things that we can do, I think, if we just sat down and looked at what we were doing. And one of the things that we can do, Mr. President, I think, is to pass Ed-Flex because Ed-Flex will give us a little better opportunity to take the Federal money that is coming in and really make a difference in the lives of kids. 
   And one of the things that I heard when I sat in your chair, Mr. President, during the debate earlier on was about accountability. In those school districts that are getting waivers for Eisenhower Professional Grants, getting waivers for title I, what have we found out? We are finding out if the programs are working. The ones that have not asked for waivers, we do not know what they are doing in terms of making a difference in the lives of children. 
   I say to Senator JEFFORDS, I think one of the great benefits of the Ed-Flex program is that when you make application you agree, first of all, to waive a lot of State statutes and also rules and regulations, but you also agree that you are going to meet certain standards; and you are held accountable toward those standards. 
   So I am saying to you that the schools in this country, in our 12 States that have taken advantage of Ed-Flex, at least we know whether or not some of this Federal money is really making a difference in the lives of children. And the more our schools can go to get waivers, I think the more accountability we are going to have. And it is one aspect I do not think has been talked about enough here on the floor of the Senate. 
   Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senate 280, a bill to extend educational flexibility to all of the 50 States. 
   One of the nice things about becoming a Member of the U.S. Senate is that I am going to have an opportunity as a Member of Congress to promote some of the programs I lobbied for while I was mayor of the city of Cleveland and  president of the National League of Cities, and programs that I promoted as Governor and chairman of the National Governors' Association. 
   Way back in 1991, we did a study in the State of Ohio in regard to our department of education to find out if there were ways we could change its direction. One of the things we discovered was that there were all kinds of reports that needed to be filed. What was astounding is that half the reports that were being filed by school districts were to the Federal Government and the Federal Government was only participating to the extent of about 6 percent of the money that was being spent in those school districts. 
   So at that time I came to Washington and I met with Lamar Alexander, who was at that time the Secretary of Education, and said to him that something had to be done about this. At that time he started to put some things together. I think he may have coined the word ``Ed-Flex.'' Also, Secretary Riley, an enlightened former Governor, realized that the Department of Education could be of help to the States. They extended the right to local State secretaries to grant waivers to local school districts where they wanted to use certain Federal programs for different purposes. 
   Prior to--we have to put this in perspective--Ed-Flex, if a local school district had a Federal program and they wanted to use it differently, they had to go to their respective State capital, kiss the ring of the superintendent of education, and then that superintendent of education would have to go to Washington and do the same thing. 
   So Ed-Flex basically says to those States that want to participate, if you put together an overall plan of how you are going to in your own State eliminate a lot of excess regulations, if you will put together an overall plan on how you intend to take these Federal dollars and use them better to really make a difference for the kids in the classroom, we will allow you the authority that we have in Washington to grant those waivers to the local school districts--in Ohio, 611 of them. 
   One of the really unique things that came about as a result of Ed-Flex in our State was that every school district had to prepare eight reports to the State department of education for Federal money, and then they would submit eight to the Federal Government. Today, they only provide one report to the State, and the State provides one to the Department of Education. 
   I think it is important also to point out that Ed-Flex is just the beginning of education reform in the 106th Congress. I would like to congratulate my colleagues on the Republican side and on the Democratic side for their willingness to allow Ed-Flex to be the first step in education reform in this session of Congress. 
   We all know that there are different ideas on how we need to reform education. The President has his ideas and some of us have a little different idea. You have heard from Senator BOND of Missouri about his program. 
   Many of us believe that the first thing we ought to do before we reauthorize elementary and secondary education is to inventory the 550 education programs that the GAO says we have or the 760 that the Congressional Research Service says we have and figure out what we are doing there, get rid of the ones that are not working, consolidate the money or save it, put it into a block grant, and send it back to the States and local governments so they can do a better job with the money we are making available to them. In other words, be a better partner with State and local government because they have the major responsibility for education in this country. 
   I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to see if we can't come up with a program that is really going to make a difference for our boys and girls throughout the United States of America. 
   In Ohio, this program has only really been in existence for 2 or 3 years, and there are some who say, why aren't you doing a lot more with it? 
   One of the things that needs to be emphasized is that school districts are interested in moving forward and taking advantage of Ed-Flex, but they are being very careful about when they ask for a change in the waivers and use the money differently because they want to make sure, if they ask for a change in the waiver, in fact they are really going to make a difference for the kids. They don't want to do this just to go through the motions. 
   In our State, we have testing in the fourth, sixth, and ninth grades, and we have a tough high school proficiency test. One of the things we are trying to do is to bring up the test scores in those first two tests, fourth and sixth grade. Through the use of Ed-Flex, we have been able to allow a local school district to use the Eisenhower professional grant money in a different way than is required under the Federal statute, and they are taking that money and putting it into emphasizing reading and social studies. We have seen, as a result of reallocating those resources, a marked improvement in the students' performance on their fourth- and sixth-grade proficiency tests. 
   I would love to see the rest of this country take advantage of this Ed-Flex Program so that they can do the same thing for their boys and girls. So I strongly urge that we pass this Ed-Flex legislation, as I say, the first phase of our education reform program. 
   I would like to underscore one other thing. One of the most important things the Congress of the United States did was to reform the welfare program in the United States of America. Prior to that reform, it was an entitlement program. We came and we lobbied Congress and said change it to a block grant, give us the flexibility so we can make a difference for our customers, the recipients of the welfare program. 
   We have seen a dramatic change in what is happening in our welfare program. For example, in my State we have 560,000 fewer people on welfare--a 60-percent reduction since 1992--because we have given the people closest to the customer the power and the authority to make a difference in their lives. 
   We never would have had welfare reform in the United States if it had not been for the fact that waivers were granted to the States prior to welfare reform and, as a result of that, Governors were able to show that with flexibility we can really make a difference in people's lives. 
   Ed-Flex will give Governors and local school district people that authority to change some of these Federal programs, these one-size-fits-all programs, change them and make a difference for our youngsters, and it will be a way we can show America that if you give people closest to the kids, the parents, the teachers in the classroom, give them the power and the authority to take those dollars and utilize them in a way that is really going to make a difference in the lives of our children, we will see the most revolutionary change and measured improvement we have seen in this country in terms of our public education system. 
   Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the ``Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999'', legislation that was championed in the previous Congress by my friend and predecessor, Senator John GLENN. As a Governor, I supported this bill as an important step toward detangling the web of duplicative federal grants available to States, localities and community organizations. As a Senator, I am pleased to pick it up where Senator GLENN left off. I would also like to thank Senator THOMPSON, Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator DURBIN for joining me as original cosponsors of this bill. 
   Scores of programs, often administered by the same federal agency, have similar purposes but are subject to different application and reporting requirements. This unnecessary duplication of effort wastes time, paper, and does nothing to improve program performance for the benefit of our constituents. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act is intended to streamline the grant application process, allowing those who serve their communities to focus on the job at hand--not on page after page of paperwork. The legislation directs federal agencies to simplify and coordinate the application requirements of related programs. The result, I hope, will be service to the public which is better, faster and more effective than before. 
   In other words, today in this country, if you want to apply for Federal assistance, every agency has a different form. If you have to report on what you are doing with that Federal assistance, every agency has a different form. We want to make those forms uniform across the board, which we know will relieve a lot of pressure and paperwork on the folks who are involved in these programs. 
   Another important component of this bill is the requirement that agencies develop a process to allow State and local governments and non-profit organizations to apply for and report on the use of funds electronically. Using the Internet as a substitute for cumbersome paperwork is a welcome innovation in the way the federal government does business, and I am pleased that the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act is leading the effort. 
   We need to bring technology into the Federal Government and allow people to do the same thing that they do when they are dealing with the private sector. 
   This bill was crafted in the last Congress by Senator GLENN after bipartisan, bicameral negotiations with the Administration, and while I was sorry that it was not enacted before the end of the 105th Congress, I am pleased to be able to introduce it today. The legislation is supported by the National Governors' Association and others in the State and local government and non-profit community because of the real potential it has to reduce red tape and improve services to our communities. I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the work of Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, and the rest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for recognizing the serious issues of recruitment and retention that S. 4 is written to address. Let me also thank Chairman WARNER, Ranking Member LEVIN, Personnel Subcommittee Chairman ALLARD and his Ranking Member CLELAND, as well as the other members of the Armed Services Committee. This legislation is a tremendous effort to address one of the most critical issues currently facing our men and women in uniform. 
   While I support much of the content of S. 4, I have some real problems with the process we are pursuing to meet the requirements of our armed forces. Specifically, why are we considering this legislation now before a budget resolution has been passed? Are we not tying the hands of both the Budget Committee as well as the Appropriations Committee with this legislation? Why did we take the pay and pension provisions out of the defense authorization bill? Passing this legislation would commit the Senate to spending an additional $55 billion between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2009. Is this a step we are ready to take? Let me point out that these concerns are not limited to this legislation alone. I will apply the same scrutiny to any bill, no matter how well-intentioned, in the future as well. 
   Which leads me to my second main concern about S. 4--its cost. $55 billion is a significant amount of money, even in Washington, D.C. Nevertheless, we have taken the opportunity during the course of debate on this bill to add a number of costly amendments. While I  have supported some of these efforts, they have been added to this legislation in an ad hoc manner without any discipline. I understand that this is often the nature of debate in this body, but I have a great fear we are forgetting our commitments to the budget caps, paying down the national debt and general fiscal responsibility. 
   The $55 billion cost for the base text of the bill, plus the costs of all the adopted amendments, must come from somewhere which begs the question--from where? The answer I have been getting from my colleagues supporting this bill is that the money will come from somewhere and the details will be worked out. I am not willing to accept that explanation at this point--I need to know details, the framework for moving ahead with this kind of spending before I would be ready to support it. Do we plan on increasing the allocation in the budget resolution for military spending? Further, once an allocation level has been established, will this effort force us to put other readiness and modernization efforts aside? These questions have not been answered. I understand that Secretary Cohen has echoed these concerns. They should and must be addressed before I can support this measure. 
   Let me be clear. I strongly support the intent of this bill and would like to support its content in a different package down the road. However, now is not the time to make these type of spending decisions. Regrettably, I will join several of my colleagues in voting against S. 4 for budgetary reasons.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. We are not here today because the President had a relationship that he himself has described as inappropriate and wrong. As House Manager JAMES ROGAN appropriately noted, ``Had the President's bad choice simply ended with this indiscretion, we would not be here today. Adultery may be a lot of things, but it is not an impeachable offense. Unfortunately, the President's bad choices only grew worse.'' It is not the President's inappropriate relationship, but his deliberate and willful attempts to conceal and mislead that brings us to this point. 
   The very foundation of this nation is the rule of law not of men. The framers of our Constitution specifically provided Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution which states, ``The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' 
   On January 7, 1999, as one of my first official duties as a United States Senator, I took an oath to consider the evidence and arguments in the impeachment case against the President. We answered in the affirmative when the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court administered the following oath:  
   Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?  
   I understood that the private inappropriate conduct of the President alone did not then and does not now rise to a level necessitating his removal from office. My responsibility is to fulfill the oath I took to determine impartially based on the facts, evidence and testimony whether the President committed high Crimes and Misdemeanors as outlined in the Constitution. 
   During my 33 years in public office, I have had to make some very difficult decisions. As governor, I had to make determinations on hundreds of requests for commutations and pardons. To my recollection, in no case have I labored more than I have over the Articles of Impeachment of our President. 
   After an exhaustive study, which included reading volumes of transcripts, watching the taped testimony and listening to the able arguments made by the House Managers, the White House counsel and my colleagues in the Senate, I have reached the conclusion that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the President committed both perjury and obstruction of justice as outlined in Articles I and II in the Articles of Impeachment. 
   I also have concluded that the President's obstruction of justice was premeditated and undertaken over a long period of time beginning when he learned that Monica Lewinsky was placed on the witness list in the Jones case. 
   It is particularly disturbing that he used his brilliant mind and superb interpersonal skills to sweep other people into his scheme, thereby impairing their credibility, all to extricate himself from taking responsibility for his conduct. But for a conclusive DNA analysis, he may have succeeded in that scheme. 
   By committing perjury and obstructing justice, the President is guilty of  high Crimes and Misdemeanors. As constitutional scholar Charles Cooper said, ``The crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, like the crimes of treason and bribery, are quintessentially offenses against our system of government, visiting injury immediately on society itself.'' 
   He violated his oath of office and failed to fulfill his responsibility under the Constitution, which provides that the President ``shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' Judge Griffin Bell has correctly noted, ``A president cannot faithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking them.'' The President has undermined the fundamental principle that we are a nation ruled by laws and not by men. There is no way in good conscience that we as a nation can have a lawbreaker remain as President of the United States when his conduct in office has included the very same acts that have resulted in the impeachment of Federal judges and have sent hundreds of people to prison. Ours is a nation of equal justice under the law. 
   I believe the framers of the Constitution had a President like Bill Clinton in mind when they drafted the impeachment provisions in Article II, Section 4--a very popular, brilliant communicator with extraordinary interpersonal skills who abuses his power, violates his oath of office, and evades responsibility for his actions because he believes he is above the law. 
   One who has committed high Crimes and Misdemeanors disqualifies himself from serving as President, Commander-in-Chief, and chief law enforcement officer. The President also represents much more than these titles and responsibilities. He is a symbol of the greatness of the American people. Presidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed that the president of the United States is ``the one-man distillation of the American people.'' And, President William Howard Taft described the president as ``the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and majesty.'' 
   By virtue of his own conduct, William Jefferson Clinton has forfeited his elected right to hold the office of president. I sincerely believe that this country can survive the removal of a popular president who has forfeited public trust. But, our country cannot survive the abandonment of trust itself.

   Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the articles of impeachment. It is the majority leader's hope that today's presentation by the White House can be concluded by early evening so that Members may attend the lecture series which begins at 6 p.m. That lecture series will be in the Old Senate Chamber. The guest speaker this evening will be former President George Bush. I remind all Senators that upon recessing this evening, the Senate will reconvene on Thursday at 1 p.m. to resume consideration of the articles. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.
