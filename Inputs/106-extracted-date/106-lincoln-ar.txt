    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, in October, the Special Committee on Aging joined Green Thumb to recognize the enormous contributions that this year's Green Thumb ``Prime Time Award'' recipients are making to their community and our country. 
   The Senior Community Service Employment Program is one of the best kept secrets in the country. This program is an innovative and cost-effective federal initiative that allows our nation's seniors to remain productive and independent by contributing their talent and services to their communities. 
   Some of Arkansas' finest employment programs for seniors are sponsored by Green Thumb, and I am pleased to recognize Arkansas' 2000 Prime Time Award recipient, Rhode B. (R.B.) Causey, Sr. 
   R.B., now 96 years old, grew up in a family of 13 children and sold business supplies and office machines during the Depression. These experiences, coupled with his ingenuity, persistence, and strong work ethic, prepared R.B. to branch out on his own in 1952 and open a business supply company. Today, R.B. and his son own and operate the R.B. Causey Company in Little Rock. 
   As if going in to work every day wasn't enough to keep him busy, R.B. also manages his own farm where he produces soybean and rice crops. The farm is also home to his extensive bee-keeping hobby. 
   R.B.'s recipe for success: ``Don't give up, stay involved, do something.'' provides a great example to all of us about the importance of staying active in our ``golden years.'' 
   I am fortunate to know R.B. and other Arkansas senior workers who are so vibrant and enthusiastic about their jobs. I only hope that when I am 75, 80, or 85 I will have half of their energy and zest for life! 
   America's senior population has great value. They have earned our nation's respect and support. Green Thumb and other senior employment programs allow communities to continue to reap the wisdom of our nation's talented seniors citizens.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as we complete work on the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000, I would like to bring the Senate's attention to a project that is very important to a group of my constituents in Arkansas: the Ten and Fifteen Mile Bayou project. The Ten and Fifteen Mile Bayou project would provide flood control to a poor, rural area in the Mississippi Delta that is oftentimes overlooked while other projects in more affluent, urban areas move forward. The Delta's small farming communities and poor minorities are the constituencies most affected by the constant flooding that this project seeks to prevent. It is vitally important to the future of this Delta region to alleviate these flooding concerns. 
   I have worked with the St. Francis Levee Board on this important project since my days in the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, the resources of this community are extremely limited and they are unable to meet the cost share requirements of any federal program. Can the distinguished Senator from Montana please explain section 204 of the current WRDA bill dealing with ``the ability to pay'' provision? Specifically, I am interested in hearing how this provision might help projects, like Ten and Fifteen Mile Bayou, that are needed but simply can not meet the cost share requirements.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues for yielding. 
   In listening to the chairman of the Budget Committee, he has been willing to work with me and I truly appreciate that. I thank him for his graciousness in working with me. But in his comments, I would like to say, for me and for others, that this is really more of a missed opportunity. So much has been talked about in the Presidential debates about bipartisanship. 
   I think all that many are asking for in this process is an opportunity to do exactly what the people of Arkansas elected me to do. That is to come into this debate with the ideas and the issues and concerns of the people of Arkansas. It is a missed opportunity for Members to be able to express how we feel about these issues in this bill. 
   The people of Arkansas sent me to this Senate to represent them and their issues. When the President comes from the White House to debate on these issues, I am not in that room nor are any of my Democratic colleagues. We have missed the opportunity to very passionately represent the people who have sent us to this body to speak up on their very behalf. 
   There are some good pieces in this bill. I am not here to say the other side doesn't know anything or that they haven't done anything right. All I am here to say is that the people who elected me to come to this body have been shortchanged because I have not been allowed a part of that process. 
   Mind you, I know I am on the bottom of the totem pole. I am not one of the higher muckety-mucks. The fact is, so many of the issues we hear are good for certain States; perhaps they are not good for our State. When we talk about Medicare+Choice in a State such as Arkansas that is predominantly rural, where Medicare Choice has pulled out in some instances and left seniors without coverage, we are going to give one-third of the funds in this bill directly to HMOs without any assurances from those groups that they will even stay in the Medicare program. Nor are there assurances that the HMOs will return to counties where they have already pulled out or will maintain the benefits they promised to seniors. We cannot in good conscience give this large sum to HMOs without providing accountability. If the other side believes that is the way to go, provide me the assurances that those HMOs are going to be willing to come back into those areas where they have already pulled out. 
   Meanwhile, in most of the other provisions that are so necessary to other providers in our States, the bill receives only 1-year fixes for the funding shortfalls. 
   This is a missed opportunity. No, it is not perfect. But it could be so much better for so many people across this Nation. It is our duty to stay here until we make it the best it can possibly be. 
   I support many of the provisions in the tax bill brought to the floor. However, there are problems with the bill, and being able to provide something that is the best that we can possibly provide for all individuals out there is our responsibility. I am willing to stay here, Mr. President, as long as it takes, to do what is right for the American people. 
   We deserve to discuss the merits of the school construction provisions in this bill. I want to do more for school construction in our country. Our schools, especially in the South, are crumbling around our students. The school construction provisions in this bill don't go far enough. If Democrats were allowed in that debate on this issue, perhaps we could bring these provisions closer to what we really need to do. 
   What we really do need is something similar to what Senator CHUCK ROBB has proposed in his school construction bill. But the fact is we haven't been at the table. We feel as passionately about representing the people in our States as our Republican counterparts do. All we have simply been asking is to be at the table. 
   And I also heard the majority leader say that he was willing to work on Senator LANDRIEU's adoption language. Well, was she invited to the table? Did he ask her what would be acceptable to her? There is no one more dedicated to this issue than Senator LANDRIEU, and she should be involved in this discussion. When exactly will she be consulted? When they call her name during the roll call vote? 
   I have been particularly frustrated that the Medicare BBA 
   relief provisions in this bill ignore the real bipartisan solutions that have been worked out between me and many of my colleagues throughout the year. I joined my Republican colleagues in a press conference the other day on a crucial bill, the Hospital Preservation Act of 2000, a bill in the Senate that has the support of 59 bipartisan cosponsors but it is left out of this package. This bill would restore full inflationary updates in Medicare hospital payments and is supported by hospitals across the country. 
   Another bipartisan bill is also left out of this package. The Home Health Payment Fairness Act of 2000, which has the support of 54 bipartisan cosponsors, would eliminate the 15 percent reduction in payment rates for home health services. This provision is very important to home health agencies in Arkansas and across the nation. 
   But the bill we are considering here merely delays this devastating cut for one year. This is not a long-term solution. Why spend time on short-term fixes when we could correct this problem right now? We delayed this cut last year for one year, and here we are again, in the same boat. Let's fix this now. It makes no sense to keep postponing these real solutions year after year and leave our health care providers without the ability to plan their budgets for the long-term. 
   The bottom line is, this is a missed opportunity. The bottom line is that we have been spending well over our surpluses while we haven't provided for the essentials, predominantly the downpayment on our debt.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for two very important pieces of legislation to the women of this country: the Violence Against Women Act and the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. 
   Combating domestic violence and child abuse has been a top priority for  me. I am an early cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 ..... And I joined with my colleagues in 1994 to pass the Violence Against Women Act, making it clear that violence against women is unacceptable. 
   Changing our laws and committing $1.6 billion over six years to police, prosecutors, and battered women shelters has helped America crack down on abusers and extend support to victims. 
   My home state of Arkansas has received almost $16 million in resources to help women who have been or are being abused. This money has made a tremendous difference to women and their families in Arkansas. 
   According to the Department of Justice, fewer women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends in the first two years after the Act's passage than in any year since 1976. We cannot stop this progress now. 
   By voting to continue the Violence Against Women Act, we send a signal to women across the country that they and their children will have options to chose from and a support network to rely on when they leave an abusive relationship. It also reinforces the message to abusers that their actions will not be tolerated or ignored. 
   I am also glad to see the Act expanded to include funding for transitional housing for women and children who are victims of violence, as well as resources for specific populations such as Native Americans and the elderly ..... Mr. President, I'd also like to take a minute to recognize National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and to call on the House to pass the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. 
   This bill will provide treatment to low-income women screened and diagnosed through the CDC National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. 
   Since 1990, the Centers for Disease Control's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program screens and diagnoses low-income women for breast and cervical cancer, but does not guarantee them treatment once diagnosed. 
   Nationwide, thousands of women are caught in a horrible federal loophole--they are told they have a deadly disease with no financial hope for treatment. 
   The American Cancer Society estimates that in the year 2000, 400 women in Arkansas will die of breast cancer, and 1,900 women will be diagnosed with it. 
   Luckily, my home state is currently administering an effective breast cancer screening program for uninsured women. This program has helped improve the rate of early diagnosis and also provides financial assistance for treatment. 
   However, right now, the CDC program reaches only 15 percent of eligible women ..... 
   Through the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, Arkansas would benefit from being able to free up resources for education and outreach, to help more women across the state. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, the fight to enact this legislation is not over. 
   After a 421-1 passage in the House in May, this critical bill passed the Senate on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 by unanimous consent. It now must go back to the House of Representatives for a vote on the Senate-passed version and then be sent to the President for his signature. I urge my colleagues in the House to move on this legislation, so that the President can sign it into law. 
   And I also urge all of the women in my state to get screened this month. Every three minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, and every 12 minutes a woman dies from breast cancer. Early detection is key. 
   I hope the women of Arkansas, especially if they have a family history of the disease, will take time during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month to take a step that could save their lives.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Interior Appropriations Bill for fiscal 2001 and our efforts here in the Senate to enact the Conservation and Reinvestment Act to provide permanent funding for land, water, and wildlife conservation programs in this nation. 
   With the passage of the Interior Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2001, we have taken a step in the right direction toward providing a permanent conservation fund for this nation--but it is only a step. 
   The Interior Appropriations bill funds many important programs and projects in Arkansas including refurbishing the historic Hot Springs National Park Bathhouses, constructing a visitors center at the White River National Wildlife Refuge, and funding needed construction and maintenance at recreation areas in the Ouachita National Forest. 
   The bill also increases the funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Payments in Lieu of Taxes, Urban and Historic Preservation programs, State Conservation grants. And needed funding for tackling the maintenance backlog in our nation's park system. But it leaves many of the programs that we have pushed for in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act out completely. Specifically, it leaves out a permanent stream of funding for wildlife conservation and education programs. 
   By establishing a permanent funding source for state based wildlife programs, we can take steps now to prevent species from becoming endangered. This would enable us not only to conserve the significant cultural heritage of wildlife enjoyment for the people of this country, but also to avoid the substantial costs associated with recovery for endangered species. In fact, all 50 states would benefit as a result of the important link between these wildlife education-based initiatives and the benefits of wildlife-related tourism. 
   CARA also would have provided a permanent funding source for rural community assistance and development funds, historic preservation, urban parks, conservation easements, and restoration of National Parks. These provisions would annually provide almost $3 billion nationwide for land, water, and wildlife conservation programs and include over $25 million in funding for Arkansas. 
   The 2001 Interior Appropriations bill is an important step toward providing for the conservation of this nation's land, water, and wildlife, but we can do so much more. We must not let this opportunity slip away to enact what may well be the most significant conservation effort of the century. I strongly urge my colleagues to continue to work toward passage of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Recreation Lakes Act of 2000--a bill that will recognize the benefits and value of recreation at federal lakes and give recreation a seat at the table in the management decisions of all our federal lakes. I am proud to be joined in this effort today by Senator CLELAND. 
   Recreation on our federal lakes has become a powerful tourist magnet, attracting some 900 million visitors annually and generating an estimated $44 billion in economic activity--mostly spent on privately-provided goods and services. And by the middle of this century, our federal lakes are expected to host nearly two billion visitors per year. 
   Yet, even with the millions of visitors each year to our lakes and reservoirs, recreation has suffered from a lack of unifying policy direction and leadership, as well as insufficient interagency and intergovernmental planning and coordination. Most federal agencies are focused on the traditional functions of man-made lakes and reservoirs; flood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, irrigation, and navigation. And often recreation is left out of the decision process. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will reaffirm that recreation is also an authorized purpose at almost all federal lakes and direct the agencies managing these projects to take action to reemphasize recreation programs in their management plans. This legislation will emphasis partnerships between the federal government, local governments, and private groups to promote responsible recreation on all our federal lakes. 
   It will establish a National Recreational Lakes Demonstration Program, comprised of up to 20 lakes across the nation. At each of these federal lakes, the managing agency will be empowered to develop creative agreements with private sector recreation providers as well as state land agencies to enhance recreation opportunities. Rather than just building new federal campgrounds with tax dollars, we need to create new partnerships to provide support for building recreation infrastructure that is in line with visitor and tourist desires for recreation. The National Recreation Lakes Demonstration Program will be a pilot project to test these creative agreements and management techniques on a small scale to demonstrate their effectiveness at promoting recreation on federal lakes. 
   Second, this legislation will establish a Federal Recreation Lakes Leadership Council to coordinate the National Recreation Lakes Demonstration Program and coordinate efforts among federal agencies to promote recreation on federal lakes. 
   It also will include the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. The Fee Demo Program has had wide successes in Arkansas and across the country in allowing individual parks and recreation areas to keep more 
   of their fee revenues on-site to reduce the often overwhelming maintenance backlog. 
   The legislation will also provide for periodic review of the management of recreation at federal water projects--something long overdue. A great deal has changed since many of the water projects were authorized, yet the initial legislative direction from over 70 years ago continues to be the basis for the management practices now in the year 2000--and that is not right. 
   Finally, the legislation will provide new opportunities to link the national recreation lakes initiative with other federal recreation assistance efforts, including the Wallop-Breaux program for boating and fishing. 
   Mr. President, let me give you a little background on how this legislation was developed. In 1996, the U.S. Senate recognized that recreation was becoming more important on federal lakes and conceived the National Recreation Lakes Study Commission to review the current and anticipated demand for recreational opportunities on federally managed lakes and reservoirs. The National Recreation Lakes Study Commission was charged to ``review the current and anticipated demand for recreational opportunities at federally-managed man-made lakes and reservoirs'' and ``to develop alternatives for enhanced recreational use of such facilities.'' 
   The Commission released its long-awaited report confirming the impact of recreation on federally-managed, man-made lakes in June of last year. The Commission also recognized that we are far from realizing their full potential. The study documented that these lakes are powerful tourist magnets, attracting some 900 million visitors annually and generating an estimated $44 billion in economic activity--mostly spent on privately-provided goods and services. 
   During the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's hearing last year  on the Recreation Lakes Study, the Chairman and I spent some time discussing how children today do not take full advantage of the outdoor opportunities that are available to them. It is so important that we encourage our children to enjoy the great outdoors that often times is less than an hour's drive away. 
   As the mother of twin 4-year-old boys, I feel we need to encourage our children to be children, not to become adults too quickly, to learn how to enjoy the outdoors. The only way we can do that is by exposing them to it early and often. 
   In this nation we have nearly 1,800 federally-managed lakes and reservoirs. There are 38 in my home state of Arkansas. With so many federal lakes spread throughout the country, there's no reason why we shouldn't do all we can to promote recreation on our federal lakes. I know that in Arkansas, we don't think twice about getting away to the lake for the weekend to go boating or fishing, or to just get away from the day-to-day grind. And that doesn't even begin to get into the tremendous economic impact from recreation on our federal lakes. 
   Mr. President, this bill is not an attempt to completely rewrite how federal lakes in this country are managed or to put recreation in front of all other authorized purposes at federal lakes. 
   The Recreation Lakes Act of 2000 will work with all current laws and regulations to ensure that recreation is merely given a seat at the table when the management decisions are made for our federal lakes. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill. In everything from the creation of jobs to the money that tourists like myself spend at the marinas and local stores surrounding the lake--our Federal lakes and reservoirs have an immense recreational value that can and does bring revenues into our local economies. The best way to encourage and expand this aspect is to ensure that recreation is given a higher priority in the management of our federal lakes. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to the debate on how we can promote recreation on our federal lakes.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as a strong advocate for Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, I feel a personal responsibility to ensure that American companies benefit from this continuing trade relationship. I believe most of my Senate colleagues feel the same way. I am confident there will be many success stories, but there are also valuable lessons to be learned from watching U.S. companies that have tried to do business thus far. 
   Panda Energy International is one such company. Panda is currently building a substantial gas-powered generator in Union County, Arkansas, and I have been personally briefed by Panda's officials about their difficulties in China. Panda spent six years developing a power project near Tangshan in Hebei Province. It signed a contract to sell all of the output from the project to the North China Power Group--an arm of the national utility--at a price to be determined by a formula. Armed with this contract, Panda borrowed $155 million needed to construct the project through a public bond offering in the U.S. capital markets. Construction for the project got underway in 1997. The project was completed late last year, and has been in limbo since that time. 
   The project cannot sell power without formal approval of a tariff, or price for its electricity, by the Tangshan municipal pricing bureau. The Tangshan pricing bureau has been reluctant to assign a tariff that would then set in motion the need to buy additional electricity for the region  where demand has recently diminished. At the same time, Panda Energy is in a perilous bind, because it had to mortgage all of its existing power plants--two in the United States and one in Nepal--as security to guarantee the U.S. bond holders they would be repaid their loans. The company is on the verge of defaulting on the loans.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I came to the floor earlier this week to express  my strong support for passage of the permanent normal trade relations legislation currently before the Senate. During the course of debate on this issue we have heard several points of view and have considered several amendments to the underlying legislation. 
   I would like to be abundantly clear for the RECORD that I am joining several of my colleagues that support passage of PNTR by voting against all amendments to this vital legislation. This does not mean that I do not support some of the amendments and initiatives that have been presented before this body. It is unfortunate that our time in the Senate has not been managed in a way that provides us with the adequate time to appropriately debate and amend a vital piece of legislation without running the risk of its complete demise. 
   I, along with many others, have been calling for Congress to take up and pass PNTR legislation since February of this year. We are nearing the end of this legislative session and, unfortunately, time is a precious commodity. We have a backlog of appropriations bills that must be completed prior to October 1st and any successful amendments to this bill could force a conference committee that would further stall and likely doom passage of this essential legislation. 
   Several of my colleagues have submitted a letter from over 60 agricultural related associations and corporations. I, too, received this letter and the same sentiment has been expressed to me by countless companies and associations, including Federal Express, Wal-Mart, United Parcel Service, Microsoft, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and many, many more industries concerned with expanding our market opportunities. In addition, I have heard from many of my constituents in Arkansas including rice farmers, wheat farmers, pork producers, soybean growers, and various other industries from across my State. All of them have urged the Senate to pass PNTR as soon as possible. 
   Many of us have worked to keep this bill clean in order to guarantee its passage and expedite its signature by the President. I am proud that we have achieved this goal, and I am proud that we are now positioned to take advantage of China's continually growing markets. I have no illusions about the rigid, Communist regime of China and I, along with others, want nothing less than to improve the quality of life for citizens of China. I know, however, that the surest way to encourage internal reforms is to open this country to western influence, private enterprise, and the opportunities that come with good old American capitalism.

They both commented on the 83-year-olds and the 84-year-olds. I think I have them beat. My husband's grandmother will turn 103 on the last day of this month. 
   So the issues for the elderly in Arkansas are extremely important to us, a No. 1 priority, and something I hope we will address in the context of a prescription drug piece for the elderly, as well as reauthorizing the Older Americans Act, not to mention the importance of solidifying and preserving Social Security and Medicare.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, am here to speak on the issue of permanent normal trade relations with China. 
   In order to be successful in today's global economy, every industry must market its products overseas. And in order for the United States to continue the unprecedented economic growth we have seen during the last few years, we must adopt policies that open international markets for farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and service industries. 
   On November 15 of last year, our Government successfully negotiated an  historic trade agreement with the People's Republic of China that will bring China into the World Trade Organization. The potential impact of this arrangement cannot be overstated. China is home to one-fifth of the world's population and is growing by 7 percent each year. Access to China's enormous population will help sustain American economic growth. 
   But before the United States and Arkansas can reap the full benefits of this agreement, Congress must vote to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status. The WTO requires that its members extend normal trade relations to all other members. 
   There is a lot at stake depending on whether or not the United States grants PNTR to China. Since February, I have been urging the Senate leadership to bring this issue up for a vote as soon as possible. I had hoped that we would approve this legislation prior to the August recess, but nevertheless, I am anxious to finish work on this bill as soon as possible and get it on the President's desk for signature. There are so many things at stake. We must not lose this opportunity. 
   China will join the WTO regardless of the congressional decision on PNTR, so a decision to deny this new status to China will only give China license to keep its markets closed to U.S. services and agriculture, and to keep its high tariffs in place on U.S. goods and services while opening it up to all other WTO members. 
   All sectors of our economy, especially agriculture, will benefit from increased trade with China. Likewise, all sectors of our economy will suffer if we don't trade with China. Chinese accession into the WTO could mean $2 billion more a year in national agricultural exports to China by the year 2005. 
   On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will drop from an average of 31 percent to 14 percent. China will also expand access for bulk agricultural products, permit private trade in these products, and eliminate export subsidies. In my home State of Arkansas, rice, poultry, soybean and cotton producers will stand to reap enormous benefits from opening markets with China, including lower tariffs and increased trade. For instance, under its WTO accession agreement, China will cut tariffs on rice to 1 percent. Also, China is already the second leading market for U.S. poultry exports. If Congress approves PNTR status, it will cut tariffs in half from 20 percent to 10 percent by the year 2004 for frozen poultry cuts. 
   In addition to the agricultural changes, China's tariffs on American industrial goods will fall from an average of about 25 percent to less than 10 percent within 5 years. Industries including telecommunications, banking, insurance, reinsurance, and pensions will all gain expanded market access. In information technology, tariffs on products such as computers, semiconductors and all Internet-related equipment will decrease from an average of 13 percent to zero by the year 2005. 
   In exchange, the U.S. gives up nothing; our trade policies remain the same. The economic reasons make so much sense and are themselves a very powerful reason for passage of PNTR. 
   But the opportunity we have as a nation to make an impact on the humanity of China only exists if we are engaged with the country and its people. We cannot build a relationship that is effective if we turn our backs on China and isolate them. 
   Is China a perfect country? No. 
   I too share the concerns about human rights abuses in China and believe that a greater international presence in the country, fostered by free trade, will help to improve the lives of Chinese workers and citizens. WTO membership will strengthen the forces of reform inside China by exposing the Chinese to better paying jobs, and higher labor and environmental standards. 
   Finally, permanent normal trade relations with China will force the Chinese to play by the rules in the international marketplace. 
   Only under this agreement with their accession into the WTO will we have the proper recourse to be able to question their practices. 
   The WTO's dispute settlement system will force China to explain its actions if other member countries question them. In addition, the WTO's trade policy review mechanism will allow all other members to review a country's entire trade system. This type of scrutiny of China is virtually unprecedented in history. 
   If we do not approve PNTR status for China, the missed opportunities will be tremendous, not to mention the devastation it could have on our strong economy today. Our producers and industries will not be in a position to openly access the 1.3 billion people who live in China. The United States will not have the ability to challenge China's trade practices or demand better human rights practices. In short, the United States stands to gain enormously if we grant PNTR status to China, and we stand to lose enormously if we do not. 
   Certainly once China does enter the WTO, there will still be many challenges ahead for all of us, but congressional approval of PNTR for China is a critical first step. It means so much to this Nation and to my home State of Arkansas. We must take this first step in passage of a good, clean PNTR bill in the Senate. Having China in the WTO is a good deal for Arkansas and a good deal for this Nation. 
   I encourage my colleagues to approve the House-passed bill granting permanent normal trading relations with China--soon, not later--and that we send it to the President to be confirmed so we can continue building a relationship which will benefit both countries. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a noble Southern gentleman, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. All of us in the Senate were saddened by the sudden loss of such a fine man, and we will sorely miss him. As a relative newcomer to the Senate, I have spent a great deal of my time on the Senate floor observing my colleagues. You can tell a lot about a person by his demeanor, and I first grew to  like PAUL COVERDELL simply by watching him. He wore a cloak of peacefulness around him and he radiated kindness. It was rare to see him without a smile. 
   When I began working with him on the ``Small Watershed Dams Rehabilitation'' bill, I realized that my first impressions of him had been accurate. He was, indeed, kind and friendly. It was a pleasure to work with him in a bipartisan manner on an issue that is vital to both of our states. As is obvious by his rise within the leadership of the Republican Party, he was extremely loyal to his Party. But he never let partisanship interfere with his relationships in the Senate. In short, he was a statesman in every sense of the word. 
   To his wife, Nancy, and the rest of his family, I extend my sincere condolences. Public life is not an easy one, and our country's greatest leaders can be identified by the support system that is their family. Thank you, Nancy, for sharing PAUL with the rest of us.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment which prevents funds from being used for the application of unapproved pesticides in areas that may be used by children and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with EPA to ensure that pest control methods do not lead to unacceptable exposure to children. 
   We updated the safety standards for pesticides, with specific safety factors for children, in 1996. 
   This amendment allows EPA to do its job. The Boxer amendment seeks to regulate pest control products from the Senate floor, thereby ignoring the scientific tests EPA requires for pesticide registrations. 
   I urge Members to support the Bond second-degree amendment and to let EPA do its job of regulating and ensuring safety for all of us, including our children.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished gentlemen from Washington and West Virginia for their leadership in shepherding this bill through Committee and to the floor. I recognize that the Committee was faced with requests that went far beyond the Committee's budget, and I commend the leaders for successfully balancing the myriad of requests with which they were presented. 
   I want to bring to my colleagues' attention one particular program that I believe is worthy of additional funding in Conference. Would the Senator from West Virginia agree that encouraging the forest and paper products industry to achieve greater energy efficiency is a worthy goal?

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Since we agree with that goal, I am sure the Senator shares my support for a program within the Department of Energy that will encourage the forest and paper products industry to utilize resources that are readily available on site to produce energy. By utilizing wood and bark residues and spent pulping liquor in a process called black liquor gasification, the industry could potentially improve on site electricity generation by 300%-400% over existing cogeneration systems. Given these benefits, would the Senator agree that increasing funding for the black liquor gasification program should be pursued in Conference?

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, with the passage of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, I want to talk about an important issue to all of my constituents in Arkansas and to private property owners across this country. I thank the appropriators for including language in the bill that will prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating or implementing its proposed Total Maximum Daily Load regulations. 
   In issuing its August 1999 Total Maximum Daily Load regulation, the EPA overstepped its congressionally mandated authority. Congress authorized the EPA to regulate point sources and left it up to the states to regulate non-point sources and develop and implement TMDL plans. In its proposed TMDL regulation, the EPA granted itself authority to regulate these specific items and clearly overstepped its regulatory authority. These changes, while seemingly innocuous, represent a major shift in Clean Water Act authority from the States to the Federal Government at the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency. Congress has the authority to set clean water laws of this country, not the EPA. 
   I reiterate something I have been saying as often as anyone will listen--these new regulations can easily be summed up in two words--unreasonable and unnecessary. 
   I understand some of my distinguished colleagues' objections to what seems like legislating on an appropriations bill, but I want to let my colleagues know that I have attempted to use all other avenues to fix this regulation. I completely agree with the EPA's objective of cleaning up our Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams, but firmly believe that this regulation oversteps congressional mandated authority and intent for the implementation of the Clean Water Act. 
   I assure my colleagues that I have done all that I could to encourage the EPA to back down before we got to this point. I have personally met with the President. I have personally met with EPA Administrator Carol Browner. I have introduced legislation to reassert congressional intent regarding the Clean Water Act. My colleagues and I have held ten congressional Committee hearings, introduced six pieces of legislation on this matter, and held over 20 public meetings around the country that were attended by thousands of property owners. 
   In Arkansas alone, we have held three public meetings and two congressional field hearings. In El Dorado over 1,000 attended; in Texarkana over 4,000 attended; in Fayetteville over 2,000 attended; and over 1,000 attended in Hot Springs and in Lonoke to learn how this new TMDL regulation would affect their private property and to protest the reach of the EPA into traditional non-point source activities. 
   We have attempted all available avenues to right this wrong. It was never congressional intent for the EPA to regulate non-point sources or to interfere with States' implementation of TMDLs on its rivers, lakes, and streams. 
   After all of our efforts to curb this regulation and bring it back into line with congressional intent have failed, we have been left with no other recourse but to restrict the EPA's funding for this TMDL regulation. 
   This emergency supplemental appropriations bill is a good bill, and it rightly delays implementation of any new, unnecessary and unreasonable EPA regulations until Congress and the States have adequate time to address this issue properly and completely. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, join my colleague, Senator LANDRIEU, in applauding what our colleague from Ohio, Senator VOINOVICH, was doing previously in bringing up the importance of not only the program of IDEA but also the importance for us to be able to make good on commitments we have made, things we have asked our States and our localities to do and yet have not provided them the resources to do them. 
   This is just one of those requests. When we look at the targeted grants for the title I dollars, it is a program that was authorized over 6 years ago and never has been funded. That is all the Senator from Louisiana is asking--that we make good on our obligation that came about several years ago to target those dollars to the neediest of children across this Nation. 
   And to our colleague, Senator GRAMM from Texas, who mentioned that one of the most important things we need to do in this debate is to set priorities, I say: Exactly. Let's set the priorities of educating our children and understanding that we are only as strong as our weakest link, and that devoting the resources we have obligated long ago to the neediest of children should be done. 
   So I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, which would provide a modest increase in title I funding and target those additional resources to the neediest public schools. As I have said on many occasions, I believe strongly that we need to increase the Federal investment in public education to ensure that all students have access to quality education. But spending more money to help educators meet higher standards is 
   only one part of that solution. We also have to ensure that Federal dollars are spent responsibly and that we allocate those resources where we can make a real difference. 
   Right now, in those title I funds, there are three categories. These targeted grants don't receive any of that funding. Eighty-five percent goes to basic grants and 15 percent goes to concentration grants. Statistics consistently demonstrate that, on average, children who attend schools with a high concentration of low-income students lag behind students from more affluent areas. This is certainly true in Arkansas, where students in the delta region score lower on academic achievement tests than students in our more prosperous regions of the State.  
   To me, these statistics are a clear indication that title I, which again was created to aid the education of disadvantaged children, isn't working as well as it should. We have diluted our title I program funds to so many different areas, until they have become less effective in the areas where they are supposed to be directed--to the disadvantaged. 
   Congress recognized that problem back in 1994 when it created those targeted grants for title I dollars. In the most recent ESEA Reauthorization Act, unlike basic and concentrated grants, targeted grants are designed so that school districts with a high percentage of low-income students receive a greater share of title I funding. 
   I think we were on to something, but unbelievably these targeted grants have never been funded. 
   This is unfortunate because these are the kids who need the Federal assistance the most, and it is where we could do the most good. Income status alone doesn't determine student achievement. It is the concentration of economically disadvantaged students in a school that makes the most difference. 
   After visiting dozens of schools and talking with hundreds of parents in my home State, I am convinced that we have to change our approach if we want to maintain public confidence and support for a strong role in education at the Federal level. In addition to more targeted funding, we need tough accountability standards to ensure students are learning core academic subjects, and more flexibility at the local level to allow school districts to meet their most pressing needs. Ultimately, we have to account for the money we spend in Washington and show our constituents results to sustain their support. 
   I also call on my colleagues to support an amendment Senator LIEBERMAN will be offering later which will address this issue. It calls for a comprehensive GAO study of targeting under title I. At the very least, I believe we have a responsibility to take a good, hard look at the current system because the status quo isn't good enough. 
   This amendment is an important step in the right direction. I applaud my colleague from Louisiana for the courage to stand up for what is right. Maybe it is not the most popular, but it is right. 
   I urge support for this proposal. This may not be a political issue, and this certainly may not be the most popular issue with those in this body who want to keep the status quo, but it is the right issue. It is the right decision to make, and it is the right amendment to support. If nothing else, this body should support this amendment on behalf of the neediest children in this Nation. 
   I applaud my colleague's courage, and I appreciate her leadership in this effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, commend my colleague from Virginia, Senator ROBB, for his wonderful leadership on this issue. My colleagues have already spoken eloquently about the need for prescription drug coverage among seniors and, certainly, the basic components of this amendment. I won't reiterate what they have said. We, as a body, must make this a priority, and we have not. I think this amendment is timely because the House is scheduled to act on it today. It is quickly becoming a crisis issue for many seniors in the country today, and that is why I am here as a supporter of a bipartisan plan in the Senate. 
   As a Senator who represents the State with the highest poverty rate among seniors, I am committed to seeing that the Senate act this year to implement a prescription drug plan. With all due respect to the chairman's comments in terms of timeliness and what must go through committee, the bottom line is that we are running out of time to do something on this issue. 
   This plan will provide immediate, affordable, and comprehensive drug coverage to seniors who often have to make the choice between buying food to eat or buying the prescription drugs they need. I want to emphasize the importance of the Medicare outpatient drug plan to rural seniors. In particular, this plan helps all seniors, particularly those who are low-income and living in rural areas. This is important because low-income and rural seniors  are less likely to have adequate 
   prescription drug coverage. Nationally, rural seniors are 60 percent more likely not to be able to buy needed prescription drugs due to their high cost. A greater proportion of rural elderly spend a large percentage of their income on prescription drugs. Rural beneficiaries need adequate coverage because they are more likely to have poor health and lower income than seniors living in urban areas. In Arkansas, 60 percent of the State's seniors live in rural areas. 
   This is a good prescription drug proposal. It is a fiscally sound proposal that offers free coverage to our Nation's poorest seniors and reasonable benefits to those who can better afford to pay for some of their benefits. Our seniors deserve to enjoy healthier, longer lives without having to worry about affording the medicine they need. The Senate must act this year and this is an excellent time to do it. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to call attention to the needs of our Nation's seniors. Although Social Security, Medicare reform and prescription drugs make daily headlines in newspapers across the country and are the topic of Congressional and Presidential debates, there are two other important programs for seniors which do not receive the media attention they deserve. These two programs are the Older Americans Act and the Social Services Block Grant. 
   As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and a Senator representing the State with the highest poverty rate among seniors, I want to reinforce to my colleagues in the Senate the importance of these two programs, which are lifelines to low-income, homebound and frail seniors. 
   First, we need to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. It is our country's main vehicle for providing a wide range of social services and nutrition programs to older men and women. Unfortunately, the Older Americans Act has not been reauthorized since 1995--absolutely inexcusable--making this the sixth year without a reauthorization of such a vital program for our Nation's senior. Because this year marks the 35th anniversary of the Older Americans Act, Congress has a unique and timely opportunity to improve the Older Americans Act. 
   If we don't act, we will be sending the wrong message to our Nation's seniors. We would be telling them that they are not a priority in this Nation. This is absolutely the wrong message to be sending to those who helped create this incredible prosperity in our Nation. I say to my colleagues, we can do better. We must do better. 
   The South not only has some of the highest poverty rates among seniors, but the South is the home of the majority of seniors in the country. Here are some statistics that might surprise you: Florida, West Virginia and Arkansas rank among the top five States nationally with the highest percentage of seniors over the age of 55; through 2020, the South will see an 81 percent increase in its population of persons age 65 to 84 years of age; and for people age 85 and over, that increase in the South will be 134 percent--phenomenal in terms of what we will see in the South with elderly individuals dependent on programs that the Older Americans Act provides--and over half of all elderly African Americans live in the South. 
   Based on these compelling statistics and the pending ``age wave'' that is coming to the South, the time to act is now. We must update the formula used to calculate Older Americans Act funds so Southern states receive their fair share of the funds. Currently, 85 percent of Older Americans Act funds are distributed to States based on 1985 numbers. This is neither fair to southern States nor is it good public policy to be using such outdated information. Without a formula update, States like Arkansas, and other southern States, with greater numbers of seniors will continue to be expected to do too much with absolutely too little. 
   Each year Title III funding provides seniors around the country with hot, nutritious meals in senior centers and other congregate settings. In addition, millions of meals are delivered each year to homebound men and women who rely on this program not only for nutrition, but for companionship and human contact which volunteers provide when they visit the person each day. I have made those rounds with constituents, delivering meals on wheels to our seniors in rural areas. It means so much to have someone bring a nutritous meal and to visit. 
   For many seniors, the only human contact they have each day is with the person who delivers their meals. During extreme weather conditions, home-delivered meal volunteers are able to check on seniors and make sure they are not ill or suffering from extreme heat or cold. 
   In Arkansas, we deliver 2 million home meals a year to the elderly and provide another 2 million congregate meals. However, many seniors are still unable to receive meals. About 1,300 frail, homebound elderly men and women are on waiting lists for home-delivered meals. This number only represents a fraction of low-income seniors who need meals but can't get them, because those living in rural areas that are not served by programs like Meals on Wheels are not counted for waiting lists. 
   Here is a story which was sent to me by an Area Agency on Aging caseworker from Fulton County, AR. She writes about a couple by the name of John and Reba.  
   John and Reba live in a mobile home near Salem, Arkansas. They started receiving home delivered meals in October 1999. Both of them are physically handicapped and are barely able to get around. John is on oxygen and has severe heart problems. Reba has heart problems and arthritis. 
   At the time they began receiving meals they were physically and financially burdened and didn't know how they would buy  food for the next meal. Reba said getting the meals had relieved them from a great burden. She said they can hardly wait each day to get their meals. They really look forward to seeing the volunteer and the van coming to their trailer.  
   Here is another story about an Arkansas senior. Mr. Black is 71 years old and lives alone in an old farmhouse in an isolated, rural area in Van Buren County. In the winter you can feel the wind blow through the house and in the summer the heat is unbearable. Mr. Black does not have any immediate family to check on him. He only has a microwave to cook in. He lives on a fixed income and has no transportation to get into town to purchase groceries on a regular basis. 
   Mr. Black said this about the home delivered meals he receives, ``They help me out a lot. The meals are better than the food I can buy. I can't buy much on a fixed income.'' Mr. Black has told his case manager on more than one occasion that he does not know what he would do without the meals. It is a real hardship on him if he misses his home delivered meals. One week he missed all of his home delivered meals because of doctors appointments and it was very difficult for him to buy food and prepare meals that week. He just went without. 
   The Title V senior employment program is one of the best kept secrets in the country. Through this funding mechanism, older Americans who want to work can go to a senior employment agency in their community and learn of available job opportunities. 
   No matter what type of training seniors need to fill these jobs, training is made available to them. For example, if seniors need training to work in a modern office environment, they learn how to surf the internet, use computers and send faxes. Nationally, over 61,000 seniors a year are employed through senior programs. 
   Some of Arkansas's finest employment programs for seniors are operated by Green Thumb and other outstanding Area Agencies on Aging. I have met many older workers and listened to them talk with enthusiasm about their jobs. I only hope that when I'm 75, 80, or 85 I will have half of their energy and zest for life! 
   The senior employment program is a win-win proposition for both sides. Low-income seniors who need additional income to supplement their Social Security checks have an opportunity to find a job placement and any necessary training through a Title V contractor. This not only generates additional income for seniors but a sense of purpose and a chance to stay engaged in their community and make a contribution--something we all want to feel, and that is needed. 
   The community and employers benefit by hiring honest, loyal and dependable persons who are committed to showing up for work every day and doing a good job. Especially in booming economic times when the job market is tight, seniors can fill jobs that employers otherwise might not be able to fill. The senior employment program makes good economic sense. It also provides for the workers: the quality and guidance of seniors who exemplify a tremendous work ethic and bring a lot to the workplace. 
   Here is a remarkable story of a woman from Texarkana, AR, whose life was transformed by the Green Thumb program. Olla Mae Germany came to the Green Thumb program at the age of 65. She had been a victim of domestic violence. She had never worked, could barely read and had walked to the interview. She told the coordinator that she was ``dumb, stupid, ugly, ignorant, and no one cared about her.'' During that meeting she also shared her hopes for the future--she wanted to learn to read, achieve a GED, gain clerical and computer skills, and get a job. 
   Ms. Germany was assigned to the Literacy Council in Texarkana. Her job entailed clerical duties and literacy training. After receiving her first pay check, Ms. Germany told her boss that she bought a new outfit for work and had her hair styled professionally for the first time in her life. She was especially pleased that the people in her office noticed her appearance and told her she looked pretty. With increased self-esteem she became more confident in her abilities. Only 24 weeks after her Green Thumb enrollment, Ms. Germany learned to read and significantly improved her office skills. She began making public speeches on behalf of the local literacy council. 
   Today, Ms. Germany continues to work toward self-sufficiency. She has a new job with a Texarkana agency that promotes neighborhood revitalization and economic development. She is learning new technology skills. She is also studying for her GED. Recently, Ms. Germany was able to buy her very first car, thanks to the money she has earned from her jobs. With new marketable skills, a confident self-image and dependable transportation, Ms. Germany is well on her way toward achieving her goals for a brighter future and making a contribution to her community. 
   I know Democrats and Republicans on the Special Committee on Aging disagree over the allocation of Title V monies. I think groups like Green Thumb have proven their ability to train and place older workers successfully in the community and I urge my colleagues to allow the national Title V grantees to continue receiving a majority of Title V funds. 
   The reauthorization of the Older Americans Act will also include a new authorization for the National Family Caregivers Act. I am an original cosponsor of this bill in the Senate because I believe that our country needs to find a better way to support family members who serve as caregivers. No one wants to leave their home just because they are aging and/or disabled. The inclusion of a National Family Caregivers Act is foreward thinking and family friendly. Baby boomers need support to care for their family members and it is high time that we provide Federal leadership in this area of home care. 
   Finally, the other program I will focus on is the Social Services Block Grant, better known by its acronym SSBG. States use SSBG funds to support programs for both at-risk children and seniors. In Arkansas, a significant portion of SSBG funds are used to support and operate senior centers, to provide Meals on Wheels for frail, homebound elderly, and to provide transportation for seniors, especially those living in rural areas. 
   Over the past five years, Congress has cut SSBG funds by $1 billion.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. This year alone, the Senate Labor-HHS Subcommittee on Appropriations cut SSBG by $1.1 billion. This translates into a cut of nearly two-thirds. 
   Arkansas will lose over $11 million in FY 2001. This draconian cut comes on the heels of a $134 million cut in FY 2000 in which Arkansas lost $1.3 million. 
   What does this dramatic funding loss mean to senior services in my home state? Because Arkansas spends a majority of its SSBG funds on senior services, 40 senior centers around the state may have to shut down or dramatically reduce operating hours. In addition to providing social activities and hot, nutritious meals to seniors, senior centers also provide seniors with rides to the doctor's office, the pharmacy and grocery stores. As one Area Agency on Aging administrator in Malvern, Arkansas wrote to me, ``for many of our seniors, the senior center is their lifeline. It provides them with a reason to get up in the morning.'' 
   I would like to read to you what a social services case manager sent me about an aging client in northwest Arkansas.  
   When Delbert was in his early 50's he suffered a stroke that left him with paralysis on the left side and confined to a wheelchair. He has no children and his only family support comes from a sister and brother-in-law in Atlanta, Georgia. They help him with money management. Case managers and case workers with the Area Agency on Aging helped him find a personal care assistant on a temporary basis through the state's Supplemental Personal Care Program.  
   In the meantime, Delbert applied for and awaited approval from the Alternatives Program for Adults with Physical Disabilities, a state Medicaid program. Once approval came, he received funding and assistance in having his bathroom retrofitted to be handicapped accessible. 
   He was also provided with personal care and housekeeping assistance. Delbert also began to receive home delivered meals. Last October, Delbert celebrated his 65th birthday. Because he was confined to a wheelchair and very isolated and lonely, his doctor prescribed socialization and exercise to combat his depression. Now, every Tuesday and Thursday Delbert rides in a handicap accessible van to the Benton County Senior Services Center where he participates in an exercise program. 
   He now enjoys his newfound friends and enjoys games and other activities at the senior center. Thanks to these aging and disability support services, Delbert lives with dignity and independence. Without this assistance he would, no doubt, have spent the past few years in a long-term care facility at enormous cost to the public.  
   If SSBG gets cut severely this year, millions of Meals on Wheels to homebound seniors may not be delivered next year to people who rely on them. States are already scaling back congregate and home delivered meal programs because of last year's Federal funding cuts. Although Congress increased Older Americans Act funds for home delivered meals by 31% last year, it simultaneously cut the Social Services Block Grant and the USDA Nutrition Program for the Elderly, which resulted in a net loss of $300,000 in Federal funds to Arkansas. Unless we act, this year's cuts will be even greater. 
   To put the cost of home delivered meals in perspective, the cost of providing home delivered meals to a senior for one year costs about as much as one day's stay in the hospital for one person. I don't know about you, but I think that is pretty affordable. 
   The irony of the situation is that these draconian cuts to SSBG come at a time when our budget is experiencing unprecedented surpluses. That is why I respectfully disagree with some of my colleagues who support these crippling SSBG funding cuts. They argue that Governors can offset these cuts with tobacco settlement money or TANF funds, but I think this is unrealistic. Governors are spending most of their tobacco settlement funds on health related initiatives and smoking prevention programs. 
   I supported an amendment during last year's Labor/HHS/Education appropriations process to restore funding to the SSBG, although it did not pass. Recently I cosponsored legislation by Senators GRAHAM and JEFFORDS to restore SSBG funding. When I was in the House of Representatives and voted for welfare reform, an agreement was made between Congress and the states to decrease SSBG from $2.8 billion to $2.4 billion until welfare reform was firmly established. In FY 03, Congress was to restore funding to the $2.8 billion level. Clearly, Congress has not operated in good faith in honoring this agreement. 
   I believe that the Older Americans Act and the Social Services Block Grant are vital safety nets for our nation's seniors. I hope the Senate will do the right thing by passing a pro-senior Older Americans Act and restore funds to the Social Services Block Grant. 
   I don't know about my colleagues, but I do know there is not a day that goes by that I don't think of the contribution of an elderly person in my life. 
   I would like to close by reading a quote by Senator Hubert Humphrey that you may be familiar with:  
   It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy and the disabled.  
   I think we have a wonderful opportunity to help the young, the old, the sick, the needy and the disabled by restoring the cuts to the Social Services Block Grant and reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. 
   Let's get to work!

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and to recognize a fellow Arkansan, Blake Rutherford, for his accomplishments at Middlebury College in Vermont. Blake is a native of Little Rock, attended Little Rock Central High School, and will be graduating from Middlebury College with a degree in Political Science in August 2000. This fine young man is the first student ever chosen at Middlebury College to give the Student Commencement Address. This is a well deserved honor for Blake Rutherford and I whole heartily congratulate him on his achievements. I ask that the text of his speech be included following my remarks. 
   Blake Rutherford's Commencement Speech 
   Today, we are fortunate to experience one of the great accomplishments in life. Like thousands throughout America, we are gathered at the beginning of a new millennium, a unique time in our nation and in our world. But unlike thousands we have come together in a very special place-nestled between the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains--a place where we worked hard, played hard, made lifelong friends, and have spent some of the best years of our lives. Paraphrasing the legendary Bob Hope, ``Middlebury: Thanks for the Memories.'' 
   I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Class of 2000--individually and collectively--for your achievements. I also want to thank the Board of Trustees, the administration, faculty, and staff for providing us the very best. And I especially want to thank our parents and families for paying for it. 
   At our centennial celebration one hundred years ago, the Middlebury Register characterized it as the ``day of days for the undergraduate.'' Today, a century later, is most certainly our day of days and one that we will celebrate and remember forever with great pride, for as Emerson noted, ``The reward of a thing well done, is to have done it.'' 
   Middlebury College began in 1800 under the direction of President Jeremiah Atwater in a small building with only seven students. As we see almost 200 hundred years later, more than 2000 students larger, under the direction of President John McCardell, much has changed. 
   Built for only $8,000, Painter Hall, constructed between 1814 and 1816, is currently the oldest building on campus. Although it stands the same today, the environment and the atmosphere around it do not. 
   Admittance into Middlebury in 1815 used to consist of a forty-minute oral examination in Latin, Greek and arithmetic. Remembering back four years ago, I could only wish the process was as simple. 
   But today, thanks to the efforts of many, Middlebury is blessed with a stronger, more diverse student body than it has ever had. 
   We have seen the number of applicants to Middlebury grow steadily over the past four years. 
   We have seen the number of minorities on campus grow over the past four years.  
   Most importantly, we have seen Middlebury's reputation grow and spread all over the United States and to dozens of countries across the world. 
   Our accomplishment and our experiences have taught us a lot about ourselves and about Middlebury College. As we strive to promote a more diverse environment, we find ourselves struggling to come to terms with many difficult questions and issues. In answering these, let us turn to the lessons taught to us by three prominent Middlebury graduates. 
   Roswell Field graduated from Middlebury College in 1822. Upon his departure from the College, he became a lawyer, and is most famous for arguing to the Supreme Court on behalf of a slave named Dred Scott. Although the Court did not rule in his favor, his case has taught us that intolerance and bigotry cannot and should not be permitted against any group, at any level. 
   Alexander Twilight received his Middlebruy diploma in 1823, and in turn became the first African-American to receive a college degree. Today, several minority students will walk across this stage as members of the class of 2000. No doubt, Mr. Twilight would be encouraged. 
   Ron Brown graduated from Middlebury in 1962. Upon his arrival here, which at the time was almost all white, one campus fraternity objected, saying they only permitted ``White, Christian'' members, Brown and other members of his fraternity chose to fight. In time our local chapter was expelled, but because of his efforts, Middlebury, more importantly, made it college policy that no exclusionary chapters would exist on campus. 
   Ron Brown had an exemplary professional career serving as Secretary of Commerce until his death in a tragic plane crash in 1996. Jesse Jackson once said of him, ``He learned to be a bridge between the cultures.'' I hope we all can remember that lesson here today. A lesson, no doubt, Ron Brown learned at Middlebury College. 
   We've come a long way since these individuals were here, but we still have a long way to go. 
   I am a son of the South. I came a far distance to go to school here. Acceptance to Middlebury was my own impossible dream. 
   I graduated from Little Rock Central High School where 43 years ago nine African-American students were denied admittance prompting a constitutional crisis our nation had not seen since the Civil War. 
   While much progress has been made, today in parts of the Mississippi Delta region of our own country--just a couple of hours from my home--there is poverty at its very worst. 
   Several years ago the late Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois was speaking at a ceremony at the Gettysburg Battlefield where he said, ``Men died here and men are sleeping here who fought under a July sun that the nation might endure: united, free, tolerant, and devoted to equality. The task was unfinished. It is never quite finished.'' 
   He was right. It is never quite finished. 
   With our Middlebury foundation, we're now going to embark on a world full of many wonderful opportunities and also of many grave problems. If we can remember two important lessons, our lives and certainly our world will be a much better place. First, the future can always be better than the present. And second, we have a responsibility to ensure that that is the case. It is a responsibility we have to ourselves, to our communities, to Middlebury and most importantly to those who are not as fortunate to be here, among us, today. 
   This afternoon we leave Middlebury with a greater knowledge of various academic fields, the world and ourselves. We also leave Middlebury young and energetic, bound closer to one another more than we probably ever will be through our friendships, our relationships, and our experiences. And with that we now have the opportunity to help and serve others. 
   Robert Kennedy said, ``This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite of adventure over the love of ease.'' 
   Today, we make history as the first graduating class of Middlebury's third century. It is an accomplishment that I'm sure makes our families, our friends, and those close and important to us very proud as well. So let us always remember this day, May 21, 2000 as our day of days--our historic day. And very soon will all embark on separate journeys and begin a new and exciting chapter in our lives. 
   In doing so, let us not forget the famous words of Tennyson who wrote, ``That which we are, we are, one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'' 
   And for the class of 2000, the world now awaits and the best is yet to be. 
   Good Luck and Congratulations.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Home Ownership Made Easy (HOME) Act, which will expand home ownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income, first-time home buyers. 
   Providing affordable, fair, and quality housing for all people is important. Home ownership is not only the American Dream, it also increases pride in community, schools, and safety. Too often, however, American workers who make too much money to qualify for public assistance and too little money to afford a home on their own are stuck in the middle. These families are stuck in substandard housing or in neighborhoods that are far from their jobs. Fortunately, in the early 1980's, Congress established the Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program, which allowed state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds to finance mortgages at below-market interest rates to first-time home buyers. Unfortunately, as sometimes happens in government programs, administrative barriers have rendered the program less effective in recent years. 
   The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have been unable to collect and maintain statistical data on average area purchase prices in all states. In Arkansas for instance, the MRB Program is based on an average area purchase price that was established in 1993. This means that, while housing prices are going up, the  threshhold for homeowners to qualify for an MRB loan has stayed the same. 
   The HOME Act reduces the administrative burden on the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It will allow state and local housing finance agencies to use a multiple of income limits, which are readily available and updated annually. Relying on already established MRB income requirements is a natural fit because families generally purchase homes within their income range. 
   The Mortgage Revenue Bond program is a state administered program that works. The HOME Act will continue to expand the MRB's track record and success. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in full in the RECORD.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, when President Kennedy announced a trade embargo on Cuba in 1961, the consensus in Washington was that stifling the Cuban economy would lead to internal unrest and ultimately depose the anti-American president, Fidel Castro. Since that time, Congress has tightened the screws on Cuba to include food and medicine in the embargo and to put pressure on other countries not to trade with Cuba. We have made it more difficult to lift the embargo by requiring a two-thirds vote by Congress and we have passed a law that says no government involving Fidel Castro or his brother will be acceptable to the U.S., even if they were chosen in Democratic elections. Through it all, our  main nemesis, Fidel Castro, has survived. In fact, he is strong as ever. To gain a better understanding of this issue, I recently led a group of Arkansas farmers to Havana to see firsthand the impact of our policy and the potential opportunities that exist should this policy be changed. I entered Havana focused on Cuba's potential as a new trade market for Arkansas agriculture producers. I left Havana with a new understanding of the embargo's effects on the people of Cuba. I returned from Cuba more confident than ever that the U.S. embargo on Cuba must be lifted. The three most compelling reasons for my stance on this issue are: (1) the fact that we should engage countries, not isolate them in order to move them forward and help them to gain potential; (2) the overall effect on the American economy that losing the trade with Cuba has had; and (3) the humanitarian impact on the Cuban people. 
   This was my first trip to Cuba and it was extremely worthwhile. I found the country and its people impressive and possessing great potential. The architecture in downtown Havana was charming, however, it struck me that someone had turned the lights out 40 years ago and no one has thought to flip the switch back on. The gorgeous architecture was crumbling along with the people. The physical decay of the cities, buildings, and infrastructure is readily apparent. This obvious economic and physical decline has not, however, led to an uprising of Cuban citizens demanding for a more democratic government based on capitalistic principles. It has been four decades since the embargo was enforced for political reasons. Times have clearly changed. The Soviet Union no longer aids Cuban efforts to challenge U.S. interests in Central America and elsewhere. The Soviet Union does not even exist. 
   The Cold War has been over for 10 years and the U.S. has normal trade relations with all of the countries of the former Eastern bloc. Yet we continue to ostracize Cuba. U.S. defense analysts even maintain that Cuba does not pose a security threat to our country at the turn of the century. Is Cuba an ideal nation? Absolutely not. But there are other countries that we trade with and maintain normal diplomatic relations with whose governments are not democratically elected; where full respect for internationally recognized human rights is lacking; where there is little or no tolerance for political dissent; or where private enterprise is largely illegal. 
   The first of these countries that comes to mind is China. Prior to the Memorial Day recess the House of Representatives voted to grant Permanent Normal Relations (PNTR) status to the Republic of China. The Senate will likely vote on this matter soon. On this separate but related issue let me be clear. I look forward to the China PNTR debate and urge my colleagues to join me in support of expanding our trading opportunities. I hope that we can pass PNTR with China as quickly as possible with no amendments so that President Clinton can sign this landmark legislation into law. As I have watched the China PNTR debate rage in Washington during recent weeks, I am struck by the common theme that we, as a nation, can influence a country's actions much more by engaging them in trade and communication than we ever could by ignoring and isolating them. 
   I've held to this belief for quite some time in regard to China as well as Cuba. China is the largest Communist country in the world. The U.S. has annually granted China its most-favored-nation status and will likely approve Permanent Normal Trade Relations in the coming months. Our treatment of Cuba should be no different. It is true that China has made various overtures and taken some positive steps as their acceptance into the WTO is being considered. China has allowed for a limited amount of private enterprise to exist. And recently, China purchased goods from the U.S. as a good faith gesture that they will live up to the commitments negotiated in the WTO accession agreement. Many who oppose trade with Cuba ask, ``Why are we not holding Cuba to the same standard? Why don't we require them to privatize certain business entities or purchase some commodities as a good faith gesture?'' The option to purchase U.S. goods is not available to Cuba, as it is to China, due to laws that we have passed in this very institution. Their hands are tied. 
   Yet Cuba is taking steps on its own regarding private industry. 
   Recent progress has been made in the form of joint ventures to facilitate the tourism industry in Cuba. For instance, the hotel we stayed in was a joint venture with the Dutch. Of course the government is still participating, but it is an example of private capital coming in from another source and affecting the people's way of life. The people working at those hotels receive tips from tourists that put them way above the daily wage of average Cubans. Steps made in these directions can only foster and plant positive seeds for change. We can also expect the rapidly and advancing technology of the Internet to help open doors to Cuba. Just as Chinese dissidents communicate today over the Internet in spite of attempts by the Communists to stop them, I can anticipate a day when the Cuban people do the same thing. 
   The farmers of Cuba are incapable of producing enough to sustain the 11 million inhabitants of the Caribbean island. Therefore, food must be imported. Our allies are already meeting that need and trading with Cuba. Rice is coming into Cuba from Asia, soybeans from Brazil, while our farmers endure some of the worst prices they have seen in decades. 
   We have put ourselves in a position where we are hurting our own economy and the backbone of our nation, the America farmer. By denying our farmers access to additional markets, like Cuba, we are ignoring a pledge that was made with the passage of the 1996 Farm Bill to open markets, the necessary markets our farmers need. Promises regarding enhanced trading opportunities and the free market abounded with passage of the so-called Freedom to Farm Act. Yet, the recently passed Caribbean/Africa Trade bill was the first trade bill Congress has passed in six years. We have failed to grant the President Fast Track Authority and essentially guaranteed the failure of our nation's farmers by granting them the ability to produce as much as they are capable while denying them access to sufficient markets to move their goods. For the American farmer the combination of this nation's Ag and foreign trade policies is a no-win situation. 
   For soybeans alone, opening up trade with Cuba could mean a $60 million market. In Arkansas, we could ship 400,000 tons of rice right down the Mississippi River, through the Gulf of Mexico to the Cuban people. Food products would be a phone call and a couple of days away. Instead, the Cuban people are left paying higher prices for a lower quality product that takes weeks, sometimes months, to arrive in their ports. 
   Rice is a staple of the Cuban diet and we know how to grow it in Arkansas. Arkansas is consistently the top U.S. producer of rice. Exports are extremely important to the rice industry. Last year, the rice industry exported to more than 100 countries. Trade and trade policy, therefore, are critical to the continued success of the industry. 
   At the time that the U.S. Government imposed sanctions on trade with Cuba, it was not only our largest export market for rice, but it took more than one-half of our total rice exports. Cubans know good American rice, and they want it. The embargo dealt a major blow to the rice industry, particularly growers in the South who grow long grain rice, which is the rice of preference in Cuba. The only impact the embargo has had on Cuba is on its middle- to low-income citizens. We are hurting the Cuban people much more than the Cuban government or Cuban elite. Due to the high prices the government is forced to pay, less food is available for distribution. U.S. humanitarian organizations are prevented from providing food to starving children due solely to the existence of the embargo. 
   While in Cuba, I met with opponents of the Castro regime who have been persecuted for attempting to highlight the disparate human rights treatment in Cuba. These dissidents believe that the embargo gives the Cuban government an excuse for what is wrong with the country. Our embargo provides Cuban officials with an excuse for the sorry state of the economy and the challenges the country faces. If we lift  the embargo, we expose the Cuban people to many of the problems of their own government. Right now the Cuban people are only getting one side of the story, and they are not blaming their government or Fidel Castro for their troubles, because Fidel Castro is using the U.S. Government as the excuse for those problems. 
   I understand there are colleagues in this body whom I deeply respect who also disagree with me on this issue. I agree that should the U.S. lift its embargo on Cuba, Fidel Castro will probably declare victory over what he calls his imperialist oppressor to his north. But the real truth which is undeniably is that under current policy absolutely no one wins. 
   As a farmer's daughter, I am not so concerned about the short-term implications of who can claim victory after 40 years of economic isolation. I believe that the long-term benefits of engagement with Cuba offer economic benefit to Americans; opportunities for democratic influences inside Cuba and better living conditions for the Cuban people. Each of these goals strike me as fundamental principles of our unique, American democracy. Lifting the 40-year embargo on Cuba is the right thing to do. I hope we do it sooner than later. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference report on the crop insurance reform bill. I believe this bill makes fundamental changes to the existing Federal Crop Insurance Program that are necessary to make crop insurance more workable and affordable for producers across the country and I urge its passage. 
   Congress has been attempting to eliminate the ad hoc disaster program for years because it is not the most efficient way of helping our farmers who suffer yield losses. Due to the Ag economic crisis, there has been much discussion lately on the issue of the ``safety net'' for our nation's producers. On that point I would like to be perfectly clear. Crop insurance is a risk management tool to help producers guard against yield loss. It was not created and was never intended to be the end-all be-all solution for the income needs of our nation's producers. 
   Last year, Senator COCHRAN and I introduced a comprehensive bill that addressed what we saw as the various reform needs of the crop insurance program. 
   I am pleased that many of these provisions are included in the conference report that we are considering here today. This bill establishes a process for re-evaluating crop insurance rates for all crops and for lowering those rates if warranted. After pressure from Congress and the National Cotton Council last year, RMA reduced rates by as much as 50 percent for cotton in Arkansas and the Mid-South. The provision included in today's bill will require further review of all Southern commodities. 
   By making the crop insurance program more affordable, additional producers will be encouraged to participate in the program and protect themselves against the unforeseeable factors that will be working against them once they put a crop into the ground.  
   The bill also provides for an enhanced subsidy structure so that producers are encouraged to buy-up from their current level of coverage. The structure included in this bill will make the step from catastrophic coverage to buy-up easier for producers and will make obtaining the highest level of coverage easier for those who are already participating in the crop insurance program. 
   In an attempt to improve the record keeping process within USDA, this legislation requires that FSA and RMA coordinate their record keeping activities. Current USDA record keeping, split between FSA and RMA, is redundant and insufficient. By including both crop insurance program participants and non-program participants in the process, we hope to enhance the agricultural data held by the agency and make acreage and yield reporting less of a hassle for already overburdened producers. 
   In addition, this bill establishes a role for consultation with state FSA committees in the introduction of new coverage to a state. The need for this provision was made abundantly clear to Arkansas' rice producers this spring. A private insurance policy was offered to farmers at one rate, only to have the company reduce the rate once the amount of potential exposure was realized. 
   In my discussions with various executives from the company on this issue it became apparent that their knowledge of the rice industry was fairly minimal. Had they consulted with local FSA committees who had a working knowledge of the rice industry before introduction of the policy, the train wreck that occurred might have been stopped in its tracks. 
   I am pleased that another reform measure that I worked on has been included to help rice producers suffering losses caused by drought. Recent droughts have left many Arkansas farmers with low reservoirs and depleting aquifers. If rains do not replenish them, an adequate irrigation supply may not exist by summer. 
   In addition, drought conditions in Louisiana have caused salt to intrude into the water supply used for irrigation on many farms. Current law states that rice is excluded from drought policies because it is irrigated. This is not equitable since rice producers do suffer losses due to drought. 
   I have worked with Senators BREAUX and LANDRIEU to provide these policies for our rice producers who are experiencing reduced irrigation opportunities due to the severe drought conditions that have plagued the South for the last two years. I am pleased that this provision has been included in the bill. 
   Many of the problems associated with the crop insurance program have been addressed in previous reform measures. However, fraud and abuses are still present to some degree. 
   This bill strengthens the monitoring of agents and adjusters to combat fraud and enhances the penalties available to USDA for companies, agents and producers who engage in fraudulent activities. 
   There is simply no room for bad actors that recklessly cost the taxpayers money. 
   Mr. President, I was prepared during our Committee markup earlier this year to offer an amendment related to a cooperative's role in the delivery of crop insurance. 
   I held off at that time due to concerns from the Committee related to possible ``rebating'' ramifications and preemption of state law, but in working with RMA and Senators KERREY and GRASSLEY, we were able to craft an amendment that clarifies the role of cooperatives in the crop insurance program. 
   I am pleased that the conferees included this amendment in the final version of the bill. 
   This amendment does nothing to preempt state law or even change current federal law. It simply provides that current approved business practices be maintained. 
   With the inclusion of my amendment Congress is recognizing the valuable role cooperatives play in the crop insurance program, specifically, encouraging producer participation in the crop insurance program, improving the delivery system for crop insurance, and helping to develop new and improved insurance products. 
   My amendment requires the Risk Management Agency to finalize regulations that would incorporate the currently approved business practices of cooperatives participating in the crop insurance program and to do so within 180 days of enactment of this Act. 
   If farmer owned entities are not allowed to sell crop insurance, then anyone can sell crop insurance in America except an American farmer. Such a legal result would give the appearance that crop insurance is designed for a closed club to exploit farmers. 
   That appearance would inhibit broader use of crop insurance. I do not believe that such a result is the intent of those who have put so much effort into improving the crop insurance program. 
   Mr. President, I would personally like to thank all staff members of the Committee and industry representatives that have helped with this effort. I would particularly like to thank Louie Perry of the National Cotton Council for his tireless efforts to make crop insurance more effective for cotton and other southern commodities. 
   Mr. President, Arkansas farmers have told me time and time again that crop insurance just isn't affordable for the amount of coverage they receive. As the program currently exists, it does not make sound business sense to purchase crop insurance in our state. Since this reform process began, I've been working to correct this inequity. I hope that the changes we make today will lead to a crop insurance program that is equitable, affordable and effective. 
   Crop insurance reform is not the only thing included in this legislation, however. $7.1 billion has been included to address the ongoing crisis in the agricultural community due to depressed market prices. I am pleased that Congress is acting more promptly this year to address the needs of our nation's producers. Numerous farmers in my home state of Arkansas have indicated that the additional assistance we provided over the last two years is the only reason their operations are still afloat today. While some commodities have seen a slight rebound, prices across the board are still too low to meet the increasing costs of production on our nation's farms. 
   Congress has to provide these ``add on'' payments to producers because the current farm bill does not provide an adequate safety net when commodity markets head south. I voted against the 1996 Farm Bill because I feared that we would find ourselves in the exact position we do today, with one bailout after another. 
   I introduced a bill earlier this year that would make reforms to the existing marketing loan program. An enhanced marketing loan program would provide additional assistance to our nation's producers without going through this annual ``horse trading'' over billions of dollars trying to determine who we are going to help. Farmers would be able to know at the beginning of the growing season what to expect from the government with regards to economic assistance instead of having to cross their fingers and hope Congress comes through. 
   We are coming near the end of the life of the ``Freedom to Farm'' bill and as we begin discussions on what the next farm bill should look like I hope my colleagues will see the importance of providing an adequate safety net to our nation's farms. 
   We must adequately support those who are supplying our nation, and many others, with safe, affordable food. 
   Do not misread my remarks, I am pleased that Congress has acted promptly to address the needs of the agricultural community this year. I simply feel that there is a better way to approach our nation's agricultural policy. I hope my colleagues will agree and work to provide a better farm bill in the future.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, due to a scheduling conflict I was unable to cast my vote today on the cloture motion for the conference report accompanying H.R. 434, the Trade and Development Act of 2000. For the record, I would have voted ``aye'' in favor of cloture on the bill. 
   I am very supportive of expanding our trading opportunities with the Caribbean countries and Africa and I am delighted that all parties involved have come to agreement and we have passed this vital legislation. Our distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN, focused our attention on the significance of the passage of this bill earlier today when he highlighted the fact that this is the first trade bill to pass Congress in six years. In my view, that is simply too long. 
   I'm not here to focus on missed opportunities today, however. I'm here to praise the members of both the House and Senate who were on the conference committee for their tireless efforts on this bill's behalf. To all involved in the passage of this legislation I say ``thank you.'' 
   This legislation means a great deal to the Caribbean and Africa, but it means a lot to Arkansas, too. This bill will generate an increase in demand for cotton, which is sorely needed. Our cotton farmers at home have experienced several years of bad weather and prices, and I know they are pleased to have access to new markets. It's planting season in Arkansas but that hasn't stopped my constituents from staying in touch. I've heard from many of them this week who took time from their busy schedules to voice their support for this bill. They realize, as I do, that the world is increasingly becoming a ``global marketplace'' and we must do all we can to expand our trading opportunities. I applaud the Senate's vote on the ``Trade and Opportunity Act'' today and hope that it will not be another six years before the next trade bill comes to the Senate floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I also would like to thank all of my colleagues who have worked so diligently on these issues, and particularly Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator BAYH who I have been working alongside on the proposal that is before us right now. I also would like to compliment Senator KENNEDY's staff for all the work they have put in, as well as the wonderful bipartisan spirit that has been shown by Senators GREGG, COLLINS, GORTON, and HUTCHINSON in trying to bring about this issue of great importance on behalf of our Nation and on behalf of our children. 
   I am proud to join my colleagues on the floor today to talk about a bold, new education plan that we hope will provide a way out of the current stalemate over reauthorizing ESEA. I must admit that I am disappointed because so far we have turned one of the most important issues we will debate this year into yet another partisan standoff. 
   I can't tell you how frustrated I am that we face the real possibility that our children will be forced once again to the back of the bus while partisan politics drive the legislative process off a cliff. 
   I would like to focus on a comment that was made by one of my colleagues earlier in this debate. Senator LANDRIEU mentioned that we had one chance at reaching each of these individual children in our Nation who are the greatest blessings in this world. 
   Each year we fall behind in making the revolutionary changes to move our educational system to where it needs to be in order to provide our children with the source of education they need in order to meet the challenges of the coming century. Each year that we fail to do that--if that happens this year--is one year in a child's life that we cannot replace; one year in a child's life that cannot be reproduced or given back to them in terms of what they need to know to be competitive. 
   If I have learned one thing since my first campaign for Congress in 1992, it  is that when voters send you to Washington to represent them they mean business. They expect leadership and they want results, and rightly so because they deserve it. 
   As parents, we certainly all understand one of the things that we will fight the hardest for, and that is benefits for our children. 
   The American people want us to get serious about educating our children in new and innovative ways that will allow them to learn and meet the challenges of the future. 
   I firmly believe we have a responsibility to pass a reauthorization bill this year that will improve public education for all children. That means working together until we reach an agreement a majority on both sides can support. Waiting to see what happens in the next election should not be an option. 
   Last week, I supported one alternative to S. 2 offered by Senator DASCHLE. It didn't contain everything I wanted, but after I and other Members expressed some initial concerns, we reached an agreement that reflected my key priorities on accountability, public school choice and teacher quality. Every Senator on this side of the aisle supported that proposal, but we didn't get one Republican vote. 
   At the same time, I don't know any Member on our side who is prepared to support the underlying bill that the President has indicated he will veto unless substantial changes are made. So it is clear that both sides have to give some ground in this debate if we have any chance of crafting a compromise proposal that the President will sign into law. 
   The Three R's amendment we proposed today helps bridge the gap on both sides of the debate over the role of the federal government in public education. Our bill synthesizes the best ideas of both parties, I believe, into a whole new approach to national education policy. 
   It contains three crucial elements to improve public education--tough accountability standards to ensure students are learning core academic subjects, a significant increase in federal resources to help schools meet new performance goals, and more flexibility at the local level to allow school districts to meet their most pressing needs. 
   Essentially, under our proposal, the federal government would concentrate less on rules and requirements and focus instead, on what I know every Member of this body can and will support--higher academic achievement for every student. 
   In addition to being smart national policy, the Three R's proposal would dramatically improve education in my home state of Arkansas. 
   As I noted earlier, the RRR bill significantly increases the Federal investment in our public schools and carefully targets those additional dollars where they are needed the most. We, as a moderate group, find ourselves in an unusual position of trying to change the law to actually enforce the original intent of that law--title I funds actually being targeted to the schools and to the students who need those resources the most. There is no doubt that we can only be as strong as our weakest link. That is why it is essential that in those poor school districts we make sure title I dollars actually get to where they were intended to go. 
   Statistics consistently demonstrate that, on average, children who attend low-income schools lag behind students from more affluent neighborhoods. 
   This is certainly true in Arkansas where the most recent test results indicate that students in the economically prosperous northwest region of the state outperform students in the impoverished Delta. These results also indicate that the disparity in student achievement between minority and non-minority students in Arkansas continues. It proves that in the past several decades we have not been eliminating the gap and disparity between haves and have nots. 
   I believe strongly that every child deserves a high-quality education and that the federal government has a right to expect more from our nation's schools. But we also have a responsibility to give public schools the resources they need to be successful. 
   The ``Three R's'' acronym can also apply to our efforts to improve teacher quality. In fact, this plan can best be summed up by Four R's: recruiting, retention, resources, and above all, respecting our teachers. 
   The difficulty schools experience today in recruiting and retaining quality teachers is one of the most enormous obstacles facing our education system. 
   In my State of Arkansas, somewhere around 30 percent or more of our teachers are under the age of 40. We are going to hit a brick wall eventually as our teachers begin to retire with no more younger teachers in our school systems. 
   If we do not provide the funds in order to make sure that teacher improvement and quality and retention are there, we will not have the teachers. We cannot expect students to be successful if they don't work with quality teachers. We can't expect quality teachers to stay in the profession if they don't get adequate training, resources, or respect. 
   In our bill, we include a 100-percent increase in funding for professional development for teachers. I think that is absolutely essential in supporting our educators for them to be able to provide for our students. That is why I believe we in Congress must do our best to help schools meet the challenges we are setting forth today. 
   Most experts agree teacher quality is as important as any other factor in raising student achievement. The amendment we are debating would consolidate several teacher training initiatives into a single formula grant program for improving the quality of public school teachers, principals, and administrators. This proposal would increase professional development funding by more than 100 percent, to $1.6 billion annually, and target that funding to the neediest school districts. In my home State of Arkansas, this will mean an additional $12 million for teacher quality initiatives. In my book, that is putting your money where your mouth is. 
   In addition, the RRR would give State and school districts more flexibility to design effective teacher recruitment and professional development initiatives to meet their specific needs. No two school districts are alike, and there is no one size fits all for the school districts of this country. 
   One overreaching goal we propose today is to require all teachers be fully qualified by 2005. Even the best teachers 
   cannot teach what they don't know or haven't learned themselves. To be successful, we must work harder to reduce out-of-field teaching and require educators to pass rigorous, State-developed content assessments in the subject they teach, not a Federal test but those that are designed by the State. 
   I have the highest respect for the teachers, principals, and superintendents who dedicate their talent and skills every day to prepare our children for tomorrow. I think they have some of the hardest and most important jobs in the world. Our Nation's future, in large part, depends on the work they do. We should be reinforcing them. Our teacher quality proposal is an example of how, by combining the concept of increased funding, targeting flexibility, and accountability, we can join with States and local educators to give our children a high-quality education. 
   There is much more to say today about this approach of the amendment of Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator BAYH that Members such as myself have sponsored. I know there are others who want to speak. 
   Before I close, I truly think this is the question we must ask ourselves: What, honestly, is the best thing for our children in this country? I say to my colleagues, if you want accountability from local schools, our proposal has it. If you want more targeted, effective national investment, take a look at the amendment that was produced by Senator LIEBERMAN. Do we want more qualified, better trained teachers, investing in their professional development, with flexibility at the local level? Do you want higher minority student retention rates, which should be the objective of all Members? We have those answers in this amendment and in our bill. 
   We have one chance at producing something on behalf of our most treasured blessing in all this world, our children. Please, colleagues, let's don't lose that chance. Let's not disappoint our children in this country and, more importantly, the future of this country. Let's put party politics aside. I think  the RRR in the LIEBERMAN-BAYH proposal is the right approach to improve student achievement in every classroom. 
   I thank my colleagues for their involvement in this amendment and certainly in this debate. More importantly, I encourage all Members to remember what it is we are here to do and who, more importantly, we are here to do it on behalf of, our children.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional group of students from Mountain Home Junior High School in my home state of Arkansas. These students won first place in the state competition of the ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. I am proud to report that the following students will represent my home state at the national competition this May 6-8 in Washington, DC: 
   Matthew Brinza, T.C. Burnett, Patrick Carter, Cody Garrison, Meredith Griffin, Kayla Hawthorne, Delia Lee, Megan Matty, Zachary Milholland, Stacy Miller, Jennifer Nassimbene, Rebeca Neis, Patty Schwartz, Carrie Toole, and Kris Zibert. 
   I also want to say a special word of thanks to their teacher, Patsy Ramsey, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. 
   The We the People ..... program is an outstanding educational initiative developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Students who compete at the three-day national competition, which is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress, testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges representing various regions of the country. The students are then asked a series of challenging questions to test their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. 
   Teaching students about the benefits of public service and the value of representative government is essential to the long-term viability of our nation's democracy. Since its inception in 1987, more than 26 million students and 75,000 educators nationwide have participated in this worthwhile program designed to encourage civic awareness and understanding. I am extremely proud of the Mountain Home students who have earned the opportunity to compete in the We the People ..... finals in Washington, DC. I wish them well in their endeavor and know they will provide an excellent example for others in my state and the nation to follow.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I rise today, as have others, to talk about an issue of paramount importance to this Nation, and possibly the most important issue we in the Senate will face this year--how we educate our children. 
   I only hope that we in the Senate are big enough to rise above the partisan politics to get results on behalf of our children. We in the Senate have a difficult task before us of passing legislation that reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which determines how the Federal Government allocates money to our public schools. 
   Unfortunately, all signs to date point to yet another political stalemate on an issue of vital importance to our nation and its children. Once again, Mr. President, we face the real possibility that the Senate will abandon its responsibility to govern and choose partisan politics over sound public policy. 
   I reject this proposition because our children deserve more from their elected officials. In hopes of fostering a compromise on this contentious issue, I have joined with a group of my moderate Democratic colleagues here in the Senate to promote a ``Third Way'' on ESEA, one that synthesizes the best ideas of both sides into a whole new approach to federal education policy. 
   We're calling this bill the ``Three R's'', and it is a bold effort at streamlining massive Federal education programs and refocusing them on raising academic achievement. 
   At its core, this blueprint will give more funding and flexibility to states and local school districts, in exchange for greater accountability. 
   In addition to being smart national policy, the Three R's proposal would dramatically improve education in my home state of Arkansas. 
   As I noted earlier, the Three R's bill significantly increases the federal investment in our public schools and carefully targets those additional dollars to the neediest public schools. 
   As my colleague who spoke before said, there are those out there who we cannot just leave to chance. 
   Statistics consistently demonstrate that, on average, children who attend low-income schools lag behind students from more affluent neighborhoods. 
   This is certainly true in Arkansas where the most recent test results indicate that students in the economically prosperous northwest region of the  state outperform students in the impoverished Delta ..... These results also indicate that the disparity in student achievement between minority and non-minority students in Arkansas continues. 
   I believe strongly that every child deserves a high-quality education and that the federal government has a right to expect more from our nation's schools. But we also have a responsibility to give public schools the resources they need to be successful. 
   Another aspect of the current education framework that affects Arkansas is the prevalence of competitive grant funding programs. 
   Unfortunately, rural states--and especially rural school districts similar to where I grew up--do not have the resources necessary to be successful under a competitive grant system. 
   Simply put, economically disadvantaged schools don't have the ability to chase after federal dollars as effectively as schools who can afford to hire professional grant writers. As a result, many of the schools in my state that most need financial support from the federal government are too often out of luck. 
   Under the Three R's bill, federal funding is allocated based on total student enrollment and the number of low-income students in the district, not on the ability of savvy grant writers to draft proposals with graphs and color charts. 
   Under our bill, Mr. President, these schools would be guaranteed federal funding which they could use to address their most pressing problems. And they will be held accountable; schools will be forced to make improvements or suffer consequences. 
   Mr. President, we will certainly hear this week from people representing both sides of the debate about how to improve public education. But the question we need to ask: who is representing our children? Who is representing the thousands of young Americans who continue to underperform academically year after year in an educational system simply that does not work for the students who are left behind? 
   As we go through this debate this is the question we must ask ourselves--what, honestly, is the best thing for our children? 
   I say to my colleagues, you want accountability from local schools? Our proposal has it. 
   You want more targeted, effective national investment? Take a look at our Three R's bill. 
   Do you want qualified, better-trained teachers, flexibility at the local level and higher minority-student retention rates? We have the answers in this bill--a commonsense approach. 
   Put party politics aside. The ``Three R's'' is the right approach to improve student achievement in every classroom. 
   Congress must do all it can to help our schools meet the challenges they face today and will face in the future. 
   We must do all we can to help our States and local school districts raise academic achievement and deliver on the promise of equal opportunity for all students. But I will say our most important responsibility is to our children and to their future. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention and patience this evening, and for all of the hard work that both of these two legislators have done in this field of education. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, in listening to my colleagues I am pleased to detect broad support for ending the so-called marriage penalty. I know that no one in this body believes that there should be a price to pay to the government for matrimony. However, we should work for a fair and reasonable solution that will not expand the marriage bonus and shift tax unfairness from one group in this country to another. The fact is that expanding marriage bonuses is not fair to single Americans just like doing nothing is unfair to married couples. 
   The ironic thing about the marriage penalty is that it was actually born out of fairness. According to a June 22, 1999 document prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, before 1948, there was only one income tax schedule, and all individuals were liable for tax as separate filing units. Under this tax structure, there was neither a marriage penalty nor a marriage bonus. 
   However, this structure created an incentive to split incomes because, with a progressive income tax rate structure, a married couple with only one spouse earning income could reduce their combined tax liability if they could split the income and assign half to each spouse. Under this system a disparity between the citizens of community and separate property states arose after a handful of Supreme Court cases upheld the denial of contractual attempts to split income, but ruled that in states with community property laws, income splitting was required for community income. This led Senator John McClellan, of my home state of Arkansas, to ask Senator William Knowland of California, ``why is it that just because you live in California and I live in Arkansas, you pay $646 less every year than I pay?'' 
   The Revenue Act of 1948 provided the benefit of income splitting to all married couples by establishing a separate tax schedule for joint returns. That schedule was designed so that married couples would pay twice the tax of a single taxpayer having one-half the couple's taxable income. While this new schedule equalized treatment between married couples in states with community property laws and those in states with separate property laws, it introduced a marriage bonus into the tax law for couples in states with separate property laws. As a result of this basic rate structure, by 1969, an individual with the same income as a married couple could have had a tax liability up to 40 percent higher than that of the married couple. 
   To address this inequity, which was at the time labeled a ``singles penalty,'' a special rate schedule was introduced for single taxpayers, leaving the old schedule solely for married individuals filing separate returns. This schedule created the infrastructure for the so-called marriage penalty that we seek to end today. 
   At the time more than thirty years ago when the current single and married filing categories were established, our society looked different, and very few people were affected by the flaws in our tax code that imposed a penalty on marriage. As we all know, Mr. President, the general rule is that married couples whose incomes are split more evenly than 30-70 suffer a marriage penalty. 
   However, the fact still remains, that married couples whose incomes are attributable largely to one spouse generally receive a marriage bonus. 
   As the income levels between men and women have rightly narrowed and as more married women have moved into the work force, the so-called marriage penalty has begun to affect more and more families. 
   Today we are debating a bill offered by the Senate Finance Committee that seeks to address the problem of the so called Marriage Penalty, and I applaud my colleagues for bringing this to the floor. As I said before, I believe we all want to tell our constituents that we have ended the marriage penalty, however, the underlying bill will not allow us to do that. 
   There are 65 provisions in the tax code that contribute to a possible marriage penalty for taxpayers. The bill offered by the Majority only eliminates one of those provisions and softens the bite of two others. The fact still remains that 62 other provisions could rise up to affect married couples on tax day. If we are going to end the marriage penalty, Mr. President, we should just end it. 
   Another problem with the Majority bill is that it expands the marriage bonus. We should not bring back the unfairness we had before 1969. We should learn from the history of this debate and we should come up with a better solution. I believe in the sanctity of marriage, as do all of my colleagues. I don't believe in penalizing it. But I also recognize the rights and fairness that our single constituents demand. We should not shift tax unfairness from one group to another, we should work to eliminate the unfairness for all Americans. 
   The Majority bill would also expand the roles of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Talk about unfair! I think a lot of Americans would almost rather pay the marriage penalty than have to deal with the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Majority bill would expand, by 5 million, the number of people who have to fill out an AMT tax form and pay higher rates. Not only is it inexcusable,  it goes against what we stand for and what we are trying to achieve 
   We should be working to lessen the effects of the AMT on middle class families not expand them. I am aware that the Majority bill includes a provision to permanently exempt the non-refundable personal tax credits from AMT determination. That is good policy. In fact, Mr. President, I am the author of the bill, S. 506, that is essentially attached to the Majority bill. This provision, however, will not do enough to lessen the effects that doubling the standard deduction will have on the AMT roles. The good policy of S. 506 is drowned by the bad policy to which it is attached; drowned in the squeals of 5 million voters. I remind my colleagues that the AMT equals higher taxes and confusing forms. No one wants that for their constituents. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, this majority bill can hardly be labeled a ``Marriage Penalty Relief Bill'' at all. It doesn't completely eliminate the marriage penalty and less than half the cost of the bill goes to reducing it. 60 percent of the cost of the Majority bill goes to singles and to expanding the marriage bonus. I believe we should be honest with the American taxpayer and quit trying to aggregate tax cuts under popular headings like ``Marriage Penalty Relief'' and ram them through the process with cloture votes. 
   If my colleagues truly believe in fairness, as I think they do, then, Mr. President, let us work to truly end the marriage penalty, not to just put it on hold. Let's work together, Mr. President, to end the marriage penalty. Lets put an end to it now and forever. That means eliminating all 65 marriage penalties. Not just one and a fraction. That also means avoiding a new singles penalty. We have a record to look upon, Mr. President. We have a history. If we approach the marriage penalty in the way the Majority proposes, the unfairness will continue, the debate will continue, and sadly, the marriage penalty will continue as well.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Missouri, KIT BOND, in introducing the Fishable Waters Act. This bill is aimed at restoring and maintaining clean water in our Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. This bill will provide funding for programs with a proven track record of conserving land, cleaning up the environment, and promoting clean and fishable waters. This legislation takes the right approach to reducing non-point source pollution. It's voluntary. It's incentive-based. And if encourages public-private partnerships. 
   Our State Motto, ``The Natural State,'' reflects our dedication to preserving the unique natural landscape that is Arkansas. We have towering mountains, rolling foothills, an expansive Delta, countless pristine rivers and lakes, and a multitude of timber varieties across our state. From expansive evergreen forests in the South, to the nation's largest bottomland hardwood forest in the East, as well as one of this nation's largest remaining hardwood forests across the Northern one-half of the state, Arkansas has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the United States. Most streams and rivers in Arkansas originate or run through our timberlands and are sources for water supplies, prime recreation, and countless other uses. We also have numerous outdoor recreational opportunities and it is vital that we take steps to protect the environment. 
   This bill utilizes current programs within the U.S. Department of Agriculture that have a proven track record of reducing non-point sources of pollution and promoting clean and fishable water through voluntary conservation measures. Existing USDA programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Reserve Program, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, assist farmers in taking steps towards preserving a quality environment. 
   CRP and WRP are so popular with farmers, that they will likely reach their authorized enrollment cap by the end of 2001. Mr. President, farmers wouldn't flock to these programs unless there was an inherent desire to ensure that they conserved and preserved our Nation's water resources. 
   Arkansas ranks third in the number of enrolled acres in USDA's Wetlands Reserve Program because our farmers have recognized the vital role that wetlands play in preserving a sound ecology. 
   WRP is so popular in AR that we have over 200 currently pending applications that we cannot fill because of lack of funding. That's over 200 farmers that want to voluntarily conserve wetland areas around rivers, lakes, and streams. We need to fill that void in funding for these beneficial programs. This bill will help farmers in Arkansas and across the nation to voluntarily conserve sensitive land areas and provide buffer strips for runoff areas. 
   Farmers make their living from the soil and water. They have a vested interest in ensuring that these resources are protected. I don't believe that our nation's farmers have been given enough credit for their efforts to preserve a sound environment. 
   As many of you know, farming has a special place in my heart because I was raised in a seventh generation farm family. I know first hand that farmers want to protect the viability of their land so they can pass it on to the next generation. This bill is about more than agriculture though. It strikes the right balance between our agricultural industry and another pastime that I feel very strongly about, hunting and fishing. 
   Over the years many people have been surprised when they learn that I am an avid outdoorsman. I grew up in the South where hunting and fishing are not just hobbies, they're a way of life. My father never differentiated between taking his son or daughters hunting or fishing, it was just assumed that we would all take part. For this, I will be forever grateful because I truly enjoy the outdoors, and the time I spent hunting and fishing is a big part of who I am today. 
   We are blessed in Arkansas to have such bountiful outdoor opportunities. For these opportunities to continue to exist we must take steps to ensure that our nation's waters are protected. Trout in Arkansas' Little Red River and mallards in the riverbottoms of the Mississippi Delta both share a common need of clean water. And that is what we are ultimately striving for with this legislation: an effective, voluntary, incentive based plan to provide funding for programs that promote clean water. 
   Mr. President, I want to again stress the importance of voluntary programs. 
   We cannot expect to have success by using a heavy-handed approach to regulate our farmers, ranchers, and foresters into environmental compliance. Trying to force people into a permitting program to reduce the potential for non-profit runoff may actually discourage responsible environmental practices. 
   I agree with the EPA's objective of cleaning up our nation's impaired rivers, lakes, and streams, but firmly believe that a permitting program is not the best solution to the problem of maintaining clean water. Placing another unnecessary layer of regulation  upon our nation's local foresters will only slow down the process of responsible farming and forestry and the implementation of voluntary Best Management Practices. 
   Mr. President, this legislation takes the right approach to clean and fishable waters. It's voluntary. It's incentive-based. And it encourages public-private partnerships to clean up our Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join us in the fight for clean and fishable waters.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I spoke briefly last week about this proposal to reduce the gas tax. I spoke on the need for reforms in our Nation's energy policy. 
   However, because this bill did not go through committee, and because it has had little technical scrutiny, there are just two points that I believe should be considered before we move ahead with this idea. 
   First, I appreciate the concern that has recently been shown for the highway trust fund. There is a nice clause in this bill that would take money out of general revenues to pay for the reduction into the highway trust fund. 
   Last week I called this hocus pocus. It is creative, to say the least. But let's get honest here. This tax cut has to come from somewhere, and this method of accounting is not without consequence. 
   Regardless of the good intentions being professed by my colleagues, the transfer of this burden to general revenues would result in a tax increase to the people of my State and perhaps other States. 
   In Arkansas, any reduction, either whole or in part, of the existing excise tax on motor fuels will result in a penny-for-penny increase in tax at the State level. This is the law in my State, and I know that there are similar provisions in Tennessee, Oklahoma, Nevada, and California.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I agree that this bill might give a minor tax reduction for the oil producers of 45 States, but the tax burden would remain level in as many as five States. Without a reduction in spending, this amounts to a tax increase in my home State and two of my neighboring States, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. In short, if this bill were to pass, taxes, in effect, would go up in Arkansas. 
   My second point is that this bill would not get relief to the people who need it. I said last week that this tax is collected on the wholesale level and all that this bill offers is a suggestion that the wholesalers pass this on to the consumers. I am not sure that this point is getting out to my colleagues, so I have a quote here from the Supreme Court of the United States concerning this tax. 
   According to the U.S. Supreme Court in Gurley vs. Rhoden:  
   the Federal excise tax on gasoline is imposed solely upon statutory producers, and not on consuming buyers. 
   Let me repeat that:  
   the Federal excise tax on gasoline is imposed solely upon statutory producers, and not on consuming buyers. 
   Therefore, I assert that even the Supreme Court agrees that this tax reduction will not go to consumers. This tax cut will go exclusively to oil producers who will have no legal requirement to pass the cut on. That won't help truckers in my State. It won't help farmers in my State. It won't help small business people in my State. It won't help average consumers. 
   We cannot forget that despite the fact that the administration has successfully compelled OPEC to pump more oil, and that oil prices are coming down, the high cost of the oil price spike will still be on the bottom line at the end of the year. 
   We have to do something real and substantial for our truckers, our farmers, and our fuel dependent small businessmen and women. 
   A 4.3-cent gas tax cut will do essentially nothing for anyone. 
   I again suggest that a suspension of the heavy vehicle use tax would be a way to get real relief to real truck drivers. This would not drain the highway trust fund to the degree that this gas tax cut would and it would directly help the people who have been hurt the most by the spike in fuel prices. 
   I have also advocated a short-term no-interest loan program for diesel dependent small business, and lastly I have called for a formalized end-of-the-year tax credit, that would take into account the totality of this oil spike in an environment of dropping prices. 
   We all want to help those in need and we should consider giving tax credits, but we should also protect the Treasury from windfalls that could arise in this economic environment. 
   This bill is a bad idea, it would in effect raise the tax burden on my constituents, and it would not help the people who are really hurting from the high prices at the gas pump. 
   I urge my colleagues, especially those from Oklahoma and Nevada, California and Tennessee, to look at how this bill will affect the tax burden in your States. Ask how this bill will affect the bonds that your State has issued. And most importantly, consider how little this bill will do to help the consumers of our Nation. We can do better, and I hope we can continue the debate on this bill so we will have that opportunity.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in strong support of the amendment by my good friend, Senator BOB GRAHAM. There are several of us in this body who have come together to build a consensus of a commonsense, result-oriented solution to educating our children in this Nation. 
   This amendment combines two concepts that are essential to improving our system of public education--greater investment and tough accountability standards. 
   Now Mr. President, before I get into the details of why this amendment is so important, I think we have to take a minute to consider the current state of education in this country. 
   I am not sure how the rest of my colleagues feel, but I think it is difficult to deny that the status quo in our education system is simply not acceptable. It is not working, and we are not doing a good enough job in educating our children. We are certainly not doing the best job we could be doing. 
   And if we think things are bad now, we should stop and look 10 or 15 years into the future. I continue to be amazed at the pace of high-tech development in this country and the incredible advancements that take place every day. This progress is only going to continue, and our children are the ones who will be left behind in the global high-tech world. 
   If we do not do something to change the way we approach education, if we do not increase our Federal investment and demand more accountability from our system and our educators, then we are only fooling ourselves, and we are cheating our children. 
   Our children are our greatest national resource, and their education is worthy of a significant investment. Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us today once again falls short of our responsibility to make quality education a top priority in this Nation. 
   Under the budget resolution before us, Arkansas would receive $6.6 million less in title I funds than it would under the administration's plan. That means more than 10,000 students in my home State would be denied the critical support this program provides. 
   In addition to the annual budget, we in the Senate have the difficult task before us this year of passing legislation that reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Quite frankly, we need a bold new approach that targets resources to the neediest areas, puts decisions in the hands of local educators, and maintains national priorities like school safety and educational technology. 
   I have joined with a group of my moderate Democratic colleagues in the Senate to promote a ``Third Way'' on ESEA, one that synthesizes the best ideas of both sides into a whole new approach to federal education policy. 
   Like our ``Three Rs'' bill, the additional funding contained in this amendment would allow schools to raise student achievement, implement effective professional development programs for teachers, improve English language instruction and encourage innovation in the classroom. 
   This investment is especially important to rural school districts, like many of those in Arkansas, that cannot afford to meet all of their needs with limited local resources. 
   We must do more than just throw more money at the problem of under-achievement in the classroom. We also must demand results. 
   To qualify for additional funding under this amendment, educational proposals authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would have to contain greater accountability; incentives to set high student achievement standards; an emphasis on education for disadvantaged students; and funding targeted to our neediest, most impoverished schools. 
   Congress must do all it can to help our schools meet the challenges they face today and will face in the future. 
   Our most important responsibility is to help States and local school districts raise academic achievement and deliver on the promise of equal opportunity for all students. 
   I believe in the children of this country. I believe that through this amendment, we can truly make a difference by making a bigger investment and setting our children's education as one of our top national priorities. I urge the support of this amendment, and I thank my colleagues for their attention. I yield back any remaining time I may have to the Democratic leader.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, just a few days ago Arkansas lost one of its boldest opinion leaders and most respected modern journalists, John Robert Starr. I rise today to pay tribute to his career and to offer my sympathies to his family, friends and colleagues. 
   A journalist of the ``old-school,'' John Robert Starr was dedicated to the tradition of his craft even in this day and age of on-line papers and 24-hour news channels. He loved his work and once said of journalism: ``This is the place to be--reporting, covering the day-to-day business. This is where I would like to be. This is where everybody ought to be.'' 
   Ultimately, Mr. Starr would have a dramatic impact on journalism in Arkansas. But he got his start on the college newspaper at Southwestern, now Rhodes College in Memphis. After college, Starr combined two of his loves, sports and journalism, to join the sports staff at the Memphis Commercial Appeal. He later moved to the Associated Press in Little Rock as the sports editor but soon shifted into the arena of political coverage. 
   Throughout his 19-year career at the AP, including as Little Rock bureau chief, Starr covered such infamous political characters as Governor Orval Faubus, as well as various political candidates. After a lengthy and successful stint, he then left the AP to teach journalism at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Starr didn't last long on the academic side of things after being recruited to run an afternoon paper, the Arkansas Democrat. The Democrat was headed into battle with a more widely-read morning paper, the Arkansas Gazette, which was the oldest newspaper west of the Mississippi. 
   As they say, the rest is history. John Robert Starr led the Democrat through a raucous, public battle against the Gazette for readership and power. He became known through a must-read daily column for his sharp wit and engaging writing. Ultimately, the Democrat took the Gazette head on with hard news coverage and even harder-hitting opinions. It won, taking over the Gazette in 1991 under the masthead of one combined daily paper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. It has been said that, despite his hand in shutting the Gazette down, Starr mourned the loss of the competition and lamented the passing of a major journalistic institution. 
   After the takeover, Starr stayed at the helm of the Democrat-Gazette as managing editor for just under a year, but stayed on to write his much-beloved daily column until the late 1990's when he cut back to three columns per week. During these years, Starr took on every topic from politics to travel, from professional basketball to Razorback football's recent stadium controversy. He always had an opinion and expressed it like no one else could. While his career was not without controversy, his opinions were always received with respect. 
   John Robert Starr also devoted much time to his wife of 51 years, the former Norma Jeanette Wilson of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and their family. They traveled extensively over the years and their adventures provided material for many touching columns. Starr is survived by two sons, a daughter, and nine grandchildren, whom he loved dearly. 
   Journalism in my home state is forever influenced by the life and career of John Robert Starr. He was a dedicated Arkansan, with a passionate commitment to our state and its communities. With his passing, thousands of Arkansans will find something missing as they pick up their morning papers for years to come.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 2285--a bill that is so flawed I can't believe the majority wants to end debate on it before the debate has even begun, with no committee hearings, no floor debate, no bipartisan discussion over something as important as the tax base for our highway and transportation infrastructure needs. This is literally an ``Our Way or the Highway'' bill, and I will choose the highway. 
   As a southerner, I represent a large number of farmers and about 1,600 independent trucking firms. Eleven hundred of those firms are one-truck operators; 250 operate 10 or fewer trucks. I've got at least seven of the largest trucking firms in the Nation based in my State, as well as the world's largest retailer, which operates about 4,000 trucks, and one of the largest food processors which operates about 1,500. I am opposed to S. 2285 and should I have the opportunity, I will vote against it.  
   First of all, none of the truckers or farmers that operate in my State would receive any benefits from the bill being discussed today, or any of the other bills that are based on a reduction in Federal excise taxes. 
   They are calling this proposal the ``federal fuels tax holiday'' I can tell the Senate that if this bill passes, we won't be celebrating in Arkansas. 
   A key point that must have been overlooked by the authors of this bill is that some States like Arkansas, any reductions in Federal fuel excise taxes automatically require a penny-for-penny increase in the State fuel excise tax. 
   If we could have had committee hearings on this bill, perhaps the entire body might know that my State, along with Oklahoma, Nevada, Tennessee, and California all have provisions that will in some way negate any decrease in the Federal tax by increasing the state tax. 
   Many States use the funds they receive from the Federal Government transportation formulas to issue bonded debt. They depend on the gas tax to pay for these bonds and to fund their transportation needs. 
   Smartly, many of the States recognized that you can't always rely on the promises you get from Washington. I am glad that the State legislators of my State had the wisdom and the foresight to anticipate ill-conceived notions by Congress such as the bill before us today that would put our highway and transit programs at risk. 
   Further, even in those States that would not automatically increase excise taxes, there is no guarantee that the consumers would see a price decrease at the pump. These taxes are charged at the wholesale level. 
   The only thing this bill offers is a ``sense-of-the-Congress'' clause that says to the big business: ``Here you go, have a huge tax decrease; by the way, we sure hope you guys will pass it on.'' 
   Further, there is no credit in the bill for retail stocks. That means that even if this tax reduction were to pass both Houses and make it past the President with lightening speed, the gas in retail inventories would still be priced with the tax. There is no telling how long it would take for the fuel that wasn't taxed to finally make it to consumers. 
   One last thing about cutting the Federal excise taxes on fuels: these are the dollars that go into our highway trust fund. I know that this bill has some statutory hocus-pocus that takes the money out of general revenues, but are we really protecting the highway trust fund, and Social Security by hopping from trust fund to trust fund until we find one that the voters aren't watching? 
   They say this bill is paid for out of the ``on-budget'' surplus. I ask, where is that? We don't even have a budget resolution, let alone a surplus. I think we should make sure that a surplus exists before deciding to spend it. The bottom line is this bill isn't paid for and the money is simply going to come out of debt reduction, education, and out of Medicare reform dollars that are so needed in the country. 
   I have spoken with the truckers in my state and they have told me that they need help. And I want to help them in a way that is reasonable and will actually reach them. But the way this bill is structured no relief will make it to them. If we really want to help truckers and consumers effectively then we should have a package that helps them right now and through the end of the fiscal year. 
   In the very short term, we should consider a suspension of the heavy vehicle use tax that is due on every big rig. This tax break would go directly to the people in need, and it would have a very quick impact. 
   This tax is due on July 1, but it can be paid quarterly. Suspending the heavy vehicle use tax would equal about $550.00 in relief for every truck on the road, and we wouldn't have to wait for the effects of market pricing to see relief at the consumer level. 
   Also, we should consider low-or no-interest loans to help small business men and women make it through this price spike. In the intermediate months, truckers, and producers who have been pushed to the edge could find help in load assistance until oil prices come down. 
   Finally, we should consider end-of-the-year formula tax credits that would go directly to the consumers and could be directly tied to oil prices which, as I speak, are dropping. 
   We are all aware of the recent announcements that have been made by the oil exporting countries. Prices are falling and the price spike is coming down. While we all want to ensure that the high prices we have had will not drive small business people into bankruptcy, our relief package should be flexible enough to take falling prices into account. 
   Beyond the rash and reckless way that we have come to consider this bill, and beyond the abomination that it is, there remains the underlying issue of our nation's energy policy. This knee-jerk bill is a reaction to a host of problems and just because oil prices are starting to come down we should not let this issue fall to the wayside. 
   There is no excuse for the lack of a comprehensive energy policy that we suffer from in this country. The roller coaster ups and downs of oil prices in 1999 and 2000 are evidence that we have been completely reactive to market forces and have not established stable, long-term energy policies. 
   It is obvious that no immediate, cost-effective government action could eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign oil entirely, but there are things that we should be doing to help reduce our dependence on oil as an energy source. 
   To help lessen the economic shocks that oil price spikes have created, we should couple short term relief provisions such as the ones I have spoken about with smart, stable, long-term, energy policies. 
   Through the use of petroleum supply enhancements such as energy conservation, use of renewables, and expanded U.S. production we could lessen our dependence on foreign oil. We must provide incentives to try to bring ourselves away from dependence on oil in general. We must set out a course to promote oil production at home, to promote the use of renewable sources of energy, and to promote the more efficient and cleaner uses of the fossil fuels we are still using. 
   Mr. President, many of us in this body have been pushing for expanded uses of renewables for quite some time and we will continue to do so. This spike in fuel prices demonstrates that we need to shift our emphasis from research to the practical use and application of renewable sources of energy. 
   Simply put, Mr. President, this knee-jerk reaction to high oil prices represents a reckless abandonment of the priorities we brought to the Congress last year--Social Security, Medicare, paying down our national debt, and educating our children. 
   I want to do whatever I can to help my constituents who are dependent on diesel for their livelihoods, but if we adopt measures to eliminate, albeit temporarily, gas taxes, we will not get the help to those who need it. 
   When a core business segment of this nation is under duress we should address that segment directly. We must get the help to the ground where it is needed. In our present situation, we should be pursuing targeted assistance in the forms of loan assistance, grants, and reasonable tax measures that actually get to the level of the consumer who need it the most. 
   We can't afford to jeopardize funding for our roads, the stability of Social Security and Medicare, or the long-term goal of paying down our enormous debt. This bill would do just that, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the ``fuel tax holiday'' bill before the party gets out of hand, 
   to ensure our roads will be funded and, more importantly, that we go about it in a reasonable way and get relief to the individuals who need it the most.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, the Wildlife Services Division of the United States Department of Agriculture needs assistance in expediting proper bird management activities. I am here today to introduce legislation that accomplishes this goal. 
   Proper migratory bird management is important to the state of Arkansas for a number of reasons. We are deemed ``The Natural State'' due to the numerous outdoor recreational opportunities that exist in the state. Fishing, hunting, and bird watching opportunities abound throughout Arkansas. Maintaining proper populations of wildlife, especially migratory birds, is essential for sustaining a balanced environment. 
   In Arkansas, aquaculture production has taken great strides in recent years. The catfish industry in the state has grown rapidly and Arkansas currently ranks second nationally in acreage and production of catfish. The baitfish industry is not far behind, selling more than 15 million pounds of fish annually, with a cash value in excess of $43 million. I have been a great supporter of this industry since my days in the House of Representatives and I am concerned about the impact the double breasted cormorant is having on this industry. In the words of one of my constituents, ``The double-crested cormorant has become a natural disaster!'' I am pleased that the Fish and Wildlife Service has agreed to develop a national management plan for the double breasted cormorant. I am hopeful that an effective management program will be the result of these efforts. 
   One of my first priorities since coming to Congress in 1992 has been to work to make government more efficient and effective. To specifically address what I see as an inequity among government agencies regarding this issue, I am introducing a bill today that gives Wildlife Service employees as much authority to manage and take migratory birds as any U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee. After all, Wildlife Services biologists are professional wildlife managers providing the front line of defense against such problems. With this legislation I would like to recognize the excellent job that Wildlife Services has done and is doing for bird management. 
   Currently, USDA-Wildlife Services is required to apply for and receive a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before they can proceed with any bird collection or management activities. This process is redundant and unnecessary. Oftentimes, Wildlife Services finds that by the time a permit arrives, the birds for which the permit was applied for are already gone. I hope that this legislation will lead to a more streamlined effort for management purposes and I urge both agencies, USDA and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to work together to accomplish this goal. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from Arkansas, Senator TIM HUTCHINSON, for joining me in this effort and look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that government is operating efficiently.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to introduce the ``Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program Authorization Act''. The Junior Duck Stamp program gives youth a valuable opportunity to study waterfowl and learn about environmental conservatism through the arts. 
   I believe we have an unique opportunity to instill in our children a love of the outdoors and must encourage our children by example to protect our natural resources for future generations. Through my own personal experiences in the outdoors, I have learned to value and appreciate the joys of hunting and fishing and look forward to raising my twin boys with the proper respect for the environment so that they too will enjoy a lifetime of experiencing one of America's greatest treasures. 
   The Junior Duck Stamp Reauthorization Act provides us with one of these opportunities to instill the importance of conservation in our nation's children. This legislation will reauthorize a program which helps teach children to love and respect the environment, while encouraging artistic development. By concentrating on nature, students have an opportunity to appreciate our country's great natural resources and explore their own talents. 
   The Junior Duck Stamp program allows students from elementary to high school to research any species of North American waterfowl and portray it artistically. Students then may enter their design in a state contest. The ``Best of Show'' winners at the state level are then sent to Washington D.C. for a national competition. The first place national winner receives a $2500 scholarship award and his/her design is used to create a Federal Junior Duck Stamp each year. Proceeds from the sale of the stamp, which costs $5, are then invested back into the program. 
   The Junior Duck Stamp Program was originally developed through the Fish and Wildlife Service with a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The program was expanded by Congress in 1994 and authorized through the year 2000. In 1998, more than 42,000 students entered the art contest. It is estimated by educators who work with the program, that for every student who enters the contest, ten other students actually participate in the curriculum. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting legislation which will continue the Junior Duck Stamp Program and encourage conservation practices and appreciation of the outdoors in our children.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair. 
   I am very pleased to support a crop insurance reform bill that has been a long while in the making. I compliment the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee for his diligence in this. He has certainly worked hard and put forth a great effort in working with all of us to come up with a final product. I appreciate his diligence and patience and all his hard work and wisdom that have gone into it. 
   As we all know, the Budget Committee included funds to reform our ailing Crop Insurance Program last year. I have been working diligently with the Senate Agriculture Committee to develop a bill that will improve the current program because for us in the South, the current program doesn't work. What we are considering today is the result of the efforts and hard work of all of us. 
   I believe this bill makes fundamental changes to the existing Federal Crop Insurance Program that are necessary to make crop insurance more workable and affordable for producers across the country, and I urge its passage. Congress has been attempting to eliminate the ad hoc disaster program for years because it is not the most effective way of helping our farmers who suffer yield losses. 
   Last year, Senator COCHRAN and I introduced a comprehensive bill that addressed what we saw as the various reforms necessary in the Crop Insurance Program. I am pleased that many of those provisions are included in the bill we are considering today. 
   As we all know, the Government's role in farm programs has changed. The 1996 farm bill phased out our traditional support for our farmers, and the current farm programs require producers to assume more risk than ever before. 
   Due to the agricultural economic crisis we are experiencing, there has been much discussion lately on the issues of the safety net for our Nation's producers. On that point, I will be perfectly clear. Crop insurance is a risk management tool to help producers guard against yield loss. It was not created and was never intended to be, and will never be, the end-all, be-all solution for the income needs of our Nation's producers. 
   As the crop insurance reform debate proceeds, I am hopeful my colleagues will be cognizant of the various needs in the agricultural community and recognize that while crop insurance is an important part of the safety net, it is not and should not be the only income guard for our Nation's farmers. 
   In Arkansas, the last estimates I heard indicated that fewer than 2 percent of our cotton producers were participating in the buy-up program. Buy-up coverage for all commodities in Arkansas historically is below 20 percent. That tells me the producers in my home State don't think crop insurance is currently providing the kind of help they need. 
   In the South, we traditionally grow capital-intensive crops. As we have  grown these crops in the past, and certainly as we will in the future, the way the current Crop Insurance Program is structured, the rating program has never suited our needs or made it a good business decision for southern farmers to purchase crop insurance. This bill establishes a process for reevaluating crop insurance rates for all crops and for lowering those rates if warranted. 
   It was only after pressure from Congress last year that the risk management agency reduced rates by as much as 50 percent for cotton in Arkansas and the Midsouth. The provision included in today's bill will require further review of all southern commodities in the rating structure. By making the Crop Insurance Program more affordable, additional producers will be encouraged to participate in the program and protect themselves against the unforeseeable factors that will be working against them once they put a crop into the ground. This is the ultimate goal, to get more participation in our insurance program. 
   The bill also provides for an enhanced subsidy structure so producers are encouraged to buy up from their current level of coverage. The structure included in this bill will make the step from catastrophic to buy-up easier for producers and will make obtaining the highest level of coverage easier for those who are already participating in the Crop Insurance Program. 
   In an attempt to improve the recordkeeping process within USDA, this legislation also requires that FSA and RMA coordinate their recordkeeping activities. Current USDA recordkeeping, split between FSA and the RMA, is redundant and insufficient. By including both Crop Insurance Program participants and nonprogram participants in the process, we hope to enhance the agricultural data held by the agency and make acreage and yield reporting less of a hassle for already overburdened producers. 
   In addition, this bill establishes a role for consultation with State FSA committees in the introduction of new coverage to a State. The need for this provision was made abundantly clear to Arkansas' rice producers last spring. 
   A private insurance policy was offered to farmers at one rate, only to have the company reduce the rate once the amount of potential exposure was realized. 
   In my discussions with various executives from the company on this issue it became apparent that their knowledge of the rice industry was fairly minimal. Had they consulted with local FSA committees who had a working knowledge of the rice industry before introduction of the policy, the train wreck that occurred might have been stopped in its tracks. 
   I am pleased that another reform measure that I worked on has been included to help rice producers suffering losses caused by drought. 
   Recent droughts have left many Arkansas farmers with low reservoirs and depleting aquifers. If rains do not replenish them, an adequate irrigation supply may not exist by summer. 
   In addition, drought conditions in Louisiana have caused salt to intrude into the water supply used for irrigation on many farms. Current law states that rice is excluded from drought policies because it is irrigated. This is not equitable since rice producers do suffer losses due to drought. 
   I have worked with Senators BREAUX and LANDRIEU to provide these policies for our rice producers who are experiencing reduced irrigation opportunities due to the severe drought conditions that have plagued the South for the last two years. I am pleased that this provision has been included in the bill. I thank Senators LANDRIEU and BREAUX for their hard work on it. 
   Many of the problems associated with the crop insurance program have been addressed in previous reform measures. However, fraud and abuses are still present to some degree. 
   This bill strengthens the monitoring of agents and adjusters to combat fraud and enhances the penalties available to USDA for companies, agents and producers who engage in fraudulent activities. 
   There is simply no room for bad actors that recklessly cost the taxpayers money. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I was prepared during our committee markup earlier this month to offer an amendment related to a cooperative's role in the delivery of crop insurance. 
   I held off at that time due to concerns from the committee related to possible ``rebating'' ramifications and preemption of state law. 
   I am pleased that Senators KERREY and GRASSLEY, as well as the Risk Management Agency, were willing to work with me to include my amendment in this bill. 
   This amendment does nothing to preempt state law or even change current federal law. It simply provides that current approved business practices be maintained. 
   With the inclusion of my amendment Congress is recognizing the valuable role cooperatives play in the crop insurance program, specifically, encouraging producer participation in the crop insurance program, improving the delivery system for crop insurance, and helping to develop new and improved insurance products. 
   My amendment requires the Risk Management Agency to finalize regulations that would incorporate the currently approved business practices of cooperatives participating in the crop insurance program and to do so within 180 days of enactment of this act. 
   If farmer owned entities are not allowed to sell crop insurance, then anyone can sell crop insurance in America except an American farmer. Such a legal result would give the appearance that crop insurance is designed for a closed club to exploit farmers. 
   In my opinion, that appearance would inhibit broader use of crop insurance, which is the overall objective we have been trying to reach. I don't believe that such a result is the intent of those who have put so much effort into improving the Crop Insurance Program, and I am pleased our amendment has been worked in. 
   Mr. President, I personally want to thank all of the staff members of the committee and the industry representatives who have helped in this effort. It certainly doesn't happen without their long hours of work, diligence, and perseverance in making all of this come together. 
   Arkansas farmers have told me time and time again that crop insurance isn't affordable for the amount of coverage they receive. As the program currently exists, it does not make sound business sense to purchase crop insurance in our State. Since this reform process began, I have been working to correct this inequity. I hope the changes we make today will lead to a Crop Insurance Program that is equitable, affordable, and effective. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of paramount importance to this nation, how we educate our children. 
   We in the Senate have the difficult task before us of passing legislation that re-authorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which determines how the Federal Government allocates money to our public schools. 
   Unfortunately, all signs from the Committee point to yet another political stalemate and neither side appears to be pushing any closer toward common ground. 
   In hopes of breaking this unproductive dynamic, I have joined with a group of my moderate Democratic colleagues here in the Senate to promote a ``Third Way'' on ESEA, one that synthesizes the best ideas of both sides into a whole new approach to federal education policy. 
   We are calling this bill the ``Three R's'' and it is a bold effort at streamlining numerous Federal education programs and refocusing federal resources on raising academic achievement. This blueprint will give more funding and flexibility to local school districts, in exchange for greater accountability. 
   Mr. President, today I would like to specifically talk about the component of the bill that focuses on teacher quality. We call our bill the ``Three R's'' and a similar acronym can apply to our efforts to improve teacher quality. Our plan can best be summed up by ``Four R's'': recruiting, retention, resources, and above all ..... RESPECT. 
   The difficulty schools experience today in recruiting and retaining quality teachers is one of the most enormous obstacles facing our education system. We cannot expect students to be successful if they don't work with quality teachers; and we can't expect quality teachers to stay in the profession if they don't get adequate training, resources or respect. 
   Most experts agree that teacher quality is as important as any other factor in raising student achievement. The legislation we are introducing today would consolidate several teacher training initiatives into a single formula grant program for improving the quality of public school teachers, principals and administrators. 
   This proposal would increase professional development funding by 100 percent to $1.6 billion annually and target that funding to the neediest school districts. In my home State of Arkansas, this will mean an additional $12 million for teacher quality initiatives. 
   In addition, the ``Three R's'' would give States and school districts more flexibility to design effective teacher recruitment and professional development initiatives to meet their specific needs. 
   One overreaching goal we propose today is to require that all teachers be fully-qualified by 2005. Even the best teachers can't teach what they don't know or haven't learned themselves. To be successful, we must work harder to reduce out-of-field teaching and require educators to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the subjects they teach. 
   I have the highest respect for the teachers, principals, and superintendents who dedicate their talent and skills everyday to prepare our children for tomorrow. I think they have some of the hardest, and most important, jobs in the world. Our Nation's future, in large part, depends on the work that they do. Our teacher quality proposal is an example of how combining the concepts of increased funding, targeting, flexibility and accountability, we can join with state and local educators to give our children a high-quality education every child deserves. 
   I hope this plan will serve as a blueprint to improving public education as we enter into what is sure to be a lengthy and contentious ESEA debate.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to an issue of great concern to many people in my home state of Arkansas. 
   This week, I introduced a bill, S. 2041, to continue to promote the use of best management practices in the forestry industry by relieving this nation's private timberland owners of an impending unnecessary regulatory burden. 
   My bill would permanently prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from requiring water pollution control permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System for the forestry activities of site preparation, reforestation, thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control, harvesting operations, surface drainage, road construction and maintenance, and nursery operations. 
   Recently in El Dorado and Texarkana, Arkansas, literally thousands of private timberland owners came together to discuss and express their concerns about this new extension of EPA regulations and to learn of the potential impact they may have on their private property and private forests. 
   Simply put, my legislation will statutorily ensure that all forestry activities will remain as non-point sources in the eyes of the EPA. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has jurisdiction to protect the water quality of the United States by regulating point sources of water pollution. 
   Let me define what I mean when I speak of ``point'' and ``non-point'' sources of pollution. A point source of pollution is pollution from a single point such as an industrial plant's wastewater pipe or a wastewater drainage ditch. Non-point sources of pollution like rainfall runoff from a field or a forest cannot be defined as a set point. What is important here is that Congress, upon passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, very clearly did not give the EPA authority to regulate non-point sources of pollution. 
   The EPA's proposed revisions to the Total Maximum Daily Load requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, issued in September of last year, seeks to change this authority. This proposed regulation would enhance clean water by extending the NPDES point source TMDL water pollution rules to forestry activities. This would be accomplished by reclassifying forestry non-point sources of pollution as point sources of pollution. 
   The forestry activities included in my legislation have always been considered as non-point sources of water pollution and therefore not subject to EPA regulations. The EPA's new regulation change would require point source water pollution permits for all of these activities. In other words, these new regulations would require permits on the very things we want to promote in forestry--responsible harvesting and thinning operations, best management practices, 
   and reforestation. 
   I agree with the EPA's objective of cleaning up our nation's impaired rivers, lakes and streams, but firmly believe that its proposed revisions are not the best solution to the problem of clean water. Placing another unnecessary layer of regulation upon our nation's local foresters will only slow down the process of responsible forestry and the implementation of forestry Best Management Practices.  
   In Arkansas, we have a very successful Best Management Practices program for all forestry activities. In fact, over 85% of Arkansas' private timberland owners voluntarily adhere to these Best Management Practices to reduce water pollution from all forestry activities. 
   Let me restate that over 85% of Arkansas' private timberland owners voluntarily adhere to these Best Management Practices to reduce water pollution from all forestry activities. This is a wonderful example of where everyone works together to take care of their own environment and have been successful in their efforts! 
   The EPA's background for the new regulation states that these new requirements of obtaining water permits for forestry activities would take effect only if the state did not develop a satisfactory system of its own, or if a specific water body needed the regulation to remain clean. It also states that only 3 to 9 percent of all non-point source pollution comes from forestry-related activities. 
   Mr. President, let's talk through each of these forestry-related activities to find out just exactly what each includes as well as what a good Best Management Practices program does to combat potential pollution from each of these. 
   Site preparation. Generally, site preparation includes removing unwanted vegetation and other material when necessary and before any harvesting of timber can take place. Best Management Practices provide guidelines to minimize the use of equipment and disturbances near streams or other bodies of water, keep equipment out of streamside management zones, and minimize the movement and disturbance of soil. 
   Reforestation. Reforestation is simply the process of planting trees. Reforestation is the single process that prevents any further erosion of exposed soil. I can't see why we would want to slow down the reforestation process by implementing a permitting process. 
   Prescribed burning. Prescribed burning is done almost exclusively to prevent potential forest fires. In many of our nation's old growth forests, prescribed burning has prevented what would have been certain destruction of thousands of acres of beautiful forestland. We want to prevent forest fires for the loss of timber as well as for the potential loss of property and life. Best Management Practices provide guidelines for conducting prescribed burning operations and ensuring a minimal potential for erosion and forest fire. 
   Pest and fire control. If someone is trying to control a forest fire, why do we want to hinder their 
   efforts? For the same reason, we don't want our Nation's forests eaten up by bugs. 
   Harvesting operations including thinning and, when necessary, clear-cutting. This is the crux of the issue. Timber harvesting is the timber industry. Following Best Management Practices ensures that during any harvesting operation, extreme care is taken to prevent unnecessary water pollution. Best Management Practices encourage thinning of existing forests as opposed to clear-cutting of our Nation's forests. Thinning is going into a forest and removing only a small portion of the timber. 
   Surface drainage. Surface drainage through a forest is a naturally slow. And, following Arkansas' Best Management Practices, a buffer of trees must be left around all streams and rivers. 
   Road Maintenance and Construction. It is necessary to have forest roads to reach the available timber. Best Management Practices require the minimization of stream crossings, designing the road to be no wider than necessary, and building roads to minimize the adverse impacts of heavy rain. 
   Nursery Operations. To conduct any reforestation activities, you must have seedlings to plant. Best Management Practices for nurseries include minimizing soil disturbance, runoff, and chemical application. 
   Mr. President, the voluntary use of these and many, many other Best Management Practices in Arkansas have successfully reduced and prevented water pollution from all forestry activities. Our nation's private timberland owners should not be burdened with more unnecessary regulations when they are already voluntarily complying with Best Management Practices to effectively reduce water pollution. 
   Reasonable minds should prevail and agree on a common sense solution to promoting Best Management Practices in the forestry industry without unnecessary regulation and allow states like Arkansas to continue voluntarily implementing our successful best management practices.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I voted for final passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Act today because bankruptcy reform has been desperately needed in this country and I have worked throughout my public career to bring it about. This bill, however, is not without its problems. It is my sincere hope that the Bankruptcy bill that emerges from the Conference Committee will be just that, a Bankruptcy Bill. I believe that the non-bankruptcy and poison pill riders that were added to the bill on the floor should be stripped, or at least reformed in Conference, so that we can move forward on bankruptcy. Our country needs, and we owe to our constituents, a bankruptcy bill that the President will sign. 
   Mr. President, we made various amendments to this bill which should be readdressed in Conference and changed. For instance, I am pleased that this body passed an increase in the minimum wage for working families in Arkansas. However, I urge my Colleagues in Congress to strengthen this provision in Conference implementing the $1.00 increase over two years instead of three. 
   I also support tax cuts, however, the tax cuts in this bill are not paid for and will do nothing to help small business and working people. I am especially disappointed that this body failed to pass the needed estate tax relief for family farms and small businesses that was included in the tax amendment offered by the Minority. 
   The Senate also agreed to an amendment during consideration of this bill designed to combat the spread of methamphetamine use in rural and urban areas. While I agree we must do something to stop the terrible spread of meth use in our country, I voted against that amendment because, as the language stands, it will allow federal education funding to be spent for tuition at private and religious schools. Everyone wants to fight the scourge of drugs. Let's have a clean amendment so we can move forward as a nation and fight against methamphetamine with a concerted effort. 
   These are just a few examples of what needs to be fixed in this bill. If we really want bankruptcy reform to become a reality we have to craft a bill that the President will sign. Without a hard working conference and bipartisan efforts, this can't possibly happen. I urge my colleagues to work together to bring a clean bill back from the conference, and to bring needed bankruptcy reform home to the American people.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the achievements of a distinguished member of the Arkansas medical community. Dr. M. Gazi Yasargil is recognized worldwide for his work in the field of Neurosurgery and we in Arkansas are fortunate to benefit from his talents. Dr. Yasargil's contributions to his field were recently acclaimed when Neurosurgery, the official journal of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, recognized him as ``The Man of the Century.'' This honor acknowledges Dr. Yasargil's significant impact on the field of neurosurgery in the second half of the 20th century. 
   Professor Yasargil received his medical degree from the University of Basel, Switzerland, in 1950. Following his residency in neuroanatomy, psychiatry and neurology, internal medicine and general surgery, he began his training in neurosurgery in 1953 with Professor H. Krayenbuhl at the University Hospital, Zurich. 
   During the first decade of his career Professor Yasargil was involved with the development of cerebral angiography, publishing two monographs with his teacher, Professor H. Krayenbuhl. He introduced stereotactic surgery and high-frequency coagulation technique into Switzerland and operated on 800 patients for movement disorders. Additionally, Yasargil routinely performed all types of conventional neurosurgical procedures on both children and adults. Professor Yasargil spent 14 months in 1965-66 with Professor RMP Donaghy, in the Neurosurgical Department, University of Burlington, Vermont, where he learned microsurgical techniques in the animal laboratory, and developed microvascular surgery of brain arteries in animals. Upon his return to Zurich he began to apply the microtechnique to the entire field of neurosurgery. He developed the counter balanced operating microscope and numerous microsurgical instruments and vascular clips; he pioneered microsurgical approaches and treatments for occluded brain arteries, intracranial aneurysms, AVMs, caveronmas, and extrinsic and intrinsic tumors of the brain and spinal cord, in 7000 adults and 400 children. His surgical experiences have been published in 330 papers. The six volume publication Microneurosurgery is the comprehensive review of his broad experiences. 
   In 1973, Professor Yasargil became Chairman and Director of the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital, Zurich, until his retirement in 1993. He was President of the Neurosurgical Society of Switzerland 1973-75. Professor Yasargil has been awarded with honorary medical degrees by the Universities of Ankara and Istanbul in Turkey, also with honorary citizenship of Austin, Texas, and Urgup, Turkey, and honorary membership in 15 international medical societies. Professor Yasargil has received major awards and prizes including the highly regarded Marcel Benoit Prize from the Swiss Federal Government in 1975, Medal of Honor of the University of Naples, Italy, in 1988, Gold Medal of the World Federation of Neurological Societies in 1997, and he was honored as ``Neurosurgeon of the Century'' by the Brazilian Neurosurgical Society in 1998.  
   In 1994 Professor Yasargil accepted an appointment as Professor of Neurosurgery at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in Little Rock where today he is active in the practice of microneurosurgery, research, and teaching. At UAMS, Dr. Yasargil has consistently provided superior treatment and care, attracting patients from all over the world. At the same time, he has continued to guide ground-breaking research initiatives and develop innovative surgical procedures. 
   Madam President, I take great pride in recognizing Dr. Yasargil's contributions to the quality of the lives of so many people in my home state and others around the world. I am equally proud of the quality care and cutting edge medical service the people at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences provide so that Dr. Yasargil can share his talents. UAMS has been the state's primary source for healthcare education, biomedical and biotechnology research and clinical care for more than 100 years. The quality work and service that UAMS and Dr. Yasargil continue to provide should be a great source of pride for Arkansans.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, for the last six years I have worked in Congress to provide relief from liability to legitimate recyclers. Congress never intended to create a disincentive to recycle when it created the Superfund program, and for that reason, I am delighted that this legislation was included in the omnibus appropriations bill. 
   In addition, I agree with Senator DASCHLE's clarification of the intent of this bill. I am very concerned about the possibility that this legislation could be misinterpreted to relieve from Superfund liability persons who release radioactive material to recyclers, such as those in the steel industry in my home state of Arkansas, who may be unaware of the danger of the products they are receiving, and who could in turn pass it on to consumers. I believe it is critical that we further clarify that this was not intended, and I am hopeful that the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader will work with me to do so.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today is a historic day in the United States Senate. With the inclusion of the Superfund Recycling Equity Act in the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, we have righted a wrong to the recycling industry of this Nation. We have removed the Superfund bias against recycled materials and set this country back on a path to promoting reuse of all recyclable materials. The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 will finally place traditional recyclable materials which are used as feedstocks in the manufacturing process on an equal footing with their virgin, or primary feedstock, counterparts. Traditional recyclables are made from paper, glass, plastic, metals, batteries, textiles, and rubber. 
   Mr. President, we have been working to right this wrong for over six years. During the 103d Congress, I first introduced a bill to relieve legitimate recyclers of scrap metal from unintended Superfund liability. The bill was developed in conjunction with the recycling industry, the environmental community, and the Administration. We worked closely together and consistently agreed that liability relief for recyclers is necessary and right. The language in this bill is the culmination of a process that we have been working on since 1993. 
   As I'm sure you can see, Mr. President, the push to relieve these legitimate recyclers of this unintended liability has received broad, bipartisan support. This bill has received 67 co-sponsors in the Senate this year and thanks to the strong leadership of Senators LOTT, DASCHLE, CHAFEE, and WARNER, we have successfully brought this important piece of legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. President, as the sponsoring member of this legislation when I was a member of the House of Representatives, I would like to make a couple of important points. First, this Superfund Recycling Equity Act is both retroactive and prospective. Slightly different standards must be met for recyclers to be relieved of Superfund liability for recycling transactions that occurred prior to the date of enactment than for those that occur after the date of enactment. But in either scenario, legitimate recyclers of paper, glass, plastic, metals, textiles, and rubber will no longer be treated as if they were ``arranging for the disposal'' of materials containing hazardous substances each time they sell their materials as manufacturing feedstocks. Rather, they will be treated as if they were selling a product, which is the same standard to which suppliers of virgin materials are held. Virgin materials are in direct competition with recyclables and this legislation will help to increase recycling in our nation. 
   Recognizing that this issue has been the focus of much litigation, the Congress intended that the recycling situation be clarified through the Superfund Recycling Equity Act. That is why we have written this legislation in such a fashion that virtually all lawsuits that deal with recycling transactions of paper, glass, plastic, metals, textiles, and rubber are extinguished by this legislation. Only those lawsuits brought prior to enactment of this legislation directly by the United States government against a person will remain viable. All other lawsuits brought by private parties, or against third party defendants in lawsuits originally brought by the U.S. Government will no longer proceed under this legislation. This will resolve the inequities suffered by recyclers in a quick, fair, and equitable manner. 
   It should also be reiterated that this bill addresses the product of recyclers, that is the recyclables they sell which are utilized to make new products. This does not affect liability for contamination that is created at a facility owned or operated by a recycler. Neither does it affect liability related to any process wastes sent by a recycler for treatment or disposal. In order to assure that only bonafide recycling facilities benefit from this bill, a number of tests have been established within the bill by which liability relief will be denied to sham recyclers. 
   With the passage of this important legislation, we have taken a bold step in the right direction for America. We have taken a step to promote legitimate recycling and to put recycled materials on an equal footing with new materials. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, a week ago today, President Clinton signed S. 900, The Financial Services  Modernization Act. Beyond the obvious positive implications that this legislation has for the bankers of my state of Arkansas, there is a provision in the bill that I rise to speak of today that has been a long time in coming and will finally bring fairness to Arkansas' banking market. 
   Section 731 of the Financial Services Modernization Act is titled ``Interest Rates and Other Charges at Interstate Branches.'' This section was not included in the original version of S. 900 that passed this body, but with the support of the entire Arkansas congressional delegation it was added to the House version, and retained in the conference committee. Because of the importance of this provision to my state, because of the role that both Arkansas Senators played in protecting this provision in the conference committee, and because there was no debate on the provision in the Senate, I will speak briefly on the history that led to this new law, and the reason it was so vitally needed. 
   With the passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act several years ago, the question arose as to which state law concerning interest rates on loans would apply to branches of interstate banks operating in a ``host state.'' Would those branches be governed by the interest rate ceiling of the charter location or that of their physical location? The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation addressed this issue with opinions that basically gave branches of interstate banks the option of being governed by either their home or host state requirements concerning interest rates by structuring the loan process to meet certain requirements. 
   In Arkansas this had a profound effect upon the local banking community. Under Article 19, Section 13 of the Arkansas Constitution, the state places the maximum rate that can be charged for many classes of loans at 5% above the Federal Reserve Discount Rate. However, over 40% of the banking locations in Arkansas are non-Arkansas based interstate banks, and were, in effect, not governed by this constitutional provision after Riegle-Neal became the law of the land. The out of state banks were able to price freely, while Arkansas banks were bound by the usury restrictions in the Arkansas Constitution. This placed Arkansas banks at a significant competitive disadvantage. 
   In light of this clear inequity, and because, if left uncorrected, my state could have lost virtually all of its local community banks, the Arkansas delegation wholly supported the language of Section 731 that provides our local banks with loan pricing parity in all regards with non-Arkansas interstate banks operating branches in Arkansas. Remedying this disparity was our intent, Mr. President, and I am pleased that my colleagues supported its inclusion in the Financial Services Modernization Act. 
   The local banks in Arkansas play such an important role in the small and rural communities they serve. Not only do they provide the capital that fuels the local economy, but they are always out front in charity and community service. You always see their names in the back of the football program, or leading the drive to buy the new band uniforms. The local bankers in my state are much more than business men and women, they are neighbors and friends, and dedicated to their homes. 
   In short, Mr. President, Congress put Arkansas banks at a severe competitive disadvantage with the passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act. The entire Arkansas delegation, therefore, considered it appropriate, if not our duty, to work to rectify this inequity here in Congress where it was created. I am glad we were successful.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the 570,000 satellite viewers in the State of Arkansas who would like to watch local news broadcasts over their satellite dishes. Since I began serving in the Senate in January, I have received more phone calls, letters, and postcards regarding satellite television service than about Federal spending, crime, health care, or many of the other important issues we have debated this year. 
   Many constituents complained to me earlier this year after they lost some of their network signals due to a court order. Others have been worried they will lose part of their service by December 31. I have kept all of these constituents informed about developments with the bill that would let them keep their full satellite service. 
   When we passed the bill--which most people refer to as the Satellite Home Viewer Act--by unanimous consent in May, I told my constituents their problems would soon be resolved. Then, as the summer days got shorter and the leaves began to fall, I told them to just be patient. I said, ``It will be just a few more weeks,'' because members of the conference committee had begun to meet. 
   Now, as we rush to conclude the legislative session, my constituents, and millions of others across the country, are still waiting. I now share their anger with what they perceive as Washington interfering with their access to information and entertainment. I have been told there is only one Senator who is holding up the process of passing a bill that would permit satellite viewers to receive local network signals over their satellite dishes. This is especially frustrating considering the House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved a bill by a vote of 411-8. 
   In my opinion, it is so unreal that those who stand in the way of this legislation would think that as we rush to finish the important task of funding the Federal Government, they can kill this bill in the 11th hour and no one will notice. I am here to bear witness that people will notice. As many as 50 million people will notice because that is how many people risk losing part of their satellite service if we do not complete action on the satellite bill before the end of this session. 
   The satellite TV conference report is the product of hard-fought and very extensive negotiation among conferees. The provision that one Senator has expressed concerns about is especially important for residents of rural States. The local broadcast signal provision in the satellite bill would create a loan  guarantee to bring local channels via satellite into small television markets. Without this loan guarantee, there is little chance that any corporation will make a business decision to launch a satellite that would enable it to beam local television signals into rural communities. Local broadcasters provide people with local news and vital details about storm warnings and school closings. People in rural communities need access to this information. They deserve no less. 
   It is important to note that this loan guarantee will not cost the taxpayers 1 cent because a credit risk premium would cover any losses from default on the federally backed private loan. 
   This rural provision should stay in the satellite bill, and we should vote on this bill in the light of day rather than sneaking a whittled-down version into an omnibus package. 
   I hold in my hand a letter signed by a bipartisan group of 24 Senators urging the majority leader to file cloture on and proceed to the satellite bill. After we delivered the letter, five additional Senators called my office seeking to sign it. I understand that another letter supporting the rural provision may be circulating as I speak. 
   Mr. President, I urge the majority leader to listen to the will of the people and to the majority of the Members of this body. Let us vote on this today.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senator from Louisiana in calling upon our colleagues in the Senate, as well as the Administration, to capitalize on the momentum provided by the House Resources Committee last week in passing the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. We must not let this opportunity slip away to enact what may well be the most significant conservation effort of the century. 
   As part of any discussion into utilizing revenues from Outer Continental Shelf oil drilling to fund conservation programs, I want to ensure that wildlife programs are kept among the priorities of the debate. Specifically, I want to comment upon the importance of funding for wildlife conservation, education, and restoration efforts as provided in both the House and Senate versions of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. This funding would be administered as a permanent funding source through the successful Pittman-Robertson Act. 
   This program enjoys a great deal of support including a coalition of nearly 3,000 groups across the country known as the Teeming with Wildlife Coalition. Also, this funding would be provided without imposing new taxes. Funds will be allocated to all 50 states for wildlife conservation of non-game species, with the principal goal of preventing species from becoming endangered or listed under the Endangered Species Act. 
   In my home state of Arkansas, we have recognized the importance of funding conservation and management initiatives. The people of Arkansas were successful in passing a one-eighth cent sales tax to fund these types of programs. As I'm sure is true all across this country, people don't mind paying taxes for programs that promote good wildlife management and help keep species off of the Endangered Species List. 
   By taking steps now to prevent species from becoming endangered, we are not only able to conserve the significant cultural heritage of wildlife enjoyment for the people of this country, but also to avoid the substantial costs associated with recovery for endangered species. In fact, all 50 states would benefit as a result of the important link between these wildlife education-based initiatives and the benefits of wildlife-related tourism. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to make  this historic legislation a reality upon our return early next year.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American and an honored daughter of Arkansas. Daisy Gaston Bates was an author, a newspaper publisher, a public servant, a community leader. And some would say most importantly, a civil rights activist. Mrs. Bates passed away last Thursday and we in the great state of Arkansas are celebrating the life of one of our greatest citizens. 
   Mrs. Bates believed in justice and equality for all of us. No doubt it was that love of freedom and equality that compelled her crusade in 1957 for the rights of nine African-American children to attend Little Rock's all-white Central High School. Daisy Bates played a central role, as Arkansas president of the National Association of Colored People, in the litigation that lead up to that confrontation on the school steps. This was a defining moment in the history of the civil rights movement. 
   According to her own accounts and those of the Little Rock Nine, the students would gather each night at the Bates' home to receive guidance and strength. It was through the encouragement of Daisy Bates and her husband that these young men and women were able to face the vicious and hateful taunts of those so passionately opposed to their attendance at Central High. 
   Mrs. Bates and her husband, L.C., also published a newspaper, the Arkansas State Press, which courageously published accounts of police brutality against African-Americans in the 1940's and took a stance for civil rights. Eventually, Central High was integrated and Daisy and her husband were forced to close their newspaper because of their civil rights stance. Advertisers withdrew their business and the paper suffered financial hardships from which it could not recover. She and L.C. were threatened with bombs and guns. They were hanged in effigy by segregationists. 
   But Daisy Bates persevered. She did all this, withstood these challenges, because she loved children and she loved her country. She had an internal fire, instilled in her during a childhood spent in Huttig, Arkansas. And this strong character shone through as she willingly took a leadership role to battle the legal and political inequities of segregation in our state and the nation. 
   Mrs. Bates continued to work tirelessly in anti-poverty programs, community development and neighborhood improvement. She published a book, for which another remarkable woman, Eleanor Roosevelt, wrote the introduction. Daisy also spent time working for the Democratic National Committee and for President Johnson's administration. 
   Many people honored Daisy Bates during her lifetime. In 1997, Mrs. Bates received for her courage and character, the Margaret Chase Smith Award, named after the second woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate. Daisy Bates carried the Olympic torch from a wheelchair during the 1996 Atlanta games. Many more, I am sure, will honor her after her death. I am proud to honor her today in the U.S. Senate. 
   Mrs. Bates will lie in state on Monday at the State Capitol Rotunda in Little Rock. Ironically, this is only blocks away from the school where that famous confrontation occurred in 1957. And in another twist of fate, the Little Rock Nine are scheduled to receive Congressional Gold Medals in a White House ceremony with President Bill Clinton this Tuesday, the very same day Daisy Bates will be laid to rest. 
   This great woman leaves a legacy to our children, our state and our nation; a love of justice, freedom and the right to be educated. A matriarch of the civil rights movement has passed on but I'm encouraged by the words of her niece, Sharon Gaston, who said, ``Just don't let her work be in vain. There's plenty of work for us to do.'' 
   Mr. President, there is still much work to be done to bring complete civil rights and equality to our nation. Today, as we pause to remember Daisy Gaston Bates, I hope we will be renewed and refreshed in our efforts.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I support the Minimum Wage Proposal offered by Senator KENNEDY because it is fair and responsible. It provides a minimum wage increase to 228,000 Arkansans and 11 million workers nationwide, most of whom are women. It provides important tax relief directly to small businesses to help defray costs of a wage hike. And, perhaps most importantly, it pays for the tax cuts by: offsetting tax adjustments on large estates valued at $17 million and above, which the Senate voted overwhelming to do in 1997; extending the tax imposed on corporate income for Superfund, which I hope will encourage Superfund reform, and closing corporate tax shelters, which Congress has been trying to do since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. 
   A $1 increase in the minimum wage over 2 years is needed to restore the purchasing power or real value of the minimum wage, which has been greatly diminished over the last 20 years by inflation. In the United States, 59% of workers who will gain from a wage increase are women; 70% are adults age 20 and over, and 40% are the sole breadwinners for their families. The bottom line--this proposal will generate $2,000 in additional income each year for full-time minimum wage workers. As a mother of two young children who balances the check book every month and shops at the supermarket each week, I honestly don't know how a single parent who makes $5.15 an hour can feed their family and provide other basic necessities for their children. 
   I am also very supportive of the tax relief provisions in this amendment which will help those who will be most affected by a minimum wage increase--small business owners and family farmers. This common sense package will expand access to health insurance by letting self-employed individuals deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs, a proposal I have supported for many years. I believe providing 100 percent deductibility now to small business owners and independent farmers is more urgent today than ever as our country experiences one of the worst farm crises in recent memory. Furthermore, I have never understood why we deny a benefit to sole proprietors that is currently available to many large corporations. 
   This package also includes another priority of mine--estate tax relief for family owned-farms and small business. Too often those who inherit a business or family farm from a relative must liquidate all or a portion of the property just to pay the estate tax which is owed. 
   Another provision will help business owners provide child care assistance to their employees by allowing a 25% tax credit for qualified costs. In addition, this amendment will encourage investment in economically depressed areas like the Delta region in Arkansas and strengthen retirement security for workers by reducing small businesses' cost of setting up employee pension plans. 
   Finally, I am hopeful that extending the tax imposed on corporate income for Superfund will be an added incentive to roll up our sleeves and pass meaningful Superfund reform legislation. I have worked on this issue since I came to Congress in 1993. I and millions of Americans are still waiting for Congress to fulfill its responsibility. I am sorry that our former colleague Senator Chafee, who was very passionate about this issue, died before Congress addressed Superfund reform. 
   But before I yield the floor, I want to emphasize an important aspect of this plan that should not go unnoticed--it is paid for and does not threaten our government's ability to meet future obligations to Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries. Republicans and Democrats have knocked themselves out over the last year trying to blame each other for spending the Social Security trust fund, so I fail to understand how we can consider a proposal which costs $75 billion over ten years with virtually no means to pay for it. That is irresponsible and I can't support it. 
   In short, Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment is a common sense proposal that is good for both employers and employees and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will stand with me in supporting this legislation. 
   I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, mere words seem inadequate to honor the courage of some people and so I am humbled to lend my voice to the chorus of praise for the Little Rock Nine, who today will receive the Congressional Gold Medal, and I will also speak in remembrance of Daisy Bates, a daughter of Arkansas and a civil rights activist. 
   Receiving the medal today are: Jean Brown Trickery, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wait, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas. As teenagers, when they bravely walked through the doors of Central High School in Little Rock, they led our Nation one step closer to social justice and equality. While it is still painful to look at pictures from that time, where white teens sneered at their black peers, seeing the harsh face of hatred opened our Nation's eyes and propelled the civil rights movement forward. 
   Before the ``Crisis of 1957,'' as some call the events at Central High, Little Rock was not associated with the pervasive segregation of the Deep South. In fact, Little Rock was considered quite a progressive place and some schools in Arkansas had already integrated following the Brown v. Board of Education decision in May of 1954. So, when nine students sought to integrate Central, few Arkansans envisioned a confrontation with the National Guard at the schools entrance. And I doubt many imagined the long-lasting, profound effects of this confrontation on the entire State. While the country witnessed countless images of this face-off, they were not necessarily aware of the continuing abuse endured by the Little Rock Nine, or the fact that Central High School had to be closed because the atmosphere was so hostile. 
   Now, we all know that the high school years aren't easy for any teenager. For these men and women, high school was inordinately difficult. In addition to enduring the verbal taunts and even beatings, some had to uproot to other schools in the middle of the school year. Luckily for Carlotta, Thelma, Ernest, Jefferson, and the others, a woman named Daisy Bates entered their lives as a ``guardian angel'' of sorts. 
   According to Daisy's own accounts and those of the Little Rock Nine, the students would gather each night at the Bates' home to receive guidance and strength. It was through the encouragement of Daisy Bates and her husband, L.C., that these young men and women were able to face the vicious and hateful actions of those so passionately opposed to their attendance at Central. Ironically, Daisy Bates passed away last Thursday. She was laid to rest this morning, the very day the Little Rock Nine will receive their medals. I know she is with us in spirit--acting again as a guardian angel to these brave men and women. This great woman leaves a legacy to our children, our State and our Nation: a love of justice, freedom, and the right to be educated. As a result of her efforts, the newspaper Mrs. Bates and L.C. published was forced to close. She and L.C. were threatened with bombs and guns. They were hanged in effigy by segregationists. But Daisy Bates persevered. She did all this, withstood these challenges, because she loved children and she loved her country. She had an internal fire, instilled in her during a childhood spent in Huttig, AR. And this strong character shone through as she willingly took a leadership role to battle the legal and political inequities of segregation in our state and the nation. 
   Many have called that confrontation at Central High an historic moment, a pivotal moment, a defining moment.  But it was more than just one moment. When these nine men and women walked into Central High School, they opened more than a door, they opened the flood gates. For them and for the rest of our country, the battle didn't end at the schoolhouse steps. Their struggle lasted for years and, in reality, it still continues. My husband and I are both products of an integrated public school system in Arkansas. We are personally grateful to the Little Rock Nine for making our school experience rich with diversity. I truly value the lifelong lessons that I learned at an early age and I might not have had the wonderful privilege of studying with children of all races were it not for the Little Rock Nine. There is still much work to be done to bring complete civil rights and equality to our Nation. 
   Today, as we pause to remember Daisy Bates and to honor the Little Rock Nine, I hope we will be renewed and refreshed in or efforts. I'm encouraged by the words of Daisy Bates' niece, Sharon Gaston, who said, ``Just don't let her work be in vain. There's plenty of work for us to do.''I hope my colleagues will join me in extending appreciation and commendation to the Little Rock Nine. And in remembering a matriarch of the civil rights movement, Daisy Gaston Bates.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Financial Modernization Bill. After decades of unsuccessful tries, it appears that financial modernization legislation may finally become a reality. As we move into the next millennium, I believe it is important that the financial service structure in this country is up to par with the rest of the world so that American finance can continue to lead internationally. 
   The thing that impresses me the most about this bill, Mr. President, is not the way it will strengthen American financial markets and allow this important sector of our economy to grow with the technology of the age. It's not even that we will close the Unitary Thrift Loophole, or that we will maintain the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure that low income and minority communities in my home state of Arkansas will continue to have access to the capital needed to create jobs and increase incomes. What impresses me most, Mr. President, is the way we are going about passing it. When I vote for this bill later today, I feel like I will have weighed all the issues and had the opportunity to actually work to make it better for the people of my state. We deliberated, discussed, and fought over the merits of the legislation--not just parliamentary tactics. This bill was scrutinized by Senator SARBANES and Senator GRAMM and all of my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee before it ever got to the floor. Before it was even put on the calendar, it was subject to the judgement and the intellect of these men, whose esteem I hold in the highest regard. 
   After this bill came out of committee and to the floor, we were able to offer and vote on amendments to adjust and strengthen the bill. I supported some amendments that passed, and I supported some that failed, but what is important is that my votes and the votes of my colleagues were registered and the conferees were able to gauge the Senate's support for these provisions. This allowed for compromise, Mr. President, and at the end of the day it allowed for a bill that a majority of the Senate can and, I predict, will support.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two outstanding companies in Arkansas that were named last month as two of America's 10 best manufacturing plants in North America by Industry Week magazine. This dual achievement is impressive and stands as a testament to the strong work ethic and pride in workmanship that exists among Arkansas workers. 
   Scroll Technologies of Arkadelphia and Eaton Corporation's Aeroquip Global Hose Division in Mountain Home were selected from over 400 plants that were considered for this award. Applicants were judged on productivity, workplace safety, community involvement, customer and supplier relations, product quality and innovation in technology. 
   Scroll Technologies, which manufactures air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, employs 575 workers and is one of the most advanced production plants of its kind. This company's success is founded upon management-employee partnerships, its highly skilled workforce and a strong commitment to workplace safety. Scroll Technologies can also be proud of its sound environmental record. 
   Eaton Corporation's Aeroquip Global Hose Division opened for business in 1975 and now employs 285 workers in Northwest Arkansas. Eaton-Aeroquip manufactures hydraulic hoses used in large trucks and tractors. This company has succeeded by abandoning the traditional, hierarchical manufacturing process and adopting an organizational structure based on 50 employee teams. Team members are encouraged to give candid feedback about all aspects of the plant's operations and are rewarded with performance based bonuses. 
   I have always said that Arkansas' greatest asset is its people. I am glad that Scroll Technologies and Eaton-Aeroquip have taken advantage of this resource and become valuable corporate-citizens in my state. I am proud to honor their achievements in the U.S. Senate today. I hope their well-earned success sends a signal to other companies in Arkansas and the nation that Arkansas is a good place for industry to do business.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the people of Arkansas to express my extreme disappointment, frustration, and bewilderment with our ineffectiveness in the manipulation of the Senate. Today, I was supposed to be touring the former Eaker Air Force Base site in Blytheville, AR, with numerous officials from the National Park Service as well as other State and local leaders. This is a meeting we have worked on for months to arrange, understanding there might be legislative business today. 
   The community is united in its effort to have this former military base converted into a Mississippi Valley archeological facility and research center. The benefits this project will bring to northeastern Arkansas are enormous, and I had hoped to be there today to again demonstrate my support to the entire community and the Park Service and to urge a favorable decision by the Park Service. 
   I also had several other appointments scheduled with various constituents in the State, but I had to cancel all these meetings to be here for scheduled votes. I thought we might vote on key trade initiatives and might even get to an appropriations bill. But these votes are, once again, delayed and may never occur. This is not the first time I have had to cancel meetings or events on critical issues with large groups of constituents in Arkansas to stay in Washington for votes, votes and work that never happened or were simply procedural or partisan. My constituents understand when I have to be in Washington to vote, but what they do not understand and what frustrates me is when I stay in Washington for votes and work that never occur. 
   I would understand, and would encourage a great deal, if we were delaying debate so Members could travel to Rhode Island to pay tribute to our distinguished former colleague, John Chafee, a man whose presence in the Senate made this entire body a more respectful and enjoyable place, a truly bipartisan, wonderful colleague I enjoyed working with so very much and a great leader, one who I think would be proud to see us working to come to conclusion and bring about results on behalf of the American people. But this is not the case. There is no reason we should not be working and voting today. 
   October 29, today, was our target adjournment day. We could be and should be done. We have just voted our third continuing resolution. We could have been working in the Senate to come to conclusion. Five spending bills still remain, including funding for education and health care, which I think should have been our very first priority in the Senate. It is clear to everyone involved why this mess keeps happening, why we are not getting anywhere. The majority is trying to override the true design of the Senate. They are limiting debate. They are refusing amendments and pulling legislation off the floor to mute the voices of the minority. I have great concern with that. 
   I was elected to this body in November of 1998. I came to serve in 1999, during a historical situation that caused each of us to research and understand what the constitutional responsibilities of this body are about, to understand the design of this body. I was a Member of the House of Representatives. The Senate is called the upper Chamber, the deliberative body, for a very good reason. We are supposed to be above all of this. We are not the House. We should not operate as the House. We should be operating as a deliberative body, debating the issues, bringing out the concerns of each individual in this body, especially since just last night the House voted to gut Social Security by $17 billion. What an important issue to the people of America. 
   We have a lot of difficult decisions before us, decisions we should be debating, we should be making, and not postponing. I call on the leadership and on my colleagues in the Senate, again, let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work. The American people deserve no less.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Late Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1999. 
   I would like to thank Senator DURBIN for working with me and others who oppose later term abortions like the procedure being discussed today, which some have called partial-birth abortion. 
   Let me start by saying that this is a difficult issue for anyone to discuss. And it is an emotional issue. It is not easy for any of us in this Chamber to discuss terminating a pregnancy. 
   As a mother who has gotten infinite joy from twin 3-year-old boys and was blessed with a safe and healthy natural delivery, it is an especially sensitive topic for me. 
   Like many of the people that I represent in Arkansas, I do not believe the so-called partial-birth abortion should be an elective procedure. 
   We should put an end to all forms of abortion after viability except in cases where a late term abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother or when ``grievous injury'' could harm the mother. 
   Congress has attempted to eliminate what some people call partial-birth abortions in the past. And 30 states have enacted similar legislation. But most efforts to end this horrific procedure have been unsuccessful thus far because the courts have overturned them. 
   As I have shown during debate on HMO reform and tax reform, I am result-oriented. I believe we're here to get things done, to effect change, instead of scoring political points. 
   For that reason, I have chosen to support Senator DURBIN's approach to eliminating late term abortions because Senator DURBIN has taken care of the concerns raised by courts and because this legislation will actually reduce the number of late term abortions. 
   I should point out that, while serving in the House of Representatives, I twice voted in favor of a ban on partial-birth abortions, expressing my concern that the life and serious health of the mother be considered. 
   Much has happened since then. Nineteen courts have overturned laws very similar to the one I supported. Some rule that the term ``partial-birth abortion'' is too vague. 
   While I am not a lawyer, I understand the courts' point because all of the doctors I have discussed this issue with tell me that there is no such procedure as partial birth abortion. 
   In addition, the courts have noted that states cannot regulate or prohibit abortion prior to viability. So it is very important, if we want results from this debate, to specify that we are talking about post-viability. 
   Senator DURBIN has corrected these prior legislative flaws by referring to abortions after viability rather than partial-birth abortions. 
   In addition, the Durbin late term abortion ban would eliminate elective late term abortions by requiring not one but two doctors to certify the need for a late term abortion to save the life or serious health of the mother. 
   I support the Durbin amendment because if Senators really want to ensure that we stop late term abortions, then we should pass legislation that can stand the test of the courts. 
   The Durbin amendment could stand the test and become law. It has the best chance of producing results. 
   So if results are what we're looking, if stopping late term abortions--including the so-called partial-birth abortions--is our goal, then this is the right option. 
   If we vote for other vague measures, we will be right back here next year, and the next year, still debating this issue--without results. 
   Let's do the right thing and ban unnecessary late term abortions by voting for the Durbin amendment which can stand up to federal court tests.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I plan to vote for the Agriculture Appropriations Bill today, and I would like to thank those who have helped move the ball down the field. But I'd like to state for the record my opposition to the Conference Committee's decision to remove language previously approved by the Senate that would have removed barriers to trade for domestic producers. 
   I am extremely disappointed and disheartened that this year's Agriculture Appropriations bill will not take steps to open up additional trade markets to domestic producers, especially after this body voted 70-28 to pass legislation that would exempt agricultural products from unilateral economic sanctions. 
   In short, Mr. President, a small handful of people have overturned the will of the majority by strong-arming Congress with decisions made behind closed doors. The Members who removed sanctions language from the Conference Report are the very same members who promoted the Freedom to Farm Act. It's beyond me how they expect Freedom to Farm to work when they remove the best chance for our farmers to compete in a global economy. 
   For months our farmers have been left hanging when it comes to disaster relief payments, loan guarantees and crop insurance reform. Producers in Arkansas should not be let down by Congress again. They should be looking forward to sending 300,000 metric tons of rice to Cuba next year. Arkansas producers have been particularly affected by trade sanctions with countries such as Cuba, Iran and Iraq. 
   According to Riceland executive Richard Bell, who testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee in May, ``Probably no domestic commodity or product has suffered more from these trade sanctions than rice. The sanctions towards Cuba in particular were a major blow to our industry, especially to growers in the South who produce long-grain rice.'' 
   There is bipartisan support for changes in the way this country considers economic and trade sanctions. So, in light of the conferees' decision to remove sanctions language, I hope my colleagues will take a serious look at cosponsoring S. 566, the Agricultural Trade Freedom Act, which would exempt exports of food and other agricultural products from any current or future U.S. unilateral sanctions imposed against a foreign government. I also encourage my colleagues to consider supporting S. 1523, The HOPE Act, which will require the President to justify how economic sanctions serve our national interests and to report to Congress on an annual basis the costs and benefits of food sanctions. 
   It's foolish to let our foreign policy objectives cloud common sense. Without access to foreign markets, we cannot expect the agricultural community to survive. Without a better long-term farm policy, it most certainly will not. 
   While this bill provides some relief, it doesn't go far enough. What we must do is give our farmers a consistent, workable agriculture policy. We must give them some idea of what they can count on from their government in terms of consistent farm policy. Repeatedly passing emergency disaster relief bills isn't the answer. And it is clear that Freedom to Farm has not  worked. According to today's Washington Post, ``Congress has now spent $19 billion more in the first four years of Freedom to Farm than it was supposed to spend during the bill's entire seven-year life-span.'' 
   This relief package will hopefully get several of our nation's producers through this growing season, but it does nothing to ease the minds of our agriculture community for next year. We've taken care of the short term needs of our agriculture community, I hope that my colleagues will soon take care of the long term.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have spoken several times this year about the need for our Nation to address juvenile violence. Today, I would like to commend another group that has joined the call to end violence. The American Medical Association Alliance has designated today as National SAVE Schools from Violence Day, and I would like to praise their efforts. 
   The AMA Alliance SAVE (Stop America's Violence Everywhere) campaign began in 1995 and comprises a grassroots effort of 700 local and state-level projects to curb violence. Through the campaign, the Alliance has created unique workbooks and activities for use as conflict resolution tools in classrooms across the country. One of their themes, Hands are not for hitting, catches children's attention by challenging them to come up with other uses for their hands. Rather than seeing their hands as weapons, children are reminded that their hands can be used for hugging, collecting bugs or coloring with crayons. 
   Another campaign theme, I Can Choose, teaches children that they can choose their attitudes and behavior. Other projects including I Can Be Safe and Be a Winner have been distributed nationwide. 
   Using its Hands are not for hitting campaign and others like it, the AMA is working to call attention to school safety and the way children interact. Nationally, the AMA hopes to reach 1 million children by the year 2000 with activities that help them manage anger and build self-esteem. This type of private sector involvement represents a key building block in our nation's commitment to providing a safe learning environment for our children.  
   Many of my colleagues know that I introduced the Safe Schools Act of 1999 to provide resources to public schools so they can remain safe and strong cornerstones of our communities. As we move into the 21st century, we must adapt our approach to education to meet the changing needs of students, teachers and parents. 
   Although I am one of the youngest members of the Senate, I grew up in Helena, Arkansas during what seemed to be a much simpler time. Our parents pulled together to make everyone's education experience a success. Students came to school prepared to learn. Teachers had control of their classroom. The threat of school violence was virtually non-existent. 
   Now, more than twenty years later, things are different--very different. Our children are subjected to unprecedented social stresses including divorce, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, poverty and an explosion of technology that has good and bad uses. 
   These stresses exhibit themselves in the behavior of teenagers, as well as in our young children. Increasingly, elementary school children exhibit symptoms of substance abuse, academic underachievement, disruptive behavior, and even suicide. 
   Although school shootings will probably not occur in a majority of our schools, each time we witness a tragedy like Jonesboro or Littleton, it makes us wonder if the next incident will be in our own home towns. 
   This is a very complex problem and there is no one single answer. It will take more than metal detectors and surveillance cameras to prevent the tragedies occurring in our schools. I believe the Safe Schools Act reflects the needs and wishes of students, parents, teachers and school administrators. 
   Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough mental health professionals working in our nation's schools. The American School Health Association recommends that the student-to-counselor ratio be 250:1. In secondary schools, the current ratio is 513:1. In elementary schools, the student-to-teacher ratio exceeds 1000:1. 
   Students today bring more to school than backpacks and lunchboxes--many of them bring severe emotional troubles. It is critical that schools be able to help our troubled students by teaching children new skills to cope with their aggression. 
   So, I commend the AMA Alliance for designating today as National SAVE Schools from Violence Day and encourage students, teachers, parents and the community to work together to make our schools safe.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to voice my support for a bill which addresses the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I am pleased to join my Democratic colleagues as an original cosponsor of the Medicare Beneficiaries Access to Care Act. 
   Since I've been in the Senate, one of the greatest concerns of Arkansans is the lowered Medicare reimbursement rate for a variety of services that resulted from the Balanced Budget Act. Yes, we must continue to rid our Medicare system of waste, fraud and abuse. That is a high priority for our government and it should remain so. However, when Medicare changes were made as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Members of Congress did not intend to wreak havoc on the health care industry. 
   Enough time has elapsed to know the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act. Hospitals have lost tremendous amounts of money due to changes in the outpatient prospective payment system. Many hospitals in my state are on the brink of closing due to the tremendous financial losses they have suffered. Nursing homes have not been reimbursed by Medicare at rates that cover the cost of patients with acute care needs. Payments for physical and rehabilitation therapy have been arbitrarily capped. Teaching hospitals have lost funding to support their training programs. Home health agencies have been forced to absorb huge losses and limit services to the elderly. Rural health clinics have been forced to cope with even more losses and operate on a shoestring budget. 
   Not only do these cuts and changes in Medicare reimbursement wreak havoc on the health care community and force them to absorb unfair financial losses, but Medicare beneficiaries, the very people that Medicare was set up to help, lose access to critical services. We cannot allow our parents and grandparents to be denied access to coverage or receive limited medicare care because we didn't take action to correct the devastating cuts of the Balanced Budget Act. 
   As a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus and a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I care deeply about the quality of health care and our citizens' access to health care. Over the past few months I have cosponsored various pieces of legislation which address all of the above-mentioned issues and the need to restore Medicare cuts. However, this legislation is ``all encompassing'' and if passed, would ensure that hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, physical therapy clinics, home health agencies, rural health clinics, and hospice programs receive important financial relief. 
   Above all, this legislation is about priorities. Ensuring the health and well-being of our Nation's seniors and most vulnerable citizens should be our highest priority. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this proposal and I look forward to the quick passage of this legislation so we can deliver relief to our health care communities and let them know how much we value their services.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I am here to express my disappointment in this process and the vote we are about to cast this afternoon. I will probably vote for the continuing resolution because I don't want to shut down the Government. I will also probably vote with the expectation that we will get our work done in the 3 following weeks. I am not happy about it, and I don't believe we have fulfilled our obligation and commitment to the American people. 
   For over 200 years, it has been the responsibility of Congress to pass the 13 appropriations bills that make the Federal Government tick. It is our only constitutionally mandated responsibility, the only thing we absolutely have to do. 
   We have had 9 months. In the same amount of time, I produced twins. It wasn't easy, but we did it. My chief of staff, unfortunately, had an accident at Christmas, has been through two major surgeries, and has made a resounding comeback, unbelievably. My legislative director has gotten married. She has finished law school and bought a home in those 9 months. Amazing things can be done if one actually works at them. 
   I came to Washington, sat through an impeachment trial, bought a house, and moved two 3-year-old boys, one husband, and a dog to Virginia so I could work in the Senate. It is time to get down to work. 
   I fully expect us to end this monkey business. To pass fair, thought-out appropriations bills within the next 3 weeks is certainly not something we should take for granted. 
   I will not support an omnibus appropriations package similar to the one passed last year. One of the most frightening stories I heard, when I first arrived in the Senate, was the process that happened in the last few days of the session last year when only a couple people came around a table and decided the budget for this entire Nation without the assent of all of those who should have been at that table. What an irresponsible way for us, as Government, to work on behalf of the American people. 
   This way of governing is absolutely irresponsible, ineffective, and it is not what I came here to do. I imagine many of my colleagues did not come here to act in such an irresponsible way. To do so is to sell the American people down the river. I hope my colleagues will put politics aside and get our business done, the only constitutional responsibility that we have in this body; that is, to take care of the American people's business. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Improved Maternal and Children's Health Coverage Act. I am joined by my colleagues Senator LANDRIEU, Senator GORDON SMITH, Senator EVAN BAYH and Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
   A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman DEGETTE and Congresswoman MORELLA. 
   This legislation is intended to help increase the coverage of uninsured children under the Children's Health Insurance Program, better known as CHIP. 
   Right now there are 10.7 million uninsured children in the United States. The goal of CHIP is to insure 5 million children nationally. 
   However, we have only enrolled 1.3 million of the targeted 5 million children so far. We can do better. We must do better. 
   Let's get rid of barriers to coverage! There are several simple, administrative changes that we can make in this legislation that will help break down the barriers to enrollment. 
   First, we can reduce the need for excessive documentation. States would be required to develop and use a uniform, simplified application form to determine eligibility for both Medicaid and CHIP. This means families only have to fill out one form. 
   Second, families would only have to deal with one state agency to establish eligibility for either program. It is unfair to make parents go from agency to agency to enroll for state health insurance coverage. 
   Third, we can do a better job making a greater variety of application sites available to families. Rather than only being able to apply at a state agency, states could opt to expand application site options. Let's take the application process to the places that parents and their children go on a regular basis--examples include schools and child care centers. 
   This bill also expands health insurance coverage options to pregnant women who do not qualify for Medicaid because their incomes are slightly above Medicaid guidelines. Thousands of pregnant women earn just a bit too much to qualify for Medicaid, but they do not have health insurance because either their employer or their husband's employer doesn't offer it. 
   We all know the importance of prenatal care to the health of unborn children. If a mother receives proper prenatal care, her child has a much greater chance of being born healthy. That is why the National Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of Children's Hospitals and the March of Dimes--just to name a few organizations--support this legislation. 
   In an era of making every federal dollar stretch as far as possible, this provision makes sense. For every $1 we spend on prenatal care, we save $3 later on that would be spent on complicated deliveries and serious birth defects. Sometimes you have to spend money to save money. 
   Several years ago, the Arkansas governor and the state legislature implemented the AR Kids First health insurance program for children who did not qualify for Medicaid. AR Kids First precedes CHIP. 
   The statistics for enrollment in the CHIP program in Arkansas are a bit ahead of the national curve. So for, AR Kids First has enrolled half of all eligible children. Over 45,000 now have coverage as a result of the state's proactive efforts and commitment to children's health. 
   It has been so successful in enrolling eligible children for health insurance that the Department of Health and Human Services recently granted approval to allow AR Kids First to operate as the state's CHIP program. 
   I applaud their efforts and hope that other states can learn from the outreach success of AR Kids First. 
   Finally, this bill eliminates the sunset clause for a pot of money that Congress allocated for states to help them link families leaving welfare with the Medicaid and CHIP programs. As part of the 1996 welfare reform law, Congress gave $500 million to states to see that families with children in the welfare system continue to receive health care coverage. 
   Prior to 1996, poor families with children automatically received health benefits through Medicaid when they signed up for AFDC. Since Congress passed welfare reform legislation, Medicaid and TANF are no longer legally connected. States must revamp their eligibility systems to see that families with children do not fall through the cracks. 
   There has been confusion between governors and the Department of Health and Human Services about the time period that this money could be spent. 
   States run the risk of losing this money just 2 days from now. On September 30th, 16 states are in jeopardy of losing this funding and 18 more states will lose funding by December 31, 1999. 
   So, as you see, this piece of the Maternal and Children's Health Coverage Act is critical--and timely. 
   I hope that the Congress and the President will act swiftly to eliminate the sunset clause and give states more time to spend this valuable pot of money. 
   Mr. President, Congress is currently engaged in a debate over the Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope that we don't lose sight of an equally important goal of seeing that all children in America have health care insurance. 
   I believe this bill takes a positive step forward in helping states move closer to the goal of providing health insurance to 5 million uninsured children. We can do this. We must do this.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Delta Regional Authority Act of 1999, which is aimed at improving the economy of the Mississippi Delta region, the poorest region in the country. 
   The lower Mississippi Delta region, following the course of the Mississippi River, stretches from southern Illinois to the Delta of the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. According to the latest Census figures, communities in the Delta region of seven States--Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana--face a poverty rate of 22 percent while the national average is 12 percent. 
   This legislation seeks to build on efforts begun more than a decade ago, when Congress created the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission. Under the leadership of former Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers, the Commission was charged with studying the unique problems of the Delta region and recommending a course of action. I refer my colleagues to Senator Bumpers' statement, which appears on page S25689 of the September 27, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, in which he introduced legislation authorizing the Commission. The Commission submitted its report, ``Realizing the Dream ..... Fulfilling the Potential,'' in 1990. The Chairman of the Commission, former Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, called the report a ``handbook for action.'' 
   The report highlighted problems facing the Delta, whose economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. The report noted the Delta faced high unemployment, low levels of income and education, welfare dependency, poor health care and housing, along with serious shortcomings in transportation infrastructure. Unfortunately, a decade after the report was issued, these problems still exist. While Congress took one bold step toward solving these problems when we passed welfare reform, there is still much to be done. 
   In particular, this bill seeks to improve the infrastructure of the Delta region. It is common knowledge that when industries seek to expand and build new facilities, they look at the availability of roads, water systems  and other infrastructure. The Federal Government has tried to foster development in these areas by providing Federal grant monies, but we haven't approached the economic problems in the region with an appropriate understanding of the unique demographic and geographic challenges that face the Delta. 
   Education programs are available, but if there's no technical assistance to help people actually access the grant resources, then the programs are essentially wasted. We can encourage young folks to pursue higher education and start their own businesses, but if there is no basic infrastructure, if transportation and other resources are inadequate, how can they succeed? For instance, in many areas of the Arkansas Delta there are no copy shops, computer repair stores, or office supply stores. These basic offerings that we take for granted in larger cities simply are not available and that is why creating a central location for technical assistance is so vital. We may not be able to put copy shops in place, but we can provide help that will be only a phone call or an e-mail away. 
   Currently, many communities in the Delta have problems gaining federal grants for two reasons. First, they often don't have the technical expertise to complete the grant applications. Second, they often don't have enough money to meet the local matching requirement. The Delta Regional Authority created by this legislation will be authorized $30 million annually to provide technical assistance in the grant application process. In effect, local communities across the seven state region will have one-stop shopping when they need assistance completing grant applications and accessing resources for economic development. Second, the Delta Regional Authority will be authorized to provide money to help grant applicants meet the federal match. Certainly the matching dollar requirement in the grant application process is important to demonstrate the community's commitment to the project, but we shouldn't exclude the very communities who need grant assistance the most. 
   The Delta Regional Authority will function along the same lines as the Appalachian Regional Commission. But it will operate entirely independently of the ARC. The Delta Regional Authority's mission will be to help create jobs, attract industrial development and grow the local economies by improving infrastructure, training the workforce and building local leadership. 
   I would like to thank staff of the Appalachian Regional Commission, who worked very closely with us in drafting this legislation. Special thanks also is due to the National Association of Development Organizations, the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Center and many local economic development groups who provided suggestions and input. Last, but certainly not least, I would like to commend Representative MARION BERRY, who represents my home in the First Congressional District of Arkansas, who has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. I certainly hope that today's introduction of legislation is the first step toward making the Delta Regional Authority a reality.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise, as did my other colleagues today, to talk about something of great importance to each Member individually. I think we have not taken full advantage to discuss what I think is our greatest blessing in this world, one of our greatest investments. That is our children. 
   Today I will discuss the importance of education funding and why it is imperative the Senate act quickly and responsibly on this issue. We have an opportunity to do something on behalf of our children, to give them the capability they need. We talk about the magnitude of education on behalf of our children, but we don't often talk about the timeliness that is needed here on this issue today. 
   I question the wisdom of delaying the vote on the appropriations bill that funds education, the Labor-HHS bill, until after we have completed the other 12 spending bills. I know for myself, as a working mother, and as do all of my colleagues here as working family individuals--we have to prioritize. We have to look at what is important and we make a list. We recognize what is important and then we go about accomplishing it. It seems our priorities are in the wrong place when we vote on the legislative appropriations bill before funding education, waiting until the last minute, the last issue, to try and drum up the necessary funding to educate our children for the future. 
   School has started all over this country. Kids are taking tests; they are turning in papers; they are getting grades. We, as parents, as aunts and uncles, as mentors to our children all over this country, are encouraging them to aim for the best, to work towards that A, to do what it is they can to accomplish their best, to work hard at their education because it will pay off for them in the end. 
   What are we doing? We are setting a very poor example. If this Congress was to be graded on its performance on prioritizing our children's education, it would be given a big red F. 
   I know there is always a contentious debate over how to fund education, but it seems our colleagues on the Republican side are out of touch with the American people on this issue. A recent survey of the American public found that 73 percent of Americans favor increased Federal investment in education and placed it as the highest priority among the 19 other issues they were asked about. Yet we in Washington have failed to act, and the situation is only getting worse. 
   During the August recess, instead of having townhall meetings, I set about having five back-to-school meetings across our State of Arkansas. I spent a great deal of time listening to parents, students, teachers, and school administrators at all of these different schools in these meetings that I organized across our State. One school superintendent told me that in his area, an enormously depressed area, they were starting the school year with 22 job openings; short 22 people in that school district. As a result, classrooms are overcrowded, teachers are overworked, and students are not receiving the kind of attention and education they deserve. We must send Federal money immediately to hire new teachers. We must look for incentives to get our young people into teaching. 
   Do you realize the enormous brick wall we will hit soon, as we are having fewer and fewer of our young people going into the teaching profession? It doesn't matter if we have smaller class sizes or if we have new school buildings; we are not going to have the teachers to put in them. That is essential. 
   We want to give our teachers the capability to be well qualified. We send our children to school 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Teachers are some of the most important people in their lives, and they are not given the appropriate time to prepare nor are they receiving the reasonable accommodation in resources they need to be able to teach our children. We must send those Federal dollars to hire new teachers. Waiting until next year is not an option. Schools are already open this year. If we wait as planned, we will have missed an entire grade of children. 
   I have talked to my colleagues: Oh, we won't get to that 
   this year, or we will do it next year, or we will do it in the next Congress. Think about those years. Think about those first graders from this year. They will be second graders next year and then third graders. By the time we have finally done something on their behalf, we will have missed the most critical stage in their educational process. How irresponsible on our part. 
   By the time the money is allocated and school districts can begin to make those hiring decisions, they have missed that opportunity. Our children will be the ones who suffer if we do not do the right thing in the Senate. I also think it is such a shame, as we look at the tax package that has been presented to the President, what it will do in robbing our children of the money that is needed to build new schools, hire new teachers, reduce class size, wire classrooms with the latest technology, and enhance the access to affordable higher education. 
   Under the Republican plan that has been presented to the President, education funding will be cut by 17 percent. How inexcusable is that, our greatest resource in this Nation, our children, our future, and not even anteing up what we need to do to meet those needs. That is an embarrassment. 
   It is in our Nation's long-term interest to give our children the very best, highest quality education that we can. But even if we would not do it for our children, should we not do it for our Nation? That is the future of our Nation, our children, their capability to compete with other children across this globe. We should make that a priority in the Senate. The American people have indicated to us that they have made it a priority on their wish list. They are the future of our workforce. They are the future of our country. If we fail our children, we have failed our Nation. 
   So I rise today to encourage my Senate colleagues to reconsider their priorities and to support public schools by restoring full funding to education and supporting efforts to hire more teachers, to build more schools, and to establish valuable afterschool programs. Now is the time to act--not next year, not next Congress, but right here and right now. Let's get over the partisan bickering and political posturing and get on with the people's work. 
   More important, let's move beyond the process posturing that the Senate is famous for and really reflect on our priorities, what our priorities should be, what is our greatest blessing, which I believe is our children. Their success is without a doubt the biggest measure of our Nation's success. I encourage my colleagues to do just as I am doing, and that is to talk about the education of our children and move this bill forward. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. 
   Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to provide a ray of hope for our farmers across the country. The situation is dire in the agricultural community. Commodity prices are at Depression era levels and are projected to remain low through this year and beyond. Despite the federal government's efforts over the past year to alleviate some the financial strain affecting the agriculture industry, a simple fact remains: we no longer have a policy that protects farmers when forces beyond their control drive prices down. 
   Farmers are the hardest working people I know. They work from dusk to dawn on land that has been past down from generation to generation. This heritage is in jeopardy of being lost due to depressed commodity prices and the lack of an adequate safety net for family farmers. 
   The agricultural industry is the backbone of rural communities. I'm not just hearing from farmers about this crisis. In the past weeks and months, I've talked with bankers, tractor and implement dealers, fertilizer distributors, and even the local barber shop. They are all concerned about the train wreck that will occur if nothing is done to provide an adequate safety net for producers. The bottom line in rural America: if farmers are hurting, everyone is hurting. 
   It's really ironic watching the news these days. We're too busy patting ourselves on the back over the strength of the stock market and a potential tax cut that we have all but forgotten those that are not benefitting from this record setting economy. This situation is very reminiscent of the roaring 20's that our country experienced earlier in the century, followed by the Great Depression of the 1930's. I hope and pray that it does not take a situation so severe and drastic to convince this Congress, and the nation, that our agricultural sector and domestic production needs our support. 
   The HOPE Act that I am introducing today is built on solid but simple principles and takes steps to reestablish a safety net for our nation's farmers. To reconstruct the safety we must restore the formula based marketing loan structure that existed prior to the 1996 Farm Bill. Loan rates were arbitrarily capped in 1996 and I feel that it is imperative to return this assistance loan back into a formula based, market-oriented program. In doing so, loan rates would more accurately reflect market trends and provide an adequate price floor for producers. No business in America can survive selling their products at levels below cost of production. With Depression era prices, that is the situation our farmers currently face. An adequate safety net must be restored. This legislation also extends the loan term by up to six months, allowing farmers more time to market their crops at the most advantageous price. 
   Secondly, my legislation would require the President to fully explain the benefits and costs of existing food sanctions. It does not make sense to force Cuba to purchase their rice from Asia when the United States is only 90 miles away. Without access to foreign markets, we cannot expect the agricultural community to survive. We cannot let our foreign policy objectives cloud common sense. These sanctions rarely impose significant hardship on the dictators against whom they are targeted. The unfortunate victims are the innocent citizens of these foreign lands and the U.S. producers who lose valuable markets when these restrictions are put into place. We require cost/benefit analysis from almost all sections for our government regulators. We should do no less in our agricultural trade arena. 
   I am also very committed to preserving our environment. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetlands Reserve Program(WRP) are responsible for taking a great number of erodible acres out of production. Unfortunately, these programs are victims of their own success because they are near the maximum enrollment levels allowed by current law. I propose to expand these programs so that even more marginal acreage is eligible for participation. 
   I urge my colleagues to act quickly and address the growing crisis in the agriculture community. Everyone of us enjoys the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the world. Unfortunately, we often take that for granted in this nation. The consequences of doing nothing are far too great. This safe and abundant supply will not be there for this Nation or the world if we do not support our family farmers at this critical time.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues in introducing legislation to relieve legitimate recyclers from Superfund liability. 
   This legislation has become necessary because of an unintended consequence of the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, more commonly called Superfund. Some courts have interpreted CERCLA to mean that the sale of certain traditional recyclable feedstocks is an arrangement for the treatment or disposal of a hazardous substance and, therefore, fully subject to Superfund liability. While there exists in law and legislative history no suggestion whatsoever that the Congress intended to impede recycling in America by providing a strong preference for the use of virgin materials through the Superfund liability scheme, that is precisely what has happened. 
   The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 is intended to place traditional recyclable materials which are used as feedstocks in the manufacturing process on an equal footing with their virgin, or primary feedstock, counterparts. Traditional recyclables are made from paper, glass, plastic, metals, batteries, textiles, and rubber. 
   During the 103rd Congress I first introduced a bill to relieve legitimate recyclers of scrap metal from unintended Superfund liability. The bill was developed in conjunction with the recycling industry, the environmental community, and the Administration. All of the parties worked closely together and consistently agreed that liability relief for recyclers is necessary and right. 
   The language in this bill is the culmination of a process that we have been working on since the 103rd Congress. Similar language was also introduced in the 104th and 105th Congresses with the most recent version garnering almost 400 Senate and House co-sponsors. I am sure you can see, Mr. President, the push to relieve these legitimate recyclers of this unintended liability has received broad, bi-partisan support. 
   The Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999 acknowledges that Congress did not intend to subject to Superfund liability those government and private entities that collect and process secondary materials for sale as feedstocks for manufacturing. This bill removes from liability those who collect, process, and sell to manufacturers paper, glass, plastic, metal textiles, and rubber recyclables. This bill also exempts from liability those individuals who collect lead acid, nickel, cadmium, and other batteries for the recycling of the valuable components. However, this bill does not exempt chemical, solvent, sludge, or slag recycling. It addresses traditional recyclables in a CERCLA context only. We do not intend it to be viewed as a precedent for any other amendment to Superfund or to any other environmental statute, whatsoever. 
   It should also be clearly understood that this bill addresses the product of recyclers, that is the recyclables they sell which are utilized to make new products. This does not affect liability for contamination that is created at a facility owned or operated by a recycler. Neither does it affect liability related to any process wastes sent by a recycler for treatment or disposal. In order to assure that only bonafide recycling facilities benefit from this bill, a number of tests have been established within the bill by which liability relief will be denied to sham recyclers. 
   I have consistently supported Superfund reforms beginning with my time in the House and continuing in the Senate. Unfortunately, comprehensive Superfund reforms have yet to garner broad support throughout the Congress and action on recyclers has been held up in the process. Relief for legitimate recyclers has been the one portion of Superfund reform that has consistently garnered widespread, bi-partisan support. The recycling industry should no longer be denied their legitimate exemption from Superfund liability because of broader issues that do not relate to them. 
   Mr. President, I am aware of ongoing negotiations concerning a section within this recycling bill that applies to PCBs in paper. I want to again stress that when we began preparing for this bill in 1993, we formed a coalition of parties that all agreed upon the language within the bill. This coalition has remained until this day. These parties are currently working to amend the language of the bill to resolve this concern. Upon final agreement, I will welcome an amendment to this bill to include the resolution language. 
   Mr. President, there are legitimate recyclers across our nation that stand to lose their livelihoods if we don't act immediately. Legitimate recyclers that reuse and recycle the scrap leftover from our everyday processes. Legitimate recyclers that reduce the waste we put in our landfills and produce a useful product. Legitimate recyclers that were not intended by the writers of CERCLA to be burdened with liability for taking scrap metal and other products and processing them into products equivalent to virgin material. 
   Mr. President, we have been working toward providing this needed liability relief for legitimate recyclers for over 6 years. It is time to pass this important legislation now. Doing so will not only relieve this unintended liability but will promote recycling in our country. I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator for yielding me this time. 
   I am one of the newer Members of the Senate. I have not taken to the floor of the Senate often to speak yet. But I have been on the floor of the Senate five times already to speak on this issue of the agricultural crisis. I think it is immensely important to this Nation and certainly vital to the rural areas of our country. 
   I compliment my colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD. I think the spirit in which this bipartisan effort has been crafted is essential in being able to produce good policy for this country. 
   I also agree with the words of my colleague from Mississippi that without a doubt this is a diverse body, and especially when it comes to agriculture, oftentimes we certainly see our diversity in terms of regions more than parties. I compliment his leadership in many of these areas. 
   But I do think the debate and the differences we have seen are certainly reflective of the necessity now to review agricultural policy in this country. I truly encourage my colleagues to take a look at this bipartisan approach that has been presented by Senator CONRAD. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I echo the words of my colleague. 
   I was raised on and continue to be a part of the seventh generation Arkansas family farm. 
   I think it is so important that we recognize this is an issue--those from other States, as well as farm States, agricultural-based States--and that we can impress upon our colleagues in Washington, D.C. the crisis that our small rural communities and our farming communities are going through. 
   I will certainly be joining the Senator later on this afternoon in that debate. We need to impress upon people  that this is an issue for this country. It is not just agriculture; it is a heritage of this country and a heritage of our rural communities.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on what I think is the most critical as well as the most worthy of issues that we should be dealing with in the Senate and the Congress; that is, the emotional well-being of our children. They are truly the fabric of the success of our Nation into the next century. 
   All too often we have been through incidents such as Jonesboro, AK, as well as Littleton, CO. We like to talk about them and discuss these issues and the crises that are going on in our children's minds and in their souls. But all too often we talk about it, and we seem to forget it. We don't do what we really need to be doing on behalf of our children in this country. 
   Mr. President, the Safe Schools Act of 1999 will provide resources to public schools so they can remain safe and strong cornerstones of our communities. 
   As we move into the 21st century, we must adapt our approach to education to meet the changing needs of students, teachers and parents in these communities. 
   Although I am one of the youngest Members of the Senate, I grew up in Helena, Arkansas during what seemed to be a much simpler time--even though we were in the height of de-segregation in the South. 
   Our parents pulled together to make everyone's education experience a success. Students came to school prepared to learn. Teachers had control of their classroom. The threat of school violence was virtually non-existent. 
   Now, more than twenty years later, things are different. 
   Our children are subjected to unprecedented social stresses including divorce, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, poverty and an explosion of technology that has good and bad uses. 
   These stresses exhibit themselves in the behavior of teenagers, as well as in our young children. Increasingly, elementary school children exhibit symptoms of substance abuse, academic underachievement, disruptive behavior, and even suicide. 
   Too many students bring guns and weapons to school. 
   This is a very complex problem and there is no one single answer. It will take more than metal detectors and surveillance cameras to prevent the tragedies occurring in our schools today. But we must do something. We cannot wait any longer. We have to address this issue now. 
   I believe the Safe Schools Act reflects the needs and wishes of students, parents, teachers and school administrators. It is the first step toward addressing the emotional well-being of our young people. 
   During my Senate campaign last year, I spent a lot of time listening to parents and teachers. From my experience, a lot of the most effective solutions being at the local level. 
   This bill incorporates the lessons I have learned from the people of my state who are working on the front lines to educate and care for our children. 
   First, this bill would provide funds to elementary and secondary schools to hire additional mental health professionals. 
   Students today bring more to school than backpacks and lunchboxes. Many of them bring severe emotional troubles. 
   It is critical that schools be able to help these students and help teachers deal with them. We can possibly prevent a horrific act of violence, and if a disruptive student receives help, his or her teacher will have more control of the classroom in order to instruct all of the children there to learn. 
   Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough mental health professionals working in our nation's schools today. 
   The American School Health Association recommends that the student-to-counselor ratio be 250:1. In secondary schools, the current ratio is 513:1. In elementary schools, where the student-to-teacher ratio exceeds 1000:1. 
   This is just not acceptable for a country as advanced as ours to not be providing the needs of our children. 
   The second major component of my Safe Schools Act provides funding for after-school and mentoring programs. 
   Many of our children go home to empty houses or spend hours every day in poorly supervised settings. Studies show that youth crime peaks between 3:00 and 7:00 p.m. 
   Local public schools need additional resources so they can establish or expand after school and summer programs for children. 
   This is a wonderful chance for the community to get involved. Many non-profit organizations can bring their resources to children in the schools and to the community. 
   A variety of organizations can come together to build strong after school and summer programs which enhance the academic work of students and provide them with other meaningful activities. 
   Many communities in Arkansas are doing just that. 
   The city of Fort Smith has begun the SPICE Program, which has been working for nine years with adult tutors who help kids after-school with homework, and teach them arts and crafts which keep them out of trouble. 
   In Little Rock, the Camp Aldersgate Youth Initiative encourages teenagers to participate in supervised community service activities, such as tutoring, recreation and conflict management; 
   The Safe Jonesboro Mentoring Program in Jonesboro, Arkansas, brings adults from the local business community to Jonesboro High School once a week to mentor high school student. 
   And these programs are not just being put into place in our larger towns, they're also cropping up in rural communities. 
   In Monticello and six counties throughout Southeast Arkansas, the Southeast Arkansas Foster Grandparents Program has helped improve literacy and reading test scores for hundreds of children. In this program, senior citizens serve as literacy and reading tours to K-3 elementary school students twenty hours a week. 
   The Boys, Girls and Adults Community Development Center in Marvell, a Save the Children grantee, has been providing educational, cultural and recreational activities, as well as mentoring for children after school. 60% of the children participating in this program have improved their grade point average. It works. 
   Studies show that one-on-one attention raises the academic scores of children and improves their self-esteem. With just a little extra help, a child who is struggling with reading or math can catch up with the help of volunteers or mentors and excel. 
   We can utilize organizations like AmeriCorps and our older volunteers in the Senior Corps program. Encourage high school students to mentor elementary school students who need a little extra attention, to see an older peer being a part of their life makes a difference. 
   The bottom line is we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Good examples already exist in our communities, initiatives like the ones I've mentioned today. By providing added resources to the states, we can emphasize the successful programs and make them available to more students. 
   I'm also asking states to inform parents about the quality of public schools by issuing a Safe Schools Report Card. My own state of Arkansas will begin releasing a more comprehensive report card next year. 
   All states should collect this information and make it readily available to parents and the community. This information will help parents and schools officials better address the most important issues at the local level. 
   Above all, we must continue to share information and ideas, to talk to one another. Our country cannot possibly meet the challenges of the 21st century if each community operates in a vacuum and there is no mechanism to pass on what is working and what isn't. 
   During the August recess I will hold five ``Back to School'' meetings with students, parents, teachers, school administrators and concerned citizens. 
   These meetings will be a good chance to discuss the various components of my Safe Schools Act as well as other important education issues like school construction, class size, school discipline and parent involvement. 
   I welcome the chance to listen to those who care deeply about our public  schools and I hope my colleagues will spend some of their time during the recess to do the same. 
   I also hope my colleagues will take the opportunity to review the components of this bill. I feel strongly it should be a critical part of any federal response to school safety issues. I look forward to its passage. 
   This is our opportunity to begin the process that will show our children we do care about their emotional well being and the future success of our nation.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the Bingaman amendment to recommit S. 1429 to the Senate Finance Committee which would have enabled us to clarify that debt reduction is a top priority for this government in spending any budget surplus. 
   As we say in my home state of Arkansas, the best time to fix the roof is when the sun is still shining. 
   Now is the time for us to take steps to reduce our enormous federal debt. I believe we have an unprecedented opportunity before us. We've been making tough decisions--living within our means, so to speak. 
   We have a surplus that's bigger than we thought it would be and a chance to save Social Security for future generations, protect for Medicare and help older people afford prescription drugs. 
   So, now we have a shot at reducing our nation's debt, which in turn will lower interest rates and put more money back in the pockets of more Americans. 
   Using a major portion of any surplus accumulated in these times of prosperity to improve the financial integrity of the federal government. Reducing the national debt is a smart long-term strategy for the U.S. economy and it must be our priority in this bill. 
   Reducing our national debt will provide a tax cut for millions of Americans because it will restrain interest rates, saving them money on variable mortgages, new mortgages, auto loans, credit card payments, etc. Each percentage point decrease in interest rates would save American families hundreds of dollars every year. 
   By reducing the national debt we will protect future generations from increasing tax burdens. Currently, more than 25 percent of individual income taxes go to paying interest on our national debt. Every dollar of lower debt saves more than one dollar for future generations, a savings that can be used for tax cuts, or for covering the baby boomers retirement without tax increases. 
   Reducing the national debt will also make it easier for the government to deal with the future costs of Social Security and Medicare and repay the Social Security trust fund when the Social Security system faces annual shortfalls. 
   In addition, reducing the national debt will reduce our reliance on foreign investors. More than $1.2 trillion of the national debt--roughly one third of the publicly held debt--is held by foreign investors. In 1998, the U.S. government paid $91 billion in interest payments to foreign investors. 
   It was not the American way to live beyond one's means. Our parents taught us to work hard so that we can pay our bills, clothe our children and save for the future. 
   Accumulating debt and simply letting it grow and grow is not--and should not be--an option for most families around this country. It should no longer be the practice of this government. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly advised Congress that the most important action we could take to maintain a strong and growing economy is to pay down the national debt. I, for one, believe he is on the right track. 
   Clarifying our intent to prioritize debt reduction is the right thing to do.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair. 
   I also want to thank my colleague from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU, and Chairman MURKOWSKI, for their fabulous leadership on this issue. 
   I rise today in support of greater funding for land and wildlife conservation programs as embodied in S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation to ensure that a portion of the revenues from outer continental shelf oil and gas production are dedicated to land, water, and wildlife conservation programs throughout the U.S. It is well past time that the Land and Water Conservation Fund is permanently funded and used as originally intended to provide for state and federal land purchases and to help states with conservation and recreation needs. We need consistent, dependable funding for federal, state, and local governments to make investments in land preservation, habitat conservation, and wildlife management. 
   I know in my home state of Arkansas, this funding is badly needed for protection of exiting wildlife habitat and conservation programs as well as for funding additional conservation and recreation needs. Since inception, the state and federal sides of the Land and Water Conservation Fund have combined to provide Arkansas with over $84 million in targeted land purchases for preservation of tracts of forested lands, purchases of needed land for state and municipal parks, lands for schools, land for baseball fields, bike trails, zoos, and recreation areas. The federal side of the LWCF has provided resources for needed land purchases in the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests, White River and Cache River National Wildlife Refuges, the Buffalo National River, and for preserving many other tracts of land. The state side of the LWCF has provided land for a ballpark in Bentonville, a school park in Jonesboro, a zoo in Little Rock, a swimming pool is Searcy, a city park in Batesville, a swamp habitat in Woodruff County, and for over 600 other projects across my home state. And there are still many needs for these resources. Funds are needed for in-holdings purchases in State and national forest and to assist rural communities with building parks for children and to help urban areas with preserving needed green space.

   Ms. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, compliment our colleagues from Rhode Island and from Florida. We have had a train wreck in terms of the health care proposals we tried to present this week in the Senate. 
   For the past few days in the Senate we have had a lot of colorful charts and graphs. We have seen a lot of ads on TV paid for by special interest groups. There has been a lot of partisan maneuvering. What we haven't had, what the American people haven't seen, is a sensible, moderate debate on this critical issue of health care. 
   Tonight, I am very proud to join my colleagues in trying to provide emergency relief, to find the middle ground in this debate with the proposal that should be acceptable to the majority of the people, the Members of the Senate, and without a doubt is in the best interests of the American people. 
   This issue is of great importance to the American public and they are waiting to see if Washington--and more importantly, if the Senate--will be able to do their job. And that is to present a plausible response to the reforms that are needed in this Nation's health care program. 
   I applaud my colleagues.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to make clear my position on such a very important issue. In the forefront of the managed care debate in the early nineties, I diligently supported the concept of trying to manage care, to control the cost of health care in this country in order to provide more health care to more Americans. When we did that, we in Congress never envisioned that medical decisions would be taken away from medical professionals or that an insurance company would circumvent a patient's access to specialists. 
   Again we are debating this issue of how to provide better health care for more Americans. Today we are talking about the Robb amendment which is absolutely essential to women across this country. 
   Managed care has been a very necessary and useful tool in our nationwide health care network. It has helped us cut the costs, especially in Medicare. But the issue of making sure women have the opportunity to choose as their primary care giver an OB/GYN is absolutely essential. Most women in this day and age go from a pediatrician to an OB/GYN. To have to go back through a primary care giver in order to see an OB/GYN is absolutely ridiculous. 
   It is so important to do more to see that women have access to quality care. The Robb amendment takes us in the right direction with three very important provisions. It provides women with direct access to an OB/GYN. They should not have to obtain permission from a gatekeeper. I have had staffers in the past who had awful experiences of having to go to a primary care giver and not even bothering to see their OB/GYN to get the speciality care they needed because it took so much time to go 
   through a primary care giver. That is absolutely inexcusable in this day and age with the kind of speciality care, research, and knowledge we have in our medical professionals. 
   A great example: A lump is discovered in a woman's breast during a routine checkup. The OB/GYN ought to be able to refer that woman for a mammogram rather than sending her back to the primary care physician. The Robb amendment would designate the OB/GYN as the primary care giver. Most women try to do that already. They already view their OB/GYN as their primary physician. 
   It is especially important for women in rural areas. They are limited in their access and capability to get to their physicians, and if they cannot see an OB/GYN from a rural area, then they likely are never going to get the speciality care they need and deserve. 
   Most important, we have to make sure our physicians are able to make those medical decisions. One of the most frustrating comments I ever heard from my husband, who is a physician, is when he spent 1 hour 45 minutes on the telephone with an insurance adjustor after seeing one of his partner's patients who had come through surgery. She was still running a fever, and the nurse called him and said: We have to send this woman home because the insurance company said we had to. 
   He spent 1 hour 45 minutes on the phone with that insurance adjustor, and at the end of that conversation he finally said: If you can send me your medical diploma and if you will sign an affidavit that you will take complete responsibility for this woman's life, then, and only then, should I be able to discharge her from this hospital, because she is sick. 
   Yet they were not going to pay for it. He said: We are going to keep her in the hospital, and you are going to be responsible, you are going to pay for that bill, and we are going to ensure the woman is well taken care of. 
   It is so important for the women across this country to know they will have the primary care they need through their OB/GYN. 
   I appreciate my colleagues' involvement.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. 
   Mr. President, I offer for the Senate's consideration, a bill to rename the Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center after a man that has been essential to the success of the aquaculture industry in Arkansas: Dr. Harry K. Dupree. 
   Dr. Dupree has devoted his entire career to the progress of the warmwater fish industry. In Arkansas, aquaculture production has taken great strides in recent years. The catfish industry in the state has grown rapidly and Arkansas currently ranks second nationally in acreage and production of catfish. The baitfish industry is not far behind, selling more than 15 million pounds of fish annually. Much of this success is due to the ongoing efforts of Dr. Harry Dupree. 
   The early years of Dr. Dupree's career were spent in Alabama. Harry received his master's in fisheries management from Auburn University in 1956 and his Ph.D. in Zoology in 1960. From 1960 to 1974, Harry served as both a Research Biologist and Laboratory Director at the Southeastern Fish Cultural Laboratory in Marion, Alabama. There, Dr. Dupree focused his efforts on catfish research and established the major elements required for a manufactured feed for channel catfish. His research activities led to the formulation of pelleted feed for catfish production and made it possible for catfish production to move from a small, labor intensive industry of local interest to a streamlined industry with potential for expansion on the national and international level.  
   Arkansas was fortunate enough to lure Dr. Dupree to the Fish Farming Experimental Laboratory in Stuttgart, Arkansas, during 1974 where he served as Scientific Director for the next 18 years. His efforts, dating back to before 1985, resulted in funding for design and construction of the new laboratories and offices for the facilities on the campus of the Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center. These facilities were constructed in 1992 and Dr. Dupree has served as the Laboratory Director for the center ever since. 
   I first met Harry during my tenure as Representative of the First Congressional District of Arkansas. I'll never forget the enthusiasm and genuine interest Harry displayed as he showed me around the research center that he had worked so hard to establish. I, and many others, share many fond memories and great gratitude for the wonderful friendship and great work of Dr. Harry Dupree. The pride that he has exhibited and has instilled in all Arkansans for the science industry of Aquaculture has been tremendous. 
   Dr. Dupree is a great man with a huge heart. I urge my colleagues to act promptly on this legislation so that Dr. Harry K. Dupree will receive the recognition that he truly deserves.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, yesterday during consideration of the Steel and Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program the Senator from Illinois, Senator FITZGERALD, raised several concerns regarding the potential for program abuse. During these discussions, my colleague from Illinois questioned whether or not a bank, or other investor, would be able to transfer their risk to the government upon enactment of the Steel and Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program. 
   Fiscal responsibility is a top priority of mine and upon hearing of these concerns, I was initially troubled. However, I have been assured by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, that the loan approval board is structured such that these situations will be prevented. Loans will not be approved on a whim and the taxpayers' dollars will not be thrown about recklessly to benefit those who did not need help in the first place. This program provides much needed, temporary assistance to keep our steel industry afloat. 
   It should be noted that the Steel and Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program sunsets in three years and is not a permanent change in public policy. We are simply responding to the crisis currently faced by many in our nation's steel industry. 
   I rise in support of this measure and thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership on this issue.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my colleague from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN, to introduce the Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999. We believe this bill makes fundamental changes to the existing Federal Crop Insurance Program that are necessary to make crop insurance more workable and affordable for producers across the country. 
   As we all know, the government's role in farm programs has changed. The 1996 Farm Bill phased out traditional support for our farmers, and current farm programs require producers to assume more risk than ever before. Due to the Ag economic crisis, there has been much discussion lately on the issue of the ``safety net'' for our nation's producers. On that point I would like to be perfectly clear. Crop insurance is a risk management tool to help producers guard against yield loss. It was not created and was never intended to be the end all be all solution for the income needs of our nation's producers. As the crop insurance reform debate proceeds, I am hopeful that my colleagues will be cognizant of the various needs in the agriculture community and recognize that while crop insurance is an important part of the ``safety net,'' it is not and should not be the only income guard for our nation's farmers. 
   Congress has been attempting to eliminate the ad hoc disaster program for years because it is not the most efficient way of helping our farmers who suffer yield losses. Senator Cochran and I have been working over the last few months with individuals involved in crop insurance delivery, major commodity organizations, and most importantly, farmers, to craft a comprehensive bill that addresses the various reform needs of the crop insurance program. We feel that this legislation takes a significant step toward providing a crop insurance program that is equitable, affordable, and effective. 
   In response to the outcry we have heard from producers in Arkansas, Mississippi, and across the nation, we have attempted to make the crop insurance program more cost effective for our farmers. In Arkansas, the last estimates I heard indicated that 1% of our cotton producers were participating in the buy-up program this year. Buy-up coverage for all commodities in Akansas historically is around 12%. That tells me that producers at home don't think that crop insurance is currently providing the kind of help they need. Our bill establishes a process for re-evaluating crop insurance rates for all crops and for lowering those rates if warranted. By making the crop insurance program more affordable, additional producers will be encouraged to participate in the program and protect themselves against the unforeseeable factors that will be working against them once they put a crop into the ground. 
   This legislation directs USDA to establish ``good experience'' premium discounts for producers who have not filed claims in the last years. This simply makes sense. If you have car insurance and you haven't had a wreck or a ticket over a significant period of time, then your premium is reduced. Crop insurance should not be any different. 
   The bill also provides for a more equitable subsidy method by setting the subsidy for crop insurance premiums at a flat rate, regardless of the level of coverage a producer purchases. Current law provides higher levels of federal subsidy to producers who purchase the lowest levels of coverage. 
   In an attempt to improve the record keeping process within USDA, this legislation establishes the Farm Service Agency (FSA) as the central repository for all acreage and yield record keeping. Current USDA record keeping, split between FSA and RMA, is redundant and insufficient. By including  both crop insurance program participants and non-program participants in the process, we hope to enhance the agricultural data held by the agency and make acreage and yield reporting less of a hassle for already overburdened producers. 
   In addition, this bill establishes a role for consultation with state FSA committees in the introduction of new coverage to a state. The need for this provision was made abundantly clear to Arkansas' rice producers this spring. A private insurance policy was offered to farmers at one rate, only to have the company reduce the rate once the amount of potential exposure was realized. In my discussions with various executives from the company on this issue it became apparent that their knowledge of the rice industry was fairly minimal. Had they consulted with local FSA committees who had a working knowledge of the rice industry before introduction of the policy, the train wreck that occurred might have been stopped in its tracks. 
   Many of the problems associated with the crop insurance program have been addressed in previous reform measures, however, fraud and abuses are still present to some degree. This bill strengthens the monitoring of agents and adjusters to combat fraud and enhances the penalties available to USDA for companies, agents and producers who engage in fraudulent activities. There is simply no room for bad actors that recklessly cost the taxpayers money. 
   While this bill was crafted with the input of producers from Arkansas and Mississippi, there is no preferential treatment toward any commodity or geographic region. We have attempted to include provisions that will make the crop insurance program more effective across the nation. We hope that we have achieved this goal and look forward to working with our colleagues to address any measures that will make the crop insurance reform effort more effective.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, for their help regarding clean up needs in my state following the devastating tornadoes that struck on January 21, 1999. On that day, an estimated 38 tornadoes touched down in at least 16 counties in Arkansas, a one-day record for the number of tornadoes in a single state in one day. Eight deaths and scores of injuries resulted. The storms damaged or destroyed two thousand homes, at least 126 businesses, and various utilities in eleven counties. As you might imagine, a tremendous amount of debris is scattered throughout the damage area. 
   When the Senate considered S. 544, the supplemental appropriations bill which is now before us as the conference report to H.R. 1141, an amendment of mine was adopted that would direct the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to assist in the removal of debris left from those storms. It is extremely important that we provide assistance necessary to remove this debris in order to help restore lands to a more productive state, but even more importantly, to prevent more serious emergencies that will result if this debris is allowed to obstruct stream flows and cause flooding, erosion, and other economic and environmental problems. Could the Senators please explain how his conference report addresses this situation.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this marks the third time I have been to the floor to discuss the emergency supplemental bill. For months now I have been trying to get my colleagues' attention about the extreme urgency of the items included in this bill. There are provisions included in this bill that were deemed an ``emergency'' back in March of this year. In addition to the tornado-related funding we just referenced, I have received call after call from farmers who have been anxiously awaiting the loan money that is tied up in this supplemental appropriations bill. Mother Nature does not wait for Congress to act. The ideal planting window has already come and gone for several commodities in the South, and yet, many producers have not been able to put a crop in the ground because they do not have adequate funds for operating expenses. The money is included in this bill and it is critical that we act on this matter as quickly as possible. 
   While I am pleased that these funds are included, I am disappointed that more assistance is not provided to the agriculture community. If ever there was an emergency in this country, we are seeing one now in rural America. I commend the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator HARKIN, on his efforts to provide additional assistance to farmers. I hope that my colleagues will be ever mindful of the potential consequences this country will face if we allow our producers to simply die on the vine, and I strongly urge this body to revisit the agricultural crisis as soon as possible. 
   Some of my colleagues have chosen to use this bill, which is designed specifically for emergency needs, to fund projects that would have a hard time passing the laugh test of emergency spending. In spite of this, I will be casting a vote in favor of this bill on behalf of the brave servicemen and women representing our nation in the conflict in Kosovo, and on behalf of our nation's family farmers. 
   I thank the President, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to join my colleagues Senator HARKIN and Senator WELLSTONE in offering an amendment that will help reduce crime and violence in our nation's schools. 
   This amendment specifically addresses the issue of our children's emotional well-being, and what we as a nation, can do to provide schools with the necessary resources to help our kids. 
   The lives of America's children are very different than they were 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Before our children reach their teenage years, they've already been exposed to drugs, alcohol, violent movies and a general culture of violence that influences their thoughts and actions. 
   Many have expressed that they are even desensitized to violence in their everyday lives. 
   And today's students bring more to school than just backpacks and lunch boxes. They bring severe emotional problems. 
   They disrupt classes, they have difficulty learning, they suffer from depression, and they fight with teachers and students. 
   And when they do not know how to deal with their feelings of anger and rage, they may even kill. 
   Since the school shooting a year ago in Jonesboro, I have been grappling with ideas to ensure that this type of tragedy never happened again. Unfortunately, it did happen again and we as a nation have got to act. 
   Children should not be afraid to go to school in the morning and parents should not be scared to send them there. Studies show that 71% of children ages 7 to 10 say they are worried they will be stabbed or shot while at school. 
   The Department of Education reported that in 1997, there were approximately 11,000 incidents nationally of physical attacks or fights in which weapons were used. 
   I don't claim to have all the answers on how to help our children, but I do think we should do more to get to the root of the problem. 
   We've got to look at the source of this problem; we must come up with some kind of preventive medicine, rather than using a haphazard Band-aid approach. 
   Metal detectors and controlling access to guns can hinder their ability to act out, but doesn't address their illness to begin with. 
   And as the tragedies in Jonesboro, Paducah and most recently as the horror in Colorado has shown us--while much of our country is prospering economically, we cannot allow our country's economic success cause us to ignore our social ills. 
   We can train our children to use computers, to analyze stocks and to meet the economic challenges of the new millennium. But if we do not address their emotional needs or teach them the value of human life, then what have we accomplished? 
   As Theodore Roosevelt said, ``To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.'' 
   Together, we must call for improvements, changes and accountability. This can be done, and it must be done. 
   We can install more metal detectors and surveillance cameras in schools, but we won't get to the root of the problem. The youth of America are suffering and all the increased security in the world may ease our minds, but it won't solve their problems. 
   The United States Congress can lead the way. We can take common-sense steps to see that tragedies like those in Colorado and Jonesboro become a distant, painful memory. 
   I've traveled all over my home state of Arkansas talking with educators and school administrators about what's happening in our schools. 
   The one common denominator--the one thing they all tell me is--``We need more counselors in our schools. We need more qualified mental health professionals to adequately deal with the enormous and overwhelming problems kids have today.'' 
   The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that although 7.5 million children under the age of 18 require mental health services, fewer than 1 in 5 receive it. 
   The Harkin/Lincoln/Wellstone amendment calls for $15 million in authorizing funds for FY 2000. In order for these services to reach children at a younger age, this money must be spent in elementary schools. 
   Only qualified mental health professionals may be hired with this funding. Fortunately, these funds are eligible to urban, suburban and rural local school districts. As we all know, rural and suburban areas need our help as much as inner city schools. 
   The additional school counselors, psychologists and social workers will work hand-in-hand with an advisory board of parents, teachers, administrators and community leaders to design and implement counseling services. 
   School counselors will involve the parents of children who receive services so parents can be more involved in the development and well-being of their children. 
   This legislation will help accomplish that and will allow teachers to focus more on a student's skills at writing and arithmetic, rather than on his or her potential for violence. 
   I will fight to see that this legislation passes, so we can begin to make changes happen in my home state and across our country now, and not wait until the next tragedy. I hope my colleagues will work with me in that effort.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a bill that we have been addressing and that I think we have made some good progress on, the juvenile justice bill. But I rise today to encourage, to plead with both sides of the aisle, with all of my colleagues in the Senate, that we remember what it is we are here to address, and that is the well-being of our children; that we put down and put aside all of the other things to really focus on what it is we are here to do, and that is to address the well-being of our children in this country. 
   I think it is so important that we do not lose sight of the tragedies we have seen that have presented to us the agony which has brought us to this floor and to this debate to try to do something to correct those tragedies and, more importantly, to prevent any others from happening in the future. 
   It is so easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. If we continue that in this debate on juvenile justice, we will have done a true disservice to the children of this Nation. 
   I will speak today on an amendment which will be offered, which I am joining two of my colleagues in offering, Senator HARKIN and Senator WELLSTONE. We think it will help to reduce crime and violence in our Nation's schools by preventing it before it ever happens, and that is exactly what can be the most important tool in this Nation in providing safety for our children. 
   It addresses the issues of the children's emotional well-being and providing schools with the necessary resources to help our children deal with the complicated problems that today society brings them. 
   Students bring more to school today than just backpacks and lunch boxes; they bring severe emotional problems. Our children in today's world come to school with problems far more severe than we can imagine, and certainly far more severe than we may have experienced ourselves. And 71 percent of the children ages 7 to 10 are worried whether they will be stabbed or shot while in their school. This is inexcusable in a country like ours, that that many children are frightened to go to school and they are frightened of what they will be up against. 
   The Department of Education reported that in 1997 there were approximately 11,000 incidents nationally of physical attacks or fights in which weapons were used. We can no longer continue to look for a solution which is only a Band-Aid. We must look at the source of the problem. Preventative medicine rather than a haphazard Band-Aid approach is something that is absolutely essential to the emotional well-being of our children today and the future of our country. 
   Theodore Roosevelt said: To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society. 
   It is so absolutely essential, in today's society where we are blessed with so much advanced technology, that we remind our children that their emotional well-being, that the friendships and the fellowships that they must build with their fellow students is essential to the safety of mankind and the future of this country. Isn't it great that my children and other people's children, one day when they are older, will be able to communicate on the Internet to children in France and other countries across the world? 
   But let us not forget that we must encourage them also to walk out the back door of the house and to talk over the back fence again with their neighbors and their neighbor's children so they know who their friends and their neighbors are and so they are less likely to violate them. 
   It is absolutely essential that we do not lose sight of what it is we are here to do on behalf of our children. Improvements, changes in accountability, are absolutely essential in our children's education. Metal detectors and surveillance cameras in schools won't get rid of the root of the problem. They will help us in dealing with what we have to deal with right now, but the most important thing we can do is provide our children with the kind of counseling and background to deal with the severity of problems they are coming to school with at a younger and younger age. We must minimize access to guns that can address the means to act out, but it doesn't address the illnesses that we begin with in our children's minds. 
   I have traveled across our State of Arkansas, and in absolutely every school I have visited, every teacher and administrator has said the same thing to me--we do not have adequate counselors and trained professionals to deal with the severity of problems our children are coming to school with today in K through 3. We do not have the appropriate resources to give to our teachers and our administrators to help them recognize the problem in these children. 
   It is absolutely essential that we give them that resource in counselors and professionally trained individuals. The National Institutes of Health estimates although 7.5 million children under the age of 18 require mental health services, fewer than one in five receives it. 
   All of us have our own personal stories to tell of a relationship or something we have heard through the education process. One of my older sisters was a teacher in the public schools. She had a classroom of 31 students, 6 and younger. She said that wasn't the biggest challenge in her classroom. The biggest challenge in her classroom was that those students came to school hungry and sick and, most importantly, frightened. 
   We have a severe crisis on our hands in the fact that we now, in our State of Arkansas and in other States, have no young people going into the teaching profession. Less than 25 percent of the teachers in the State of Arkansas are under the age of 40. We will hit a brick wall soon, because no one is going into the teaching profession. My sister is a great example. One of the reasons she got out of teaching was she said she couldn't handle bus duty when she had it, because there were students that clung to her leg and said, please, don't make me go home. It is essential that we deal with the emotional well-being of 
   our children. 
   I rise today in support, with two other colleagues, of an amendment we will offer to this juvenile justice bill when we get beyond the forest and we start to recognize what it is we are here to do; that is, the details of dealing with the well-being of our children. 
   The details of the Harkin-Lincoln-Wellstone amendment are basically to put $100 million in authorizing funds for fiscal year 2000. The first $60 million must be spent for counseling services in elementary schools where the illness and the problem begins, before it grows into the problems that we deal with in terms of guns and violence in later grades. Only qualified mental health professionals may be hired with this funding. The funds are eligible to urban, suburban and rural local school districts, knowing that every school is suffering from these problems. Some more than others, but all of them equally in need. 
   It is absolutely essential. The benefits of what we are proposing are to treat the emotional problems before they are out of control, to work hand in hand with an advisory board of parents, teachers, administrators and community leaders to design and implement counseling services, because we know that the most important part of any child's well-being is their parental and family involvement. It is essential in what we are doing. 
   We know that when we involve the parents in the child's life, it is far more  productive. But involve the parents of the children who receive services so that the parents can be more involved in the development and the well-being of their children, so it is not just one shot at trying to fix the problem, but a continuing of trying to fix the problem both through the counseling services to the children and assistance with the parents. 
   Teachers focus more on a student's skills at writing and arithmetic, rather than their potential for violence, because they do not have the support that they need, because their classroom sizes are too large, and they don't have the time to devote to it. I plead with my colleagues that we must get back to the business at hand, and that business is the well-being of the children of this country who are our future. 
   I urge Congress to act quickly, and I certainly want to devote the time to this important issue that we have begun to do and I hope we will continue. I just plead with my colleagues to remember that what we are dealing with in this legislation is our Nation's greatest resource--our children. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the Washington Regional Medical Center in Fayetteville, AR, for being awarded the American Hospital Association's prestigious 1999 NOVA award. This award is given to acknowledge hospitals that create and implement new and innovative community partnerships. Only nine hospitals nationwide were honored by this distinction. 
   The Washington Regional Medical Center is a leader in its commitment to the health and well-being of Washington County's children. The Washington Regional Medical Center works to reverse the trend of chronic disease, disability, and even death through its ``Kids For Health Program.'' In collaboration with the Washington County school system, more than 8,000 children have been educated about self-esteem, general health, nutrition, fitness, hygiene, safety, and environmental health. Good health habits learned at a young age often parlay into better health in adult life. The ``Kids For Health Program'' proves that communities which educate their children in healthy habits reap vast benefits by becoming healthier communities overall. 
   On behalf of all the children in Arkansas, I thank the Washington Regional Medical Center for its impressive achievement in children's health and its contribution to stronger communities.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a situation that grows more dim with each passing day. My colleagues and I came to the floor before the Easter recess and addressed this very issue. 
   The Farm Service Agency has depleted many of its accounts, and quick passage of the supplemental appropriations bill is absolutely vital to replenish these funds and to get our farmers back into the fields. 
   I was very pleased with USDA's emergency action on March 26 to keep loan money available and to keep temporary employees on staff. However, that funding has run out in many areas, and Congress has yet to complete action on the bill. 
   The billions of dollars in agricultural credit authority contained in the bill is literally the only hope of staying on the farm for hundreds of Arkansas producers and many farm families. 
   In Arkansas, we need an additional $41 million for FSA's loan programs. We are experiencing the largest USDA credit demand since the mid-1980s. As of April 23, our State FSA offices had delivered more than $179 million in credit 
   assistance. 
   Due to bad weather, low prices and poor outlooks, the need for Government-guaranteed credit has increased substantially this year. Our agricultural industry is on a deadline with Mother Nature, and it cannot wait any longer. 
   The timeliness of this legislation cannot be overemphasized. For those of us in Southern States, our planting time has already come and is just about gone. We are in dire straits. All farmers across this Nation are in dire straits. It is so very important for us to act in this body in a timely fashion in recognizing this problem. 
   In addition, I take this opportunity to express to my colleagues that agriculture is vitally important to all of us across this Nation and to the rest of this world. It seems that every time I turn on the television, there is another story applauding the unbelievable success of our Nation's economy. 
   Unfortunately, not every segment of our society is sharing in this period of economic bliss. The agricultural community nationwide is suffering. 
   USDA economic projections for 1999 do not offer much hope for relief in the immediate future, and it will fall upon our shoulders to explore the short-term, as well as the long-term, policy resolutions to farm revenue problems. 
   It may not be the most popular issue of the day, but every one of us enjoys the safest, most abundant and most affordable food supply in the world today produced by American agricultural growers. 
   This safe and abundant food supply will not be there for this Nation or for the world if we do not support our family farmers at this critical time. Once those family farms are gone, they will no longer be back in production. 
   I certainly thank the President for allowing me to talk about this and to reiterate to my colleagues how absolutely important it is.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to do something that I know my fellow colleagues in the Senate will be very interested in, and that is to pay tribute to one of the Senate's esteemed graduates and a role model for all Americans, former Senator David Pryor. 
   As a young woman and a former Congresswoman from Arkansas, I have always looked up to Senator David Pryor for his intelligence, his dedication, his tenacity and his compassion for his fellow man. 
   Now, I have found a new reason to admire my former colleague and long-time friend. For those of you who don't know, last week David Pryor left his current post at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. 
   No, he didn't take a job at Yale or even an Ambassadorship. He has gone to Kosovo. Not as a diplomat or as a U.S. official, not even as a Harvard professor, but as a hands-on volunteer who is helping care for Kosovo refugees in Albania. 
   I am sure that many of you who served with David Pryor and already know him as a great humanitarian are not in the least bit surprised by this. 
   Senator Pryor recently signed on with the International Rescue Mission, a New York based group which was started by Albert Einstein to help those suffering under Hitler's regime. The organization is currently building shelters and assembling sanitation systems to improve living conditions for thousands of displaced Albanians. 
   Senator Pryor loaded up his suitcase with gifts for the refugee children--candy bars and crayons. And he told the International Rescue Mission that he was going there to work for 30 to 60 days. 
   Some may ask what prompted David Pryor to take this step. By all accounts, he has had a remarkable career--serving as a Senator and the Governor of my home state and the state legislature as one of its youngest members. 
   He has been able to continue his love of politics by teaching young people at  Harvard's esteemed school of Government. And he has a wonderful family, who he enjoys immensely and who loves him dearly. It all sounds like a pretty full life. 
   When asked by a friend why he made the decision to go to Kosovo, Pryor responded that he was too young to fight in World War II and he was too involved in his own career during the civil rights struggle to contribute much in that event. 
   Now, later in life he was struck by the reports and pictures coming out of the Yugoslav region. He was concerned for the thousands of children and families who were in need and who he wanted to do something for. So, after a week of deliberating within himself, he woke his wife in the middle of the night and said, ``Honey, we've got to talk.'' A week later, off he went. 
   Since he has been in Albania, Senator Pryor has reported once back to his family and sent a fascinating letter to friends, family and former staff. He works in a camp digging latrines and assisting the Red Cross efforts to secure supplies. Last Saturday he bought 5,000 bars of soap and diapers for 1,000 babies. 
   ``Being here a week makes me wonder about our world and how people can do such unthinkable, brutal things to other humans,'' Senator Pryor wrote. ``It is a world of unreality.'' 
   He says of the men ``All their incentive and pride has been stripped from them and they having nothing left.'' 
   About half of the dislocated refugees in the camp where Senator Pryor works are children. They are scared. They are tired. They are hungry. And above all, they are devastatingly sad. They mourn lost loved ones and ache to return to their homeland. 
   Senator Pryor also shared with his family the stories of two women, one whose daughter had been raped at the hands of a Serb police officer; the other a young mother has been separated from her three children, all under the age of 5, for more than a month. She was forced to flee her home, abandon her life and possessions in Yugoslavia, and now continues to desperately search for her family, her small children. 
   These are just some of the images Senator David Pryor is seeing on his trip. They are even more heart wrenching than any of us could imagine. 
   Whether or not you support U.S. involvement in the Kosovo region, none of us can imagine or ignore the human tragedy that is unfolding along its borders. Every day our televisions and newspapers carry new images of the suffering--new reports of atrocities by Yugoslav troops. 
   I, for one, feel better about the humanitarian conditions and the thousands who are suffering, knowing that David Pryor is lending a hand and leading with his heart. 
   My generation has yet to see the kind of nationwide mobilization and spirit of volunteerism that swept our country during World War II and the Korean War. My mother has often told me of rationing gas and preserving food. She told me of joining together with friends and family to plant a victory garden and to make morale-boosting gifts to send to our troops overseas. 
   I have such enormous respect for the efforts of all Americans during that time and I hope we as a nation can join together in support of our troops and the humanitarian efforts to help the Kosovo refugees now. 
   I commend Senator David Pryor's efforts, wish him well, and urge all of us to take note of his selfless example. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   It certainly is ironic that we should be scheduled to vote on education legislation today in the wake of last night's tragedy in Colorado. All of the Nation is wondering how we can help our children. 
   Since a school shooting a year ago in my home State of Arkansas, I have been grappling with ideas to ensure that this type of tragedy never happens again. Unfortunately, it did happen again yesterday when the peacefulness of a Denver, CO, suburb was shattered by the sounds of explosions and gunfire. 
   The first line of defense against the terrible television images that we have seen over and over during the last 24 hours, 
   and all too often during the last year, is guidance and love in the home. Parents must take responsibility for their children. And we, as a society, must do all that we can to provide the support our children need. 
   Our children are truly our greatest national resource. We must make their education a national priority. In order to do this, our teachers need help, too. 
   Each year our Nation's educators are asked to wear more than one hat, to take on more roles--all the while teaching our most precious resource. They make sacrifices every day, and quite literally in some instances have put their lives on the line for the safety of our children. 
   I do not claim to have all of the answers, but I do think we should provide more assistance to our teachers in identifying troubled children and giving them skills to deal with these students. One of the single common denominators I get from school principals in K through 3 elementary grades is that they must have more resources in their schools, more medical professionals to deal with the severity of problems that our young children are coming to school with today. 
   We have to give the teachers and the administrators the support and trust necessary to guide our children when we cannot be there. And finally, we must put more counselors and qualified medical health professionals in our schools as resources for teachers and administrators. 
   Yes, we can install more metal detectors and surveillance cameras in schools, but we will not get to the root of the problem. The youth of America are suffering, and all of the increased security in the world may ease our minds but it will not ease their pain. 
   I plan to work with the Senate Education Committee on school counseling and mental health legislation so that we can take proactive, commonsense steps toward seeing that tragedies such as those in Colorado and Jonesboro, AR, become only a distant, painful memory. 
   But we are here today to move forward in the field of education. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Ed-Flex bill. I am pleased that both sides could reach an agreement in conference so we can proceed to final passage of S. 280. 
   Although this process has taken longer than most of us wanted, there is a silver lining in this cloud. The Ed-Flex bill has given the Senate the opportunity to talk seriously and comprehensively about education--one of the most important issues facing our country. 
   It is absolutely essential that we continue that debate in the Senate. I have a county in southwest Arkansas where our superintendent made it an obligation to his school district that within 3 years he would minimize the size of K through 3 grades to well below 18 students per teacher. This school year they achieved that goal and have seen remarkable differences in their students. 
   Once the Ed-Flex bill passes, and States have greater flexibility with Federal funds, we hope to see so much more of that. We still have lots of work to do to ensure that our children get a good education and the best possible start in life. 
   Why? Because education is a national investment, with the highest possible return for which we could ask. The knowledge and training that we provide our children are the tools that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. When we give them these tools, we have successfully invested in the success of our workforce and the future of our country. 
   How do we accomplish this? First, let's talk about school construction and renovation. 
   As a product of Arkansas's public schools, I know they are not just buildings where students and teachers spend their time; they are the cornerstones of our communities. And when a community works together to improve its schools, everyone benefits. 
   We have to physically fix our schools that are crumbling. What kind of a message does it send to our children when we send them to a school that has been allowed to literally fall apart? We have to devote the resources necessary to improving these situations. 
   School buildings also need to be adapted and equipped for computers that are wired to the Internet. All of our Nation's children should be able to take advantage of technology and a ride on the information superhighway. 
   In Arkansas, a recent survey of school facilities conducted by the Arkansas Department of Education reports that facility maintenance is one of the largest expenses for schools. The need for maintenance is often forgotten or overlooked, but in fact, the cost of roof repair or replacement is one of the largest expenses that schools incur. 
   The study also indicates that 364 buildings are occupied beyond their capacity. Some areas of the state are struggling to provide adequate facilities to accommodate the student population growth. No one wants our children to study in make-shift classrooms. Portable buildings and mobile trailers don't serve children or teachers well. 
   As a Senator who represents a predominantly rural state, let me point out that we can't ignore our rural schools when we talk about school construction and renovation. I raised the needs of rural schools last week on the Senate floor and will continue to do so as long as the education debate continues. I look forward to working with Senator KENNEDY on the needs of rural schools as well as other Senators on both sides of the aisle who share my concern. 
   In addition to building new schools and renovating older ones, we must reduce class size by hiring new teachers. Studies show that children learn better in smaller classrooms and teachers are able to do a better job teaching children when they can devote more time to fewer children. 
   I have spent a lot of time talking with teachers in Arkansas. They are desperate for Federal assistance to help them reduce class size because a crisis is looming. Only 15 percent of the teachers in Arkansas are under the age of 40. 
   This summer, Arkansas will receive $11.6 million as its first installment of funds to hire teachers to reduce class size in early grades. Clearly, State educators are excited about this new pool of funding to hire more teachers, but they are quick to point out that they need commitments from Congress for additional funding to maintain the new teachers in years 2 through 7. They simply don't have the funds to pay for these new teachers in years 2 through 7. What an important field. But we also must encourage young adults to go into education. 
   Schools are now in the process of making hiring decisions for the fall. Let's make a commitment to this funding soon so school boards and principals can hire new teachers and promise them jobs for more than just one year. 
   I believe that as Senators, we can come together and do the right thing by our Nation's children, parents and educators. Let's take steps to end violence, reduce class size and rebuild our schools so America's children can thrive. Let us, in the Senate, not end our discussion on education--our greatest national investment with this Ed-Flex bill, but let us continue this discussion and truly make our children's education a national priority.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, on tax-filing day, it is customary for Senators to note the many difficulties that taxpayers have complying with a complex and unwieldy tax system. I plan to highlight some problems with the system later today. But I do think it is important, however, to note that some aspects of our system have worked very well. 
   Since the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1913, the tax system has provided a deduction for mortgage interest. 
   The mortgage interest deduction is one of the simplest, most widely available, and most widely understood of all the provisions in the Code. 
   What is important about the deduction is the support it provides for a goal that is of paramount importance to all Americans--Homeownership. Just five years ago, the rate of homeownership was declining in our country. Beginning in late 1997, however, the rate of homeownership began to climb, so that now, a record number of American families own their own homes. For the first time in our history, two-thirds of all households own their own homes. Where has the growth in homeownership been most evident? Every age group has expanded its ownership, and, even more importantly for the future of our country, the two categories of homeowners that have seen the greatest rates of growth are first-time homeowners and minorities. It is also notable that within 6 years of naturalization, foreign-born individuals achieve the same rate of homeownership as the nation at large. This is a great achievement that shows that the American Dream is alive and well. 
   When asked why they want to own their own homes, Americans in all parts of the country note that ``Owning my own home is the American dream. That is what it all boils down to, that I own my own home.'' They do not buy a home to get tax breaks. They buy a home to attain a sense of community. Neighborhoods that have a high rate of 
   homeownership have high rates of voting, participation in schools, and lower crime rates. 
   It seems that we all complain a great deal about the complexity of the tax system. I think that a great deal of this tax code ridicule is justified. The U.S. Tax Code now consumes more pages than eight Bibles. It is generally too complicated and unfair for most taxpayers. I too believe that the tax code must be streamlined but only while preserving important taxpayer deductions such as the home mortgage deduction. It is important to note that, as far as the tax code goes, one of the easiest steps in the computation process is the mortgage interest deduction. Unlike many more recently created tax breaks, the mortgage interest deduction presents no difficult formulas, calculations, or income limits for taxpayers who utilize the deduction. The lender simply provides the interest and property tax amounts to the homeowner on a Form 1098. The taxpayer then simply transfers these two numbers from the form on to their tax return. 
   Among the taxpayers who itemize their deductions, 28 million used the mortgage interest deduction in 1995, the most recent year for which statistics were available. In that group, 71% had incomes below $75,000, and 42% had incomes below $50,000. Clearly, the mortgage interest deduction is a significant benefit for middle class taxpayers. 
   Homeownership is a cornerstone of American life. The tax code has always supported that goal and facilitated the great achievements we have made. The stability and simplicity of the tax policies supporting homeownership have played a crucial role in the progress we have made in keeping the American Dream alive. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to reiterate to my colleagues the need for immediate reform in the Alternative Minimum Tax. This tax, which was created to stop the very wealthy from ducking taxes through exemptions and tax shelters, looms in the future of millions of unwitting American taxpayers. Economists from the Treasury Department and elsewhere state that perhaps 12 million American taxpayers will be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax and its higher rates over the next 10 years. Now these people, these 12 million, these are not millionaires, they are mainstream people. According to the Treasury Department if we do nothing to change the AMT there will be a 638% increase in the number of taxpayers earning between $15,000 and $30,000 who will pay the AMT's higher rates. By 2008, 12% of the taxpayers paying the AMT will be earning between $30,000 and $50,000, 29% will be earners of $50,000 to $75,000. By 2008, 45% of people paying the AMT, a tax created for the very wealthy, will have Adjusted Gross Incomes of less than $75,000. If this alone is not enough to alarm this body perhaps we should consider the fact that an estimated 2000 families making over $200,000 will not pay one red cent in taxes this year. This is an unfair, unjustified, and inaction by this body is unreasonable. The AMT is out of sync with its purpose and it must be changed. 
   There are two major factors that have brought the AMT into the lives of middle-income taxpayers--first, tax credits created to help families and aimed at promoting education and community are considered to be preferences in terms of AMT determination. This means that many taxpayers must choose between applying middle-income tax credits and paying the AMT or forgoing the benefits of the credits and paying regular income tax. The AMT is threatening to prevent millions of middle-income families from receiving these valuable family tax credits such as the dependant care credit, the credit for the elderly and disabled, the adoption credit, the child tax credit, and the HOPE scholarship. No one, rich or poor, should be forced to pay the AMT, and higher rates, because they use these credits. 
   Second, Mr. President, the AMT has not been adjusted for inflation since 1993. This problem simply speaks for itself. While the cost of living has increased by approximately 43% since the tax code was last overhauled in 1986, the AMT has been adjusted only once by 12.5% in 1993. It is an inevitability that middle-income families will be drawn into the AMT if nothing is done to adjust a tax provision that is structured like the AMT. It is very important that this problem be addressed and I am happy that Senator LUGAR has brought this issue to the forefront of debate with his bill which would index the AMT beginning in 1993. 
   We can do a great favor to ourselves and our constituents this legislative session by fixing the AMT. Many families are not aware of the AMT. Most, I'm sure don't realize that soon they may be subject to the AMT and its higher rates. I promise, however, that if we do not fix the AMT now there are 12 million people out there that will let you know in the coming years. 12 million people, 45% of which earning less than $75,000 in adjusted gross income. One-million-four-hundred-and-forty-thousand Americans earning between $30,000 and $50,000 will be contacting their representatives in Washington in the coming years to ask, ``how can you people possibly consider me wealthy enough to pay a special tax for the wealthy?'' They will ask, ``why am I being punished for applying these tax credits that you gave me.'' 
   While the bulk of the bulk of the middle-income AMT damage can be abated by Congressional action now, the AMT is already starting to take its toll on a handful of middle-income voters. I received a letter from an accountant in the northwest Arkansas town of Harrison. Jeff Hearn, who has impeccable professional credentials and who I understand to be a very well-respected practitioner among his peers, wrote me about the AMT plight of one of his clients. He wrote, ``Please find enclosed the description of one of my clients who is a young aspiring farmer with chicken houses in northwest Arkansas . . . He and his wife have two beautiful children who both qualify for the new child tax credit this year . . . However, when their return was completed they were subject to alternative minimum tax.'' Apparently this family was forced into paying AMT due to a combination of the new child tax credit and excess depreciation arising from their budding farm operation. I believe Mr. Hearn said it best when he wrote, ``It seems quite unfair to me that a couple under the age of thirty, who are trying to build an agricultural business in addition to working for a living would have to pay alternative minimum tax when individuals who make hundreds of thousands of dollars are still not paying alternative minimum tax.''

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues being on the floor today to talk about this important issue. I am pleased to be here in support, and I am pleased to see these Senators helping to educate our other colleagues in this body about the importance of this issue. 
   It is not just to educate. It is also to impress upon them the urgency of this issue. I come from a seventh-generation Arkansas farm family. We are in dire straits. All farmers across this Nation are in dire straits. It is so very important for us to act in this body and in this Congress in a timely fashion. 
   I believe my colleagues have expressed it, but it is so absolutely critical. Our farmers have been in dire straits for the past year, with bad weather, bad prices, and bad markets. This is the last straw. It is absolutely essential that we do something before we go home for this recess. 
   Our farmers right now are looking at the equivalent of 1970 prices. What industry could make it with the increase in production costs, the increase of keeping the business going, surviving on what people were making in the 1970s? It is absolutely impossible to survive in today's agriculture economic climate. 
   We produce the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the world. It is not going to be there for the future of this Nation and for the world if we do not support our farmers at this critical time. It is simply a desperate time. 
   I spent the last recess looking at the worry on the faces of Arkansas farmers as they have talked about this crisis. These farmers are ready to throw in the towel; many of them already have. I applaud Senator DORGAN's efforts and hope my colleagues will join him in addressing the needs of our agricultural community. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this bill addresses a crop insurance crisis that is plaguing my home state of Arkansas. 
   As many of you know, the outlook for the agricultural economy is very bleak for many parts of the country. As farmers in Arkansas and other states making their planting decisions for the upcoming growing season, they were offered what seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel. A crop insurance policy entitled CRCPlus. 
   CRCPlus is a supplemental crop insurance policy available only from America Agrisurance, Inc. and is offered on corn, cotton, grain sorghum, soybeans, wheat and rice in several states. For Arkansas' rice growers, the original CRCPlus policies offered what appeared to be a financially viable risk management tool by adding a privately backed 3 cents per pound to the underlying federal Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC) policies. This placed the guaranteed fall price for rice at a level above projected prices. With commodity prices depressed across the board, a large number of farmers decided to switch to growing rice based on this ``too good to be true'' offer. 
   At a time when the agricultural climate in Arkansas is devastated to begin with, these policies were a last ray of hope for hundreds of farmers. Now, essentially, American Agrisurance has pulled the rug out from under these families. On March 1, the company reneged, saying it would reduce the additional guarantee of coverage from 3 cents to 1 1/2 cents per pound. This announcement came after the sales period for crop insurance was closed, leaving many producers with a product they would not have otherwise purchased. Many producers felt they had been misled and I tend to agree. I am very thankful to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Risk Management Agency Director, Ken Ackerman for their assistance in opening the cancellation period for crop insurance over the last two weeks so that the affected producers had more time to evaluate whether to keep the CRCPlus policies. This extra time eased the mind of many producers in my state during a very troubling period. During this extended cancellation period many producers reevaluated the cost/benefit ratios calculated at the 1 1/2 cent level rather than the 3 cent level. Several producers canceled their polities with American Agrisurance, but many producers decided that the coverage offered was still sufficient to provide protection during a very volatile growing season and opted to stick with American Agrisurance and the CRCPlus policy. I wish the story ended here. 
   American Agrisurance has since indicated that due to a problem with its reinsurers, they may not be able to live up to the additional 1 1/2 cents of coverage on policies currently held by many producers. The company is reviewing its financial status and will announce on March 25th whether or not the 1 1/2 cent polices will be honored. This situation has further clouded the outlook for producers and left them wondering what to believe and who to trust. 
   Regardless of the company's excuses for its actions, it is now imperative that farmers who were wronged by this company be able to withdraw their  business. I have been working with the Administration, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar, and several other members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to draft legislation that addresses our producers' needs. This bill allows the Department of Agriculture to reopen the crop insurance sales period so that producers affected by the uncertainty of the CRCPlus situation can transfer to another approved insurance provider. 
   Farmers are on the verge of planting, so a swift response is necessary to clear up the confusion over their insurance protection. As the daughter of a seventh generation Arkansas farm family, I truly understand that in situations like this it's the farmer who gets left holding the bag. Each year, farmers go out on a limb and make critical planting decisions based on obligations and promises. My heart goes out to all who have made plans based on these policies. I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this matter so that a wrong can be righted in America's heartland. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague from Arkansas. 
   Mr. President, I join my colleagues, all of my colleagues, here today, but especially my fellow colleague from Arkansas, Senator HUTCHINSON, in a very special effort to designate March 24, 1999, as National School Violence Victims Day. 
   As mentioned by my colleague, a year ago today the peaceful routine of a small middle school just outside of Jonesboro, in my home State of Arkansas, was forever changed. People across our country still grieve over the tragic shooting of four 11-year-old children and one 32-year-old schoolteacher of Westside Middle School. 
   The heartbroken families of victims Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson, Britthney Varner, and teacher Shannon Wright still question why it happened. What prompted two boys at the tender ages of 13 and 11 to violence? What spurred them to shoot their schoolmates and their teacher? The answers may be beyond our comprehension. 
   Mr. President, the shooting at Westside Middle School is one of the gravest tragedies in the history of our State and our 
   country. Though time has evoked some healing and renewed confidence, the children and teachers of Westside Middle School were apprehensive when returning to school last fall. Teachers had to comfort nervous children. Parents had misgivings. And playmates longed for their young friends. Having seen such young children fall to their death at the hands of classmates right before their very eyes, this brave community is having a hard time making sense of it all. We all are having a hard time making sense of it all.  
   Sadly, last year's tragedy in my home State is not an isolated event. Over the past 18 months, gun violence has claimed lives at schools in Pearl, MS, as mentioned by my colleague; West Paducah, KY; Edinboro, PA; Fayetteville, TN; Springfield, OR; and Richmond, VA. Each time as our country watched in horror, we wondered if this senseless violence would ever stop. 
   Mr. President, the picture painted by these images is ghastly indeed. Our Nation's schools are not just buildings where children and teachers spend their days. They are the cornerstones of our communities and the centers of young precious lives. Parents send their children to school day after day with the expectation that they will learn and that they will be safe. There are many things we can do in the Senate to curb school violence. We must not allow schools to become places to fear. 
   I urge this body to examine this escalating problem. And I urge each Senator to use National School Violence Victims Day to create a dialogue with school communities in their States. When an entire community works together to improve its schools, everyone benefits. Every child deserves the opportunity to attend a safe school where he or she may worry about math and science, not guns and violence. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to National Women's History Month. I am proud to have the privilege of being the youngest woman ever elected to serve in this great body. And I want to use the occasion of Women's History Month to recognize just a few women from Arkansas who are paving roads for others to follow. I want to thank the many women who have blazed trails for years before me in order to secure a more prominent role for women of all professions, race, or faiths. In my home state of Arkansas, there are many such examples of women who deserve notoriety. 
   Judge Bernice Kizer of Fort Smith was one of the first 5 women to enroll in the University of Arkansas Law School. After a brief time in private practice, she was elected to represent Sebastian County in our state legislature. During her tenure in the Arkansas General Assembly, 
   Judge Kizer had the distinction of being appointed the first woman chairman of any legislative committee and the first woman member of the Legislative Council. She served in that capacity for 14 years, and then returned home to Sebastian County to become the first woman elected a judge in my home state of Arkansas. Judge Kizer's accomplishments are even more monumental when you understand that over the course of her 33 year career in public service, she was elected by Arkansans on 10 separate occasions without ever accepting one single campaign contribution. At the age of 83, Judge Kizer still serves as an active member of the Sebastian County Democratic Party. Judge Kizer paved the way for so many Arkansas women who are now involved in either the legislative or judicial branches of our government. On the Arkansas Supreme Court, Justice Annabelle Clinton Imber holds one of the courts seven seats. Secretary of State Sharon Priest and State Treasurer Jimmie Lou Fisher serve as two of Arkansas' constitutional officers. Today, Arkansas has 20 women who serve in our legislature. 
   Community service and philanthropy are two vital components of life in many of the small rural communities in Arkansas and women have helped lead the way to improve our quality of life. My home State of Arkansas ranks third in the nation for philanthropic giving. The gifts given to the people of Arkansas have consisted of civic centers, art centers, and classroom equipment just to name a few by women like Helen Walton, Bess Stephens, and Bernice Jones. These gifts have had a significant impact on the lives of all of the areas residents. Whether it be insuring a warm meal to a hungry child in the early morning or after school activities, these women have looked beyond their own world and reached out to others in need. My mother has always told me that the kindest thing you can do for someone is to do something nice for their children. And as a young mother, believing that to be true, I am grateful to these and all community activists who take the time to care for the less fortunate. 
   Numerous Arkansas women have ventured into previously 
   uncharted territories and established themselves as leaders in the business communities. These women, like Patti Upton, founder of Aromatique, Inc. have served as an inspiration to our state's growing number of young women who want to pursue business careers. Patti, who began this home fragrance endeavor in her kitchen in 1982, has turned a personal hobby into an inspiring professional growth opportunity. As the current President and CEO of what has become one of the nation's leading home fragrance companies, Patti has most recently begun to share her success with the rest of the State. Under her leadership, Aromatique created a line of products that include potpourri, candles, soaps and other products that are appropriately named ``The Natural State.'' All proceeds from this product line go to support the Arkansas Nature Conservancy and recently Aromatique surpassed the million dollar mark for contributions back to this civic organization. 
   Arkansas is the home of other women who have had dramatic effects in the business world. Diane Heuter is President and CEO of St. Vincent Health System and Julia Peck Mobley is CEO of Commercial National Bank in Texarkana. 
   Mr. President, I am so proud to be able to stand here today in this historic Chamber and proclaim my full support and participation in National Women's History Month. There is no doubt that women across this Nation have made very significant contributions to our lives. Sometimes those contributions are subtle and some times they are significant, but none the less worthy of recognition. Let us celebrate the invention of bullet proof vests, fire escapes, or wind shield wipers, all of which can be credited to women in our history, as ways to promote and encourage women of future generations to rise to the level of success that I have spoken of here today. From this great Chamber, to State legislative chambers, from the boardroom to the classroom, from corporate headquarters to local Head Start, women make a difference. 
   I am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me by those who have gone before me, and I hope in my tenure in the United States Senate to pave the way for many more young women from the great State of Arkansas. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you, Mr. President.  
   Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to speak on behalf of one of the issues that I think is the most important to our Nation. The great philosopher Edmund Burke once said, ``Education is the cheap defense of nations.'' So I think it is appropriate that we have moved on to education after last week's discussions about military spending. I tend to maybe disagree with some of my colleagues over there. I do think this is a very important issue to be discussing right now in the context of all of the different things we can be doing on behalf of our children, which I do think are our greatest resource. 
   Investing in our children is the best national investment we could possibly make at this stage of the game. Giving our children the tools to succeed is a valuable investment in the success of our workforce and the resulting economy. 
   Schools are not just buildings where children and teachers spend their days. Our schools serve as the cornerstone of our neighborhoods, and they are the most basic building blocks that our children need to compete in the future and in the coming 21st century. There is no doubt that our time is very well spent in this debate here not only on the issue of Ed-Flex and being able to give States and school districts flexibility to be able to produce the best workforce possible, but it is also a great time for us to be speaking in the context of all issues related to education--certainly, increasing our teachers and making sure that we have the proper infrastructure. 
   We all have our particular areas in education of great importance, and certainly, we all represent different areas in the country that have specific needs. But we must ensure that as we discuss any legislation to repair our educational infrastructure, our school buildings, and classrooms, that we remember the needs of rural areas as well as urban areas. 
   We must also do our best to equip all classrooms with the proper wiring and equipment so all of our children can ride the information highway, not just those in urban areas. When I served in the House of Representatives, I worked on the telecommunications conference, and I recognized how absolutely vital it was for us in rural America to have an interest ramp 
   onto that information highway. 
   Let's not overlook the importance of parental involvement in our educational reform discussions here. When parents read with children each night and help them with their homework, they reinforce what their children have learned during the day. This is so totally appropriate, not only that we are talking again about the flexibility we can provide States and districts but of every aspect of education. And if we spend the first 2 months of this session talking about education and reinvesting in our children, it is certainly worth it. 
   Teachers will certainly have greater success in the classroom if parents are doing their part as well. We have a great example in northwest Arkansas of a family night constructed by a school district to help bring together fellowship in that school area with parents, local businesses, superintendents, principals, administration, teachers and students to come together in fellowship and understand their school community and how important that school community is to the overall community. 
   My sister and many of my other relatives are teachers. They have talked to me about the importance of getting  our children ready to learn. When you have a classroom of 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds who come in and are hungry or scared or they are sick, they can't possibly learn. School nutrition is absolutely vital to our children if they are going to be able to learn, to take on the tools they are going to need to be competitive. It is absolutely essential. I have met with teachers who have told me for years they could do their jobs better if they also weren't subbing as psychologists, doctors, and disciplinarians. 
   There is so much we can do. We can fill our time and our debate here with investing in that great resource of our children. These teachers have also told me one of the most important things we can continue to do is, again, reinforce those nutrition programs in our school districts. I have done some of that debate in our recent hearing this week in the Agriculture Committee, and I hope we will continue debating what an important role that plays in this discussion we have here. 
   As we discuss ways to empower teachers and improve teacher quality, let's try to support our teachers with resources so they can deal with the troubled children who are in our Nation's schools today. Whether children were born with the side effects of crack cocaine, or have witnessed domestic violence at home, or are tempted by others to smoke, these problems affect their performance in the classroom, and we must be focusing on how to eliminate those temptations to our children. Reducing class size is the first step toward helping our teachers deal with these issues, both being able to get the students' attention, but more importantly, to be the best teachers they can possibly be. 
   It is important that we move quickly to put 100,000 new teachers into the classrooms because school districts are making hiring decisions right now for the fall. That is what makes that issue important and a part of this legislation that we are discussing right now. 
   In my own State of Arkansas, like many of the other States that are represented here, a majority of our teachers are beginning to retire. We are losing a large number of our teachers over the next few years to retirement, and if we don't address the issue of teacher recruitment right now, we are going to be in serious trouble in many of our States. 
   We will not have the qualified teachers to be able to teach our children, to nurture them in what it is that they need to be competitive in the future. 
   I certainly appeal to my colleagues that all aspects of education must be addressed, and must be addressed as quickly as we can, because we certainly at this point must recognize that this greatest resource of ours, our children, and our future in this Nation are in jeopardy if we are not doing all we can in this debate to provide the best education possible for our children. 
   Let's reverse the unfortunate road and trend of fewer young adults pursuing a career in education. Let us work towards giving teachers the incentive not only in pay but in stronger classrooms, smaller sizes, and a better capability of reward in what it is that they are there to do, and that is to teach our children. 
   I thank my colleague for bringing this issue up. I am very supportive and have been an original cosponsor of Ed-Flexibility. But, more importantly, I think it is extremely appropriate for us to be discussing these issues of education. I hope we will continue this discussion and continue to improve this bill with so many of the opportunities that we have before us. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. I appreciate my colleague's concern. I would like to express to him--and I think it is probably the sentiment of many of the Senators from rural States--having visited with some of my communications workers on the technical aspects of what we need to do in order to bring our schools and the infrastructure up to the level where they are actually going to be able to house these wonderful pieces of technology and computers, that we have to bring those buildings up to standard if we don't want to create fire hazards by overwiring classrooms to try to accommodate equipment that we are not prepared for in the buildings. We really have to focus on that kind of investment and infrastructure in our classrooms. I have certainly seen it, traveling rural America--the problems that we see out there. I am dedicated to making sure that all of our children of this Nation receive that help.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am honored this morning to recognize Commander Mickey Vernon Ross, a great American from Arkansas who later today will be promoted to the rank of Captain in the United States Navy. With his promotion to Captain, Commander Ross not only earns the respect and admiration of his country, he also earns a place in Arkansas history, becoming the first African-American from our state to attain that high rank. 
   Commander Ross is a native of North Little Rock and comes from a proud family with a long record of military service, following his father and three older brothers into the Armed Services. His father is no longer with us, but his mother, Minnie P. Ross, has traveled from Arkansas to be at the ceremony formally recognizing her son's promotion today. As you might imagine, she is overjoyed knowing how hard her son has worked to accomplish this feat. His wife, Mary Ann Ross, of Elaine, Arkansas, which is my home area, and their two children, Timothy, age 14, and Benjamin, age 6, will also be on hand to celebrate this momentous occasion. 
   From an early age, Commander Ross has exhibited excellence in all aspects of his life--academically, professionally and personally. More than that, in a world short on heroes and role models to guide our children, Commander Ross is a shining example of the brilliant promise every life holds. Hard work and an eager spirit still equal success in America--no matter how difficult the challenges may be. It is my privilege--indeed, my duty as a voice for my state--to hold him up as an example for others to see. 
   After graduating from North Little Rock High School in 1973, Commander Ross attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he was commissioned an Ensign and graduated in 1977 with a degree in Physical Science. In 1983, Commander Ross received a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Currently, Commander Ross is pursuing a doctoral degree in Engineering Management at George Washington University. 
   As an officer in the Navy, Commander Ross has served his country with distinction. His first tour of duty was onboard the U.S.S. Ranger CV 61 where he helped the command receive top honors, the No. 1 Recruiting District in the Nation. Later, on the U.S.S. Acadia as the Repair Officer, his department received the highest award for fleet maintenance support and the ship received the Navy ``E'' award from Commander Naval Surface Forces, Pacific. And I couldn't help but notice  that in between his many assignments, Commander Ross found time to return to Arkansas to recruit Naval Officers at colleges and universities in our state. Today, Commander Ross is Director for Combat Systems for the Program Executive Officer for Aircraft Carriers at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Arlington, Virginia. 
   But Commander Ross' record as a student and a Naval Officer aren't the only things for which I want to commend him this morning. Commander Ross is also a devoted husband and a wonderful father. His wife, Mary Anne, and their children must be very proud of him today. 
   My father fought in Korea and my grandfather fought in World War I and they taught me at an early age to have the highest respect for the men and women in uniform who defend our nation. On behalf of the state of Arkansas and the United States Senate, I thank you, Commander Ross, for your service to our country. I hope the honor you bestow on your family, our state and our nation today inspires others to follow your example. I, for one, will be following your career with great interest and I suspect this will not be my last opportunity to recognize an outstanding achievement in your life. 
   I thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to ensure that middle income working families receive the tax credits that Congress intended for them. 
   There are many absurdities in our tax code, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to reform and simplify our entire tax system. Today, however, I offer a small first step toward making our tax laws sensible. The legislation I am introducing will protect millions of working families by allowing taxpayers to deduct their nonrefundable personal credits without having to include those credits in any determination of Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) liability. Tax laws created to deal with wealthy folks who overuse tax shelters simply should not apply to middle income families. This legislation is necessary, and it will actually remove language from the tax code making it more simple and more user friendly. 
   Imagine for a moment two working parents in Arkansas making $33,800. They work hard to spread their incomes far enough to pay their mortgage and care for their two school-age children and one in college. It may surprise you to know that this family falls under a tax burden that was created to ensure that the very wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. This family would have to pay the AMT. 
   While the threshold income limits of the AMT have been set since 1986, incomes have slowly crept up due to inflation. This, coupled with the inclusion of family tax credits in AMT liability determination, has led to the ironic situation that my legislation seeks to correct. The Alternative Minimum Tax must be changed so that a family will not be strapped with an added tax burden simply because they choose to have children or educate them. 
   Not only must we change the AMT, we must change it permanently. Last year, Congress provided a one year provision which removed the nonrefundable personal credits from AMT liability determination. I was pleased to see the President extend this provision for two more years in his budget. But we need to fix this problem permanently rather than using a band-aid approach of year-to-year alterations. 
   The AMT is a looming peril for a massive number of middle-income Americans. Two Treasury Department economists recently projected that the number of households earning from $30,000 to $50,000 that are subjected to the AMT will more than triple in the coming decade. Because the individual AMT parameters are not indexed for inflation, 2.8 million taxpayers will completely lose these important family credits by 2008. On top of this injustice, many unwitting taxpayers will owe penalties and interest on underpaid taxes. Such a situation cannot be allowed to exist. While Congress must soon address the issue of indexing the AMT for inflation, permanently removing the nonrefundable personal credits from the reach of the AMT is the first step to ensuring that America's middle-income taxpayers will receive the financial relief they deserve while avoiding the confusion and frustration of year-to-year tax legislation. 
   American families were given a child tax credit to help them raise their kids. Education credits were created to help make a college education more affordable for all Americans. These tax credits are good for families. They are important to working people and they are great for the long term future of our economy. As our law currently stands, however, many middle-income families will not be able to use these credits because they will be either totally eliminated or significantly reduced by the AMT. The education and child credits are not, however, the only credits that stand to be voided by the growing menace of the AMT. People who bring children into their homes will lose the value of the adoption credit. The credit for the elderly and the disabled will lose its value, and the dependant care credit will be effectively canceled by the AMT. This is absurd and the problem must be rectified. 
   I would like to thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senate MOYNIHAN, and his very capable staffer, Stan Fendley, for working with me on this legislation. And I'd like to thank Senators MOYNIHAN, COCHRAN, BREAUX, KERREY, and LANDRIEU for signing on as original co-sponsors. I encourage our colleagues to join us in this common sense approach to helping working families.

    Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, if you consult any of the numerous Congressional directories that are published here in Washington, you will see that they all list six members of the Arkansas Congressional Delegation--two Senators and four House members. But for the past 25 years, there has been an unofficial seventh member of our delegation: a dynamic, hard-working, can-do staffer named Henry Woods. After two decades in the nation's capital, Henry is retiring, and the state of Arkansas is losing a Washington institution. 
   Henry has helped one Congressman and three Senators from Arkansas to court and inform constituents, direct Arkansans to the assistance they need, provide intern opportunities for the state's young people, and stage events to advance his members' priorities at home and the state's interest in Washington. For the past 25 years, people  working in the state congressional delegation knew that if you wanted to launch an ambitious project and have it done well, you wanted Henry Woods to be in charge of it. 
   His institutional memory is as incredible as it has been invaluable. It is not uncommon for him, at a moment's notice, to recall the name of a constituent's wife, the ages of their children and which schools they attend, which of his cousins serve in the State Legislature, and what civic groups he belongs to and who he supported in the last campaign. He can also cite zip code after zip code, not to mention phone prefixes for cities and towns across Arkansas. 
   Over the years he has made many friends in the halls of the House and Senate, from the doorkeepers to the printing clerks, from the restaurant workers to the Rules Committee staffers who have all helped him accomplish things for the members and constituents. He has an amazing way of finding the people and the resources to accomplish any project he is given. 
   Henry, a proud Hot Springs native, is legendary for his political savvy and quick wit. His fellow staffers often wondered why someone as busy as Henry was so willing to serve as driver for his employer whenever one was needed. After a while, they realized that those occasions gave Henry as much as a half-hour of interrupted access to the member, which he used to full effect. He has often been heard cautioning members and staffers alike that certain visitors waiting to see them ``may not be right, but they're convinced.'' Another popular Henry-ism has been an admonition to disgruntled staffers that they ``can just get glad in the same clothes they got mad in.'' 
   Henry has set up and run intern programs that have easily helped more than 1,000 Arkansas students become familiar with the working of Congress and the federal government. His intern program has been so successful that it has been emulated by countless other congressional offices. Henry's interns never sat idly in the office waiting for the next tour, softball game or free reception. He made sure each one had the chance to work in a variety of capacities and learn a number of skills in the offices. It is not surprising that many of his interns have gone on to run for public office and serve in the state's leading corporations, commissions, and charitable organizations. 
   In addition to his official efforts, he kept the Arkansas State Society and the University of Arkansas alumni society running efficiently for many years, working countless hours of his personal time to organize events ranging from the cherry blossom reception to football watch parties and trips to the horse races--all aimed at keeping Arkansans in Washington in touch. 
   Several of his friends established an award in his name last year at his beloved University of Arkansas, where he served on the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association. A cash award will be given each year to a student who shows an interest in internships or government services. The award will be formally announced at the University on April 22. 
   To put it briefly, no matter which office he was working in, Henry quickly became indispensable, a fact that was recognized by countless people both on and off the Hill as the following letters attest. Now he is leaving for sunnier climes in the southern-most point of the continental United States. We are going to miss him, and we are going to be poorer without him. We wish him well, and we want to let him know that the key will be under the doormat for him any time he wants to come back.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment being offered by my friend from Florida. I appreciate my colleague's commitment to the fiscal responsibility that we have worked so hard to instill in Congress. This is only my second month serving in the United States Senate, but I certainly hope that the process we have followed in considering this legislation does not set a precedent for future debates. I am dis-  
   appointed that this bill and the amendments have not been considered in hearings before the Armed Services Committee. And I am disappointed that we are circumventing the appropriations process by considering this legislation now. 
   Certainly I believe that the pay increase and other benefits for the men and women who are serving our country are warranted, but I think we're going about this all wrong. I spent four years in the House of Representatives where I made tough decisions to reign in our federal deficit because I believe that we ought to run our country like most people with common sense run their families. I thought--and still think--that we should not spend money that we do not have. Have we already forgotten the lessons that we learned when the debt soared past $4 trillion? Do we really want to take credit for helping our veterans and the people who continue to serve our country without making the tough, but responsible choices on how to pay for these programs? 
   When I first came to Congress in 1992, our country faced a $300 billion annual operating deficit. We have worked hard and made difficult decisions to balance the budget and today we are blessed with a surplus. If today's process is any indication of our future actions, we seem poised to squander away the surplus without taking the time to make responsible choices. If we were following the rules we wouldn't be in this situation. The PAYGO provision enacted in 1990 set the framework to discipline Congress when we wanted to spend money without deciding where to get it. And now it appears that we are going to violate that provision because we won't make tough choices. 
   While I am very proud of the men and women who serve our country in the armed forces and while I am pleased to vote in favor of programs to support them adequately, I am disappointed in this body for failing to follow procedures we have set for ourselves. 
   Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LINCOLN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you for your thoughtfulness and patience in these proceedings. I apologize that my back is to you. 
   I would also like to thank the majority leader and the minority leader. I have been awed by their patience--just as Job had the patience--to deal with all of us on our particulars that we have wanted to express here and the time constraints we have all felt. They have done a wonderful job in accommodating all of us and certainly giving these proceedings the dignity that I think all Americans have expected. I do appreciate that. 
   As the youngest female Senator in the history of our country, as a farmer's daughter raised on the salt of the earth with basic Christian values, and as a young mother whose first priority in life is my family and the well-being of the world that they live in, I regret that my first opportunity to speak on the floor of this historic Chamber is under these circumstances. And I am reluctant to speak here today. I had intended to wait until I had more experience under my belt before I addressed my esteemed colleagues here. You will find that I am not quite as eloquent, or as lengthy, as my predecessor; but I will work on that. But because of the historical aspects of this proceeding, I feel it is important that my thoughts and my judgments are expressed here today. 
   I, like President Clinton and my colleague, Senator HUTCHINSON, grew up  in a small town in Arkansas, the oldest city in Arkansas. My colleague expressed regret that the black and white of right and wrong is not as easy as it was growing up in that small rural community. I am reminded of the wisdom that my grandmother shared with me as a younger woman returning home from college. I sat on our back porch and I expressed to her my agony over what difficult times I was growing up in, and that she could not possibly know or understand because right and wrong were so much easier in her day. She quickly corrected me. Right and wrong becomes more difficult for each of us as we grow older, because the older we get the more we know personally about our own human frailties. 
   I will not discuss the historical or the legal aspects about what we are doing here today and what we have been doing in these past weeks. I am not a lawyer; neither am I a historian. But I do want to thank each of you for your legal and your historical aspects, and the heartfelt wisdom and guidance that you have shared with me and with all of us as colleagues. 
   I want desperately to cast the right vote for the people that I represent in Arkansas and for all the people of this great country. My heart has been heavy and I have deliberated within my own conscience, knowing that my decision should not come out of my initial emotion of anger toward the President for such reckless behavior, but should be based on the facts. I have approached this both as a parent and as a public servant, with the ultimate goal of doing what is right for our country. Since hearing of the President's misconduct, I have in no way tried to make excuses for the President or to defend such dishonorable behavior. I have tried to determine how we should communicate to our children and our Nation that this very visible misconduct is unacceptable. 
   I have sought to reconcile in my mind what is appropriate condemnation of such action and what is the best course of action for the future of the Presidency and for this country. In my efforts to reach a fair conclusion, I have listened to the presentation of evidence from both sides. I have examined the historical intent of our Founding Fathers with regard to impeachment and my constitutional responsibility as a Senator--however young I may be. I have sought the counsel of colleagues, family, friends and constituents; and, of course, I have prayed for guidance for myself and for our country. 
   My home State of Arkansas has been under the scrutiny of a powerful microscope these past 6 years and, yes, regardless of how closely we may be viewed, any of us, character does count in each and every one of us. But who of us in this Chamber does not have a chapter in our individual books of life that we might be ashamed of or might regret--a chapter that might be revealed under such a powerful microscope, something we might be so ashamed of that we might mislead others to spare our families, our very children, the pain and sorrow? 
   Many have referenced what they would do if another President of their own party were in this situation, and they have indicated that they would still vote the same. 
   But the true test, I say, is what each of us would want done if we were in this President's position. How would we want to be treated? And who of us would not go to great lengths to protect our children and our families from the pain and embarrassment that we have seen over the course of these years? 
   I have also heard many people say that the President should be removed from office because he set a poor example for our children. It is all of our responsibility to set an example for our children. It is not just the President's. Ultimately, my husband and I have the responsibility to teach our children. And we will teach our children that misconduct is unacceptable. The President's conduct, however troubling, does not take away my responsibility to teach what is right to my children. Future generations depend on each of us--not just the President--to teach and to lead. 
   Many are amazed that the general public, although they believe that the President's behavior was wrong, does not want him removed from office. I am not so amazed by this as I find it reassuring. This expression of humanity and forgiveness from the real-life people of this Nation that we represent reassures us that in our highly technical, fast-paced and somewhat impersonal society, we as a country but, more importantly, we as human beings, are still equipped to handle this or any other situation. 
   It is striking to me that we are at a crossroads in our Nation at this entrance into the 21st century. We are being tested--not by war or by pestilence--but by conflict that is our own trouble from within. This requires us to reflect on not only the lessons we have learned but, more importantly, those that we want to leave. These lessons should not only demonstrate how we as a country prosper, or how our people advance, but how we treat and relate to one another as individuals. 
   So today, after much careful thought and deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that the President's actions, while dishonorable, do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense warranting his removal from office. Impeachment was never intended to be a vehicle or a means of punishment. And the standard to prove high crimes and misdemeanors has not been met by the disjointed facts strung together by a thread of inferences and assumptions that were presented here. 
   I have and will support a strong bipartisan censure resolution that tells the President and this Nation that the President's misconduct with a subordinate White House employee was deplorable, and that future generations must know that such conduct will lead to a profound loss of trust, integrity and respect. I believe there has to be consequences here not only to demonstrate that something wrong has been done but to finally bring closure to this ordeal, not just for us but also for the American people. 
   Above all else, I believe we have been entrusted not only to be judges and jurors in this trial, but we have also been entrusted with the last word. Senator KERREY from Nebraska spoke strongly to this--that the last word from this body's collective voice should be a chorus, loud and clear, of how great this land and our people are. 
   The President, actually in his own words from his 1993 inaugural address, aptly replied. He said, ``There is nothing wrong with this country that cannot be fixed by what is right with this country.'' 
   The most important thing we can do in the last days of this trial is to present the good in the U.S. Senate, in our government, and in our Nation for the sake of our children and future generations. I hope and pray that in the following weeks this body will grasp the leadership role and to begin the process of healing our Nation, restoring pride in our Government, and inspiring faith in our leaders once again.

   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in support of the ``States Rights Protection Act of 1999.'' I believe that states are entitled to retain the tobacco funds that were agreed upon under their settlement agreements. 
   These funds result from an historic accord reached in November 1998 between 46 states, U.S. Territories and commonwealths, the District of Columbia, and tobacco industry representatives. State Attorneys General worked diligently to initiate and negotiate a settlement with the tobacco industry. States are now in the midst of finalizing the settlement, carrying out the  terms of the settlement agreement and making fiscal decisions about how to apply settlement funds to public health and other needs. 
   Although the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initially notified states in the fall of 1997 of its intention to recoup the federal match from funds states received through the suits, citing a provision in existing Medicaid law, it has suspended recoupment activities. For this reason, I join my Senate colleagues in introducing this legislation to prohibit the federal government from trying to recoup any funds from state governments recovered from tobacco companies as part of their tobacco settlement or from determining how these funds should be spent. 
   I strongly believe that each state should have the right to determine where this money is needed and how it is best spent. In my own state of Arkansas, Governor Mike Huckabee has reached an agreement with the Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives, Bob Johnson, the President Pro Tempore of the Arkansas Senate, Jay Bradford, and the Arkansas Attorney General, Mark Pryor, regarding the use of this money solely for health-related purposes. Specifically, the settlement funds will be used to prevent smoking by young people, to treat tobacco related illnesses, and to establish a foundation to provide for continued funding of these programs even when the tobacco settlement money expires. I'm proud that my home state of Arkansas will use these funds towards such valuable programs. 
   I support the Arkansas state government and all other state governments in retaining their tobacco settlement funds and exercising their authority to determine how the funds are spent. 
   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.
