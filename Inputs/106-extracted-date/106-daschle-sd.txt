   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator ROBB on his remarks. I thank him very much for sharing them with all of us. 
   These past elections brought our caucus nine new members and we hope many new opportunities to address America's priorities. But they also handed us a great disappointment, the loss of our friend and colleague, CHUCK ROBB. 
   I am appreciative of the opportunity that I had just now to listen to Senator ROBB, maybe for the last time on this Senate floor. I had feared he might leave without giving us a chance to thank him for his remarkable service to the Senate. It would have been like him to do so; he is an enormously modest man. 
   In an editorial the day before the election, the Washington Post wrote:  
   Even in the final days of a nip-and-tuck campaign, Senator Chuck Robb seems uncomfortable singing his own praises. While some voters may find this quality refreshing, Senator Robb's reluctance to tout his accomplishments hides them too effectively in a tight race.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, although there are a lot of good things in the bill we are about to debate, there is one glaring omission--legislation to provide Amtrak with the authority to issue tax credit bonds for capital improvements. This bonding authority is critical to Amtrak's future and to the economic health of the northeast and many other areas of the country. 
   I have discussed this issue with members of my caucus. We had a very spirited discussion in our caucus this morning, and I know how strongly they support Amtrak and this legislation. We are very disappointed this provision was not included in this otherwise praiseworthy legislation. Amtrak supporters will not give up on passing it. In order to help them secure enactment of this important measure next year, the majority leader and I have discussed and agreed on how best to proceed. I yield the floor to allow the majority leader to describe what that understanding is at this time.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished majority leader. 
   I have admired the distinguished President pro tempore for a lot of reasons. But his diligence in opening the session every day, and his willingness to be as prompt as he always is, is something admired on both sides of the aisle. 
   So for all of his effort, for all of his service, for his willingness to serve as he has, we thank him. 
   I thank the majority leader for yielding.

   He has served his country well in so many roles over the years, including his years in the Senate, both as a Senator and as the President of the Senate. We congratulate him and thank him for his work, as well.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this resolution is offered in the most heartfelt and sincere way. These last 2 years have been very difficult. There have been times when it has tested all of us. But no one has been more tested than the majority leader. No one has been called upon to lead in more arduous circumstances, on more occasions, than the majority leader. And as he has just noted, there have been times when we have had our differences. But I have always admired him for his remarkable ability to put aside those differences, to come to my office, to invite me to his, to talk in the most affable and personal way when the day is done. I admire that and many other of his remarkable talents. We are fortunate to have his leadership. We are fortunate to have his service to this country. And I am fortunate to have his friendship. 
   So I congratulate him on his successful tenure as majority leader. And as he noted, our times in the future will become even more arduous, even more tested. I look forward to taking on those challenges with the same degree of enthusiasm, the same degree of willingness, to work in a partnership that I hope we can continually demonstrate. So I thank him. I wish him well and look forward to our service together in the next 2 years.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, I want to identify myself with the remarks of the majority leader. These staff are the best there could be. I thank them, on behalf of the entire Senate, for their hard work, for their professionalism, for the level of commitment they make each and every time they come to work. I thank them for what they do. There are so many ways we ought to stop throughout the year and express ourselves in as heartfelt a way as we can, but at least now at the end of this Congress, we ought to say--with an exclamation point--thank you. 
   Thank you for what you do. Thank you for who you are. Thank you for what you give each and every day.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this will be the last time, because I know others want to speak. 
   I, too, want to congratulate the chairman and ranking member. This has been a really difficult experience. He knows it. No one knows it better than he because he had to experience it as late as 3:30 last night and as early as 6:30 this morning. We know because of a very intense debate we had within our caucus. It would not have happened without his leadership. It would not have happened without his persistence and the work of his staff--and the staff whom both the majority leader and I have been fortunate to have serve with us as we have attempted to put this package together. 
   I congratulate him. I thank him. I also congratulate the people of Alaska for the kind of representation they sent to Washington in the person of TED STEVENS. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate South Dakota's Josh Heupel, quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners, on his incredible season leading his top-ranked and undefeated football team to the National Championship game. I am tremendously proud of the achievements of a fellow South Dakotan and Aberdeen Central graduate. 
   I am not the first and certainly will not be the last to praise Josh for his accomplishments. Josh passed for 3,392 yards and 20 touchdowns this season and led his team through a difficult schedule of worthy opponents. It is no surprise that Josh received so many honors this year: he was named Player of the Year by the Walter Camp Football Foundation; College Football Player of the Year by the Associated Press; and College Football Player of the Year by the Sporting News. 
   Most recently he was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, South Dakota's first Heisman Finalist. While he may have felt some disappointment in not winning, Josh handled himself with the maturity and grace that has molded him into a fine young leader and allows him to put team accomplishments and goals before his personal feats. 
   I believe Josh's success at the national level is the result of natural ability coupled with hard work and drive. But he has not been content with excellence simply in the athletic realm. He has also committed himself to civic duty, visiting sick children in hospitals and coordinating food drives, and has been a dedicated student. More than that, he lives by ideals instilled in him by his family--his parents Ken and Cindy, and sister Andrea--and the values and life experiences gained in South Dakota. He is an inspiration to all of us, young and old, teaching us to follow our dreams but stay close to our values. 
   I speak for South Dakota when I say that we proud of Josh Heupel and we wish him the best of luck as he leads his team into the National Championship game on January 3d and in his future athletic and academic endeavors.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, although the Senate will not resume work in earnest today on the issues remaining before the 106th Congress, we certainly hope that when we do return on the 5th of December we will be able to complete action on the appropriations bills, the minimum wage increase, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, and deal with the immigration issue, as well as a fair and balanced tax relief package. 
   In the 3 weeks until then, I certainly hope that both parties and the administration will redouble their efforts to reach agreement on these important issues. We do not have to wait until we get back. It is so troubling that we are so close to the end of the calendar year and we do not have as much to show for our efforts over the last 2 years as I would have liked. 
   The lameduck session will give us an opportunity to make progress on each of those issues. I hope we will seize that opportunity. 
   I have spoken with the majority leader about this issue, and about our desire to complete our work in a positive way. I think we agree: We need to work closely together in the final days of this Congress. He certainly reiterated his desire to do that. 
   When we left before the election, everyone assumed we would return to a relative certainty. We assumed we would have a 
   President-elect. We assumed we would know the balance of power in the next Congress. Of course, to everyone's surprise, we still do not know either of these things. 
   The situation in which we now find ourselves is virtually unprecedented. It certainly is unusual. But with the elections this close, a period of uncertainty is certainly unavoidable. 
   While none of us has ever seen such a close Presidential election, some of us have seen this on a smaller scale. I am one of those people. 
   In 1978, in my first race for election to the House of Representatives, I was behind by 28 votes at the end of election night and was declared the loser. The next day, amid much confusion, I was actually declared the winner by 14 votes. Talk about a roller coaster ride. And that was just the first day. 
   Over the next few months, after more recounts, and the discovery of computational errors, and more confusion, the election went all the way to the South Dakota Supreme Court. 
   In August of 1979, the court heard oral arguments and examined every ballot. 
   Finally, on November 27, 1979--more than a year after the election--the South Dakota Supreme Court issued its decision. It added 5 more votes to the earlier total and declared me the winner by a margin of 110 votes, which I like to say in South Dakota is about 60 percent. 
   In recounting this story, I am not suggesting that we can afford to take that much time in getting a fair and accurate count in this Presidential election. Clearly, because of the surpassing importance of the Presidency, this election must be decided on an expedited basis. I am confident that it will be. 
   Instead, I tell this story to illustrate the point that our system has dealt successfully with close elections in the past. 
   My first race for Congress is just one example. There are many others. Even as we speak, votes are still being counted in another too-close-to-call race: the Senate race in Washington State. 
   Since last Tuesday, many colleagues have told me of similar experiences in their own elections. To a person, they all agree that the important thing is to take whatever time is needed to get a  fair and accurate vote count. That is the only way to maintain public confidence in the outcome of the election. So yes, this is an unusual situation. But it is not a constitutional crisis. 
   In a Newsweek poll taken over the weekend, Americans were asked which was more important: Resolving the uncertainty over the election now so we know who the next President will be Or making certain to remove all reasonable doubt that the vote count in Florida is fair and accurate. 
   By a margin of 3 to 1, Americans say it is more important to get the results right than to get them right now. 
   Their response is proof of their faith in our system of government. 
   It is a system of unequaled strength and stability. And it should be allowed to work. 
   What we all need right now is patience. 
   What we do not need is ``spin'' from people with vested interests in the outcome. 
   It was particularly disturbing earlier today to see a representative of the Bush campaign on national television announce what he called a ``compromise offer.'' 
   In fact, his proposal merely restated his campaign's previous position that ballots counted by hand after 5 o'clock this evening should be ignored. 
   He then went on to cite fluctuations in the stock market as proof that a winner must be declared in the presidential election now--even if it means sacrificing a full and fair count. 
   I hope that everyone involved in this critically important matter would refrain from such overheated rhetoric. It is not helpful to this process. We are all anxious to know who our next President is. We all want finality. But not at the expense of fairness. 
   That is what the Vice President wants. 
   That is what the American people want. That is what I believe Democrats and Republicans want. 
   That is what is needed to reassure voters in Florida and all across America that their votes in this election counted. 
   That is what is needed for Americans to reassure Americans that their faith in our election system is well-founded. 
   Regardless of who they voted for as long as Americans have this reassurance I believe they will accept the outcome of this election and give our next President their support. 
   It is worth exercising a little patience to get that result. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to depart from the ongoing colloquy with regard to the cloture vote on the bankruptcy bill to talk about the status of negotiations on the Labor and Education bill that has been the subject of a good deal of discussion over the last several days. 
   I think the headlines give us the current state of affairs with regard to the bill probably as succinctly as any headline can. The Washington Post, from a front page story above the fold this morning, simply stated the fact: ``Budget Deal is Torpedoed by House GOP. Move by leadership angers negotiators on both sides.'' That was the Washington Post. 
   The Los Angeles Times said it as well in their headline: ``GOP Leaders Scuttle Deal in Budget Battle.'' They go on to describe exactly what happened in the budget battle on education over the course of the last several days. 
   The Washington Times had virtually the same headline, which simply read: ``House Leaders Spike Deal On Budget.'' 
   The only word missing in most of these is the word ``education.'' Because that is what the budget was about, the fight was about what kind of a commitment to education we ought to be making in this new fiscal year, now well underway. This is the last day of October. Of course, the fiscal year began on the first day of October. While the headlines didn't say it, this is what they were talking about. 
   We had a bipartisan plan that was worked out over the last several days with great effort on the part of Chairman STEVENS and Chairman YOUNG, certainly on the part of Senator BYRD, Senator HARKIN, Congressman OBEY. They worked until 2:30 Monday morning to craft what arguably could have been the single most important investment we will make in education in any fiscal year in the history of the United States. That is quite a profound and dramatic statement. I don't think it is hyperbole because we were prepared to invest more in education, more in smaller classes, more in qualified teachers, more in modern school buildings, more in afterschool programs, with a far better accountability program, with increased Pell grants, with more investment for children with disabilities and those preparing to go to college than we have ever made in a commitment to education in our Nation's history. That was what was on the table. 
   Of course, as we negotiated these very complicated and controversial provisions dealing not only with education but whether or not we can protect worker safety, all of those issues had to be considered very carefully. It was only with the admonition of all the leaders to give and to try to find a way to resolve our differences that we were able ultimately to close the deal, resolve the differences, and move forward with every expectation that the Senate and House would then be in a position to vote on this historic achievement as early as Tuesday afternoon. 
   That is what happened. 
    So instead, today we are debating cloture on the bankruptcy conference report when we could have had an incredible opportunity to put the pieces together to give children real hope, to give school districts all over this country for the first time the confidence they need that they can address the myriad of problems they are facing in education today; to say, yes, we are going to commit, as we have over the last couple years, to ensure we have the resources to reduce class size and to hire those teachers and to break through, finally, on school modernization and school construction. We could have addressed the need for 6,000 new schools with the modernization plan that was on the table when the collapse occurred. 
   I come to the floor dismayed, disheartened, and extraordinarily disappointed that this had to happen, that the 
   House leaders, House Republican leaders, spiked a deal that could have created this historic achievement. 
   What do we tell the schoolteachers? What do we tell the students? What do we tell all of those people waiting patiently and expectantly, who are hoping we could put partisanship aside and do what we came here to do. Forget the rhetoric, forget the conflicts, forget all the things we were supposed to forget in bringing this accomplishment about. 
   I don't know where we go from here, but this is part of a pattern. It isn't just education. There is an array of other issues. And perhaps this is an appropriate day to remind my colleagues of, once again, the GOP legislative graveyard. We can put up, perhaps, another tombstone today. 
   I think we can still revive this. Somehow I think there is still a possibility that we can do this. I don't know if it will happen this week--I don't know when it will happen--but I can't believe we are going to turn away from having accomplished what we could have accomplished with all of this. 
   Everybody understands that we may not have another chance. I am not prepared to put education into the legislative graveyard Republicans have created. But there isn't much chance we are going to deal with pay equity this year. There is no chance we are going to deal with campaign finance reform. 
   Let us make absolutely certain that when we come back early next year, we enact the Patients' Bill of Rights. That is a tombstone for the 106th Congress. Hate crimes, judicial nominations, the Medicare drug benefit, gun safety: all are tombstones to inaction. All are a recognition of the failure of this Congress to come to grips with the real problems our country is facing, a realization that now there is not much we can do anything about, except to rededicate ourselves to ensure that we will never let this Congress again take up issues of this import and leave them buried in the legislative graveyard. 
   Let us hope that we can revive school modernization and smaller class size. Let us hope that somehow, in the interest of doing what is right--we recognize how close we were Monday night, we recognize how important it is that we not give up, we recognize how critical it is that something as important as education will not be relegated to this legislative graveyard, or any other. Let us hope that in the interest of our children, in the interest of recognizing the importance of bipartisan achievement in this Congress, that we will do what is right, that we will take these headlines and turn them around and change them into headlines such as ``GOP Leaders And Democratic Leaders Agree on Budget Deal,'' or ``Democratic Leaders And Republican Leaders Agree To Historic Education Achievement''; with editorials that would say to the effect that, at long last, we have given children hope all over this country and we have given schools the opportunity to reduce their class size and improve educational quality without exception. 
   That is still within our grasp. I must say, the tragedy of all tragedies would be, somehow in the name of partisanship and in the name of whatever competition some may feel with the administration on this or any other issue, that we fail to do what is right; we fail to make a commitment that we know we can; and that we end up building more monuments to the lack of progress and real commitment to the issues about which people care most. 
   Mr. President, I come to the floor with the expectation that we can overcome the obstacles that remain and we truly can make a difference on education in this Congress. 
   I yield the floor.

   I appreciate especially his interest in reading into the RECORD many of the concerns the President expressed in his letter to all of us yesterday. I also appreciate his contribution to the caucus as we have attempted to work through how we ought to respond to this very unusual set of circumstances. He is our ranking member on the Committee on Small Business. He indicated to me yesterday that there was no consultation prior to the time this conference report was brought to the Senate. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he could elaborate first on what consultation, what degree of communication there was in coming to the floor and in talking about this bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am really amazed and somewhat amused. As you look at this so-called conference report, one could almost read it in less than a couple of minutes. I won't do that. But I find it interesting, and I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he could share his observations with regard to the way this conference report was written. This is no conference report. This is nothing more than a list of references to other bills proclaiming it to be a conference report. This says:  
   The provisions of the bills of the 106th Congress are hereby enacted into law: H.R. 5538, H.R. 5542, H.R. 5543, H.R. 5544, H.R. 5545.  
   So ends the conference report. That is the most remarkable thing. I just can't imagine that anybody would be willing to put their signature to a conference report which does nothing more than reference other bills. This is the conference report--or a representation of the conference report. This is what it should look like. What I hold in my hands is how thick the conference report should be. Yet as thick as this is, they could not even get it right. We actually terminate the minimum wage in this conference report. I wonder whether the Senator from Massachusetts is aware of that and could respond to how that could have happened.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Well, as I say, I note in amusement, the Senator spent some time talking about the President's veto letter, and I am amused in part because the Speaker has already addressed the veto letter and was asked yesterday if Republicans would be willing to rework the tax cut bill after a veto. He responded--I hope colleagues will listen--that any new legislation would have to go through committee, and anything else would amount to half--I will call it ``half-baked'' legislation. He has another term, but I don't think I want to dignify it this morning. 
   Anything other than a committee process is half-baked, according to the Speaker. Maybe that is how we leave out minimum wage reauthorization. Maybe that is how we leave out Democratic proposals, as the Senator from Nebraska had offered in the committee, along with others, to make this more fair. Maybe that is how it happens. Maybe you don't produce a bill this thick because you don't care about fairness; you don't care about getting 
   it right. 
   I ask the Senator from Massachusetts whether he would care to observe whether he has had, in his experience as ranking member, a time when he has ever seen legislation coming to the floor in this form, leaving out provisions that literally nullify a law that has been standing now for almost 70 years?

   Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts whether he shares my observation that it comes down to a question, as he said, of fairness. We are talking about whether or not this process is fair, whether or not, with all of the talk of bipartisanship in the Presidential campaign, there is any element of fairness or bipartisanship in the way this process has unfolded; whether or not there is fairness in a school construction proposal that leaves out over 90 percent of the school construction opportunity and need we have in this country; whether or not it is fair to provide more benefits to the top 5 percent of all taxpayers than the bottom 80 percent as represented in this bill; whether or not it is fair to give a third of all the benefits we are  providing in BBA back to the HMOs as ransom payments to stay in States that they have already proclaimed they will not do. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts whether he doesn't agree that really the essence of this argument, the essence of this debate is a question of fairness.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and express themselves about this legislation. I know a number of our colleagues have indicated an interest in being heard. 
   I note that it is my hope we can still get votes on both the tax bill as well as the Commerce-State-Justice bill today. We need to move this process along. We are now less than 2 weeks away from the election. There is a lot of work that remains prior to the time we leave. It seems to me we ought to be maximizing each day. That is why the President has insisted on 24-hour continuing resolutions. 
   I have just had a conversation with the majority leader and noted my interest in our effort to try to resolve these matters today so we can move on to other outstanding issues. We talked earlier about the importance of trying to bring some resolution to both bills. 
   The Commerce-State-Justice bill could be resolved, certainly, by Monday. If we can vote on it, and move it along, I think that behooves us and certainly accords us more of an opportunity to ensure that we can resolve these matters at a time that would allow us to bring closure to this whole session of Congress.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond, if I could reclaim my time, and say that I know the President has expressed concern on several occasions about the tendency for those of us who serve in the Congress to leave and then not to come back until close to the end of whatever CR timeframe we have been allotted. I think that is the President's concern, that if we were to go to Monday or Tuesday, most likely we probably would not revisit these questions until Monday or Tuesday. But we can certainly discuss the matter at greater length and attempt to see what opportunities for real progress we are going to be making. 
   We are now 28 days into the new fiscal year, and we still have a lot of work, especially on appropriations bills, that remains to be done. So it would be my hope that we could maximize every day. 
   And he is right; it is very rare that we have met on Saturdays--or Sundays, for that matter. It would not be our intention to make a regular practice of it, but these are extraordinary circumstances, without a doubt. I think each day should be used, with the maximum opportunity that each day affords us, to try to resolve these issues and get our work done. I don't like staying. I had plans this weekend myself. I was going to go home to South Dakota. It does not appear that is going to be possible. But I would say, certainly, if we are here we ought to be maximizing the use of our time. I think that is what the President intends. Certainly, we ought to attempt to do as well with each day that remains. 
   I would also say that we ought to go into this with an attitude that we are going to complete our work successfully. There is no reason why we cannot finish C-J-S. There isn't any reason we cannot finish Labor-HHS. There isn't any reason we can't come to an agreement on the remaining outstanding issues. 
   There is very little disagreement about the need to address each of these issues. We know we have to address education in the appropriations bill. We know we have to address the Balanced Budget Reform Act and the extraordinary problems that our health facilities are facing. We know we have to face and address the issues having to do with Commerce-State-Justice and especially immigration. 
   So there are a lot of issues that demand we stay and resolve them. I think we ought to use the weekend to keep negotiating, to try to find a way to resolve these matters, before we get well into next week. Basically, I think the bottom line for many of us is, if we can make these bills more fair, if we can address fairness with regard to immigration, if we can address fairness with regard to the BBA bill and the tax bill, if we can address fairness with regard to education and school construction--if we can do all that in a fair and meaningful way, we can resolve these matters and be done by the middle of next week. 
   There is no reason why we should not. It seems to me we waste opportunities by allowing Senators to leave town and expect somehow they will come back. But I am certainly more than willing to talk about it and see if  we can make the most of what days remain.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just respond, I will probably have to agree to disagree. I suppose you could argue that we have spent a lot more money over the last 27 days than most of us realized in keeping the Senate in session as long as we have. We have been in, in large measure, because we haven't been able to complete our work. One could argue if we would have used the days we had available to us more effectively, we wouldn't be here today. 
   As to the President's insistence on trying to find compromise, I guess this isn't a matter of whether the President gets all he wants. This is a President who has said on numerous occasions we are making progress in coming together. Let us keep at it. Let us try to find a way to resolve these issues. I am not asking for everything I want, but I don't expect the Republican leadership to get everything they want. 
   The essence of good compromise is give on both sides. We haven't seen that. That is the essence of the concern we have on this side, the lack of fairness, not only with regard to any 
   real void in bipartisanship in putting the tax and BBA bill together, but the consequences of having done so without constructive engagement, consequences that led somebody inadvertently, I assume, to leave out the minimum wage entirely, to nullify the minimum wage for 6 months. That is what happens if this bill passes. It is going to be nullified for 6 months. I know that that was not intended, but that is what happens. 
   To reference bills as are referenced in this two-page conference report with no real ability to read it thoughtfully, to carefully look through it, ought to give everybody pause. 
   I know one of the points raised by our colleague from Alaska regarding the appropriations bill is that he needs up to 20 hours to read, whenever it is agreed to, the Labor-HHS bill, the last appropriations bill to be addressed. That Labor and Education bill, if it is read by the Senator from Alaska, will at least assure that one Senator in this body has had a chance to read it from front to back. 
   Nobody had that opportunity with this bill. There was no 20-hour read of this bill, in part because there was no bill. This is a reference to five bills. There was no careful consideration of what went into this legislation. Nobody knows. We are shooting entirely in the dark. We have no appreciation of what is in this bill. What we do know is that some things were inadvertently left out. What we do know is that when it comes to school construction, we fall $10 billion short of what ought to be a minimum in the commitment we make to school construction this year. 
   This country has a deficit in infrastructure of $127 billion, a $127 billion backlog in school construction alone. What we have said is, let's require the States and the school districts to come up with at least $100 billion of that responsibility, but why not do for schools what we do for courthouses and airports and highways. Let us help school districts. Let us help States provide the funding mechanism that will allow them to refurbish and rebuild and construct new schools. 
   That is part of the debate. That is part of this fairness question that is at the heart of the debate regarding the tax bill. Is it fair? That is the question. Is it fair to provide three times more in business lunch deductions than it is school construction? That is what this bill does. Three times more goes to business lunch deductions than we are prepared to commit to school construction. I don't think that is fair. 
   We can argue a lot about whether it is fair to give more to the top 5 percent of all taxpayers than we do the bottom 80. One can argue that is a legitimate thing to do in public policy. But is it fair? I don't think anybody could argue it is fair to give the top 5 percent more in tax benefits in this bill than the bottom 80, but we are doing that. Again, it is a question of fairness. 
   The question is, too, Is it fair to have two pots of money--one for hospitals, one for clinics, one for hospice, one for all the medical and health facilities all over this country--and say: We have a limited amount of money to spend, and we are going to split that amount into two pots. We are going to give a third of all the money to HMOs at the expense of all these health facilities. 
   The HMOs are leaving States by the dozens. We are going to pay ransom to those HMOs to try to keep them in the States when they have already publicly announced they are leaving. The question is, Is it fair to say, no, hospital administrator, no, clinic administrator, no, hospice director, you can't have the money we are going to give to HMOs, even though you may go bankrupt, even though you may close your doors? 
   That is not fair. And it is a question of fairness. It is a question of priorities. It is a question of how we do business around here and the fairness of excluding half the Senate as these decisions are being made. 
   It is really a question of good management as well, when you leave out the minimum wage law, when you nullify that law for 6 months inadvertently. I think the speaker had it right. I won't use the phrase he used. He said ``half,'' I will say ``baked.'' He said, when you don't use the committee process, you have a half-baked process. Well, he was right because it is half baked. This work product doesn't deserve support. Because it doesn't deserve support, it will be vetoed. And when it is vetoed, I hope we can come back and do it right. 
   I hope we can say that in the name of fairness we are going to provide more help to health facilities, in the name of fairness we are going to provide better  balance in the Tax Code, in the name of fairness we are going to do better on school construction, in the name of fairness we are going to allow everybody in the room as we make these very critical decisions. Fairness dictates at least that. That is the essence of this argument. That is why it is important. It is what we should do. It also goes to the whole question of other things we should do. We talked about it earlier today. 
   There is so much in unfinished business that we could have addressed--unfinished business relating to the Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, gun safety. None of those issues was addressed. That leads, of course, to the question of how long, if we don't address these and all the issues relating to fiscal responsibility, can we assure that this prosperity continues? 
   There are two very fundamental differences in philosophy and approach enunciated in large measure by our two Presidential candidates. Governor Bush has articulated a particular position that, as it bears scrutiny, begs the question: How soon will we be right back to where we were 10 or 15 years ago? 
   The American Society of Actuaries answered that question yesterday. They said--not a Democrat or anybody here in the Congress, but they said--having scrutinized the Bush proposal, we would be back into deficits similar to what we experienced in the 1980s by the year 2015 and that we would end the fiscal progress we have made for the last 3 years. It would be gone. If you pass the Bush tax plan, pass the Bush Social Security plan, you are right back smack in the middle of deficits as we were before. That is one approach. Again, as I say, that is not our analysis; that is not our report. That report is by the American Society of Actuaries. 
   Mr. President, I see that other colleagues are on the floor. I want to respect their right to be heard as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I fully agree with the response from the majority leader. Whether the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Treasury makes the disbursements has absolutely no effect on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over this program. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and was the committee that originally 
   reported the Coastal Impact Assistance program as part of the CARA legislation. The fact that we have funded the first year through the Department of Commerce has absolutely no effect on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over the Coastal Impact Assistance program, including oversight and any future changes.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to support the reauthorization of the Senate's National Security Working Group--NSWG. The NSWG was created last year as the successor to the Arms Control Observer Group, a group that had served the Senate well for over a decade. 
   Like its predecessor, the purpose of the NSWG is to be the Senate's non-partisan eyes and ears on defense and national security issues. Unlike nearly every other group in the Senate and the Congress, the National Security Working Group is composed of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. This makeup was intended to ensure the NSWG worked by consensus. No single Senator or political party could dominate the group's agenda or actions. Establishing a group with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans was also intended to signify that the Senate believes the issues that come before this group are too important to be discussed in a partisan setting. 
   These were the objectives the Senate had in mind when it unanimously approved the legislation authorizing the formation of this important group. They remain the objectives today. Although the group worked together relatively well in the year since it was established, a number of us believe it could work a little bit better if we formally spelled out some simple rules of the road to govern the group's routine activities. Therefore, at the same time we re-authorize the NSWG, I would also like to insert for the record a series of administrative procedures that clearly spell out how the group should conduct its business. As put forward in these procedures, the group's administrative co-chairmen must recommend travel in writing to the Majority and Minority leaders and both leaders must approve the travel request in writing. They encourage member participation and indicate that staff travel should be the exception not the rule. 
   It is my understanding that these procedures have been agreed by both leaders and the majority and minority co-chairmen of the NSWG. I believe their adoption will help meet the objectives we all hold for this unique and important group.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I wanted to talk briefly tonight about where we are. We are now 26 days into the new fiscal year. We should have completed our work 26 days ago. We are at a stage that should command we work together to try to resolve what remaining differences there are, finish our work, and do all we can to bring this session to a close. 
   Unfortunately, that is not what has happened tonight. What has happened tonight is that our Republican colleagues have insisted on a conference report for Commerce-State-Justice which they know will be vetoed. They have insisted on drafting a piece of legislation incorporating $240 billion in tax cuts, approximately $81 billion we are told--even though we still haven't had it analyzed and calculated--in changes to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   They insisted at the last minute, without any consultation, on incorporating one of the most controversial pieces of legislation pending before the Senate at the end of the year, a bill having to do with forcing States to accept a certain position on physician assisted suicide. There hasn't been any vote in the full Senate, but it is in this tax bill. It is a bill that has nothing to do with taxes, nothing to do with hospitals and ways with which to address the real problems we are facing all across this country with health providers, hospitals, clinics, hospice facilities, nursing homes. You name it, virtually every health facility in this country today is either on the verge of bankruptcy or in a serious financial position. We all recognize the need to do this before we leave, to address the problems our hospitals and all of our health facilities are facing. 
   What happened is that our Republican colleagues, with absolutely no consultation with any Democrats--House, Senate, or White House--have cobbled together a bill they know will be vetoed. The President just this afternoon sent a letter indicating he will veto the Commerce-State-Justice bill and he will veto the tax bill. 
   I come to the floor chagrined, disappointed, angered, frustrated. Speaker HASTERT has already reacted to the veto letters. I will quote what is reported in Congress Daily:  
   Do you have to have everything you want? How much petulance is there on the other side of the aisle?  
   When asked if Republicans would be willing to rework a tax bill at all, he responded that any new legislation would have to go through committee ``because anything else would amount to half-assed legislating.'' 
   Let me repeat that. He said that new legislation would have to go through committee ``because anything else would amount to half-assed legislating.'' 
   What is this, if it isn't what the Speaker has already described as half-assed legislating? We have got a bill before the Senate that nobody has seen. We have a bill before the Senate that hasn't gone through committee. No one has had the opportunity to consider it carefully. I hope my colleagues will hear me out on this. In fact, we have just heard and been told, and now it has been confirmed, that the conference report we are about to vote on  tomorrow literally eliminates the minimum wage for 6 months--eliminates it because of a glitch in the writing of the bill. We are eliminating the minimum wage for half a year in this legislation, totally. We are not rolling it back. We are not freezing it. It is eliminated. 
   I know our Republican colleagues had no real desire to eliminate the minimum wage, but that is what is in this legislation. Why? I think the answer is clear. Because the Speaker described it--I won't repeat it again and again but I think he had a very apt description for what we are doing right now. We are not going through committee. We are not going through the legislation on the floor. We are not going through a normal conference. 
   Let me start by saying what this is really all about is fairness. This is about fairness. It is about whether we are fair to a process and whether we are fair to all Senators who ought to have an opportunity to more carefully consider a $240 billion tax cut. 
   It is about whether or not fairness would dictate that, if we are going to address a bill as important as restoring some of the payments through Medicare for all the health facilities in this country, we would have a chance to look at it; that we would have a chance to be consulted about it; that we would have a chance to voice our concerns about it and ultimately to have a chance to put the bill together in a way we can bring it back to the Senate and House with some expectation that there has been this deliberation. That is fairness. 
   I hear the Republican candidate for President, Governor Bush, talk, as he should, about the need for bipartisanship. If he says it once, he says it 10 times a day: I want to restore bipartisanship. 
   I must say, why wait until next year? Why not do it now? What is wrong with a little bipartisanship in putting a tax bill together? What is wrong with a little bipartisanship in ensuring that as we write a Balanced Budget Restoration Act that we have Republican and Democratic input? That is bipartisanship. 
   We have had a lot of bipartisan votes this year. We have the votes, now, to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is bipartisanship. We have had Patients' Bill of Rights votes throughout the year. We have a bipartisan bill. We have had a bipartisan bill on a number of pieces of legislation relating to education, a bipartisan bill on minimum wage, a bipartisan bill on gun safety. Every time we have a bipartisan bill, the Republican leadership is not willing to allow the process to be complete. So there is no bipartisanship, whether it is on all the issues upon which we have already voted or whether it is on this bill tonight. None. Zero. No consultation. 
   This is about fairness. It is also about fairness when it comes to the issues we are talking about in the bill itself. I am very troubled by the amazing and extraordinarily complex ways our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to address many of the issues before us in this bill. We have not seen, until just this afternoon, what the tax bill entails. But we are told the tax bill has provisions incorporated that allow the bottom 60 percent of all taxpayers to receive only 5 percent of the tax benefits--60 percent of all taxpayers get 5 percent of the benefit. That is an unfairness as well. 
   We hear so much debate at the national level, at the Presidential level, about making sure everybody benefits. How is it the top 40 percent should get 95 percent of the benefit, once again? And why is it we have to insist that, in situation after situation involving tax fairness, it has to be a fight about whether or not we can equitably distribute the benefit? Once again, each and every time the minimum of what you would expect for working families is left off the table. I do not understand why we cannot be more fair when it comes to tax policy and distribution. But for 60 percent of the people to get 5 percent of the benefit is not fair. 
   It is not fair as well to be sending millions of children to schools that are in a total state of disrepair. I do not have the number in front of me, but I will tell you this: 76 percent of all the school districts in this country have at least one school building that is in a state of disrepair. There are hundreds of billions of dollars in backlog all over this country with regard to school construction. We have had problems with infrastructure all over our State. My State is not unique. There is not a State in this country that has been able to adequately and satisfactorily address the problems with regard to school construction--not one. 
   What we have said is let's take at least a modicum of the responsibility. My goodness, if we can pass highway construction bills and courthouse construction bills and airport construction bills and all the array of other housing construction bills at the Federal level, certainly we can help school districts help build better schools. What is wrong with providing them with some tools, 
   financially, to get that job done? If this fight is about anything tonight, it is about that. It is about our inability to address in a meaningful way real school construction this year. 
   We had asked for a $25 billion commitment on the part of the Federal Government and this bill falls far short of the mark. And the President said on that basis alone he would be prepared to veto this bill. If we do not fix the school construction bill adequately in this legislation, it will never be signed. That, too, is a question of fairness--fairness for those school kids who must face the fact each and every day that their safety and the quality of their education is dictated by the crumbling school they must enter each and every day they come. That is wrong. That is unfair. That ought to be addressed in this Congress before we leave. And whether it is in this tax bill or in the education funding that has to be appropriated prior to the time we leave, we have to fix it. We have to address it. 
   There is also, as I noted earlier, a serious question relating to the fairness of the BBRA, the Balanced Budget Reform Act. We know what limited dollars we have. We recognize this may be our last shot. This may be our last real opportunity to send as much help out to the States as we can possibly provide if we are going to solve the problem of nursing homes, solve the problem of hospitals and clinics, solve the problems of hospice. Whether or not we are able to get that job done depends on whether or not we can adequately address it in this bill. 
   But what did our Republican colleagues do? They spent $28 billion over five years, more than a third of which goes to HMOs who have already indicated, with or without the money, they are pulling out of Medicare in many States. They will not be influenced by this legislation or by the incredible price tag this legislation holds for them. 
   I must say, I don't get it. We all claim to be concerned about the threat to the surplus that we have so carefully been able to amass over the last couple of years. We have all indicated that is our highest priority, to assure that we can retain the fiscal responsibility this year, next year, and from here on out. Yet we pass a bill that includes a gift of more than $11 billion to HMOs in the name of trying to keep them in Medicare in States when they have said they will not stay in those States regardless of how much we pay them, ransom or not. There is an $11 billion ransom payment in here and it is not going to help one State. 
   The problem we have is that it is taking money away from nursing homes. It is taking money away from hospitals. It is taking money away from hospice. It is taking money away from clinics. I do not understand, in the name of fairness, why we can't appreciate how extraordinarily important this is. 
   This is a question of fairness. It is a question of being fair to the nursing homes and hospitals which are hanging on by their fingernails tonight, hoping we can do the right thing in providing them with the assistance they need in fixing the mistake we made in 1997. It is a question of fairness about whether or not we are going to provide tax benefits to all the people, not just to those at the top. 
   It is a question of fairness with regard to whether or not schools are going to have the kinds of funds they need to ensure they have the ability to build the schools our children need today; not tomorrow, today. It is a question of fairness whether or not we can do what Governor Bush, Vice President GORE, and so many of those out there seem to be talking about each and every day: restoring some semblance of bipartisanship in this  body, in the Congress, and in the Federal Government. 
   We have fallen so far off that mark. There is not anything bipartisan about this package. There is absolutely nothing in here that even begins to appreciate the need for a bipartisan consensus, and here we are tonight, 26 days after the fiscal year began, with a veto of a bill that should have been resolved months ago. 
   It is not only unfair, it is incredibly bad management. We can do better than this, Mr. President. We have to do better than this. We have to do better than this in restoring some sort of comity, some sort of cooperation, and some sort of dialog when we take on bills of this import. We have to restore fairness if we are really going to address tax legislation this year. 
   Fairness dictates that we have a school construction program of which we can all be proud. Fairness demands that we find a better way to solve the BBA problem than we have in this bill. We need fairness. We need attention to those issues. We need to resolve it before we leave. We need to do it tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Monday, however long it takes. We have to do this before we leave. 
   We will have more to say about this.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has stated it so succinctly and so correctly. That is exactly what I am saying. He has noted the extraordinary nature of the provision he has cited. There is a great deal of controversy involving the issue, and I give credit to those in Oregon who have tried to grapple with the very personal issue of suicide and physician-assisted efforts involving suicide. 
   As he has noted, a large number of organizations have publicly 
   stated their support for the Oregon law, but the real question is not whether one agrees with the Oregon law or one does not agree. The question is, On a question of this controversy, of this import, of this breadth, should we be forced at 8:15 tonight to be talking about it without having had the benefit of discussion in the full Senate up until now? 
   Not only that, should we take it on a take-it-or-leave-it basis? This has been buried in a bill having nothing to do with physician-assisted suicide. This has a lot to do with taxes. It has a lot to do with school construction. It has a lot to do with health care. It has nothing to do with physician-assisted suicide, and at the last minute, our Republican colleagues put it in there, buried it in the bill and now want us to vote on it, up or down, no debate. 
   That is incredibly bad management. That is so unfair, not only to us--we ought to have the opportunity--but to Oregon, to the country, to the issue. That is what troubles me perhaps most of all: Once again, they have denigrated the institutional process in ways I do not think anybody can fully appreciate. Something as important as this should have its day in court. There should be a debate about it. I am sure in Oregon they spent a lot of time debating, considering, and consulting prior to the time they came to any conclusion. We should do no less. 
   The Senator from Oregon is absolutely right. That is in part what this is about.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I respond to the Senator from Oregon, since it is part of this legislation, I think it dictates that we have a lengthy discussion about it. Certainly we have to make sure that everybody understands the ramifications of all the provisions. 
   Again, in the name of fairness, we ought to be providing those Senators who have a great deal of interest in this issue and who certainly know more about it than many of us who have not been exposed to much of the debate to date, that we have some discussion about it. Again, it goes back to the Speaker's comments in the first place. You can do it the right way or you can do it the way they have done it tonight. We have done it wrong tonight. People like the Senator from Oregon, like the Senator from Nevada--all of us--deserve better. 
   The people deserve better. We are going to insist that they get better than what they have been given so far. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Founding Fathers intended that the legislative process work through strongly held policy differences to establish the law of the land. They saw open dialogue as central to our democracy, and their vision has served the American people well for over 200 years. It is regrettable, therefore, when policy disagreements degenerate into acts of retribution against individual public servants whose only transgression is to execute the directives of the President they serve. 
   That is exactly what happened recently when a provision was inserted into the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations Bill stripping the USDA Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, Jim Lyons, of his authority to administer the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service until his term in office expires in January 2000. This provision is not only unfair to Mr. Lyons, it undermines the separation of powers doctrine because it is designed solely to intimidate administration officials who are faithful to the policies of the President. 
   What has Mr. Lyons done, you might ask, to warrant such rebuke? The simple answer is: he has done a difficult job conscientiously. 
   Mr. President, Mr. Lyons was confirmed as the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment by the Senate in May of 1993. As Undersecretary, he administers two important agencies--the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service--that include nearly half the employees in the Department. 
   I have worked closely with Mr. Lyons over the past 8 years and respect greatly his work ethic, his understanding of the issues within his agencies' jurisdiction and his commitment to the public policy making process. We have had policy disagreements, but I have never had reason to question Mr. Lyons' dedication to his job or fitness to serve as Undersecretary. 
   Mr. Lyons has provided steady and clear leadership during his tenure at USDA, tackling many complex and controversial issues that have plagued the conservation and forestry communities for years. While many of these policy challenges defy easy solution, Jim Lyons never shirked his responsibility to address them. Further, it has been his hallmark to solicit and discuss the views of all parties in a search of common ground in the pursuit of Administration objectives. That approach was particularly evident in the policy dispute that culminated in the Agriculture Appropriations rider relieving Mr. Lyons of line authority for the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
   The Office of the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, NRE, has responsibility within USDA for working with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on issues affecting clean water and air, agriculture, forestry and other environmental concerns. It was in this role that Mr. Lyons entered into negotiations with the EPA to reduce the impact of EPA's proposed Total Maximum Daily Load, TMDL, rule on agriculture and forestry, while helping to ensure our continued progress in improving the quality of the waters of the United States. 
   After months of negotiation with the EPA, Mr. Lyons helped construct a rule that would provide for measured progress in reducing non-point source pollution through the use of voluntary, incentive-based programs administered largely through the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Many of the provisions objectionable to commodity groups and the Farm Bureau were dropped from the final rule or significantly modified. The provisions affecting silvicultural activities and forestry were dropped altogether. 
   In August, the President announced the final TMDL rules, and, in response to concerns expressed by Members of Congress, delayed their implementation for one year. Nonetheless, some who were upset that EPA had elected even to proceed with the rules decided to take their frustration out on Mr. Lyons, charging that he had not done enough to fight this rulemaking. As a consequence, language was added to the House version of the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill defunding Mr. Lyons' office. 
   At the urging of Senator COCHRAN and his colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee, the House agreed to restore funding for the Undersecretary's office, but eliminate Mr. Lyons' authority to manage, supervise or direct his agencies--the job he had sworn to do and for which this  body had confirmed him nearly 8 years ago. While policy differences certainly are an important and accepted part of the legislative process, acts of retribution against individual public servants--which this rider is--should not be tolerated. 
   Mr. Lyons does not deserve this treatment. During his USDA career, he has faithfully pursued the President's policies, spearheading major reforms in the management of both the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, and helping to develop the Forest Service's new natural resources agenda, which is focused on watershed protection, recreation, road management reform and sustainable forestry. 
   Under Mr. Lyons' leadership, the Natural Resources Conservation Service has assumed a leadership role for the Administration in promoting conservation of the nation's private lands and has taken on an expanded role in protecting clean water and fish and wildlife habitats. Mr. Lyons has advocated establishing riparian buffers to capture nutrient and pesticide runoff, promoted efforts to protect farm and forest lands threatened with development, and encouraged strategies to protect drinking water supplies at their source. 
   Mr. Lyons was also the principle architect of the President's Northwest Forest Plan conserving old-growth forests and promoting sustainable forestry. He has initiated efforts to assess forest ecosystem health in the Columbia River Basin, the Sierra Nevada and the southern Appalachians. He directed key acquisitions and additions to the National Forest System, and has overseen purchase of lands including New Mexico's Baca Ranch and the New World Mine near Yellowstone National Park. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Giant Sequoia National Monument. 
   Mr. Lyons continues to lead USDA efforts on the presidential initiative to protect remaining national forest roadless areas. He helped craft the President's report on this year's devastating wildfires and then worked to shape the emergency funding package that will be used to restore fire-damaged forest lands and reduce the risks to communities from future wildfires. Mr. Lyons has promoted outdoor recreation on the national forests and created new programs and partnerships to improve urban forestry and conservation activities. 
   In the Black Hills of South Dakota, Mr. Lyons worked with me to resolve differences between the timber industry and environmentalists that allowed timber harvesting to proceed in a responsible and environmentally sensitive manner. This experience demonstrated Mr. Lyons' ability to work with diverse interests in the pursuit of sound, common sense policies that reconcile multiple use objectives. 
   President Clinton's approach to the stewardship of our national resources is clear, and Mr. Lyons has been faithful to that vision. His public record over the past eight years identify him as a leading conservationist and an effective agent of change, not only within the Department of Agriculture, but also within the Administration. 
   Mr. President, I regret that, as the end of the Clinton Administration approaches, one of its longest serving subcabinet officials has been targeted for retribution as a result of a disagreement over policy. Personal attack should never become an accepted method for settling policy differences. I hope that the politics of personal intimidation can be removed from our policy debates. 
   Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print a recent New York Times editorial on this subject in the RECORD.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate passed my resolution to urge the creation of a postage stamp honoring Korczak Ziolkowski, the visionary sculptor who began work on the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota over 52 years ago. I would like to take a moment to describe the man and the dream that led him to carve a mountain. 
   Korczak Ziolkowski was born on September 6, 1908 in Boston, Massachusetts. Orphaned at age one, he grew up in a series of foster homes and often was mistreated. Korczak later would say that his collective experiences during this difficult part of his life prepared him for sculpting the Crazy Horse memorial and enabled him to prevail over the decades of financial hardship he encountered trying to create an Indian memorial in the Black Hills. 
   Before coming west, Korczak was a noted studio sculptor and member of the National Sculpture Society. Although he never took a lesson in art or sculpture, his marble portrait of Polish composer and political leader Ignace Jan Paderewski won first prize by unanimous vote at the 1939 New York World's Fair. This award drew the attention of Lakota Sioux Chief Henry Standing Bear, who invited Korczak to carve a memorial to the Sioux warrior Crazy Horse in the sacred Black Hills. In his invitation letter, Chief Standing Bear wrote: ``My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too.'' 
   In 1939, Korczak also traveled to South Dakota to assist Gutzon Borglum, the famed sculptor of Mount Rushmore. Korczak finally met Chief Standing Bear in 1941 and he learned more about Crazy Horse. He then returned to his sculpting career in New  England, but he never stopped studying the life of Crazy Horse and the Native American tribes of North America. However, a sense of duty to his country delayed his return to South Dakota. At age 34, he volunteered for service in World War II, landed on Omaha Beach and later was wounded. After the war, Korczak turned down a government commission to create war memorials in Europe to accept Chief Standing Bear's invitation. He returned to South Dakota in 1947 and dedicated the rest of his life to sculpting the Crazy Horse Memorial. 
   Korczak's first year in the Black Hills was spent pioneering, building a log cabin, and constructing a massive wooden staircase to the top of the mountain he would carve. Then, on June 3, 1948, the Crazy Horse Memorial was dedicated. From its inception, Korczak said that the memorial would be a nonprofit educational and cultural project for all Native Americans. The memorial would be financed solely by the interested public, not from government funds. In fact, Korczak twice turned down $10 million in federal funds because he believed the government would never complete the memorial as he envisioned it--a sprawling campus including the Indian Museum of North America and the University and Medical Training Center for the North American Indian with the massive mountain carving at its center. Carved in three dimensions, the memorial is 563 high and 641 feet long, and upon completion will be the largest sculpture in the world. 
   In 1950, Korczak married Ruth Ross, a volunteer at the memorial, and had 10 children, one of whom he delivered himself. Korczak soon realized that finishing the memorial would exceed one man's lifetime, so he and Ruth prepared detailed plans for the memorial's completion. Since Korczak's death on October 20, 1982, Ruth has carried out his vision. Under her leadership, the memorial continues to grow. In 1998, 50 years after the first blast on the mountain, the completed face of Crazy Horse was dedicated, and more recently, a state of the art visitors center was opened to educate visitors about the memorial. Ruth's next task is to complete work on the head of the Sioux leader's horse, which is a staggering 20 stories tall. Completing the memorial may take decades, even generations, to complete, but I am certain that under the leadership of the Ziolkowski family and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation it will be completed. 
   Korczak Ziolkowski was a humble man. From his first days on the memorial to his death, he never took salary. He always believed that, first and foremost, the Crazy Horse Memorial was for the Native Americans. I would like to close with a quote Korczak was fond of: ``When the legends die, the dreams end; when the dreams end, there is no more greatness.'' Korczak's legend did not die with him. His and Chief Henry Standing Bear's dream continues to inspire greatness today. Now, eighteen years after his death, it is my hope we can share his dream with all Americans by issuing a postage stamp in his honor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator LARRY CRAIG the Harmful Non-native Weed Control Act of 2000. This legislation will provide critically needed resources to local agencies to reduce the spread of harmful weeds that are destroying the productivity of farmland and reducing ecological diversity. 
   In the last few years, public and private lands in the west have seen a startling increase in the spread of harmful, non-native weeds. In South Dakota, these weeds choke out native species, destroy good grazing land, and cost farmers and ranchers thousands of dollars a year to control. On public lands in South Dakota and throughout the West, the spread of the weeds has outpaced the ability of land managers to control them, threatening species diversity and, at times, spreading on to private land. 
   This problem has become so severe that the White House has created an Invasive Species Council to address it. As Secretary Bruce Babbitt noted, ``The blending of the natural world into one great monoculture of the most aggressive species is, I think, a blow to the spirit and beauty of the natural world.'' 
   Despite these efforts, the scale of this problem is vast. Some estimate that it could cost well into the hundreds of millions of dollars to control effectively the spread of these weeds. This legislation will help to meet that need by putting funding directly into the hands of the local weed boards and managers who already are working to control this problem and whose lands are directly affected. 
   Specifically, this legislation authorizes new weed control funding and establishes an Advisory Board in the Department of Interior to identify the areas of greatest need for the distribution of those funds. States, in turn, will transfer up to 25 percent of it directly to local weed control boards in order to support ongoing activities and spur the creation of new weed control boards, where necessary. The remaining 75 percent of funds will be made available to weed control boards on a competitive basis to fund weed control projects. 
   I would like to thank Senator CRAIG for his work on this issue, and to thank the National Cattlemen's Association and the Nature Conservancy, who have been instrumental to the development of this bill. Now that this legislation has been introduced, it is my hope that we can work with all interested stakeholders to enact it as soon as possible. I look forward to working with my colleagues during this process.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with a sad heart that I speak this morning. We now all know that we have lost the Governor of the State of Missouri. Gov. Mel Carnahan was killed in a plane crash last night. Like another man from Missouri, Harry Truman, Mel Carnahan was a man of plain speech and enormous political courage. I believe he would have been a great United States Senator, just as he was a great Governor. His death is a loss to the people of Missouri and to all Americans. 
   Mel Carnahan spent his life in public service. In this time of skepticism and cynicism about politics and politicians, it is worth noting that Mel Carnahan could have done anything with his life and been a success. His intelligence, his drive, his dedication, his hard work, would have landed him at the top of just about anything he chose to pursue. But Mel Carnahan made a choice early in his life that he would enter public service and that he would use his enormous talents to help people, and that is what he did. 
   In the State legislature, as State treasurer, as Lieutenant Governor, and during his two terms as Governor, he worked to help people, 
   to make government efficient, and to use the tools at his disposal to make a difference to people's lives. 
   Whether it was improving public schools, expanding health insurance for children, stricter safety standards for nursing homes to protect seniors, or passing some of the toughest anti-crime measures in the nation to make communities safer, he made a difference.  
   When Governor Carnahan raised taxes in 1993 to improve Missouri schools, it was an act of political courage that he said was part of his job. ``It was the right thing to do,'' he said later. It was the right thing to do. If one principle could sum up Mel Carnahan's entire political career of public service, it would be just that--he saw what needed to be done, and he did the right thing, regardless of political consequences. 
   He saw what needed to be done, and using that strong inner compass of right and wrong that steered him through his entire life, he made his decisions--not based on polls or focus groups or other political considerations, but on what was the right thing to do. 
   Last night, we lost a true public servant--the kind whose service on behalf of people brings honor to all of us who have chosen a similar path for our lives. The fact that his son Randy was with him makes the personal tragedy suffered by the Carnahan family all the more crushing. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jean Carnahan, and the Carnahan and Sifford families in this time of sadness. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I understand we are about to recess for the day. I want to discuss for just a moment, if I may, my observations about the week and the lack of any activity or communication with the Democratic caucus. I am told that the majority leader has indicated to his caucus members that there won't be a vote tomorrow and that the vote will be postponed on the Agriculture appropriations bill until Thursday. 
   I am surprised by that announcement, first, because I had not been forewarned or informed in any way that this would be the schedule for the week. I also am disappointed because I have indicated to a lot of people that they needed to ensure they would be here tomorrow at 11:30. They have all made plans accordingly. A lot of people have arranged their entire week around the fact that tomorrow at 11:30 there would be a vote. I am told that our Republican colleagues may simply go into a quorum call at some point and force the Senate into a vote on Thursday, which is, of course, their right. We will insist on a vote on adjournment tomorrow. There will be a vote tomorrow. 
   We think we ought to be here, working, resolving the outstanding differences. The longer we are gone, the less likely it is we will finish our work. It is that simple. How many days do we have to go with absolutely no business on the Senate floor? We could be taking up an array of issues. We could be taking up unfinished business that begs our consideration. Yet we sit day after day holding hands and wondering when, if ever, we will adjourn sine die. This isn't the way to run the Senate. 
   At the very least, there ought to be a minimum amount of communication between Republicans and Democrats with regard to the schedule. To read an announcement that there will be a vote postponement and not to give forewarning to all of our colleagues who are making travel plans is, again, just another departure from what I consider to be good will and common sense. 
   We will delay the vote at least until 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon because of the Cole funeral. We understand there will be Members who need to travel to Virginia for that very important matter. We will delay the vote until at least after 4 o'clock. I want colleagues to know there will be a vote tomorrow and we will force that vote. We will continue to force votes to keep people here to do what they are supposed to do. 
   I have also just been in consultation with a number of our colleagues from the White House, and they have indicated they will begin insisting on much shorter continuing resolutions, 2 or 3 days at the maximum. I hope the President will veto anything longer than a 3-day CR. Why? Because it is ridiculous to be taking 7-day CRs, leaving 5 days for campaigning and 2 days for work--if that. We should be working 7 days with a 7-day CR. We should be finishing the Nation's business with the CR. To give every single candidate, whoever it is, the opportunity to campaign while leaving the people's business for whenever they can get around to it and delay it to another occasion when it is more convenient for them to come back is unacceptable, inexcusable, and will not be tolerated. 
   I put our colleagues on notice that in whatever limited way we can influence the schedule, we intend to do so. That will at least require perhaps a little more consultation but, at the very least, a little more forewarning to all colleagues with regard to the schedule and what it is we are supposed to be doing here.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I have seen recesses that are more productive than what we have experienced since we started passing CRs. These recesses, as I like to call them--7 days of continuation of a resolution, and then 2 days, if that, of work, maybe 1 day of work--are mind boggling. 
   There ought to be some urgency here. We ought to express the same level of urgency that a continuing resolution implies. But I don't see any urgency. I see no sense of determination to try to finish our work. If we take a poll of where our colleagues are today, they are cast out over all 50 States, with very little appreciation of the need to finish our work, to come back and do what we are supposed to do.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator from Nevada. First, I would like to see if we could work on Tuesday. I would like to see us work on Wednesday. But as he has noted, given the urgency of completing our work, Saturday and perhaps even Sunday would be a real departure from current practice. But just working on the weekdays of the week would be a startling revelation for some of our colleagues. 
   I think it is time we get the job done. It is time we recognize how important it is we finish our work. It is time we bring people back. Let's keep people here. Let's require they negotiate. Let's work and get our business done before we have to continue this charade that seems to be a common practice of being in session but doing no work. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the troubling developments in the Middle East. Given what has happened in the past several days, it is increasingly apparent that we are at a dangerous juncture in a critically important region of the world. The United States can and must stay engaged in the Middle East. 
   First and foremost, Mr. President, my heart goes out to the families of the seventeen sailors reported killed and the 36 injured in the explosion yesterday on the U.S.S. Cole off the coast of Yemen. These brave individuals lost their lives or suffered injury in defense of our country, our values, and our future. This explosion underscores the danger that the men and women of our Armed Forces face every day, and our debt of gratitude for the duty they undertake. 
   All evidence strongly suggests that yesterday's explosion was a terrorist attack. Such an attack is senseless and cowardly, and those responsible will be found and brought to justice. The world should know that the President and the Congress stand united on this score. 
   We will not grant the perpetrators an ounce of satisfaction that they have succeeded in altering the way the United States conducts business. We will remain a force for stability. We will continue to press for a negotiated peace in the Middle East. We will stand against insecurity and senseless violence in the Middle East and throughout the world. We owe that much to the brave sailors who were killed yesterday. 
   Recent days have also confronted us with a stream of horribly violent incidents in Israel and the territories. Unfortunately, efforts to end unrest have yet to succeed. Yesterday two Israeli soldiers were killed in a distressing scene of mob violence as protests gave way to deadly confrontation. I deplore that violence, Mr. President, and I call on Chairman Arafat to raise his voice in favor of peace. 
   I have followed with grave concern the violence that has gripped Israel and the territories for more than two weeks. After years of instability and violence, this region of the world--so riven with religious and strategic interests--was experiencing relative calm. This state of affairs was born out of an emerging consensus among all parties in the region that the future peace and security of Israel and the territories could be decided only through negotiation. The outlines of and expectations for a lasting peace were beginning to take shape. A successful conclusion to these negotiations seemed tantalizingly close just two short months ago when Israel made unprecedented compromises in the name of peace. 
   In addition to the human toll exacted by the recent string of violent incidents, there has been another equally tragic casualty--at least in the short term. The events of the past week or so have apparently punctured the hope for a quick peace settlement, putting at risk the great progress that had been made toward settling long-standing Israeli-Palestinian differences. Moreover, the latest crisis in Israel and the territories also threatens wider regional conflict, as evidenced by the abduction of three Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah guerrillas operating out of 
   Lebanon as well as Iraqi troop movements. The stakes, Mr. President, are high and the time is short.  
   If we are to return to the path of a peaceful settlement after the events of the last two weeks, we must first end the violence. A cessation of hostilities can only be accomplished if all sides demonstrate leadership by condemning the violence. I am sorely disappointed in Arafat and the Palestinian Authority and in the fact that they have allowed violence to be carried out without restraint or comment. 
   Preferring instead to blame the violence on what he terms Israeli provocations, Arafat has refused to publicly and unequivocally call for an end to violent protests and confrontations. Palestinian police have failed to control mob violence. And efforts at re-establishing negotiations have been rebuffed. The result is despicable violence that has cost far too many innocent lives. 
   Rather than being unable to control the violence--as Chairman Arafat claims--his silence leaves the impression that he condones it. The on-again off-again cooperation with Israeli security forces suggests that Arafat prefers using violence and the threat of wider war as a negotiating tool. Such tactics are cynical, dangerous and stand in stark contrast to the Oslo process that brought the region to brink of a comprehensive peace just two short months ago. 
   Meanwhile Prime Minister Barak has remained committed to negotiations and the Oslo Process. He took great risks at Camp David in July. He offered remarkable concessions on issues that go to the very core of his country's history and identity--compromises that no one had considered possible before President Clinton convened the Camp David talks. 
   Despite subsequent violence provocations, Barak has repeated his interest in restoring calm, ending the violence and returning to the negotiating table. When he was approached by President Clinton to join an emergency summit, he readily stated his interest and willingness in participating. 
   And unlike Arafat, Barak has clearly denounced violence. He implored Israelis not to participate in the violence when he said, ``I urge our Jewish citizens to refrain from attacking Arabs and their property under any circumstances.'' 
   Time is short in the Middle East, Mr. President. The risk of a wider regional conflict is very real. The first step toward assuring that the situation improves is a strong public statement from Chairman Arafat calling for an end to the violence.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I commend the majority leader for his work in reaching this agreement and compliment and thank Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   We have to be realists as we try to finish our work at the end of this session. Being realists means we don't get it exactly the way we want it. Obviously, many Members have serious problems about the way we are proceeding. We, nonetheless, realize we have to get the work done. While it may not be pretty, it will get the work done. That is ultimately what we are here to do. 
   To clarify what this agreement does with regard to some of the concerns  that some Members have raised, first and foremost, this allows for the completion of the Treasury-Postal bill because we address the IRS concern raised by the administration. We are very pleased that issue has been resolved and we are now able to go forth at least from the point of view of the administration. Senator BYRD had the same concern I did about procedure. This allows us technically to have taken up TPO on the floor, as Senator BYRD has strongly suggested we do and as some Members proposed be done. This allows us to do that, and we will do it in concert with the consideration of HUD-VA. 
   Obviously, as I think everyone now knows, section 103 of the energy and water bill is very problematic for the administration and for some of us. This understanding takes out section 103. 
   We have accommodated a lot of the concerns in reaching this agreement. We will have a couple of amendments offered by Senator BOXER who has concerns about the HUD-VA bill. This reaches the level of understanding we have with regard to her concerns, as well. 
   Clearly, this is a compromise taking into account both the procedural as well as the substantive concerns many Senators have had on both sides of the aisle, and it accommodates those concerns as best we can under these circumstances. 
   Again, I end where I began by complimenting the majority leader, by expressing my appreciation for his work in trying to reach an accommodation of some of these issues. I hope we can do more on other bills that are yet to be considered. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate all those who have worked so hard for so long on the H-1B bill. Senators LEAHY, HATCH, KENNEDY, ABRAHAM, FEINSTEIN, LIEBERMAN and BIDEN have all done an admirable job at putting together a good bipartisan bill that will strengthen our economy and increase the resources that go to technology education and training. 
   I would also like to thank the Majority Leader for his efforts. While we have disagreements about how the process, here in the Senate, should work, on this bill, we have shared a commitment that the Senate must act to ensure the stability of the H-1B program in the years to come. 
   Mr. President, as you know, this legislation responds to the pressing need many American companies are facing for highly-skilled workers. The bill increases the annual ceiling for the admission of H-1B non-immigrants to 195,000 for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. It also includes an important provision to exempt H-1B visa applicants employed by higher education institutions and other non-profits from the yearly numerical limits. 
   This visa increase could not come at a more important time. With unemployment rates currently at or near historic lows, the H-1B program has become an increasingly important source of skilled labor for U.S. employers. U.S. employers are expected to need roughly 1.6 million information technology workers in the next year. Unfortunately, the demand far exceeds the supply of qualified individuals. This shortage not only threatens the competitiveness of U.S. high technology companies but it also threatens our economy, which owes much of its success to the technology sector. 
   These labor shortfalls are not just felt in Silicon Valley, Northern Virginia and other high tech clusters--they are felt nationwide. In fact, 35 percent of the unfilled jobs in the information technology sector are in the Midwest. In a study done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state of South Dakota had the greatest high-technology employment growth in the early 1990's--a whopping 172 percent increase. And South Dakota companies, like those in other states, are struggling to find the workers they need to continue to grow. 
   That said, the H-1B visa program is only a short-term solution to the skills shortage being experienced by American companies. Accordingly, I am proud of the work that was done, largely at the behest of Democratic Senators, to ensure that this bill begins to address our long-term challenge--ensuring that in the future there are enough Americans with the necessary skills to fill these jobs. Indeed, as Senator MIKULSKI reminded us during this debate, America is facing a skills shortage, rather than a worker shortage. It is our job to reverse that trend. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction. It dedicates over half of the H-1B fees collected to the worker training primarily in the fields of high technology, information technology and biotechnology skills. By increasing the H-1B visa fee modestly, this bill will triple the money going to these important training programs enabling 45,000 workers a year to take advantage of these new training opportunities. In addition, the bill also triples the money dedicated to providing meaningful educational scholarships for students, particularly minority students, who are enrolled in a mathematics, engineering or computer science degree program and for improving science, mathematics and technology education in the K-12 system. 
   There are millions of Americans who yearn for the opportunity to participate in our new economy and all its rewards. And they need only one thing to do just that--skills training and education. 
   It is our duty to help these Americans realize their dreams. This bill is an important down-payment in that effort. Thus, I look forward to this bill becoming law in the near future. Both U.S. workers and U.S. companies stand to benefit.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we are about to cast a vote at 5:30. I think in many ways this is a very difficult situation. I come to the floor this afternoon expressing my gratitude to the distinguished chair of the Energy and Water Subcommittee and certainly to the ranking member, the Senator from Nevada, our extraordinary assistant Democratic leader, for the great work they have done in responding to many of the issues and concerns that our colleagues have raised. I think in large measure it is a very balanced bill. 
   Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve what is a very significant matter relating to the Missouri River and the precedent that it sets for all rivers. The Corps of Engineers must, from time to time, update the master manual for the rivers that it manages. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have indicated that they were unwilling to compromise with regard to finding a way they could address their concerns without calling a complete halt to a multiyear process that has been underway to revise and update a master manual that is now over 40 years old. That is the issue: a manual that affects thousands of miles of river, hundreds of thousands, if not billions, of dollars of revenue generated from hydroelectric power, navigation, irrigation, municipal water, and bank stabilization. 
   There is perhaps no more complicated management challenge than the one affecting the Missouri and, for that matter, the Mississippi Rivers. 
   So our challenge has been to address the concerns of the two Senators from Missouri in a way that recognizes their legitimate questions regarding the Corps' intent on management, and also to recognize that there are stretches of the river both affecting the Mississippi in downstream States as well as all of the upstream States that also must be addressed, that also have to be worked out, that have to be recognized and achieved in some way. 
   We have gone to our distinguished colleagues on the other side on a number of occasions indicating a willingness to compromise, indicating a willingness to sit down to try to find a way to resolve this matter. I must say, we have been rebuffed at every one of those efforts. So we are left today with no choice. 
   What I hope will happen is that we can vote in opposition to the bill in numbers sufficient enough to indicate our ability to sustain a veto; the President will then veto this legislation, as he has now noted publicly and privately on several occasions; and that we come down together to the White House, or anywhere else, work out a  compromise, work out some suitable solution that accommodates the Senators from Missouri as well as all other Senators on the river. That is all we are asking. 
   It is unfortunate that it has to come to this, to a veto. I warned that it would if we were not able to resolve it. I am disappointed we are now at a point where that appears to be the only option available to us. 
   Before he came to the floor, I publicly commended the chair of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for his work. And I will say so privately to my colleagues that what he has done and what the ranking member has done is laudable and ought to be supported. But the overriding concern is a concern that has been addressed now on several occasions. It was my hope that it was a concern that could have been addressed in a way that would 
   have avoided the need for a veto. Unfortunately, that is not the case. So we are left with no choice, Madam President. I regret that fact. 
   I hope that my colleagues will understand that this legislation is important. I hope after the veto, after it is sustained--if that is required--we can go back, get to work, and find the compromise that I have been seeking now for weeks, and find a way with which to move this legislation along. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, the senior Senator from Montana would like a minute or two to talk on this subject. Perhaps it would be better for him to do it now, and then you could close the debate, if that would be appropriate.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from California and the Senator from Iowa for their extraordinary colloquy this afternoon on prescription drugs. There is so much confusion, unfortunately, on the issue, largely generated intentionally by the other side, hoping to confuse people, obfuscate the question, and confuse the issue. The Senators from California and Iowa have, with great clarity, redefined it and redescribed it. I hope my colleagues, if they did not have the chance to hear them, will read it in the RECORD tomorrow. It was really an extraordinary contribution. I am grateful to them. 
   Also, I am grateful to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for allocating this time. I think it is very important that we have an opportunity to talk about how it is that we got here. I want to devote my comments to the question of how we got here, and I will talk about two things. 
   First, I want to talk about how we got here in the larger context of Senate rules and Senate procedure and the practice of the majority under the rules and Senate procedure. And then I want to talk a little bit about the schedule itself and how it is we got here, with only two days remaining in the fiscal year, and so much work still incomplete. 
   I think it is very important for us to understand that, procedurally, we have seen the disintegration of this institution in so many ways. I have come to the floor on other occasions to talk about this disintegration. I think this is important for newer Senators to understand. I see the extraordinarily able new Member from Georgia, a Senator who has just joined us, Mr. MILLER. I worry about the Senator ``Millers'' and about the Senator ``Fitzgeralds,'' our current Presiding Officer. I worry about those who may not have understood what the Senate institution looked like as an institution years ago. 
   The controversy that we are facing is not about procedural niceties. The right to debate and the right to amend are fundamental rights to every Senator as he or she joins us in this Chamber. Without those features, those abilities, we diminish substantially the nature of the office of Senator, the institution of the Senate, and indeed the reason why Senators come here in the first place. 
   Obviously, we are here to debate the great issues of the day. But how does one do it if we are relegated to press conferences or other forums that force us to talk about those matters off the floor? This Chamber has been called the most deliberative body in the world. Yet I worry about how little we have actually deliberated this year. And because we have not deliberated, the Senate as an institution has suffered. 
   Unfortunately, over the last few years, I believe the Senate has changed dramatically. We have been denied the opportunity to offer amendments, as we are right now on the pending legislation, the so-called H-1B bill. In the entire 106th Congress, we have had only a handful of opportunities where Senators were given their prerogative, given their fundamental right as a Senator, to do what they came here to do: to represent their constituents through active participant in the legislative process here on the floor of the United States Senate. 
   There has been an extraordinary abuse of cloture. Over one-fourth of all the cloture votes in history--over 25 percent--have been cast since 1995. 
   Twenty-five percent of all the cloture votes in history have been cast in the last four years. That is one figure I hope people will remember. 
   The other one which I think is critical is that we have had more cloture votes in 1999 than any other year in history. We broke a record there as well. 
   Under the majority leader's approach, we have also had the most first-day cloture filings ever. We have never had this many cloture filings on the first day. 
   This is a motion to invoke cloture. This is what it says. They are all the same. It is a stock statement.  
   We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending amendment--in this case the marriage tax penalty bill.  
   The key phrase is the one we have outlined in yellow: ``To bring to a close debate.'' 
   I ask anybody who is even a casual observer of debate: How can you close debate before it has even started? But that is what we are doing. A bill is filed. Amendments are filed to the bill in order to close the parliamentary tree. That denies us the opportunity to offer amendments. Then cloture is filed so we can bring to a closure debate that hasn't even begun. 
   We have done that more in 1999--of course we don't know about 2000 yet--than in any other year in our history. Of all the cloture votes together, over all of these years, 25 percent of them were in just the last 4. 
   Under previous leaders, we filed cloture, of course. There were some great debates about many issues in the past that went on for days and weeks and even months. People would be here 24 hours a day. The debates would go on, and a majority leader would be compelled to file cloture to bring the debate to a close. Why? Because they had been debating it. That is what they were supposed to do. That is why cloture is supposed to be filed. Yet now we find ourselves voting on cloture before we have had even the first hour or the first 5 minutes of debate. 
   We are also rewriting the rules on amendments themselves. Recently, we outlawed nongermane sense-of-the-Senate amendments to appropriations bills. We can't do that anymore. 
   The number of amendments have also been grossly restricted. I have never seen, as I have this year, the overly restrictive way with which we have approached virtually every single bill. 
   Take the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the bill we took up earlier this year. An average of 39 amendments have been offered to ESEA reauthorization bill over the last 25 years--39 amendments. Yet this year, only four Democratic amendments to the ESEA bill were permitted before the bill was pulled. That's right: historically, there were an average of 39  amendments to ESEA bills. This year, Democrats offered four amendments, and the bill was gone. We are told we don't have time to complete the bill. We are told the Democrats shouldn't even think about offering all of these amendments. We are told that bills should be passed with no amendments at all, or if we must offer amendments, they must meet the strict definition of ``relevant" used by the parliamentarian. 
   The interesting thing is, nonrelevant amendments have been considered OK for the Republican Party in the past. I have a chart that shows some of the examples of non-relevant amendments offered when the Republicans were in the minority, and even in some cases when they were in the majority. 
   We had a juvenile justice bill that came up in 1999. The majority leader saw fit to offer a ``prayer at school memorial services'' amendment to a juvenile justice bill. That was OK. 
   We had a Commerce-Justice appropriations bill 2 years ago. It was OK to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on Social Security at that time. 
   We had a supplemental appropriations bill. This was when the 
   Republicans were in the minority, and the Senator from Delaware, now chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, certainly didn't see anything wrong with offering a tax cut amendment to that bill. Evidently, that was OK, too. 
   Yet now Republicans are saying: Democrats don't have a right to offer nonrelevant amendments, nongermane amendments. We can, but you can't. 
   I don't understand that logic. I don't understand how in 1993 when they were in the minority the senior Senator from North Carolina saw fit to offer a patent for the Daughters of the Confederacy amendment to the community service bill. 
   I don't see how we could have a Lithuanian independence amendment to the Clean Air Act. I want clean air in Lithuania, but I have to tell you this had nothing to do with clean air in Lithuania. This wasn't relevant. This wasn't germane. 
   There is a double standard here. I hope people understand our frustration as they watch the action and hear the words. 
   We have also trivialized Senate-House conferences over the last several years. The scope of the conference rule was repealed. Now conference reports can include anything and everything--even measures that were never included in either House. 
   That is all part of what got us to the problem we are in now with appropriations. All of this, I might say, goes back to the concern the senior Senator from West Virginia shared as he talked about the procedures and the breakdown of the institution. When we repeal the scope of conference rule that said things had to be in either the House or Senate bill before they could be considered in conference, when we repealed that, we opened up, as our Senator from New Mexico likes to call it, a ``box of Pandoras''--a real box of Pandoras. 
   We now have sham conferences. It is almost like a huge U-Haul truck is pulled right up to the front door. We just lob everything in there and drive it on down to the White House. Nobody knows what is in that big box of Pandoras. It is put into that truck, hauled down to the White House, the President signs it, and it becomes law. 
   It is getting worse and worse. Now we find our Republican colleagues want to take what happened in a subcommittee, where maybe a handful of people know anything about it, bypass this Chamber entirely, go into a conference, load up that truck, and take it down to the White House. That is why we said no last week. That is why we said you can't marry these bills that have had no consideration on the Senate floor--sham conferences. 
   I know why we are doing this. In fact, our colleagues on the other side have been very candid about it, both privately and publicly. They have said: We don't want to have to vote on these tough issues. We have a lot of vulnerable incumbents. We are not going to allow these amendments if they are going to be problematic. 
   I am sorry if someone is inconvenienced. We have had to do that for years. Casting votes is what being a Senator is all about. If you oppose a measure, then table an amendment, offer a second degree, offer an alternative. 
   There has to be a way of doing it other than gagging this institution. Forcing cloture votes against imagined filibusters in order to cast blame just doesn't work. 
   There are those on the other side who have said we shouldn't have to spend more than a couple of days on any one of these bills. We should be able to get these things done within 24 to 48 hours. Why should they take so long? My answer is because this is the Senate. I will get into days in just a minute. We have the days. 
   We have ways with which to ensure we can have a good debate. We can work Mondays and Fridays. We can work after 6. We could do a lot of things to ensure that the days are there. Some of the very finest pieces of legislation ever to pass the Congress took more than a couple of days. Bills sometimes take longer. They are complicated. 
   The majority keeps asking for cooperation. But I think what they truly mean is capitulation. 
   All Senators should be free to debate an amendment. We shouldn't have to face these artificial relevancy requirements. Important bills should have their time on the floor. We ought to have good, rigorous debates. We ought to be able to offer amendments. Let's agree to disagree and let's vote and move on. 
   We did that in 1994 with a piece of legislation from which we still benefit today. 
   Every crime statistic is down in America today, every single one. Do you know why that is? That is in part because we passed the COPS Program, the community police program. That is because we have provided resources to police officers in ways they didn't have earlier in the decade. Another reason is that we passed an awfully good crime bill in 1994, the last year Democrats were in the majority. 
   Do you know how long it took? We spent 2 weeks on that crime bill. We had 92 amendments which were proposed, 86 amendments adopted, over 20 rollcall votes. That is the way the Senate is supposed to work--a good, rigorous debate, and ultimately a product that enjoyed, in this case, broad bipartisan support. Why? Because it was a good piece of legislation. Why? Because everybody had their say. Why? Because it was probably an improved product over what it was when it was first introduced. 
   That ought to be the model. I don't think there was a cloture motion filed in that entire debate. We didn't fill any trees. We didn't say, we have to get this done in 2 days. We didn't say, we don't have time. We said, we are going to do it and we are going to do it right. And we did it right. And 6 years later, we still benefit. 
   We are prepared to work with our colleagues on the other side. We only hope they share the deeply held view about commitment to the institution, about commitment to the rights of each Senator, about an understanding of the responsibility for the legacy of this institution for future Senators and for all of this country as we consider the fragile nature of democracy itself. 
   I said there were two items. The first was procedural; the second is schedule. The majority later said last year:  
   We were out of town two months and our approval rating went up 11 points. I think I've got this thing figured out.  
   They are sure acting as if they have it figured out. If they were motivated to be out, so their points went up, they have shown it by the schedule. 
   This is the schedule for the year. All those red days are days we are not in session. All the blue days are the days we are in session. Look at all those red days. Yet we are told: We don't have time. We don't have time to take up appropriations bills. We don't have time to take up amendments. We don't have time to take up a legislative agenda. 
   We don't have time? Maybe it is because there is a little more red than there ought to be. The number of days we are scheduled to be in session in the year 2000 is shown: 115. That is the number of days in session in the year 2000. Keep in mind, there are 365 days in the year, yet all we could find time for were 115 out of that 365. As it happens, this is the shortest session of the Senate in half a century--since 1956. In fact, this year's schedule is only two days longer that the infamous do-nothing Congress of 1948.  
   The number of days with no votes in the year 2000, out of that 115: 34. We will be in session for 115 days in session out of 365 days, but we have lopped off a third of those days. On 34 of the 115 days, we have had no votes at all. 
   But there is no time. 
   The number of days on Mondays with votes in the year is shown. Out of all the Mondays in this year, we have only had three where we have had votes--three Mondays. 
   On how many Fridays of this year 2000 did we have votes? Six. We did a little bit better on Fridays than Mondays. Three Mondays with votes; six Fridays with votes. 
   Mondays with votes in September? There it is: One. 
   No time for appropriations bills. No time for all of the issues Democrats wanted to take up. Yet on only 1 Monday in the month of September did we have votes. 
   On Fridays in September, we didn't do quite as well. I don't know how we explain no votes on Fridays in September when we have all this work, knowing we will bump up against the end of the fiscal year at the end of this month. Imagine not having votes on Mondays or Fridays, knowing we have 11 appropriations bills that are yet to be completed. 
   Appropriations bills completed to date? Only two. We are dealing here with numbers most people understand: 1's and 2's. 
   We have done a little calculating because now we are getting into more advanced arithmetic. I said we have been using 1's and 2's and 0's. We used our calculator to decide how long it would take at this rate to complete the work on the remaining 11 appropriations bills, and now we are into triple digits: 572 days to complete work on the 11 appropriations bills on this schedule. 
   Finally, there is one more calculation. I am sure people are trying to figure that out. If you take the 572 and project it out, I promise we will be finished by April 16 of the year 2002. That is when we finish our work on the appropriations bills using the schedule we have adopted in the year 2000: 4/16/02--April 16, 2002. So mark that in your calendars, folks. That is likely to be the year, the month, and the day that we finish our bills using the schedule we have employed this year. 
   Someone once said, 90 percent of success is just showing up. Maybe that is our problem. We aren't showing up. Maybe we ought to show up a little bit more. Maybe we ought to work on Mondays and Fridays. Maybe we ought to work a little bit longer after 6 o'clock. Ninety percent of success is just showing up. Maybe we can be a little more successful. When we show up, maybe we ought to remember why we are here. Maybe we ought to remember the prerogatives of every Senator. Maybe we ought to call back the golden days when Senators debated profoundly on the issues of the day. 
   Open this drawer: Lyndon Baines Johnson sat at this desk, Mike Mansfield sat at this desk, Joe Robinson sat at this desk, ROBERT C. BYRD sat at this desk. George Mitchell sat at this desk. I don't know how I would explain to my predecessors what has happened to the Senate this year. That is why the same ROBERT C. BYRD came to the floor this morning. Listen to ROBERT C. BYRD. Listen to George Mitchell. Go back in the RECORD and listen to Lyndon Baines Johnson, listen to Joe Robinson, and remember what Mike Mansfield said. 
   Let's call back the glory of this institution. Let's remember why we are here, and we can then all be proud. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the willingness on the part of the Senator from Iowa to give me an opportunity to make some remarks with regard to where we are on the legislation. 
   Yesterday's vote demonstrates clearly that there is strong bipartisan support in the Senate for increasing the number of visas for high-skilled workers. On that point, Democrats and Republicans agree, but there is a stark disagreement between our parties on the issue of fairness to immigrants. 
   Republicans do not want to acknowledge this; they do not want to admit that they oppose the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. That is why they have gone to such extraordinary lengths to try to avoid having to take a public position on it. There is an election coming up, and they do not want to have to explain to Latino and immigrant groups why they told thousands of hard-working immigrants who are in this country doing essential jobs: Go home. Republicans would rather risk not delaying the passage of the H-1B visa bill than vote for the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act or risk the political consequences of voting against it. 
   There is really no reason we cannot pass both a strong H-1B bill and the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   We are in the longest period of economic expansion in our Nation's history. We all know that now. The census numbers which were released yesterday confirm once again the remarkable progress we have made in recent years. 
   In the last 7 years, we have seen 20 million new jobs. Unemployment is lower now than it has been in 30 years. In my State of South Dakota, the jobless rate is between 2 and 3 percent. 
   Ten years ago, many companies could not expand because they could not get the capital. Today they can get the capital, but they cannot get the workers. 
   Clearly, one of the industries hardest hit by today's skilled-worker shortage is the information technology industry. According to a recent survey of almost 900 IT executives, nearly 10 percent of IT service and support positions in this country--268,740 jobs--are unfilled today because there are not enough skilled workers in this country to fill them. 
   The H-1B visa program was supposed to prevent such shortages, but it cannot because it has not kept pace with the growth in our economy. This year, in fact, the H-1B program reached its ceiling of 115,000 visas in less than 6 months. That is why my colleagues and I support substantially increasing the number of visas available under the H-1B program. 
   The high-tech industry, however, is not the only industry struggling with worker shortages. The Federal Reserve Board has said repeatedly that there are widespread shortages of essential workers all through the United States. All across America, restaurants, hotels, and nursing homes are in desperate need of help. Widespread labor shortages in these industries also pose a very significant threat to our economy. That is one reason my colleagues and I introduced the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act earlier this year and why we wanted to offer that legislation as an amendment to this measure. 
   The changes in our proposal are pro-business and certainly pro-family. They are modest, and they are long overdue. We have talked about them before, but let me just, again for the RECORD, make sure people are clear as to what it is we want to do. 
   First, we want to establish legal parity for all Central American and Caribbean refugees. That is not too much to ask. 
   Why is it we treat refugees from some countries differently from refugees from other countries? All we are asking for is parity. 
   Second, we want to update the registry so that immigrants who have been in this country since before 1986, who have worked hard and played by the rules, will remain here permanently and will have the ability to remain here legally. 
   We want to restore section 245(i) of the Immigration Act so that a person who is in this country and on the verge of becoming a legal resident can remain here while he or she completes the process. Why would we want to send somebody back to the country they fled--someone who is eligible to be a legal resident--just so they can come back here again? If we do not change the law, that is exactly what will happen, forcing these immigrants to pay thousands of dollars, disrupt their lives, and maybe imperil their opportunity to come back at all. 
   Finally, we want to adjust the status of the Liberians who fled to America when Liberia was plunged into a horrific civil war. Thousands of them live in the State of the current Presiding Officer. Our Nation gave these families protected immigrant status which allowed them to stay in the United States but preempted their asylum claims. Instead of forcing them to return to Liberia, a nation our Government warns Americans to avoid because it is so dangerous even today, our bill will give them the opportunity to become legal residents. That is all it would do. 
   Earlier this month, a coalition of 31 associations--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Health Care Association, the National Restaurant Association, the National Retail Federation, and about 28 more--all came together and said: If there is something you do before the end of this year, now that we have PNTR finished, we hope you can pass the restoration of Section 245(i) and these other reasonable immigration provisions. 
   It is the only fair thing to do, and it is good business. We need this done. That is the message from the Chamber of Commerce and the American Retail Federation sent. The American economy is growing not in spite of immigrant workers, but with their help. That is one reason we should pass the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act now.  
   There is another reason. President Roosevelt once said: ``We are a nation of immigrants.'' We are also a nation that values families. This principle is not relegated to one ethnic group. Whether you are African American, European American, Latino American, or Asian American, we value family. That is important to us. If we do not pass the provisions in our proposal, thousands of immigrant parents of American-born children will face an excruciating choice. If they are told to leave this country, should they defy the law so that they can remain with their American-citizen children or should they leave their children here in the hope that others will care for them? Forcing choices like this is simply antithetical to our commitment to family values. 
   I have heard all the speeches in the Senate Chamber about protecting family, doing what is best for family, trying to ensure that families stay together. We are concerned about what children watch on television. But for Heaven's sake, if we care what they watch on television, we ought to decide right now where we want them to watch television. Children ought to be watching television here with their families. 
   That is the choice: Should they leave their children here and hope that others care for them, or should they take their children back to nations that are mired in poverty and torn by violence or both? 
   Surely, those are not the kinds of choices we should force on people who have lived in this country and played by the rules for years. That is not the way we should treat people who have done the essential jobs that others did not want, particularly today when we need their labor so desperately. 
   My colleagues and I strongly support the H-1B visa bill. On that there can be no doubt, especially after yesterday's vote. But we are deeply disturbed and disappointed that the majority has refused to allow us to offer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act or any other amendment on this bill. Once again we have been refused the right to offer even one amendment to the bill. 
   I have offered the majority leader many opportunities. I suggested five and five. I suggested that they have five amendments, that we have five amendments, that we limit them in terms of time and second degree amendments because we wanted to get this bill done. I heard the allegation that: No, Democrats just want to slow down the process, the deliberation, the consideration of the H-1B bill; they don't want it to pass. 
   Our answer to that, you saw yesterday. We want it to pass. That is why I offered a limit on amendments, why I offered a limit on time, why I offered almost any formula you could come up with so that we could accommodate both. 
   Let's pass H-1B, but for Heaven's sake, with 2 weeks left, let's pass the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act as well. Once again we have been refused the right to offer even one amendment to the bill. Once again we are told: Do it our way, or we are not going to do it at all. This is not how this body should operate. Offering amendments and voting on them does not kill bills, it strengthens them, and it strengthens this Senate. 
   Why are our Republican colleagues so determined not even to let us discuss our amendment? They are the majority. If they believe our proposal is misguided, they can vote it down, they can table it. They can do anything they want to. They have the votes. Why won't they allow that vote? What are they so afraid of? 
   We are pleased we are finally on the verge of passing this legislation and increasing the number of H-1B visas. But we are disappointed by the disdain the majority has shown for this Senate and its tradition of fair and open debate. We are even more disturbed by the indifference they are showing to thousands--tens of thousands--of decent, hard-working families who are looking forward to the time when they can live here in freedom and peace, and with confidence that their families can stay together. 
   I am disappointed. I am frustrated, once again, that we have not had an opportunity to have the voice, to have the input, to have the opportunity that any Senator should count as his right or her right to participate fully in debate. But we have been precluded by the rules of the Senate imposed upon us in this case by the majority. 
   The rules in the Senate, of course, allow for free and open debate, allow for amendment, allow for unlimited debate and discussion. The majority continues to insist on bending the rules so that they can constrain the way we pass legislation and which issues will be heard, without regard to the rights of all Senators to have their voices heard.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have colleagues on the floor who are waiting to speak. I apologize to them for breaking in ahead of them. I appreciate their kindness in allowing me to respond briefly to the comments of the Senator from Texas. 
   I can't believe what I have just heard, frankly. I am really amazed, and I may take a longer time at a later date to respond. I do not even know where to begin. But let me make four points very quickly. 
   First, to the point made by the Senator from Texas that somehow we are holding up the H-1B bill, that could not be further off the mark. That is not true. 
   I have suggested to Senator LOTT and to others that we would be willing to take a very short time agreement, period; it is over; let's have the vote. 
   I think what he said was we are trying to hijack the bill. What is it about offering an amendment that hijacks a piece of legislation? We are not hijacking anything. We are simply asking that we use the regular order here. Let's have the vote. Let's have the vote. We can do it this afternoon. 
   Second, with regard to this notion that somehow we are making illegal activity legal, I wonder if the Senator from Texas has looked at the Statute of Liberty recently--the Statue of Liberty welcoming those oppressed from around the world. 
   What is wrong with granting fairness to all immigrants regardless of circumstance? Why do we draw a distinction? 
   That is all we are suggesting--that we not draw any distinctions here; that if you come from El Salvador or Haiti that you ought to have the same rights as if you came from Cuba. We are simply saying we want some basic fairness. We are not condoning any illegal activity. He knows that. 
   Third, I must say that it seems that it is the Senator from Texas who is shedding crocodile tears--in his case, for people who have been waiting in a long line to become American citizens. I am sympathetic to these people too. But, with the passage of the H-1B bill that I know the Senator from Texas will vote for, we are going to allow 600,000 people--over three years--to go to the front of the line. We are going to put them at the front of the line. Never mind those 7 million people he just said were waiting. We are going to put them at the front of the line because they are filling high-paying, high-skilled jobs. Never mind the individuals who fill the thousands of available low-paying, low-skilled jobs. It is only the high-skilled workers we are interested in? To them, we say go to the front of the line. But if you work in a nursing home, if you work in a restaurant, if you work for the minimum wage, we say get back to the end of the line. 
   Fourth, let me correct this notion that somehow Democratic Senators are out of sync. This isn't our legislation. This is the legislation that virtually the entire Hispanic community has said they need. I didn't draft it. We worked with the Hispanic community to draft it. A large number of those people who the distinguished Senator from Texas said voted for him in the last election were the ones who came to this Senate, and said: Fix this problem. Fix it. 
   We are not out of sync. We are trying to respond, as we all must do, to legitimate problems in the Latino community, and the Liberian community. Fairness is what we are asking for. 
   We are not alone. It is the other side that is out there all by themselves. I know the distinguished Senator from Nevada, the Assistant Democratic Leader, has a list that Senator KENNEDY initially constructed, of 31 national organizations, including the National Restaurant Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Retail Federation, that all believe we should pass these immigration reforms. 
   These organizations are not supporting sanctifying or somehow justifying illegal activity. How does the Senator from Texas 
   possibly explain to the Chamber of Commerce that they are condoning illegal activity? For Heaven's sake. 
   That is why I say I don't believe what I just heard. I can't believe anybody would come to the floor and say those things. But they were said. They deserve a response, and I hope our colleagues will keep them in perspective. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the state of South Dakota has just dedicated a very special park at my alma mater, South Dakota State University. This park holds two new granite markers, each honoring a former SDSU student who won the Congressional Medal of Honor, our nation's highest award for valor in action against an enemy force. 
   Today I offer my solemn appreciation to these great Americans: First Lieutenant Willibald C. Bianchi, whose heroism occurred in the Philippines during the first weeks of World War II, and Lt. Colonel Leo K. Thorsness, who was decorated for his feats as a fighter pilot over North Vietnam. 
   First Lieutenant Bianchi, a Minnesota native, was a football player at SDSU and graduated in 1940 with a degree in animal science. During World War II, he served in the 45th Infantry, Philippine Scouts, one of the largest units in the Philippines during the Japanese invasion of December 1941. The invasion was brutally effective and, after less than a month, our Filipino and American troops were forced to retreat onto the Bataan Peninsula where they mounted a final stand against a numerically superior foe. 
   For three desperate months, the Americans and Filipinos battled the Japanese in a sweltering, mountainous jungle. Food was limited and medical supplies scarce. About a month into the fight, however, First Lieutenant Bianchi participated in a crucial series of battles that helped eliminate a pocket of Japanese troops behind the American line. 
   Four days after the Japanese incursion, our forces targeted ``the Big Pocket'' in a coordinated infantry-tank attack. A tank was lost and only slight gains made. On February 3, our forces tried again. Although he was assigned to another unit, First Lieutenant Bianchi volunteered to join a rifle platoon that was directed to destroy two machine gun nests. While leading part of the platoon, First Lieutenant Bianchi was struck by two bullets in his left hand. Refusing to pause for first aid, he dropped his rifle and began firing a pistol. He located one of the  machine gun nests and silenced it with grenades. When wounded again, this time by machine gun bullets through his chest muscles, First Lieutenant Bianchi climbed atop an American tank, seized its anti-aircraft gun, and fired into another enemy position until he was knocked off the tank by a third severe bullet wound. 
   This story has a sad ending. First Lieutenant Bianchi survived that day and returned to the fight a month later. The American-Filipino forces crushed ``the Big Pocket'' about a week after his heroics. But the Japanese would take Bataan in the end, and First Lieutenant Bianchi was sent off on the Bataan Death March. Though he survived the march, he died on January 9, 1945, when an American plane bombed a Japanese prison ship, not realizing that it held Americans. 
   The other hero memorialized in Brookings is Lt. Colonel Leo Thorsness, with whom I share some history. We both studied at SDSU, we both served in the Air Force, and we both ran for South Dakota's 1st Congressional District seat in 1978. While I prevailed, it was only by the skin 
   of my teeth--110 votes out of more than 129,000 total ballots. And from that struggle, I gained a first-hand appreciation of the spirit, determination and patriotism of Leo Thorsness. For me, that experience enhances my appreciation for the remarkable story of a 35-year-old Air Force major who, in the words of his strike force commander, took on ``most of North Vietnam all by himself.'' 
   Lt. Colonel Thorsness had served as a pilot for about 15 years when he was assigned to the 357th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Takhli Royal Thai Air Base. Lt. Colonel Thorsness was sent in just months after the Soviet Union began supplying North Vietnam with surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and his mission was a new and dangerous one--distract and destroy the SAMs so that U.S. bombers could deliver their ordnance. 
   At one o'clock in the afternoon on Wednesday, April 19, 1967, his F-105 screamed off the runway, headed for the Xuan Mai army barracks and storage supply area, 37 miles southwest of Hanoi. Lt. Colonel Thorsness and his wingman attacked from the south, while another pair of F-105s attacked from the north. He silenced one SAM site with missiles, and then destroyed a second SAM site with bombs. But in the attack on the second site, Lt. Colonel Thorsness' wingman was shot down by intensive anti-aircraft fire, and the plane's pilot and electronic warfare officer were forced to eject over North Vietnam. Lt. Colonel Thorsness circled their parachutes and relayed their position to search and rescue crews. While he was circling, a MIG-17 was sighted in the area. Lt. Colonel Thorsness immediately initiated an attack and destroyed the MIG, but he was then forced to depart the area in search of an aerial tanker for refueling. 
   After learning that rescue helicopters had arrived, but that no additional F-105s were arriving to provide cover, Lt. Colonel Thorsness returned alone, flying back through an area bristling with SAMs and anti-aircraft guns to the downed flyers' position. As he approached, he spotted four MIG-17 aircraft, which he attacked, damaging one and driving away the rest. Soon it became clear that Lt. Colonel Thorsness' plane lacked sufficient fuel to continue protecting the rescue operation and that he would have to find an aerial tanker. On his way to the tanker, however, Lt. Colonel Thorsness received a distress call from a fellow F-105 pilot who had gotten lost in battle and was running critically low on fuel. In response, Lt. Colonel Thorsness allowed that pilot to refuel at the tanker, while he himself flew toward the Thai border, a decision that may have saved the other plane and the life of its pilot, according to the Medal of Honor citation. Lt. Colonel Thorsness managed to return to a forward operating base--``With 70 miles to go, I pulled the power back to idle and we just glided in,'' he would recall later. ``We were indicating `empty' when the runway came up just in front of us.'' 
   A week-and-a-half later, on a similar mission, Lt. Colonel Thorsness was shot down over North Vietnam by a heat-seeking missile from a MIG-21. He spent the next six years as a North Vietnamese prisoner of war. He was released on March 4, 1973, and in October of that year, the President of the United States draped the light blue ribbon of the Congressional Medal of Honor around Lt. Colonel Thorsness' neck. 
   The official citation says: ``Lt. Colonel Thorsness' extraordinary heroism, self-sacrifice, and personal bravery involving conspicuous risk of life were in the highest traditions of the military service and have reflected great credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force.'' I could not have put it any better myself. 
   With this statement before the United States Senate, I join in saluting First Lieutenant Bianchi and Lt. Colonel Thorsness. As Congressional Medal of Honor winners, they are a symbol of the finest our nation has to offer. Their feats serve as extraordinary lessons in courage, commitment, and self sacrifice, and I am proud that they are identified with my home state.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the assistant Democratic leader--I wasn't on the floor when this began. I ask if the Senator from Nevada could confirm what I understand to be our circumstance. I apologize for not being here sooner. But as I understand the circumstances, our Republican colleagues have filed cloture on second-degree amendments, and they had intended, as I understand it, to file it on the bill and made a mistake. We understand that. They have created a problem for themselves that they are trying to get out of. 
   But my question is: I ask the Senator from Nevada if the issue is whether or not we ought to have the right to offer an amendment. 
   We have been debating the issue of immigration as if an amendment were pending. We have been debating this issue assuming that somehow there is opposition on the Republican side and support for an amendment on the Democratic side. 
   In the normal course of debate, you ultimately lead to a vote on an amendment. As I understand it, the Republicans have denied us the right to offer an amendment. Is that correct?

   Mr. DASCHLE. Let me ask the assistant Democratic leader, I have to say for those who may not have watched the 106th Congress, we have established a new threshold. It used to be anytime a majority opposed an amendment, they would vote against it. They would perhaps make a motion to table an amendment, we would have the debate, they would vote, and the issue would be behind us. Oftentimes, the minority would lose. That is the way it used to be. 
   Then our colleagues on the other side of the aisle raised it another notch. They said: We don't think you ought to have the right to offer an amendment, so we will file cloture on a bill denying you the right to even offer an amendment. That was the new threshold. 
   We have gone through many, many of these--in fact, a record number. I have given presentations on the floor regarding the number of times our colleagues have actually filed cloture to deny us the right to offer an amendment. 
   This now reaches way beyond that. For the first time--maybe in history--our Republican colleague, without his even knowing it, has offered a Democratic amendment, has second-degreed that amendment, continued to file cloture, to say with even greater determination, we are not going to let you offer an amendment. 
   I ask the assistant Democratic leader in the time he has been in the Senate whether he can recall a time when we have ever seen the majority go to that length to deny Members the right to offer an amendment in the RECORD dealing with immigration or any other issue for that matter?

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the point I was trying to make, and I asked the response of the assistant Democratic leader, I don't know that I have ever seen the majority go to the extremes they have on so many of the levels I have described to deny Members the right to offer amendments. 
   Have there been precedents where the Senators have offered another Democrat or Republican amendment? Of course. But have they done so with all of the other layers of opposition, parliamentarily, that have been now shown to be the case here? Again, I argue, no, they have not. I think this is the most remarkable set of circumstances. 
   What is amazing to me is we have already offered a limit on time. All we want is a simple opportunity to debate the issue for a brief period so we can be on record with regard to fairness for these many millions of immigrants who are looking to us right now for relief. That is all they are doing. Whether they are Liberians, whether they are Latinos, we have a responsibility in this Congress to respond. 
   The President has said to me personally, and he has said in as many ways as he knows how, that he will demand this legislation be addressed before the end of the Congress. He has said that. If we don't do it on this, on what will we do it? 
   So I ask the assistant Democratic leader if he shares my conviction that, first, this extraordinarily unique set of circumstances again reflects the opposition on the part of the majority to basic fairness procedurally and basic fairness with regard to Latinos in this country today?

   Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield for one last question, I also yield the Senator from Nevada 30 minutes of my time. 
   I hope the Latino community, the Liberian community, all of those communities concerned about this immigration language, understand why we are here. We are here in the last days of this session to make right the problem that has existed all too long. We want to make it right. The President wants to sign this legislation. Unfortunately, apparently with unanimity, every one of our Republican colleagues oppose this. We haven't heard one of them come to our position on this issue. 
   I hope the Latino community understands that. I hope those who are concerned about fairness at the end of this session understand that. I hope they will do all they can to reflect their feelings and their opinions before it is too late. We still have time to do this. We still should do it this week. We ought to do it on this bill. I hope our Republican colleagues will reconsider. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is poised to pass the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA). This legislation includes critical provisions to restore the Florida Everglades and the Missouri River in South Dakota and I am hopeful that it will be enacted this year. 
   Among the provisions of WRDA that will most benefit South Dakota is a section incorporating elements of S. 2291, the Missouri River Restoration Act. I introduced this legislation last May to address the siltation of the Missouri River in South Dakota and the threat to Indian cultural and historic sites that border the river. The WRDA bill under consideration today takes an important first step to address these problems, and I want to thank all of my colleagues for their help to secure the passage of this legislation. In particular, Senator JOHNSON, Senator BAUCUS, Senator SMITH of New Hampshire and Senator VOINOVICH deserve praise for their efforts to incorporate this legislation into the larger bill. It is my hope that Congress will adopt the remaining elements of my comprehensive proposal to restore the Missouri River, including the creation of a Missouri River Trust Fund, in the foreseeable future. 
   The need for this legislation stems from the construction of a series of federal dams along the Missouri River in the 1950s and 1960s that forever changed its flow. For decades, these dams have provided affordable electricity for millions of Americans and prevented billions of dollars of damage to downstream states by preventing flooding. They have also created an economically important recreation industry in South Dakota. 
   However, one of the consequences of the dams is that they have virtually eliminated the ability of the Missouri River to carry sediment downstream. Before the dams, the Missouri was known as the Big Muddy because of the heavy sediment load it carried. Today, that sediment is deposited on the river bottom in South Dakota, and significant build-ups have occurred where tributaries like the Bad River, White River and Niobrara River empty into the Missouri. 
   The Bad River, for example, deposits millions of tons of silt into the Missouri River each year. This sediment builds up near the cities of Pierre and Ft. Pierre, where it has raised the local water table and flooded area homes. Already, Congress has had to authorize a $35 million project to relocate hundreds of families. To prevent more serious flooding, the Corps has had to lower releases from the Oahe dam, causing a $12 million annual loss due to restricted power generation. 
   Farther south, near the city of Springfield, sediment from the Niobrara River clogs the Missouri's channel for miles. Boats that used to sail from Yankton to Springfield can no longer navigate the channel, eroding the area's economy. This problem will only grow worse. According to the Corps of Engineers, in less than 75 years Lewis and Clark lake will fill entirely with sediment, ending the ability of that reservoir to provide flood control and seriously threatening the economies of cities like Yankton and Vermillion. 
   In addition to the impact of sediment on flood control, over 3000 cultural and historic sites important to Indian tribes, including burial grounds, campsites, and ancient villages, are found along the Missouri River in the Dakotas. Many of these sites are threatened by erosion, and each year some of them are irretrievably lost as they tumble into the river. Critical points of the Lewis and Clark trail also follow the Missouri through South Dakota, and they are threatened by erosion as well. 
   The elements of the Missouri River Restoration Act included in WRDA today address these problems by establishing a Missouri River Task Force composed of federal officials, representatives of the State of South Dakota and area Indian tribes. It will be responsible for developing and implementing a Missouri River Restoration Program to reduce sedimentation and protect cultural and historic sites along the river. 
   I would like to take a few minutes to explain in detail how this process will work First, the bill establishes a 25-member Missouri River Trust. Appointments will be made to the Trust by the Secretary of the Army. These appointments must be in accordance with the recommendations of the Governor of South Dakota and area Indian tribes to ensure that there is a strong local voice on the Trust. Second, the bill establishes a Missouri River Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Army and including representatives of the Department of Interior, Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. It also includes the Missouri River Trust. 
   Once funding for this legislation becomes available, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will prepare an assessment of the Missouri River watershed in South Dakota that reviews the impact of siltation on the river, including its impact on a variety of issues: the Federal, State and regional economies; recreation; hydropower; fish and wildlife; and flood control. Based upon this assessment and other pertinent information, the Task Force will develop a plan to improve conservation in the Missouri River watershed; control and remove sediment from the Missouri River; protect recreation on the Missouri from sedimentation; protect Indian and non-Indian cultural and historic sites from erosion; and improve erosion control along the river. 
   Once this plan is approved by the Task Force, the Task Force will review proposals from local, state, federal and other entities to meet the goals of the plan and recommend to the Secretary of the Army which of these proposals to carry out. It is the intention of this legislation that the Corps contract with, or provide grants to, other agencies and local entities to carry out these projects. To the extent possible, the Secretary should ensure that approximately 30 percent of the funds used to carry out these projects are spent on projects within Indian reservations or administered by Indian tribes. The bill authorizes a total of $4 million per year for the next 10 years to carry out these goals. 
   While the Task Force will have the flexibility it needs to take appropriate actions to restore the Missouri River,  it is my expectation that a significant effort will be made to improve conservation in the Missouri River watershed. Pilot projects have shown already that the amount of sediment flowing into the Missouri's tributaries can be reduced by as much as 50 percent with appropriate conservation practices. If requested, the Task Force will also have the authority to work with farmers across the river in Nebraska, for example, to reduce the amount of sediment flowing in from the Niobrara River. 
   The conceptual underpinnings of this legislation were developed through numerous public discussions that I have held in South Dakota over the last year. Last January, I held a Missouri River Summit in the town of Springfield with Governor Janklow, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Chairman Mike Jandreau, and other experts to discuss how to address these critical problems. In April, Governor Janklow and I held a hearing in Pierre to gather public comment about proposals to restore the river. 
   I have been pleased by the outpouring of support I have seen for efforts to restore the river. Dozens of communities such as Yankton, Chamberlain, Springfield, Wagner, Pickstown, Mitchell and others have passed resolutions in support river restoration. American Rivers, a national leader in river protection, has recognized this need as well. The legislation passed today takes the first important step we need to take to get this job done. I'd like to thank all those in South Dakota who contributed to this process, and my colleagues in the Senate for all of their support. I look forward to our continued work together. 
   Finally, the WRDA bill includes an amendment to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and State of South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Act. This amendment requires the Corps of Engineers to meet its legal responsibilities to identify and stabilize Indian cultural sites, clean up open dumps, and mitigate wildlife habitat along the river. It also makes important technical changes to that law that will help ensure its smooth implementation. It is my hope that the Corps of Engineers will respond by working closely with the tribes and the state to clean up those lands, stabilize Indian cultural sites, and transfer the lands along the river to the tribes and state in a timely manner.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some of my leader time to comment briefly on the pending legislation. 
   I come to the floor to express my strong objection to the manner in which this was presented to the Senate. It is wrong, it is dangerous, it is shortsighted, and it does a real disservice to this institution, period. 
   I have no objection to appropriations bills coming to the floor, as they must. I have no objection to perhaps even limiting the amendments at this late date to relevant legislation that may be affected in the bill. But I do have a strong reservation when we gag the Senate, as we have once again, limiting debate about important matters directly relating to tax and appropriations in a way that precludes the right of every Senator to be fully engaged in these deliberations. 
   I have heard again and again from colleagues on the other side that it is our desire to slow things down--to stop things. Let me say that is poppycock. No one here wants to slow anything down. In just a moment I will present a list for the RECORD of all the things we are prepared to take up this afternoon--this afternoon. 
   We know why this package was cobbled together in the form and manner in which it now appears before the Senate. It was put together to deny us the right to offer amendments--something we seek to do not because we want to slow things down but because we want a voice. 
   I am not necessarily opposed to the telephone tax repeal. Senator ROBB has been an extraordinary advocate of that. I give him great credit for getting us this far. But I must say I think it begs the question at this hour, with our Republican colleagues clamoring for 90 percent of the surplus to be used for debt retirement, should we would choose the telephone tax, of all things, as one of the items to be paid for with the remaining 10 percent of the surplus our Republican colleagues suggest should be available for both tax reduction as well as investments? 
   I am told there is about $28 billion left in the budget if we reserve 90 percent for the surplus. If we assume for the moment that we accept the Republicans' proposal to use 50 percent of that $28 billion for tax reduction and 50 percent for investments, that leaves about $14 billion for tax reduction in the remainder of this year. Fourteen billion dollars isn't a lot of money when you are talking about the proposals we have had to vote on this year, but $14 billion represents what the Republicans would make available for tax cuts. 
   The telephone tax would use up one-third of what they would allocate for tax reduction in this fiscal year--one-third. Maybe we want to commit one-third of the remaining surplus for tax reduction to the telephone tax. 
   But this Senate is denying us the opportunity to suggest something else. This Senate is denying us the opportunity to offer amendments and to have a debate. In fact, I must say I will bet you most people are going to vote on this and they don't even have a clue what the telephone tax is. I know the Presiding Officer does. He just noted that to me. But I will venture a guess that a lot of people do not. 
   That is just one of the problems we have with this course of action. 
   I don't have any objection to taking up the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. I don't have any objection to taking up Legislative Branch appropriations bill. But I do have an objection when the administration informs us that we have virtually eliminated funding for counterterrorism and have not provided the funding necessary for the IRS and we have been denied the opportunity to at least debate these issues. 
   Then I am told indirectly that, well, we will come up with the money somewhere on another vehicle. I am mystified by that approach. What is it that leads us to think we can find the money 
   elsewhere, at a later date, if we can't find it now? And if we can't find it now, it just seems to me we are premature in moving the bill forward until we can find it. 
   There are a lot of specific practical problems that I hope my colleagues share about this approach--problems related to our ability to participate in the process, problems related to our ability to offer amendments, problems related to the fundamental rights of every Senator to be involved in the debate, problems related directly to the substance of the issues on which we are now voting. Those are serious problems, and they shouldn't be minimized. But beyond that, I have fundamental problems with the precedent we are setting here. 
   There are many who may come into the Senate in future years who, if we continue this process, may come to the conclusion that if it is good on appropriations, why not on any authorization? Why not on a tax bill? Let's just go from committee to conference. Let's forget this Chamber. This Chamber might well be additional office space someday. We don't need a Chamber anymore--not for deliberations, because there are none. 
   Where does it end? Not in our generation. I am sure this will be a slow process. But, institutionally, anybody who cares about the way the Senate should be run should care about the process we are using now. 
   I don't know what message it sends to our young Members on either side of  the Chamber about the way we do business around here. But I don't want to have it heard or said on the Senate floor anytime in the near future that this is the greatest deliberative body, because we aren't deliberating. We are not deliberating on these issues, we are rubber stamping. We are sending them through the process the way you might expect it done in the House, but it doesn't, and it shouldn't, happen here. Institutionally, Republican or Democrat, old or young, it shouldn't matter. I am troubled, very troubled, by this process. 
   As I said a moment ago, we have no objection--none--to moving to other bills. I will not do it. But I would love to ask unanimous consent to move, immediately following the conclusion of our debate on this package, to the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. Guess what. I would get an objection on the other side. I am not sure why. I don't know why. But I know this. We haven't brought it up because somebody over there doesn't want it to come up. That isn't us. 
   I would love to ask unanimous consent to take up the D.C. appropriations bill, the intelligence authorization bill, and the H-1B bill. Let's take them up. Let's have a debate. Let's offer amendments. I have offered to Senator LOTT that we could take up the H-1B bill with five amendments on a side with an hour limit on each amendment, period. We would be done in a day. I believe we could do it in a day. The other side has rejected this offer. 
   Don't let anybody say with a straight face or with any credibility that it is Democrats holding things up. Let's get to these bills. Let's get them done. Let's offer amendments. But, for heaven's sake, let's remember this institution. Let's call it the most deliberative body and mean it. Let's recognize the institutional quality. 
   It degrades us each time something such as this happens. 
   I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join today with Senator MOYNIHAN and many of our colleagues in introducing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 (BBRA-2000). 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made some justified changes in Medicare payment policy and contributed to our current budget surpluses. It also included important provisions to improve seniors' access to preventive benefits, and it created the Children's  Health Insurance Program. These are important accomplishments. 
   But some of the policies enacted in the BBA cut providers significantly more than expected. This has created severe problems for health care providers all over the country. Last year, we took steps to correct these problems. But we did not go far enough. 
   When I met with hospital administrators in South Dakota earlier this summer, one told me that since the cuts from the BBA were implemented, his hospital has been just barely breaking even. Usually, that alone would be cause for concern. But then other hospital administrators told me they were jealous, because they are far from breaking even. In my state, the operating margins for hospitals with 50 or fewer beds were a relatively healthy 2 percent before the BBA. Last year, these small hospitals--which are so vital to their communities--had negative margins of 6 percent. 
   Hospitals are not the only health care providers facing this problem. Home health agencies, nursing homes, hospices, and many other providers are all struggling to make ends meet in the face of deeper-than-expected cuts. 
   The package of payment adjustments that Senate Democrats are introducing today will provide a much-needed boost to these providers--totaling $80 billion over 10 years. This will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to the care that we have promised them. 
   The bill has many provisions, but I would like to highlight a few. 
   For hospitals, BBRA-2000 would restore the full inflation update. It would also improve payments for Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) and teaching hospitals, who provide essential care for some of the neediest patients. 
   Our bill repeals the 15 percent cut in home health, and delays adding medical supplies to the home health prospective payment system (PPS). These fixes are essential to an industry that has seen an unprecedented drop in spending. 
   For skilled nursing facilities we would restore the full inflation update, with an additional two percent increase in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. We would also delay therapy caps for two additional years so that beneficiaries do not face an arbitrary limit on the amount of care they can receive. 
   Although the cost of providing care at the end of life has risen dramatically, the base for hospice payments has not been changed since 1989. The bill restores the full inflation update for hospice providers, and provides a ten percent upward adjustment in hospice base rates. 
   We are committed to ensuring that appropriate payments are made to Medicare+Choice plans. BBRA-2000 increases the growth rate in payments to these plans and allows plans to move to a 50-50 national blend one year earlier. 
   The bill also improves payment for ambulance providers, medical equipment suppliers, and dialysis facilities, who all provide important services to Medicare beneficiaries. 
   We recognize the special circumstances of rural health care providers in our bill. The rural health provisions include increasing payments for small rural hospitals, rural home health agencies, and rural ambulance providers. 
   There are other steps we need to take to improve beneficiaries' access to care. The bill we are introducing today includes a package of refinements to Medicare that directly help beneficiaries. For example, the bill will build on provisions in the BBA to lower beneficiary copayments and expand preventive benefits in Medicare. 
   We also provide for increased access to health care through improvements to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. These include changes to the BBA, such as improving state processes for enrolling people who are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. We also make changes to the health-related provisions of immigration and welfare reform legislation that passed in 1996. For example, the bill would extend assistance to people who leave welfare for work. 
   Senate Democrats continue to believe that passage of an affordable, voluntary, meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit is of highest priority. This bill, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000, is the next step in ensuring that beneficiaries have access to the care they need. 
   I want to thank Senator MOYNIHAN and his staff for their hard work putting this bill together. They have spent the last two months listening to health care providers, beneficiaries, community leaders, and members of our caucus. Through that listening process they have drafted a bill that addresses the needs of the many communities that are struggling to deal with the impact of the Balanced Budget Act. 
   We know the problems providers are facing in health care. And we know how to fix many of them. The bill we are introducing today is a comprehensive plan to ensure the stability that health care providers need and that beneficiaries depend on. We must take this opportunity to act, before it is too late to save some of the providers who are so close to closing their doors.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since the House vote, virtually every news account of this trade agreement has called its passage by the Senate all but certain. After months of such predictions, some people might conclude that the votes we are about to cast are a mere formality. They are not. We are making history here. The votes we cast today will have consequences. Those consequences will affect our economic interests, and our national security interests, for decades to come. 
   In one sense, the question before us is simple: Should we grant China the same trading status as we grant nearly every other nation in the world? Behind that question, though, is a larger question. China is home to 1.2 billion people--one-fifth of the world's entire population. What kind of relationship do we want with China? Do we want a China in which American products can be distributed--and our beliefs can be disseminated? Or do we want a China that continues to erect barriers to American goods and American ideals? Which China is better for our future? That is the question at the heart of this debate. 
   Someone who knew something about China answered that question this way. ``Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates and threaten its neighbors.'' My friends, it was not President Clinton who said that. It was not Ambassador Barshefsky, or anyone from this Administration. Richard Nixon wrote that--in 1967. Five years later, of course, President Nixon made his historic journey to China, ending 20 years of stony silence between our two nations. 
   History has shown the wisdom of that journey. Six years after President Nixon visited, China opened its economy--at least in part--to the outside world. Since then, China's economy has been transformed--from a 100-percent state-owned economy to an economy in which the state accounts for less than one-third of China's output. Along with this economic change has come social and political change. China is now taking the first tentative steps toward democratic local elections. Private citizens are buying property. People are being given more freedom to choose their schools and careers. You can now find articles critical of the government in the Chinese press, and a wider selection of books in Chinese bookstores. Now, China is ready to open its door to the outside world even further. The question is: Are we going to walk through that door? 
   Several people deserve special thanks for helping us reach this point. First among them is the President. One reason our Nation's economy is so strong today is because this President understands the New Economy. He understand that, to win in the New Economy, we need to maintain our fiscal discipline, invest in our future competitiveness and open up new markets for the products Americans produce. Under his leadership, we have negotiated more than 300 trade agreements with other nations. Among those agreements, none is more significant than this agreement with China. And none holds more potential promise for our future. 
   I also want to acknowledge the President's team--particularly Charlene Barshefsky--for her extraordinary skill in negotiating this agreement. I also want to thank our colleagues in the House, SANDY LEVIN and DOUG BEREUTER, for their bipartisan efforts to further improve on the Administration's efforts. The Levin-Bereuter improvements--particularly the creation of the human rights commission--are thoughtful solutions to concerns some of my colleagues and I had about the original agreement. Representative LEVIN and I spoke frequently about those improvements during that process. I know I speak for many in this chamber when I say we appreciate the great care he took to make sure his improvements addressed our concerns, as well as the concerns of our House colleagues. 
   Here in this chamber, I want to thank Senator MOYNIHAN, our ranking member on the Finance Committee, for his tireless efforts to pass this agreement. His accomplishment is a fitting conclusion to an historic career. I also want to thank Senator BAUCUS, who is a real leader on trade issues; Chairman ROTH, for his bipartisan leadership and determination to pass this agreement; and of course the Majority Leader, for his cooperation and leadership as well. Finally, I want to thank my colleagues who voted against sending this agreement back to the House. Their decision to focus on our trade relationship with China and leave other important questions about that relationship for later was not an easy decision to make. But it was necessary. I thank them for making it. 
   We have heard many eloquent arguments for--and against--this bill. That's as it should be. Critical decisions require careful deliberation. No one who values the freedoms we enjoy as Americans can possibly condone what we have heard about human rights, workers' rights, and religious freedom in China. None of us approves of China's frequent hostility, in the past, to the rule of law. I certainly do not. I intend to vote for this agreement, however, not to reward China for its past, but to engage China and help it create a different future. 
   In the 22 years since it re-opened its doors to outside investors, China's economy has grown at a rate of 10 percent a year. Still, China remains--by Western standards--a largely poor and underdeveloped nation. Reformers there understand that the only way China can build a modern economy is by becoming a full and accountable member of the international trade community. In exchange for the right to join the World Trade Organization, they have therefore committed--in this agreement--to make a number of extraordinary and fundamental changes. 
   Under this bilateral agreement, China has agreed to cut tariffs on US exports drastically. Tariffs on agriculture products will be cut by more than half--from 31 percent to 14 percent Tariffs on industrial products will be cut by nearly two-thirds--from about 25 percent to 9 percent. And tariffs on American computers and other telecommunications products will be eliminated entirely. On our end, this agreement does not lower a single tariff or quota on Chinese goods exported to the U.S. Not one. 
   China has also agreed to lower or eliminate a number of non-tariff barriers that now make doing business in  China extremely difficult. Under this agreement, American businesses will be able--for the first time--to sell and distribute their own products in China. The Chinese government will no longer be the monolithic middle man in every business deal. In addition, American businesses will no longer be forced to include Chinese-made parts in products they sell in China. 
   To appreciate the magnitude of these concessions, you need to understand the hold the Chinese government now has on China's economy and--by extension--its citizens. Today in China, the state decides what products may be imported, and by whom. The state decides who may distribute and sell products in China. State-owned banks decide who gets capital to invest. For the more than half of China's workers who are still employed by state-owned enterprises, the state decides how much they earn, whether they are promoted, even where they live. 
   But the state's grip on its citizens' lives is starting to weaken and will weaken further with this agreement. Nicholas Lardy, a China scholar with the Brookings Institution, notes that ``the authoritarian basis of the Chinese regime is (already) ..... eroding.......'' By agreeing to let its citizens own their own businesses, and buy products and services directly from the outside world, the Chinese government is agreeing to further relax its authoritarian grip on its people. That is not just in the interests of Chinese reformers. It is in our interests as well. 
   None of us can know, with absolute certainty, the effect these new economic freedoms will have on China. But I had an experience a few years ago that makes me think there is reason to be hopeful. I was with two other Senators on a bipartisan trip to the republics of the Former Yugoslavia. We were there to assess what progress was being made under the Dayton peace agreement, and what help the republics might need to rebuild politically and economically. 
   One day, in Albania, I was talking to a man in his early 30's. As you know, until 1992, Albania was arguably the most closed society in the world. No one entered or left. And no new information was allowed in except what the government permitted. The man I talked with said that when he was a boy, if someone had a satellite dish, and they turned it to face the sea, to receive uncensored information from Italy, police would come and turn the dish around. That was for the first offense. If the police had to come a second time, they took you off to jail. 
   Then the communications revolution occurred--the explosion of e-mail and Internet. Suddenly, the government couldn't just pull the plug, or turn the satellite dish around. Suddenly, Albania was connected to the rest of the world. 
   Today, Albania is struggling to create a free society and a free economy. The man I spoke with told me he hopes the Albania of the future looks like America. 
   Today, fewer than 2.5 percent of China's people own personal computers. And fewer than 1 million Chinese have access to the Internet. By the end of this year, there will be 10 million Internet users in China. By the end of next year, it's expected there will be 20 million. 
   Recent attempts by China to police the Internet, and punish advocates of democratic reform, are troubling to all of us. They are also destined to fail. By eliminating all tariffs on information technology in China, liberalizing distribution, and allowing foreign investment in telecommunications services--the infrastructure of the Internet, this agreement will accelerate the telecommunications revolution in China. That is not just in the interest of Chinese reformers. It is in our interest as well. 
   Some have expressed concerns about whether China will honor the commitments it makes in this agreement, and whether this agreement is enforceable. 
   Their concerns are understandable. China has no history with the rule of law, as we know it. The important point is: by entering the WTO, China is agreeing--for the first time--to comply with the rules of the international trade community. It is agreeing to settle its trade disputes through the WTO, and to honor the WTO's decisions in those disputes. If it does not, it will face sanctions. 
   This is a fundamental change. In previous disputes with China--including our disagreements over intellectual property rights--we have had to fight alone. But there are 135 members in the WTO. Under this agreement, we will be able to work with those other nations, many of whom share our concerns. China's ability to pit its trading partners against each other will be greatly diminished. By agreeing to these terms, China is, in fact, agreeing to live by the rule of law. And while that agreement may be limited--for now--to trade issues, eventually it is likely to be extended to other areas as well--including human rights. 
   Rejecting this agreement, on the other hand, is likely to harm the cause of civil rights in China. Former President Jimmy Carter--one of the world's most respected human rights advocates--has said: ``There's no doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this issue in the Congress will be a serious setback and impediment for the democratization, freedom and human rights in China.'' 
   Respected Chinese democracy advocate Martin Lee agrees. In a letter to President Clinton, Lee wrote that this agreement ``represents the best long-term hope for China to become a member in good-standing in the international community.'' Should the agreement fail, he added, `` we fear that ..... any hope for political and legal reform process would also recede.'' Clearly, it is in the interest of Chinese reformers to prevent such a failure. But it is in our interest as well. 
   There is another reason this agreement is in our national interest, Mr. President. It will strengthen peace and stability throughout Asia--particularly in Taiwan. Why? Because the more China trades, the more it has to lose from war. Taiwan's newly elected President, President Chen, supports China's entry into the WTO. 
   By passing this agreement, we would put the United States Congress on record as saying: ``If China is admitted to the WTO, Taiwan must be permitted, too--without delay.'' China has already agreed, as part of this agreement, to accept that condition. 
   As I said, Mr. President, under this agreement, China is lowering its tariffs; we are not lowering ours. China is reducing or eliminating its non-tariff barriers; we are not. There is another way to evaluate the benefits of this agreement. That is by comparing China's WTO commitments to those of another huge, largely poor and under-developed nation: India. 
   India places a 40 percent tariff on US consumer goods. Under this agreement, China will lower its tariffs to 9 percent. India places a 30 percent tariff on agriculture products. Under this agreement, China will reduce its agriculture tariffs to an average of 14 percent. In addition, China will eliminate all agriculture subsidies to its farmers. That's something not even our closest ally, the European Union, has agreed to do. 
   Four years ago, Congress re-wrote the rules that had governed farming in this country for 60 years. Supporters of the new rules said at the time that America's farmers didn't need a safety net any more because they would make so much money selling their products to new markets around the world. But that isn't what happened. 
   Instead of prospering in this New Economy, over the last four years, family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the country have suffered through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Obviously, the lack of new market opportunities isn't the only reason Farm Country is hurting, Mr. President. But opening new markets for American farm products is a necessary part of the solution to the farm crisis. 
   It's time for this Congress to keep its commitment to family farmers and ranchers. It's time--at the very least--to provide access to the new markets we said would be available when the rules were re-written four years ago. The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association is right. ``We have everything to gain by approving PNTR with China, and nothing to lose.'' 
   One lesson we have learned from past experience is that trade agreements must be specific. That is why this agreement is painstakingly detailed. Every commitment China is making is clearly spelled out, in black and white. We also know from past experience that no trade agreement--not even one  with a nation as large as China--will solve all of our economic challenges. 
   Even if we pass this agreement, we will still have a responsibility to fix our federal farm policy--so family farmers and ranchers can get a fair price for their products. We will still have a responsibility to make sure all American workers can learn the new skills required by this New Economy. And we will also still have a responsibility to monitor how this agreement is enforced. 
   We have heard a great deal of concern during this debate--and rightly so--about how China limits the rights of its citizens to organize their fellow workers, or pray to their own God. Basic legal safeguards and due process in China are routinely ignored in the name of maintaining public order. News reports just before we started this debate told of Chinese being jailed because they practice their faith in ``non-official'' churches. Several key leaders of the China Democracy Party have been jailed because they advocated for democratic change. Workers rights are tightly restricted, and forced labor in prison facilities continues. 
   Let me be very clear: No one should confuse endorsement of this trade agreement with endorsement of these and other assaults against basic human rights. Such practices are abhorrent and deeply troubling to Americans, and to freedom-loving people everywhere. 
   As part of the Levin-Bereuter improvements, this agreement will create a high-level commission--modeled after the Helsinki Commission--that will monitor human rights in China and report annually to Congress. We have a responsibility to support that commission. 
   Finally, this agreement calls on Congress to help the Chinese people develop the institutions of a civil society that are needed to support fair and open trade. We have a responsibility to provide that assistance. 
   This is a good agreement. But it is not a panacea. And it is not self-enforcing. If we want it to work, we have to keep working at it. 
   In closing, there is another quote I would like to read from President Nixon. In a toast he made to China's leaders during his 1972 visit, he said, ``It is not our common beliefs that have brought us together here,'' he said, ``but our common interests and our common hopes, the interests that each of us has to maintain our independence and the security of our peoples, and the hope that each of us has to build a new world order in which nations and peoples with different systems and different values can live together in peace--respecting one another while disagreeing with one another, letting history, rather than the battlefield, be the judge of their individual ideas.'' 
   We have made progress toward that goal over these last 28 years. This agreement will enable us to build on that progress. It is in China's interest. It is in our interest. It is in the world's best interest that we pass it. I urge you to support it. 
   Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the weekend we were saddened to learn of the death of Murray Zweben. Murray was chosen by the late Floyd Riddick to be his assistant in the Parliamentarian's office in 1965. He followed ``Doc'' Riddick in that post and became the Senate Parliamentarian in 1975. He served in that capacity for 6 years and left in 1981. The Senate recognized his exemplary service in 1983 by elevating him to parliamentarian emeritus. After he left the Senate, Murray worked in private law practice and played as much tennis as his schedule would permit. Those of us who knew Murray and his extraordinary ability to fly through the New York Times crossword puzzle, in ink no less, will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Anne, and his children Suzanne, Lisa, Marc, John, and Harry.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate is passing S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. This legislation will provide counties dependent upon the federal timber program with critically-needed funding to support education, road-building and other county programs. 
   I want to commend Senator WYDEN in particular for his leadership and hard work on this legislation. He tirelessly engaged in months of discussions with our Republican counterparts, the administration and fellow Democrats to develop a bipartisan, compromise piece of legislation that will provide stability to timber-dependent counties for years to come. 
   Since early in the last century, counties with significant federal land-holdings have received 25 percent of the revenue earned from timber sales on those lands. Since federal lands cannot be taxed, these funds provide counties with a critical source of revenue to maintain schools and roads. 
   Over the past decade, it has become clear that counties can no longer depend upon these funds. In many areas, the timber program has declined or ceased altogether, reducing revenue that counties depend up to make ends meet. As a result, many counties have had to cut educational programs for children significantly. While counties in the Black Hills of South Dakota continue to receive adequate funding under existing laws, recent challenges to the timber program in South Dakota and elsewhere have made it clear that we must have a safety net for all timber-dependent counties. 
   No child's education should be dependent upon the federal timber program. S. 1608 severs that link by providing counties with the option of choosing a set payment based upon timber revenues they received in the past or continuing with the current formula. This choice will provide counties with the continuity and funding they need to provide a quality education for children in their schools. 
   I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some important provisions of this bill. Like any product of compromise, it is not perfect, and there are sections that I would like to see changed. Nonetheless, we cannot continue to sacrifice the education of schoolchildren while we debate this bill. We need to move forward. 
   First, 85 percent of the funds made available by this bill go directly to counties to fund roads and schools. These funds are generally equivalent, or greater to, the amount of funding that counties receive today. Additionally, it gives counties a choice of how to spend the remaining 15 percent. Remaining funds can either be used by counties to fund projects on federal lands, as described in Title II, or to fund county projects described in Title III such as search and rescue programs. If neither of these two options is chosen, the fund are returned to the Treasury. 
   While I am pleased that counties will have a choice of how to use the remaining 15 percent of funds, I have some reservations about the requirements on the use of Title III funds. Given the fact that these funds are used for programs normally carried out by counties, such as education and search and rescue operations, it would be preferable to leave these responsibilities in the hands of county commissioners who are elected to make these decisions. Therefore, if this issue is considered in the future, I hope that we can take another look at the process for approving Title III projects. 
   Once again, I'd like to commend Senator WYDEN, Senator CRAIG, Senator BAUCUS, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator BOXER and Senator TORRICELLI for their thoughtful consideration of this legislation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, earlier today the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, came to the floor to respond to an article that appeared in the newspaper, USA Today. I want to take just a moment to respond to the article, as well as to some of his comments. He responded, I think, as I would if I had read the article. It is entitled, ``Senate Democratic Leader Plans Stalling Tactics,'' and makes reference to the fact that we are running out of time at the end of the year and it claims to know that I have a simple strategy for winning the final negotiations over spending bills--and I am now reading from the article: ``Stall until the Republicans have to cave in because they can't wait any longer to recess,'' and noted there are a lot more vulnerable Republican Senators than there are Democratic Senators. 
   As often is the case--I don't blame this reporter, and I am not sure I know who the reporter is--I think that was taken from a comment that I made in my daily press conference, where I simply noted that those who were in the majority oftentimes are the ones who pay a higher price the longer we are in session, the closer we get to the election, noting that we have experienced that rude realization ourselves on at  least two occasions, in 1980 and 1994, and that the longer one goes into the campaign season while we are still in session, the more it requires that Senators remain present here in Washington and not available for the demands of a rigorous campaign. 
   That was all I said. I made no reference to our desire to stall anything. In fact, it is not. The reason I have come to the floor is to emphasize our strong hope that we do not see any stalling whatsoever; that we move on with the remaining appropriations bills. Eleven of them have yet to be signed into law. I note for the record that two have not even left subcommittee. The District of Columbia appropriations bill and the HUD-VA bill are still pending in the subcommittee. 
   We finished our work on the energy and water appropriations bill this week. It would be my hope that we could go to the only other pending appropriations bill on the calendar, which is the Commerce-State-Justice bill, next week. I do not know that is the intention of the majority leader, but clearly it is a bill that must be considered and completed at the earliest possible date. 
   Our hope is that as we work through these appropriations bills, we will have the opportunity to work through other pieces of unfinished business. We are hopeful we can make real progress, maybe as early as next week, on the minimum wage bill. Our hope is that we can finish our work next week on the legislation granting permanent normal trade relations to China. Our hope is that we can actually finish a Patients' Bill of Rights bill and maybe gun safety legislation. Our hope is that we can deal with the prescription drug benefit bill. There is an array of pieces of the unfinished agenda that we would love to be able to address--education issues having to do with reducing the number of students in every class, hiring teachers, afterschool programs, school construction. Those issues have to be addressed at some point. 
   Whether it is authorizing or appropriating, we remain ready and willing to work with our colleagues to accomplish as much as possible. I do not know whether or not it is conducive to that goal not to have votes on Fridays or Mondays. It seems to me, with all the work that remains, Senators should be here casting their votes and participating fully in debates that will be required ultimately if we are going to complete our work on time. 
   I come to the floor this afternoon only to clarify the record and ensure that if anybody has any doubt, let me address that doubt forthrightly. We want to finish our work. We want to work with our Republican colleagues. We have no desire to stall anything. Our hope is that we can finish on time and complete all 13 appropriations bills no later than the first of October. There is no need for a continuing resolution. We can complete our work in the next 3 weeks. That is our desire, and that certainly will be our intent as we make decisions with regard to what agreements we can reach on schedule, as well as on substance, in the coming days. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are about to vote on an amendment that is critical not only for an important region of our country, the upper Midwest, but really the whole country. How we decide the process by which we make critical decisions about the ecological and environmental balance that must be taken into account as we consider all of the challenges we face with regard to proper management is really what is at stake here. 
   The Missouri River is one of the most important rivers of the country, but this could apply to the Mississippi River and to any one of a number of rivers throughout the country. Ultimately, it will be applied. You could say this is a very important precedent. A process has been created, enacted by this Congress, that allows very careful consideration of all the different factors that must be applied as we make  decisions with regard to management of a river, of wetlands, of anything else. 
   Basically what this amendment does is simply say, let that process go forward, without making any conclusion about what ultimately that process will lead to. If we ultimately decide 
   that whatever process produced is wrong, we, as a Congress, have the opportunity to stop it. Why would we stop it midway? Why would we say today that we don't want that process to continue; we don't want it to reach its inevitable end with a product that we could look at for comment? That is the first point: a process is in place. The legislation currently within the energy and water bill stops that in its tracks. 
   I don't have it in front of me, but the report language makes it very clear. Senator BOND and others may argue that, no, this process can continue, but the effect of this amendment stops it in its tracks. We will not have an opportunity to carefully consider all of the recommendations given the language that is currently incorporated in the bill. We must not stop a process that allows us a result upon which we will then pass judgment. 
   The Missouri River is a very critical river. It is a multifaceted river that requires balance. The current management plan was written when the Presiding Officer and I, Senator BOND, and others were, at best, in our teens, if not in our early years of life. It was written in the 1950s and adopted in about 1960. It has been the plan for 40 years. 
   What the Corps of Engineers is now saying, what Fish and Wildlife is now saying is that after 40 years, prior to the time the dams were constructed, it is time to renew that manual; let's find another; let's take another look at it to determine whether or not what worked in the 1950s and 1960s is something that will work today. Their feeling is that it will not, that we need to upgrade it; we need to refresh it; we need to renew it. 
   Back when that manual was written, the anticipated amount of barge traffic was about 12 million tons. We never reached 12 million tons. We are down to about 1.5 million tons of barge traffic, totaling about $7 million. 
   We are spending $8 million in barge subsidies to support a $7 million industry. At the same time, we have an $85 million recreation industry. We have an incredible $667 billion hydropower industry. We have industries that are held captive, in large measure, because of a manual written in 1960 that anticipated barge traffic that never developed. 
   It is time to get real. It is time to allow the process to go forward. It is time to allow those agencies of the Federal Government, whose responsibility it is to manage this river, to do it without intervention. There will be plenty of time for us to take issue, to differ, to ultimately come to some other conclusion if that happens. But that is not now, especially given the recognition that the manual is out of date. The manual didn't produce the kind of result over four decades that was anticipated. Now it is time to change. That is all we are asking. 
   Let the process go forward. The President has said that unless this change is made, this bill will be vetoed. We are nearing the end of the session. If we want to guarantee that this is going to be wrapped up in an omnibus bill with absolutely no real opportunity for the Senate to have its voice heard, then the time to change it, so it can be signed, is now--not 4 weeks from now. I am very hopeful my colleagues will understand the importance of this question, the importance of this amendment. I am hopeful that, on a bipartisan basis, we can say let us allow the Corps, Fish and Wildlife, and the biological experts to do their work. Then let us look at that work and make our evaluation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some leader time. I understand I have 8 minutes remaining. My colleagues can vote any way they wish, based upon the facts as presented. Let nobody be misled. This has nothing to do with flooding--nothing. This doesn't apply when there is flooding or when there are droughts. That is written right into the language of this new master manual proposal. It has nothing to do with flooding. This has to do with barge traffic. That is what this is about. It is about barge traffic. 
   Now, the Senator from Missouri talks about the importance of competition. How much competition is there when you have three-tenths of 1 percent of all agricultural transportation related to barge traffic and 99 percent is rail and highway? Is that competition? My colleagues are appropriately trying to defend a dying industry in Missouri, and they are using flood concerns to protect them. This is not about floods. This is about protecting three-tenths of 1 percent of all transportation for agriculture in the entire region. That is what this is about. Nothing more and nothing less. 
   I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Montana.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know I have a couple of minutes remaining in leader time. Let me respond. I understand it is 5 minutes. I will not use all of it because I know we are about ready to go to a vote. 
   Let me just say that the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri knows what I know and what everyone should know prior to the time they are called upon to vote. 
   First of all, it is not a plan until it is adopted as a plan. But the Bond language would stop the plan from even going forward before we have had a chance to analyze what effect it would have on floods. But the proposal, which is all it is at this point, says we will exempt those years when there is a prospect for flooding. We will exempt the master manual from being utilized and implemented if a flood is imminent. We lop off the flooded years and the drought years. This plan is to be used only in those times when there is normal rain flow. That is really what we are talking about here. 
   But I go back to the point: Why stop this process from going forward before we know all the facts? Why stick our head in the sand before we really have the biological, ecological, and all of the managerial details? 
   That is what the language does. That isn't the way we ought to proceed. There will be time for us to oppose, if that may be the case. But not now, not halfway through the process. Let's allow this process to continue. 
   I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me say for the record, the majority leader has, as he has indicated, offered the lockbox legislation on two separate occasions. I might remind my colleagues that on both occasions he filed cloture immediately, denying the minority any opportunity to offer amendments. 
   I ask unanimous consent, and ask the majority leader's support, for an alternative approach which would be that we offer Medicare/Social Security lockbox amendments in addition to a prescription drug benefit amendment to be offered in the context of this lockbox. I make that request.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the majority leader again 
   to suggest, as I have on many occasions, that we can find a way, perhaps, to address this issue. We certainly have a lot of ideas. I do not want to preclude ideas articulated and offered by my colleagues. I would be more than happy to work  with him. As he has indicated, there is a good deal of interest on Social Security and Medicare lockboxes and perhaps we can find a procedural way to address them even in the short time that remains in this session.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the citizens of South Dakota are honoring the heroism of Herbert A. Littleton, a 20-year-old Marine Corps private who died while performing acts of gallantry that earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   Private First Class Littleton enlisted in Black Hawk, South Dakota, and served as a radio operator during the Korean War with the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, Company C, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced). This is the same Marine division that turned the course of the Korean War with its successful landing behind enemy lines at Inchon, Korea, 50 years ago this month. 
   Seven months after the Inchon landing, Private First Class Littleton's unit was in Chungchon, Korea. On the night of April 22, 1951, Private Littleton, a radio operator with an artillery forward observation team, was standing watch. Suddenly Company C's position came under attack from a well concealed and numerically superior enemy force. Private First Class Littleton quickly alerted his team and moved into position to begin calling down artillery fire on the hostile force. But as his comrades arrived to assist, an enemy hand grenade was thrown into their midst. Private First Class Littleton unhesitatingly hurled himself on the grenade, absorbing its full, shattering impact with his own body and saving the other members of his team from serious injury or death. 
   Following Private First Class Littleton's heroic death, the President of the United States awarded him our nation's highest military award for bravery. The official citation says: ``His indomitable valor in the face of almost certain death reflects the highest credit upon Pfc. Littleton and the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.'' 
   Mr. President, today Governor Bill Janklow dedicated a granite memorial to Private First Class Littleton in  Spearfish, South Dakota, near the town where this young man signed up to serve his country. This is a dignified and fitting tribute. But there is another memorial to Private First Class Littleton on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, where a small, impoverished colony has blossomed into the Republic of Korea: a peaceful, democratic society that ranks as one of the great economic success stories of the 20th Century. His sacrifice helped make all this possible. 
   With this statement before the United States Senate, I join in saluting Private First Class Littleton. As we conduct the nation's affairs in this chamber of the United States Capitol, we would do well to remember Private First Class Littleton. In our every deed, let the members of this body bear in mind the lesson of courage, honor, and personal sacrifice offered to us by a 20-year-old man fighting for his country in the darkness, far from home.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
   Mr. President, this issue really has a very fundamental premise. The issue is: Can we use the best information available to us to manage the Missouri River, to manage it in a way that recognizes the sensitive balance that exists today--environmentally, industrially, agriculturally, recreationally? Can we take the best information we have available to us and put together the best management plan recognizing that balance? That is the essence of the question before us. 
   My distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, has said: I don't want the Corps of Engineers to alter the manual that has been used now for more than 40 years. His view is that the manual that was written in the 1950s and adopted in approximately 1960 ought to be the manual that we use from here on out, and he wants to stop in its tracks any effort to consider whether or not the Missouri River management reflects today that sensitive balance. 
   I think it is wrong to say to the Corps of Engineers--to say to any Federal agency--we don't want you to look at the facts. We don't want you to look at the information. We don't want you to take into account that delicate balance. We want you to blindly follow whatever decisions you made in 1960--I might add, before even all the dams on the Missouri River were built--and we want you to follow that verbatim. 
   We can't afford to do that. The decisions that we make on the Missouri affect the decisions we make on the Mississippi and on virtually every other river in this country. For us to freeze in place whatever decisions may have been made decades ago, and say it must not change, is putting our head in the sand and, I must say, endangering the health and the very essence of the river for years, if not decades, to come. 
   It was in 1804 that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on their Corps of Discovery expedition to explore the Missouri River and search for a passage to the Pacific Ocean. 
   Stephen Ambrose wrote an extraordinary book, ``Undaunted Courage,'' that I just reread over the summer. I must say, I do not know that there is a better book about what they found and the splendor that they discovered having traversed the entire Missouri River. 
   Along this expedition, Lewis and Clark encountered a wild river, teeming with fish and wildlife, that rose every spring to carry the snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains and shrank back in the summer as part of the ancient and natural flow cycle. That is what the river did; that is what most rivers do. 
   Since that historic trip, we have constructed six major dams and we have forever changed the flow and the character of that river. The last earthen dam was completed during the administration of John F. Kennedy. To manage the dams, the Corps produced, in 1960, as I noted a moment ago, a management plan, that we call the master manual. That manual caters primarily  to barge traffic on the Missouri River at the expense, virtually, of everything else, at the expense of fish and wildlife, at the expense of agriculture, at the expense of recreation, at the expense of ecological considerations, at the expense of the environment, at the expense of people virtually north of the State of Missouri. 
   What is amazing to me is that we do this with the recognition that the barge industry today is minuscule, valued at $7 million--that is million with an ``m''--and it transports less than 1 percent of all agricultural goods transported in the upper Midwest. Talk about the tail wagging the dog. This is the tip of the tail wagging the tail and the dog. The legs, the head, you name it, it is all wagging because of the tip of the tail. 
   These charts reflect the current circumstances on the river. This is the barge traffic that was first projected. They thought, when they wrote the master manual, that about 12 million tons of traffic would be carried by barge on the river on an annual basis. That was the estimate when the manual was written in 1960. I was about 10 years old, I suppose, when that manual was written. The Corps, of course, did the best they could projecting what they thought would be the level of traffic, 12 million tons. But as oftentimes is the case, they made a mistake. It wasn't 12 million tons. By 1977, it was only 3 million tons. And guess what. Current traffic is not 12, it is not 3, it is 1.5. That is all the traffic there is, 1.5 million tons, representing three-tenths of 1 percent of all agricultural traffic. 
   What is really amazing--as I said a moment ago, is that this is a classic example of the tip of the tail wagging the rest of the tail and all of the dog. Look who has sacrificed. Navigation provides roughly $7 million in benefits annually, compared to $85 million in recreational benefits. It compares to $415 million in flood control, $542 million in water supply projects and priorities of all kinds, and $677 million, two-thirds of $1 trillion, in hydropower. Yet we have written a manual, incredibly, that says we are going to let this minuscule $7 million industry dictate what is best for the 85, the 415, the 542, and the $677 million. Figure that out. Who in his right mind would say that somehow we ought to let that minuscule amount dictate what is best. Forget the ecological and environmental factors for a moment. 
   I go back to my original point. Barge traffic today is three-tenths of 1 percent. If I had not magnified this slice, you couldn't even find it in this pie. Roughly 99.7 percent of all agriculture produced in the Upper Midwest doesn't go by barge. How does it go? It goes the way the rest of the country. It goes by rail and by truck. So why would we threaten to throw even more out of kilter the ecological priorities of the river by putting barge traffic first? Why would we endanger hydropower, water supply, flood control, and recreation? I cannot answer that question. 
   But that is not even the question we are facing tonight. There are those on the other side who have said: We don't care what factors are out there. We don't care what percentage is barge traffic. We will not even let the Corps consider, even think about the possibility of changing the master manual, regardless of the facts. Don't confuse us with the facts. We are going to protect the barge industry, and it does not matter what the costs are. 
   We will have to face extraordinarily problematic ramifications of this provision for all of these other very critical priorities, including the ecology of the river. Three endangered species are headed towards extinction: the piping plover, the least interior tern, and the pallid sturgeon. Two fish species are candidates for listing on the endangered species list. But that isn't the only thing this fight is about. What this fight is all about is whether or not we can recognize the delicate balance that exists today. 
   This fight is not about endangered species. This fight is about an endangered river. This fight is about whether or not the health of the Missouri can be secured. That is what this fight is about. This fight is about restoring balance to management of the river. We will never go back to the days of Lewis and Clark, the pre-dam period. That will never happen. But there are things we can do through good management that will give us the opportunity to make the river as vibrant as it can be. But we cannot do it if the current provision in this bill stays intact and becomes law. 
   Recognizing that, the question is whether or not we will let the Corps be the Corps, whether or not we will allow the Corps to go through the legal process involved in evaluating what is best for the river and change the management plan to reflect a more fair balance. 
   That is all we are asking. Let us come up with a plan that allows us in the most complete way to analyze what is happening to the river, what is best for the river, what can be done in Montana and the Dakotas and Iowa and Missouri and all the way up and down the Missouri River to ensure that the health and vitality of that river can be sustained and even improved upon. That is what the Corps is trying to do. 
   What the Corps is simply trying to do is to say, look, we can do a better job than we did in the 1950s and 1960s in managing this river. We can reflect the new balance, and the recognition must be made that things have changed dramatically since the fifties and sixties. We need to reflect that change in the master manual itself. 
   Here is the process; the process is pretty simple. A preliminary draft of the EIS, environmental impact statement, was completed all the way back in 1998. Following that, there was a coordination and public comment period that lasted through January of 1999. That period allowed tribal and public officials to respond to the preliminary revised draft of the environmental statement. Then we went on to the fish and wildlife consultation and biological opinion phase, which some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to stop just recently. They wanted to kill that, to move it so we would not have the opportunity to consider very carefully what the scientists and biological experts have said about the quality of life on the Missouri today. They wanted to kill it. 
   Thanks to the Director of the Corps, Joe Westphal, and others, we are now in a position to at least hear what the scientists have had to say, and we will have that report by November 1. Following that, there will be a revised draft of the environmental impact statement. They will take into account all of the comments made by those who are concerned on all sides. They will take into account this coordination and what comments public officials have made, in particular. They will then take into account fish and wildlife and biological opinions. 
   When all of that has been gathered, we will then revise the draft and make available to the public a draft for additional comment for 6 months. We then see the final environmental impact statement after a 6-month tribal and public comment period. Washington will then review all of those comments. A record of decision will be made and the revise of the master manual will then be implemented. Those are all the steps. 
   This is like a court of law. This is like any other legal process. There are a number of very important steps that we apply in all cases--in all cases where difficult decisions involving critical public policy have to be made. We make these steps for a reason. We want public comment. We want scientific input, the best decisions from governmental leaders at all levels. We want to do that with the full involvement in a democracy of everyone who cares and everyone who has some responsibility. 
   But here is what happens. Under the provision currently in the bill, there is a big red stop sign on this process. It says: You are not going to do any of this. We are going to stop you in your tracks. We are not going to let you go through that process. We are not going to allow public comment and the array of other opportunities for public involvement. We are not going to have that process. It is over. That is what this amendment says; that is what the provision in the bill says. 
   So I have to say it is extraordinarily damaging to the river to have this attitude. It is such an important issue involving so many priorities--environmental, ecological, industrial, recreational, agricultural--because it is endangering the interests of our country in such a profound way on this river. This administration has said, without equivocation, it will be vetoed if this provision is still in the bill. That is how strongly the administration  feels about it. It will be vetoed. So we can play this game as long as our colleagues wish to do so. But let's make one thing clear. This will not become law. This will not become law because it is just too important. 
   I don't fully appreciate the reasons my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are opposed to even allowing the process to go forward, given what I have said is this multistep opportunity for careful consideration of all the options. But it goes down to, 
   as I said in the beginning, a need on the part of some to protect this minuscule barge industry regardless of all of its ramifications on everything and everybody else. 
   But as I understand it, there are those on the other side who are opposed because they understand that what has happened is that there has been some effort to find this new balance. This new balance is a recognition of all of the different factors that need to be calculated, in part, through the Fish and Wildlife Service and, in part, through the Corps of Engineers and, in part, through States' direct involvement. 
   What has been proposed is that the Corps slightly revise its master manual to increase spring flows, known as a ``spring rise,'' once every 3 years--not every year, but once every 3 years they would increase the spring rise in an effort to attempt to bring back a natural flow, a natural rejuvenation of the river as we have understood it prior to the time the dams were built. They would reduce summer flows, known as a ``split season,'' every year. 
   The spring rise and the split season roughly mimic the natural flow of the river, which increase in the spring due to snowmelt and sharply decline in the summer, beginning around July 1. It is as Lewis and Clark found it. We can't go back to Lewis and Clark. Nobody is suggesting that. What we are attempting to do, however, is to show once again that there is this balance, this need to recognize that if we are going to keep the river healthy, we have to allow it to do what it once did, prior to the time the dams were built. This is the flow pattern under which native species developed, which is absolutely critical to their very survival--not just the three endangered species, but all species on the river. 
   The spring rise is needed to scour sandbars clean of vegetation so they can be used by endangered birds for nesting habitat. 
   The spring rise also signals native fish species that it is time to spawn. This is the green light. They see these spring rises, and that triggers to the species that they can spawn. When they don't have that spring rise, the whole natural cycle is put out of whack. That is what has been happening year after year and decade after decade. 
   The low summer flows, or split season, exposes the sandbars during the critical nesting time, so that the birds have sufficient room to nest and so that the nests don't get flooded. To prevent any potential downstream flooding, the Corps, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others, have already thought about addressing the concern of some downstream who are understandably concerned about flooding. They would simply eliminate this plan from implementation during the 10 percent highest flow years--eliminate it; it would not happen. Changes would not be implemented during the 25 percent lowest flow ``drought'' years. 
   So this plan would not harm Mississippi River navigation. We have already conceded that. This is the balance. This is an effort to try to find middle ground. We are going to say we will lop off the top 10 percent and the top 25 percent; we will deal with those normal years in the middle. Once consultation between the Corps and Fish and Wildlife Service is completed, the Corps then still will take into account other suggestions made during the public comment period. 
   There are so many beneficiaries of this plan. Naturally, the river itself is the biggest beneficiary. 
   The river itself--not species on the river, not those living along the river, not the States upstream, but the river--will be the prime beneficiary of this effort. Why? For the reasons I have just stated--because we want to find a way to bring balance back into the management. We want to find middle ground in an effort to recognize all uses on the river. 
   Downstream farmers will benefit from better drainage from fields during the summertime. That is a given. The public will have greater opportunities to recreate up and down the river. Even the Mississippi barge industry will benefit from the changes that are being called on for the Missouri River. 
   I wish to take a few minutes to talk briefly about each of those benefits. 
   First, with regard to the river itself, the combination of the spring rise and flood season will help restore the health of the river and recover from the dangerous imbalance that we have with regard to all species on the river today. 
   According to the Fish and Wildlife Service's draft opinion and the Corps of Engineers' revised draft environmental impact statement of 1998, high spring flows will signal native fish species to spawn, flush detrital food into the river, inundate side channels for young fish habitat, and build up the sandbars in the river channel for the tern and plover nesting habitat, and provide a greater area for the endangered birds to nest, as well as for all birds. 
   The 600-page draft of the Fish and Wildlife Service opinion is based on hundreds of published peer review studies. The opinion itself was a peer review by a panel of experts who supported all of those conclusions. 
   The fact is that whether or not we give the Missouri River the chance to survive, to flourish, to be healthy again depends in large measure on whether or not we as Senators will allow the Corps, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and all affected governmental authorities to recognize the importance of proper balance; to recognize that what we decided to do in 1960 does not now apply and should not be used to manage the river in the next century; to recognize that if we are going to take all of the economic and environmental concerns and put them in proper balance, we have to revise the manual. To say that the Corps will be prohibited from doing so is just bad, bad policy. 
   We recognize that maybe the barge industry on the Missouri--not the Mississippi barge industry--will be hurt by this. But we recognize that this minuscule three-tenths of 1 percent should not dictate all of the other uses of this river, or any river. We shouldn't let the tip of the tail wag the tail and the dog. But that is what is happening today. That is what this legislation would do. That is why it is so important that we strike it when we have the vote. That is why I feel so strongly about this issue. 
   There is one other factor as we look at the barge industry itself that is perplexing. Barge benefits on the river economically are about $7 million. The subsidies to the barge industry last year exceeded the total benefits of the industry itself. There is $8 million in subsidies to the barge industry even recognizing that the industry generated $7 million in benefits. Not only do we have managerial concerns, not only do we have concerns reflecting the life and health of one of the most important rivers in the United States of America, we ought to have taxpayer concerns. Why in Heaven's name are we subsidizing a $7 million barge industry with an $8 million subsidy? That one I don't understand. But that is why we are having this debate. 
   I am very appreciative of the leadership shown by the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. BAUCUS, who has been the preeminent environmentalist and environmental leader, as ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I am grateful for his presence on the floor, as well as my colleague from South Dakota, Senator JOHNSON, who has been an extraordinary advocate of the effort that we have made now for several months to ensure that the Missouri River has the future that it deserves. 
   I yield the floor. I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I haven't had the opportunity yet today to welcome all of our colleagues back and to express my hope that we use this next period as productively and as successfully as we can. 
   As have most of my colleagues, I had the opportunity to spend a good deal of time at home in South Dakota for the last 3 weeks. 
   I especially want to commend the Forest Service for the extraordinary job they have done in fighting historically the most consequential fire we have had in the State now, with 85,000 acres of timberland burned. I am grateful for the response we have had from people all over the country. I especially thank the Forest Service, the Governor of the State of South Dakota, William Janklow, for the remarkable job he has done, the National Guard for their response, and the volunteer fire departments from all over the State of South Dakota and surrounding region. 
   We are grateful for their extraordinary response, and we are grateful as well for the effort that has been made to contain the fire which is now 85-percent contained. 
   I thank the volunteer ambulance personnel whom I met from all over the State. We are experiencing what many of our colleagues are experiencing with volunteer ambulance service. Many of them are on the verge of going out of business because of reimbursement schedules for Medicare and Medicaid. Without those, especially in rural areas, we are in a very serious set of circumstances involving the health and in many cases the lives of people who live in rural areas today. 
   I thank those in schools all over South Dakota who opened their doors and their offices to me in Kadoka, White River, Lemmon, and most of our Indian reservations in Belle Fourche. I thank them. 
   I thank those who especially were willing to meet with me on hospital reimbursement and appreciate very much their willingness to talk about how serious the circumstances were with regard to Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and clinics throughout our State. 
   I must say, at virtually every one of our stops we had occasion to talk about the unfinished agenda here in the Senate. I want to talk just briefly about that prior to the time we turn to another important piece of legislation, the energy and water bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is great concern about unattended legislation, legislation having to do with health care, education, meaningful gun safety, and minimum wage. There is no legitimate reason we could not have accomplished something on each of the issues I have mentioned and many more. 
   There is no legitimate reason this Congress couldn't have passed a real Patients' Bill of Rights long before this. 
   There is no good reason we couldn't have added a voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit. 
   There is no reason we couldn't have agreed by now to strengthen our children's schools. We have had many opportunities. There are those who say that passing bills is hard work. 
   If you want to see real hard work, go to Murdo, South Dakota some day. Talk to Cathy Cheney and the five other members of her volunteer ambulance squad. 
   They are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. When a call comes in--even if it's in the middle of the night--they drop whatever they're doing, leave their jobs and families, and go. Most times, they are not back for at least 3 hours. 
   When they're not answering calls, they're studying for certification tests. And they don't get paid a dime for any of it. That is hard work, Mr. President. And it is not just South Dakotans who face challenges like this. 
   Go to any community in any state in America, and you'll find people who are working hard--some of them are working two and three jobs--to make a decent life for themselves and their families, and to give something back to their communities.  
   You will find older people who worked hard for 40 and 50 years, who are retired now. They are not asking us to do the impossible. 
   They are not asking us to make unreasonable concessions. 
   All they are asking is that we make a good-faith effort to solve the problems these families are dealing with today and who face the challenging months and years when they must examine, address, and answer problems in their own lives. 
   When the 106th Congress began, many of us had great hopes about what we could accomplish. 
   We had had budget surpluses 2 years in a row and were on our way to a third year--something that hadn't happened in 50 years. The economy was setting record after record. 
   After years of having to downsize our dreams because of the deficit, Americans were finally in a position to start hoping again, and tackling some of the big challenges facing working families. 
   Nearly 2 years later, almost none of those hopes has been met. 
   As we near the end of this Congress, it appears increasingly likely that they will not be met. One reason for that is, frankly, our less than ambitious legislative schedule. If we adjourn, as planned, on October 6, the Senate will have been in session for a total of just 115 days this year. That is 115 out of 365. 
   By any objective measure, that is not exactly breaking a sweat. In fact, it is the lightest Senate schedule since 1956. It is only 2 days more than the infamous do-nothing Congress of 1948. But the calendar is not the only reason we have achieved so little. 
   A more significant, and troubling, reason for this Congress' inaction has been the absolute refusal by Republican leaders in both houses to pass the people's agenda. 
   For 2 years, majority leaders in both houses have used their numerical advantage, and every parliamentary trick they could find, to prevent us from passing a real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Despite the fact that there is an overwhelming majority in the Congress and an overwhelming majority of the American people who want campaign finance reform, Republican leaders in both Houses have prevented us from passing the McCain-Feingold bill. 
   Despite pleas from the victims of the Columbine tragedy and more than a million moms who came to Washington to petition Congress, Republican leaders have repeatedly refused to pass reasonable gun safety measures. 
   They oppose our plan for affordable prescription drug coverage. They oppose our plan to strengthen our children's schools by making classes smaller and schools safer and setting higher standards. 
   For 2 years, they even opposed raising the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years. Now some of our Republican colleagues in the other body say they might be willing to do this but only if we include tens of billions of dollars worth of tax cuts for the wealthiest in the country. Why can't we just do the right thing? Why can't we just raise the minimum wage $1 an hour over 2 years without having to spend tens of billions of dollars on new tax breaks for people who need them the least? 
   Instead of working to pass a people's agenda, our Republican colleagues have spent most of the last 2 years pursuing one goal: Cutting taxes the wrong way, creating huge new tax breaks at the expense of everything and everyone else. 
   This week we will lose more time and more opportunities because they insist on trying to override the President's vetoes on their so-called marriage penalty and estate tax bills. Never mind that 60 percent of the cost of their marriage penalty has nothing to do with fixing the marriage penalty. Never mind their estate tax bill benefits only the wealthiest 2 percent of estates. Never mind that neither bill will help middle-class families. In fact, they will hurt ordinary Americans by eating up the expected surplus, money we need for other things. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle clearly think their tax cuts are good politics. They just hope the American people accept their spin and don't check the facts. 
   Despite the history of this Congress, my colleagues and I have not given up hope for its future. Five weeks is not a lot of time, but it is enough time. Even given the time we must spend on appropriations bills and the China trade legislation, there is still enough time for this Congress to solve some of the problems real people talk about and worry about outside of Washington. 
   In 1948, Republicans held their Presidential nominating convention in Philadelphia. At that convention they endorsed a platform filled with all kinds of measures a Republican Congress had spent the previous 2 years blocking. Back then there was no September session of Congress. It went from the convention to the campaign trail. President Truman was so amazed by what he heard in Philadelphia, he ordered Congress back for a special session. He told Members: There is still time before the election. If you really believe what you say, pass your platform and I will sign it. 
   Last month, our Republican friends held another nominating convention in Philadelphia, the first time they have been back since 1948. Once again, they claim to support all kinds of things Republicans in this Congress have spent the last 2 years fighting. We have a request for our friends across the aisle, right now, tonight. There are still 5 weeks left in this Congress. Let's use this time to do the things you said in Philadelphia you support. Let's pass a responsible budget that pays down the debt, protects Social Security and Medicare, and invests in America's future. Let's cut taxes for working families. Let's strengthen our children's schools and protect our children from gun violence. Let's raise the minimum wage $1 an hour over 2 years. Let's finally pass a prescription drug benefit and a real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We were pleased by what we heard in Philadelphia about prescription drugs and a Patients' Bill of Rights. We are more pleased with the commercial running in Rhode Island. That commercial, paid for by the Republican Senate Committee, praised Senator CHAFEE for.  
   ..... voting against his own party and for a real Patients' Bill of Rights ..... and a prescription-drug benefit that gives seniors the drugs they need at a price they can afford.  
   Both of those plans referred to in that ad are our plans. We intend to give our colleagues a chance to make that record match the rhetoric before this Congress ends. We will start by offering the bipartisan Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights the first chance we get. There is no reason the American people should have to wait until next Congress for a real Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time to stop stalling. It is time for an up-or-down vote in this Senate on the Dingell-Norwood Patients' Bill of Rights bill. We also intend to give our colleagues the chance to support a voluntary affordable prescription drug benefit. If they really believe in these things, they will have the opportunity to work with this side to pass them. Let's schedule the vote. We will support them, and the President will sign them. 
   We spend far too much time in this Congress talking about 
   things that don't matter for working families and avoiding the problems that do matter. The progress we had hoped to make at the beginning of this Congress is still within our reach. Let's not waste another day. Let's work hard in these next 5 weeks on the issues I have mentioned, into the night and through the weekends if we have to. Let's not give up until we have honestly said we have done what the American people sent us here to do. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for announcing this arrangement. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation on this complicated but very understandable schedule. The majority leader has announced there will not be any cloture  motions filed or any rush to judgment on this issue. People will have the opportunity to offer amendments. I will work with our colleagues to assure they have that opportunity throughout the week, for whatever length of time it may take. I do hope perhaps we might be able to reach some agreement on time for these amendments, and my colleagues have assured me they are not averse to considering a time factor as we consider the order of these amendments. 
   As I understand it, that would then accommodate the opportunity for us to vote this afternoon. I would be interested if the majority leader could comment on when that vote might take place.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this week my friend and colleague, Senator BOND, came to the floor to explain why he is seeking to stop much needed changes in the operation of the dams on the Missouri River which is so important to the culture and economy not only in my State but so many others. 
   For the past 10 years, the Army Corps of Engineers has been working to update the decades-old management policies for the Missouri River. That effort, conducted by scientists and professional river managers, is approaching fruition. This year the Fish and Wildlife Service has told the Corps that changes need to take place to restore this magnificent river to biological health and so that we may prevent the extinction of three endangered species. By doing so, we will not only bring environmental benefits to the river but also enhance the recreational use of the river, both upstream and, I might emphasize, downstream. Bringing about these needed management changes will mean the environment, public relations, and health of the river will all be winners. 
   But now my colleague from Missouri has inserted a rider, an anti-environmental measure, in the energy and water bill that would stop the Corps from changing the management of the river. I understand why my colleague from Missouri has done this. He is trying to protect the interests of the State. However, in the process, he would sacrifice a much larger upstream fish, wildlife, and recreation industry. I simply cannot let that go uncontested. Hence, we have been embroiled for now several days in a disagreement that I had hoped could be resolved. 
   Six major dams have been constructed on the Missouri River which have forever changed its flow and character. 
   Since the last earthen dam was built in the early 1960's, we have witnessed the decline of fish and wildlife along the river. 
   This has resulted largely from the management policies that were developed in 1960 for operating the dams, and which favor the tiny $7 million downstream barge industry. These policies are established in what is known as the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual, often called the ``Master Manual.'' 
   It has been four decades since the Master Manual was significantly updated. 
   Therein lies the problem. The existing Master Manual, which is grounded in principles relevant to conditions in the 1960's, favors the barge industry, which prefers constant, level flows throughout the spring, summer, and fall. 
   But times and conditions have changed over 40 years. That is why the Master Manual is being revised. 
   Over the years, outdated management policies have caused fish species to decline, as the natural high spring flows that signal fish species to spawn have disappeared. They have led to the endangerment of bird species that rely on exposed sandbars to nest in the summertime. The corps often submerges those critical sandbars in its effort to provide sufficient flows for the barges. 
   That is why both the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agree that the Master Manual must be revised to manage the flow of the river in a much more natural way. High spring flows, known as the ``spring rise'' need to be restored. 
   At the same time, the summer flows must be reduced to allow the endangered terns and plovers to nest. This is known as the ``split season.'' 
   In combination with the spring rise, the split season and the spring rise will help to restore the health of the river and recover these endangered species. 
   In addition to the serious environmental problems and cause by the current Master Manual, current management policies also harm public recreation. In times of drought, Missouri River reservoirs of the Dakotas and Montana drop as low that boat ramps are left high and dry, and a $90 million per year recreation industry is sacrified for a $67 million per year barge industry. 
   The split season and spring rise will ensure that more water remains in the reservoirs in the summer, providing greater recreational opportunities for the public. 
   This Master Manual revision process has been underway since 1990, following a 1989 lawsuit the corps of the State of South Dakota. Again that has been a science-driver process, not a political one. 
   No one who has followed this issue will be surprised by the recommendation of the Fish and Wildlife service, or can argue this is issue has not been studied evaluated thoroughly. Once the consultation between the corps and the Fish and Wildlife Service is completed this year, the Corps will produce a revised draft environmental impact statement (EIS) and provide the public with 6 months to comment on it. 
   At the end of that stage, the corps will provide a final EIS. That document will be reviewed by Corps staff in Washington, DC, a record of decision will be issued, and the Master Manual will be revised. 
   That is the process set out of Federal law. 
   The question before the Senate on the Energy and Water Appropriations bill is whether we are going to cut off that Master manual revision process with this rider because some don't like the answers the process is revealing. If we do so, we will allow the river to continue its slow decline that inevitably will lead to the extinction of these and perhaps other species. 
   Some have stated that this rider has been included in past appropriations bills, and therefore we should continue to include it in the FY2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. 
   But members should know that this rider was irrelevant in past years, because the corps was not close to revising the Master Manual and because the corps had not engaged in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine what management changes are necessary to protect endangered species. 
   Since no changes to the Master Manual were planned in past years, the effect of the rider was at most symbolic, reflecting the opposition of some along the river to changing the status quo. 
   This year, for the first time, the debate over this rider has meaning. 
   This year, the corps finally has reached the point in the process where it is consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service and is learning officially that it must implement a spring rise and split season to avoid driving these endangered species to extinction. 
   This year, the corps finally has a schedule to complete the process of revising the manual in the foreseeable future. 
   Having learned without question that certain management changes need to take place to restore the health of the river, Congress must decide whether to override the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and condemn the fish and wildlife of the river to a slow death, or to face the truth and give the river new life. 
   The answer is clear. The Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Service should be allowed to continue to work together under the very Federal laws and processes that Congress has enacted, so that the corps can revise this outdated Master Manual and improve the management and health of the Missouri River. 
   This is a job for the technical experts of those agencies to complete, in compliance with established procedures, and including an opportunity for substantial public comment and input. Congress should not substitute its political judgment for this process and thereby condemn this once-magnificent river to a slow death. 
   It is my hope that my colleagues will allow the established process to move forward, let the public have its say, and take the steps that we know are necessary to recover this once-impressive and biologically-fertile river. This anti environmental rider must be removed. 
   Mr. President, I have now been given assurances by the White House that the President will veto this bill if this rider is included. Given that assurance and given the importance of protecting the integrity of the established process for improving the management of the Missouri River, I have agreed to allow this legislation to move forward, which is why we had the vote this afternoon. I will continue to work with my friend, the Senator from Missouri, and I will continue to appreciate the assurances I have been given by the White House that they will veto this legislation were it to come to their desk with the President's knowledge that this legislation includes the rider. I will certainly work to assure that we can sustain the veto when it comes back. That is essential. It is important to not only South Dakota and North Dakota, the upper regions of the Missouri River, but it is important to our country.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made some positive changes and contributed to our current $2.2 trillion on-budget surplus. 
   Some of the BBA policies, however, cut providers and services far more consequentially than was ever anticipated, and that has created extraordinary problems for health care providers all over the country. 
   I have been hearing from providers in South Dakota about the burdens that BBA created now for almost 3 years. 
   Just this week, community leaders in Sturgis, SD, have been meeting to decide the fate of an important clinic we have there. The administrators in Sturgis say the cuts we made in 1997 mean that they have been losing money every year. We may actually see the clinic close as a result. That clinic is not alone. There are clinics, there are hospitals, there are providers throughout my State and throughout the country who are facing the same fiscal demise if something is not done. And their demise spells problems for the people who depend on them for care. 
   Last year, we made the first step. Thanks to a united Democratic effort, we put forth a bill largely endorsed by our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and passed the first installment of relief from the BBA. It was an effort to try to stave off further closings and financial harm to critical community health care facilities. We didn't go far enough. Communities are still struggling in spite of our best effort last year. 
   Senate Democrats believe that we cannot ignore the crisis this year either. We need to act to ensure that beneficiary access to quality health care remains, regardless of circumstances, regardless of geography, regardless of whether we are talking about a rural area or an inner city. 
   I want to thank Senator PATRICK MOYNIHAN, our ranking member, Senator Max BAUCUS, and so many other members of the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Finance Committee for their leadership in developing the response to this crisis that we will be introducing shortly upon our return. 
   The Senate Democrats, under their leadership, are now proposing a package of payment adjustments and other improvements to beneficiary access that total $80 billion over 10 years. 
   This $80 billion will be used to help stabilize hospitals, home health agencies, hospices, nursing homes, clinics, Medicare+Choice plans, and other providers. 
   Our plan pays special attention to rural providers, which serve a larger proportion of Medicare beneficiaries and are more adversely impacted by reductions in the Medicare payment. 
   It includes targeted relief for teaching hospitals that train our health providers and conduct cutting-edge research. 
   And it includes improvements to Medicaid that could mean significantly improved access to health care for a number of uninsured people. 
   The proposal also includes improvements that directly help beneficiaries. 
   Senate Democrats continue to believe that passage of an affordable, voluntary, meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit is of highest priority. 
   We will continue to press for passage of a prescription drug benefit in September as we fight for the important provisions in this proposal.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our tribal colleges and universities have come to play a critically important role in educating Native Americans across the country. For more than 30 years, these institutions have proven instrumental in providing a quality education for those who had previously been failed by our mainstream educational system. Before the tribal college movement began, only six or seven out of 100 Native American students attended college. Of those few, only one or two would graduate with a degree. Since these institutions have curricula that is culturally relevant and is often focused on a tribe's particular philosophy, culture, language and economic needs, they have a high success rate in educating Native American people. As a result, I am happy to say that tribal college enrollment has increased 62 percent over the last six years. 
   The results of a tribal college education are impressive. Recent studies show that 91 percent of 1998 tribal college and university graduates are working or pursuing additional education one year after graduating. Over the last ten years, the unemployment rate of recently polled tribal college graduates was 15 percent, compared to 55 percent on many reservations overall. 
   While tribal colleges and universities have been highly successful in helping Native Americans obtain a higher education, many challenges remain to ensure the future success of these institutions. These schools rely heavily on federal resources to provide educational opportunities for all students. As a result, I strongly support efforts to provide additional funding to these colleges through the Interior, Agriculture and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bills. 
   In addition to resource constraints, administrators have expressed a particular frustration over the difficulty they experience in attracting qualified individuals to teach at tribal colleges. Geographic isolation and low faculty salaries have made recruitment and retention particularly difficult for many of these schools. This problem is increasing as enrollment rises. 
   That is why I am introducing the Tribal College or University Loan Forgiveness Act. This legislation will provide loan forgiveness to individuals who commit to teach for up to five years in one of the 32 tribal colleges nationwide. Individuals who have Perkins, Direct, or Guaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to $15,000 in loan forgiveness. This program will provide these schools extra help in attracting qualified teachers, and thus help ensure that deserving students receive a high quality education. 
   This measure will benefit individual students and their communities. By providing greater opportunities for Native American students to develop skills and expertise, this bill will spur economic growth and help bring prosperity and self-sufficiency to communities that desperately need it. Native Americans and the tribal college system deserve nothing less. I believe our responsibility was probably best summed up by one of my state's greatest leaders, Sitting Bull. He once said, ``Let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our children.'' 
   I am pleased that Senators BINGAMAN, CONRAD, BAUCUS, KERREY, KOHL, AKAKA, JOHNSON, REID, KENNEDY, and DODD are original cosponsors of this bill, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me respond to the distinguished majority leader. I thank my colleague, as I always must, the assistant Democratic leader, for being on the floor. I was not aware that a unanimous consent request was going to be propounded. I was downstairs. I am disappointed I was not able to be here at the time. 
   Let me very succinctly explain the circumstances. In the past, there has not been any real concern about revising the master manual. The master manual was written by the Corps of Engineers in 1960. It has been the law of the land with regard to the operation of the river since that time, now 40 years. There has been an effort underway in earnest over the course of this last year to look for ways that more accurately reflect how the Missouri River ought to be managed, taking into account, now, the extraordinary relevance of fish and wildlife issues. 
   Economically, the fish, wildlife and recreational benefits of the river now constitute over $80 million. Navigation constitutes $7 million. In economic wherewithal, that is what the reality is today: $7 million for navigation, over $80 million for fish, wildlife and recreation. Yet the master manual is written in a way that only recognizes the navigational issues because that is all there was in 1960 when this was written. 
   The Corps is now looking for a way to provide better balance. I think there is a compromise that more and more States are becoming more comfortable with. But what this provision in this bill says is they can't even consider it. Now that all this work and effort has gone into considering ways in which to accommodate all the States, the provision says we won't even consider it. 
   I have to use my prerogatives as a Senator to say that we must find a compromise on that language. We are not going to be able to do it with one vote on a Friday or a Monday afternoon, so I would like to work with the leader. I told him I would like to find a way to resolve this matter. He said, we are looking at, we will take any option. I suggested one to the leader: Let's go to conference on this provision. I am willing to live with whatever the conference decides. Of course, the administration is going to weigh in. They said it will be vetoed if this provision is in there. So if we are going to get this bill done, let's be realistic. 
   I want to get this bill done. I have as many things in this bill as I have in any appropriations bill. I want to get it done. I would like to get it done this afternoon, and I am willing to let the conference make its decision. But to say that the bill must have that provision or there is no bill, is just not fair to this side, to this Senator. 
   That is my reservation. If the Senator from Nevada has not objected, I will. I think it is important to resolve this matter. I am prepared to offer a compromise. Let's resolve this in conference. I say that in full recognition that I have no idea what would happen in conference. But if they want to finish this bill and move it to the next phase, I am ready to do it. I will do it this morning. I will do it this afternoon. I will do it on Monday. But we have to deal with that provision. 
   Having objected, I thank the majority leader for yielding.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say this to the majority leader before he leaves the floor. He and I have spent more time than we probably care to calculate over the last couple of days trying to work through what is obviously a very complicated and difficult period. I have appreciated his good nature as we have done this, his patience, his tolerance. He is smiling now, which is encouraging to me. I am going to keep smiling, too. I hope we can accommodate this unanimous consent request for the intelligence authorization. As Senator LOTT, I recognize that it is important, and I hope we can address it. 
   I also hope we can address the additional appropriations bills. There is no reason we can't. We can find a compromise if there is a will, and I am sure there is. But we also want to see the list of what we expect will probably be the final list of judicial nominees to be considered for hearings in the Judiciary Committee this year. I am anxious to talk with him and work with him on that issue. All of this is interrelated, as he said, and because of that, we take it slowly. So far, we have been able to take it successfully. 
   I yield the floor.

However, with the expansion of this project beyond the original states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota to also include Iowa, and Nebraska, and to establish the Internet resource a higher level of funding for this project is necessary.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on July 10, 2000, one of South Dakota's finest mayors stepped down after two decades of public service. Nancy Ekstrum, former city council member and mayor of the town of Philip for 12 years, provided thoughtful and decisive leadership for her community during a time of considerable change. 
   The first woman to lead Philip, Mayor Ekstrum began her service as mayor facing difficult issues that would be familiar to anyone who lives in a rural community. Poor quality water supplies made treatment expensive and difficult. An aging sewer system needed repair and road projects awaited completion. Meeting these challenges with a shrinking tax base and during a time of hardship for area ranchers required a sense of vision and tenacity. Most of all, it required a mayor who was willing to roll up her sleeves and put her heart and soul into finding creative solutions to difficult problems. 
   Nancy Ekstrum was just that kind of mayor. Under her leadership, the city built long-needed roads and made great strides toward providing its citizens with clean, healthy drinking water. When it became clear that the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System was still several years from reaching the community, Mayor Ekstrum rallied area residents to work with the congressional delegation to find an affordable interim solution to the city's water crisis. It is my hope that this project will be funded this year so that clean water will be Mayor Ekstrum's lasting legacy to the city. 
   On a more personal level, I will miss working with Mayor Ekstrum. Her advice on issues facing western South Dakota is always thoughtful and on target. I suspect that I will continue to turn to her long into the future for her thoughts and input as South Dakota faces the challenges of adapting a rural state to a global economy. I look forward to maintaining our strong friendship. 
   In conclusion, I simply would like to extend my congratulations to Mayor Ekstrum on her 23 years of service to her community. I am delighted that she plans to stay involved in education and will continue to make a difference for the youth of Philip. I wish her the best as she enters this new phase of her life.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to make five points in a very short period of time before we vote. 
   The first goes to the issue raised by the distinguished Senator from Delaware and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, having to do with the surplus. 
   Over the course of the last 6 months we have seen the surplus increase--projected now to be about $2.1 trillion. In 6 months, we have gone from roughly $800 billion in projected surplus to $2.1 trillion. I will predict that surplus is going to change one way or the other over the next 6 months, the next 6 years--for any length of time. In fact, I think the surplus projections are the fiscal equivalent of the dot-com stock market. They will continue to be volatile. We know how volatile they can be. We projected deficits as far as the eye could see a few years ago. We could see those deficits come back completely in a very short period of time. We don't know. There will continue to be volatility in predictions of surplus just as there has been volatility in the dot-com stock market. Let's keep that in mind. 
   When you add all the Republican tax breaks to date, and add the Bush Social Security privatization proposal and it comes to $3.4 trillion. That exceeds by more than 50 percent the available surplus. 
   Last week, we dealt with the estate tax. Today, we are dealing with marriage penalties. But when you add all of them up, we exceed by more than 50 percent of the projected surplus. 
   They are counting on this surplus continuing to go up, No. 1, or they are going to do something they say they don't want to do, which is to tap the Social Security surplus and the Medicare surplus in order to pay for the tax cuts in the first place. That is point No. 1. 
   We don't have the surplus in the bank until it is there. They can project all they want to project. But that surplus could be eliminated very quickly. 
   The second issue: If you are going to say you are going to fix the marriage penalty, fix the marriage penalty. There are 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code. The Republicans chose to deal with three of them. The cost in dealing with those three is $248 billion. They filed amendments in the Finance Committee for an additional $6 billion, totaling another $81 billion. I don't know what it would cost if they were actually going to fix all 65. We don't know how many hundreds of billions of dollars there would be in addition to the $248 billion. Keep that in mind. This does not fix the marriage penalty. Anyone who is voting under that impression ought to recognize that they can say what they will but they are only fixing 3 of the 65 problems that are currently incorporated in the tax law. That is the second point. 
   This is the third point related to the second point. Let's take this teacher and this policeman the distinguished Senator from Texas was talking about. She mentioned a teacher and a policeman and having the need to address their concern. For this couple who has been penalized, let's assume each of them were making $35,000, which in the case of a teacher is very difficult to assume. But we will assume that for the moment. The husband and wife jointly would pay $9,532. If they were able to file singly, they would pay $8,407. So their actual marriage penalty is $1,125. 
   The Republican plan only provides 39 percent of the relief for that couple making $70,000--$443. That is all the relief this Republic plan provides. That is another reason the Democrats felt compelled to offer our alternative. 
   It is no accident that the Democratic plan authored by the distinguished Senator from New York and the Finance Committee Democrats provide 100-percent relief--$1,125 in the case of this particular couple making $70,000. 
   The fourth point: This bill actually creates a new inequity. We call it a singles penalty. I promise you somebody is going to come to the floor saying we have to deal with the singles penalty. 
   That $70,000 joint income I was talking about creates a joint tax liability of $10,274 under current law. They get some tax relief under the GOP plan, and end up with a liability of $8,743. However, a widow does not get any relief at all. A single widow, a person trying to make ends meet with the same kind of income, doesn't get any kind of reduction in her tax liability at all. In fact, because they now create a singles penalty, that widow will actually pay $1,531 in additional taxes over a couple getting relief under the marriage penalty. We are inadvertently creating a singles penalty in the name of trying to address this marriage penalty relief under the Republican plan. That is something I hope Members will take a close look at. 
   The fifth point I raise, I heard several colleagues discuss the fact this does not benefit the wealthy at the expense of the rest. According to the Joint Tax Committee, it sure does. The Joint Tax Committee said a couple making $50,000 a year, as a joint couple, the Republican tax bill is going to allow $240 in relief when paying a marriage penalty with $50,000 worth of income. Someone earning $200,000, their benefit under the Republican plan is $1,335. The Democratic plan is shown in contrast. Someone earning $30,000 under the Democratic plan receives $4,191 in relief. Under the Republican plan, they receive $807.  
   When representing the vast majority of the American working families in that $30,000 to $50,000, why vote for a plan that actually reduces their opportunity to generate meaningful relief by giving them $240 in the case of a $50,000 income earner, and $807 relief for those in the $30,000 category? Why vote for such a plan? 
   It goes to the very point that many have made all along, and the distinguished Senator from New York has made so eloquently. Mr. President, 60 percent of the benefit in this bill we are about to vote on actually goes to those who get a marriage bonus; only 40 percent of that $248 million actually goes to those who face a marriage penalty. 
   Why give, in the name of marriage penalty relief, 60 percent of the benefit to those who are actually getting a marriage bonus under current law? Why exacerbate the inequities in current law already? That is what we are doing. 
   The Democrats have a far better plan. This chart shows that better plan. The Republicans, as I noted earlier, deal with 3 of the 65 inequities for $248 billion, 60 percent of which goes to those who get a marriage surplus. The Democrats deal with every single inequity currently in the code, all 65, and in one sentence. 
   That is the choice. Do we want to fix it or do we want to talk about it? Do we want to create new inequities and singles penalties, or do we want to deal with the problem? Do we want to fritter away $248 billion, thinking we have fixed the marriage problem, or do we want to deal with the real problem for a lot less money? 
   The Democratic plan allows married couples to file separately or jointly. Very simply, taxpayers get a choice. Why deny them that choice? We provide them, for the first time, an opportunity to do one or the other, in a single sentence. 
   We eliminate all marriage tax penalties for those making less than $100,000. We don't expand the marriage bonus, and we provide fiscally responsible relief. 
   You cannot get much better than that. I am hopeful my colleagues will think very carefully before they vote for a plan that does not solve this problem. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Republican plan on marriage penalty relief. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the majority leader in regard to the NCAA bill. I think there is broad support for it. But I also recognize that every Senator is within his or her rights to object and to prolong consideration of any bill for whatever length of time the rules might allow. 
   We have colleagues on this side of the aisle who have indicated to me that is their intention. I know we have to take that into account as we schedule legislation for the balance of this work period. I will certainly work with the distinguished chair of the Commerce Committee and the majority leader to find a time, either through an amendment or through a freestanding bill, to bring it up. 
   Senator LOTT has articulated very clearly the discussions he and I have had over the last hour or so. He has expressed the desire to me--not only to me, to the Senate on several occasions--that we finish at least 11 appropriations bills. I have indicated my hope that we could accommodate that kind of schedule, even though we recognize the disruptions in the schedule, even tomorrow, necessary disruptions. I think it is accomplishable. I would like to work with him to attempt to try to resolve these matters. I have indicated to him that a number of colleagues on this side of the aisle have indicated to me that in order for us to do that there would be a need to address a number of other issues. 
   The majority leader has identified each of those issues and responded just as we discussed. It is my understanding that there will be a markup in the Judiciary Committee on future judicial nominations. I hope, as the majority leader has indicated, it will include both circuit and district judges. It is my understanding that is likely to occur. He has also now indicated that we will get another batch of them done next week and that a mix of circuit and district judges is also anticipated. I am very pleased with that information and commend him for his efforts to move this process along. He has operated in extraordinarily good faith in working with me to try to move these nominations along. I know it is not easy. It is very difficult. But he has certainly been a major factor in getting us to this point. 
   We have again indicated the desire, as we have on several occasions, to bring up PNTR, at least through a motion to proceed beginning next Wednesday. I subscribe to his suggestion or his proposal that would allow us to vote on cloture on the motion to proceed on Friday. We would then have 30 hours of debate. Senators who wish to discuss the matter beyond the vote or perhaps preceding the vote would certainly be entitled to do so. We could have the vote either on Friday or immediately after we come back. That would accommodate at least overcoming one major hurdle. I applaud him for approaching the issue in that way. 
   Third, we have discussed on several occasions on the floor our hope and desire that we can use the dual track that worked very successfully in accommodating Senators' needs to address a number of issues but also in finishing legislation, as we did with the Defense authorization bill. There came a point when we had exhausted the amendment process and rightfully brought the issue to closure. I hope, as Senator LOTT has noted, that we might be able to do that with ESEA as well. It is important for us to resume this dual track. I am very pleased with the majority leader's commitment to continue a dual-track process over the course of the next couple of weeks. We have the opportunity to get a lot of work done--work on appropriations bills, work on judges, work on PNTR, and work on ESEA--as a dual-track vehicle with which we can work to offer other amendments. I am pleased with our discussions and hope we can proceed with that understanding. 
   I, again, thank the majority leader for his willingness to work with us and accommodate all of these important matters.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the Senate will be voting on two competing marriage penalty relief proposals. The choice really could not be more clear. I want to talk a little bit about that choice this afternoon. The Republican bill has very little to do with the marriage penalty. 
   In fact, I was just commenting that if the Republicans were trying to treat an illness, they would be sued for malpractice--given the bill they are proposing this afternoon--malpractice because they are not curing the disease. In fact, in some ways they are causing the disease, this marriage penalty disease, to be even more problematic, more difficult. They are actually creating another disease--a singles penalty. We need to be aware of the repercussions of what the Republicans are attempting to do with their legislation this afternoon. The singles penalty is something I will talk a little bit more about. 
   To begin, I don't think there is any doubt that if you asked all 100 Senators: should we fix the marriage penalty, the answer would be emphatically yes. The question is, How do we fix it, and are we really intent on fixing it? 
   Our Republican colleagues only deal with three of the marriage penalty provisions incorporated in the law today. If you were going to completely eliminate the entire marriage penalty, you would have to deal not with 3 but with 65 of the provisions incorporated in the tax law that have caused the imbalance or the inequity to exist today. The Republicans have only dealt with three. Yet the cost to the Treasury of their plan--the one we will vote on today--is $248 billion overall. 
   I don't know what it would cost if you were going to try to fix all 65 under the Republican plan. Republican amendments were filed addressing six additional provisions, totaling $81 billion, in the Finance Committee. The remaining 56 provisions, untouched in the Republican bill, not addressed at all, have yet to be calculated in terms of what the cost might be with regard to the approach our Republican colleagues use. 
   The second chart spells out what that means. If you only deal with 3 of the 65 provisions, this is what happens. Take a married couple with a joint income of $70,000. Under current 
   law, if the couple were single and they each paid their share of the tax, their tax total would be $8,407, depicted on the chart. Yet because they are kicked into a higher tax bracket when they reach that $70,000 joint income level, their tax is not $8,407; their tax is $9,532. So the marriage penalty is $1,125 under current tax law. 
   Here is what the Republicans do. The Republicans will provide, under their bill, 39-percent relief. That is all you get. Here they are, spending $248 billion, and they can't even do it right. They can't even fix all 65 provisions. They fix three. So you leave the balance, under the Republican bill, for another day, apparently. 
   We don't believe that ought to be the way to fix the marriage penalty. We think you ought to fix the marriage penalty, if you are saying you are going to fix it. We provide 100-percent relief, $1,125 in relief for that couple making $70,000 a year. That is what we do. That is why we believe it is important for people to know there is a clear choice tonight when we vote on those plans: You can vote for the $248 billion Republican plan that fixes 3 or you can vote for the Democratic plan that provides for 100-percent relief and fixes all 65. 
   I think it is very important for us to understand that not only is there a choice in trying to address the marriage penalty, but there is also another problem. 
   We know how doctors try to fix one disease and sometimes create another side effect they had not anticipated because they prescribed the wrong medicine. We have a true illustration of prescription drugs as we know it in this country today, with a $248 billion fix when you could do it for a fraction of the cost. Not only that, their prescription doesn't cure the disease. Not only does it not cure the disease, it actually creates a new one. 
   I guarantee my colleagues, within the next few years, you will have somebody come to the floor and say: Now we have to fix the singles penalty. It is broken. We may need another $248 billion tax plan to fix the singles penalty. 
   This is what happens under the Republican plan. You have a joint income for that couple of $70,000. Current law requires their tax liability of $10,274. The Republican plan would provide $8,743, leaving the $443 relief I mentioned a moment ago. 
   Let's take a widow, a widow who is making that $70,000 income--not a couple but a widow. She has a tax liability under current law of $14,172. Yet her penalty, a singles penalty, would go from $3,898 under current law to $5,429 under the Republican plan. 
   What happens with this tax plan for a single person under certain circumstances--take a widow, a widow who is already probably faced with all kinds of serious financial pressures. Her tax burden goes up by $1,531, a new singles penalty created--I assume inadvertently--because our Republican colleagues are rushing to try to fix a marriage penalty, and they can't do it right. That is why this vote this afternoon is so important. 
   The Democrats will be offering a plan that recognizes another inequity in the Republican plan. I have already talked about two: First, the importance of recognizing that out of the 65 provisions, the Republican plan only deals with 3; and then secondly, how we now have created--I assume inadvertently--this singles penalty. 
   Look at the third problem with the Republican plan that has caused us to want to come to the floor to offer the alternative we will tonight. If you are making $20,000, the amount of tax relief you get under the Republican plan is $567. That is all you get. But if you are making $20,000, under the Democratic plan, your tax reduction, the amount of relief, is $2,164. If you are making $30,000 a year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which has analyzed this, under the Republican plan you get $800. Under the Democratic plan, you get $4,191. Why? Because we fix the marriage penalty. We provide entire relief, all 65 provisions. 
   Look at what happens if you are making $50,000. I don't know what the Republicans have as a problem with those who are making $50,000, but they are sure penalizing them here. You only get $240 under the Republican plan in relief. Why you would want to penalize somebody making $50,000, I don't know. Under the Democratic plan, you get $1,913 in relief. 
   Let us skip all the way over to the other end of the spectrum. This probably tells it best. 
   If you are providing real relief, you are going to go to those people who need the relief the most, those people in the $30,000 to $50,000 category. Under the Republican plan, if you are making more than $200,000, that is when you start kicking in to real money. You get $1,335 in relief there. But if you make $50,000 in income, you get $240. That is the third reason we are so concerned about this Republican plan. 
   Under the Republican plan, you get $1,335 in relief if you are making tons of money. If you are making $50,000, as are most people in the country--couples--you are going to get $240. 
   We are concerned for those three problems. That is why we are offering our alternative tonight. The Democratic marriage penalty relief plan allows married couples to file separately or jointly--another very important aspect: Give them the flexibility. Let them decide what is most helpful to them. 
   That is how we avoid the so-called singles penalty, not the Republican plan. It eliminates all marriage tax penalties for taxpayers earning $100,000 or less, 100 percent. It reduces all marriage tax penalties for those taxpayers earning up to $150,000 and does not expand the so-called marriage bonus or the singles penalty that we are actually creating inadvertently today. 
   I want to show one last chart that probably makes the case as well as I can. The marriage penalty bill proposed by the Republican plan deals  with three. The Democratic alternative deals with the standard deduction and the problem we have with the marriage penalty and the standard deduction; earned income tax credits; child tax credits; Social Security benefits; rate brackets; IRA deductions, student loan interest deductions, and the 56 other marriage penalty provisions that exacerbate the marriage penalty today. We do them all. The Republican's do three. 
   There is one other nonsubstantive but procedural concern I have, which I am compelled to bring up. The regular order in the Senate right now is the marriage penalty. We ought to be taking this bill up under the regular order, but we are not doing that. I think everyone here in the Chamber knows why. We are not doing that because the Republicans don't want to vote on tax amendments. That is why we are not doing it. They are using the brick wall they built around their marriage penalty, this impenetrable wall. So this is an up-or-down vote, a take-it-or-leave-it vote. You either like it or don't; you either take it or leave it. That is the way it is going to be. We are not going to give the Democrats an amendable vehicle. We are going to give them a vehicle they can't amend, a vehicle that will allow the one alternative; and we are not going to debate tax policy, even though this goes to the heart of tax policy. 
   So for the second time in less than a week we are going to be voting on a bill that I think deserves to be defeated. We should have defeated the estate tax bill. I will offer to Senator LOTT that I am willing to sit down today and negotiate with him and the Finance Committee Democrats and Republicans to come up with a bill the President will sign. That isn't going to happen with the bill they passed last week. This bill is going to get vetoed, too. This bill will be vetoed, and it will be vetoed for good reason. It doesn't fix the marriage penalty. It costs $248 billion. It helps those at the high end and leaves everyone else in the lurch. It creates a singles penalty. That isn't the way to legislate. That is why we normally have amendments--to try to fix problems that were caused on purpose or inadvertently. 
   I am hopeful the majority will take great care before they pass the bill that they are going to be pressing this evening. I hope they will work with us to come up with an alternative that the President will sign. We can do things the right way and we can enact them into law and provide meaningful accomplishment and meaningful relief and meaningful help to victims of the marriage penalty. Or we can simply make more statements about how some in this Senate prefer simply to help those at the very top of the income scale, once again, whether they need it or not. That is our choice. I hope Senators will take great care in making their choice, and I look forward to the debate and vote later this evening. Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss the rulemaking that has been proposed by the National Park Service to limit the use of snowmobiles in national parks. 
   National parks are the crown jewels of our nation's system of public lands. They harbor diverse wildlife, rare and beautiful species of plants and spectacular geological formations. In my home state of South Dakota, the Badlands National Park is home to a rich trove of ancient fossils and it provides important habitat for the black-tailed prairie dog and black-footed ferret. 
   I support the efforts of the National Park Service to ensure that these lands remain pristine so that future generations of Americans can enjoy them. I also understand the strong desire of many snowmobilers to continue to have wintertime access to these lands, where the activity has been enjoyed for many years. 
   While snowmobiling does not currently take place in national parks in South Dakota, there is a great deal of interest in this issue in the state and support for appropriately managed access to national parks. By carefully managing the parks, I believe that we can provide this access in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of the environment and to those who go to public lands in search of solitude and quiet. 
   Today, Secretary Bruce Babbitt wrote me to describe in greater detail how the National Park Service intends to proceed in coming months. I believe that it is critical for the agency to review a variety of options for managing snowmobiles and to ensure a full opportunity for public comment. According to the Secretary's letter, the agency does not intend to ban snowmobiles, but will proceed with a rulemaking and public comment period that will allow a full analysis of this issue and provide options for the controlled use of snowmobiles in national parks. I look forward to continuing to discuss this issue with my colleagues, the administration, representatives of environmental groups and snowmobiling enthusiasts.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we discuss the tax code and the issue of fairness for families, Senator HARKIN has offered an important amendment to address an issue of fairness faced by millions of working women and their families. Senator HARKIN and I have worked hard to craft legislation that addresses the wage gap between men and women in this country. This amendment is modeled after my bill, S. 74, the Paycheck Fairness Act. In an era characterized by economic opportunity, it is time for the Senate to consider how America's prosperity can be broadly and fairly shared. 
   While much has changed over the past 35 years, one thing has remained the same: the wage gap between men and women. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, a woman earned only 59 cents for every dollar earned by a man. This landmark bill reduced the pay gap and helped women make great strides to narrow the pay gap. Nonetheless, 35 years later, women, on average, continue to earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by a man. This disparity is patently unfair. The time has come to improve and strengthen President Kennedy's landmark law. 
   Some have suggested that the pay gap is insignificant, but working women know better. Even after accounting for differences in education and the amount of time in the workforce, a woman's pay still lags far behind the pay of a man doing the same work. This persistent wage gap doesn't shortchange just women. It shortchanges families. The wage gap causes the average American working family to lose more than $4000 a year. In fact, it is women's salaries that often bring children and families out of poverty. And families suffer more in South Dakota than in most states because we have the highest percentage in the nation of working mothers with children under the age of 6. These mothers deserve equal pay for equal work. 
   To address this serious problem, the Paycheck Fairness Act uses a simple approach: we believe that the pay gap will decrease if women and men have more information about it; we believe the pay gap will decrease if we enable women to pursue meaningful suits against employers that have discriminatory practices; and we believe that the pay gap will decrease if employers are educated and rewarded for doing their part to end wage discrimination. 
   My bill is a modest but needed step in the fight against wage discrimination. The simple fact remains--working families face the problem of wage discrimination every day and lose billions of dollars in wages because of it. Instead of the risky tax scheme the Senate is considering today, we should give women and American families a much needed raise. We should pass the Harkin amendment today and continue to work towards the day when the pay gap is eliminated.

    Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have worked hard over the last 7 years to restore strength to our Nation's economy. We have turned record deficits into record surpluses. Today, we are about to make a decision none of us could have imagined making in 1993. The question facing us is: How should we spend the first significant portion of the surplus? 
   Our Republican colleagues believe we should use the first major portion of the surplus to eliminate a tax that is paid by only the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. They say the first, best use of the surplus is to give people with estates worth more than $20 million a $10.5 million tax break. 
   The cost of their plan is $105 billion for the first 10 years. In the second 10 years, the cost balloons to $750 billion. Three-quarters of a trillion dollars in the second 10 years alone--to eliminate a tax paid only by the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. The full cost of the Republican estate tax cut would hit at the worst possible time: just as the baby boomers are starting to retire. That is our Republican colleagues' highest priority for the surplus: to help those who are already benefitting most from this economy. 
   Democrats disagree. We support cutting the estate tax. We voted in 1997 to do just that. 
   Today we are offering a plan to cut estate taxes even further. But our plan is different--in three very important ways--from the Republican plan. 
   First, our plan helps family farmers and ranchers, and small-business owners, immediately. 
   The Republican plan does not remove one family-owned farm or ranch or  small business during the first 10 years. Not one. 
   Just as an aside, I must say I have been surprised, during this debate, to hear so many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle expressing concern for family farmers and ranchers. In South Dakota and all across this country, family farmers and ranchers are working practically around the clock to scratch out a living. They are working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week--not even making back their production costs, earning less than their parents and grandparents earned in the Depression. 
   Too many of them are being forced to sell farms and ranches that have been in their families for generations--not because they cannot pay estate taxes; their farms and ranches are not worth enough to owe any estate taxes. They are being forced out by the disastrous Federal agriculture policies put in place by a Republican Congress. I am relieved to hear our colleagues acknowledge, finally, that family farmers and ranchers need help from this Government. I hope they will continue to believe that when we move on to the agriculture appropriations bill next week. 
   That is the first difference between our plan to cut estate taxes and the Republican plan: Our plan cuts estate taxes for family farmers and ranchers immediately. Their plan does nothing for family farmers and ranchers for the first 10 years. 
   The second major difference is, our plan costs less: $65 versus $105 billion over the first 10 years. Our plan does not cost in the second decade, as their plan does. 
   Our plan is simple and effective. For couples with assets of up to $4 million, we eliminate the estate tax entirely. We also eliminate the estate tax on all family farms, ranches, and businesses worth up to $8 million. Under our plan, only the wealthiest seven-tenths of 1 percent of estates and the wealthiest one-half of one percent of family-owned businesses would pay any estate taxes. 
   Let me say that again: Only the wealthiest seven-tenths of one percent of couples and the wealthiest one-half of one percent of businesses would pay any estate taxes under our proposal. 
   The third major difference between our plan and the Republican plan is: Our plan also helps the other 98 percent of Americans who do not pay estate taxes. Because we target our estate tax relief, we are able to provide additional tax breaks to families, to help them with real, pressing needs--like child care, paying for college, and caring for sick and aging relatives. Because we target our estate tax relief, we are able to provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. 
   Under our plan, someone who inherits an estate worth $20 million would receive a tax cut of roughly $1 million. Our Republican colleagues say that is not enough. They want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more than is in our plan, on far bigger tax cuts for multimillionaires. That is their priority for the surplus: bigger tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans--at the expense of everyone else. 
   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: before you cast this vote, imagine sitting down at the kitchen table with parents who are wondering how they are going to pay for their children's college education. Imagine sitting around a kitchen table with a middle-aged woman who is wondering what will happen when her parents need long-term care--where the money will come from. Imagine talking with a retired couple who have cut back on necessities in order to pay for their prescriptions each month. How would you explain your vote to them? How would you explain to them that eliminating a tax that affects only the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans is more important than helping them care for their children, or their aging parents--or helping them with the cost of their prescriptions? 
   What could you possibly say to convince them to sign onto a $750 billion tax bill that won't help them one nickel, and will come due just as the baby boomers start to retire? For the life of me, I can't imagine.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to voice my support for perhaps the most important amendment--on one of the most important bills--the Senate will consider this year. 
   National missile defense is one of the most critical defense issue facing this nation. 
   It is probably one of the more politically charged issues as well. 
   Despite political sensitivity and, frankly, political risk, Senator DURBIN has looked carefully at the facts, and at the arguments on all sides of this issue. His amendment reflects a balanced measured approach that I believe should be endorsed by both supporters and opponents of a missile defense system. 
   The Senate should adopt the Durbin amendment for two reasons: What it doesn't say. And what it does say. 
   What the amendment doesn't say is whether a missile defense system is a good idea, or a bad idea. 
   Frankly, I believe we do not have enough information yet to make that call. The Durbin amendment actually presumes a NMD system will be deployed. But it does not address the issue of whether it should be deployed. 
   What the Durbin amendment does say, it says well. Simply put, this amendment says that before we commit $60 billion--or more--to deploy a national missile defense system, we must be confident the system will work. Nothing more, nothing less. Americans have a right to know that their tax dollars aren't being wasted on a system that cannot work. And we have a responsibility to provide them with that assurance. 
   The Durbin amendment says that before a national missile defense system can be declared operational, the system must be tested against measures our enemies can be expected to take to defeat it, and the Secretary of Defense must prepare a report for Congress on the ability of the NMD system to defeat these countermeasures. 
   The amendment also reconvenes the Welch panel, an independent review panel chaired by General Welch, to assess countermeasure issues and deliver a report on findings to both the Defense Department and the Congress. 
   Why are such assurances needed? 
   Deployment of a national missile defense system would signal a dramatic change in the deterrent strategy this Nation has followed successfully for over 40 years. Moving to new strategy dependent on defenses is not without risks. 
   Missle defense deployment requires enormous public commitment--not unlike our effort to put a man on the Moon. 
   While success can never be guaranteed, American people have a right to know that success is possible--before we commit $60 billion, or more, to it. 
   The President must have confidence the system will work. Also, critically important, our adversaries must know a national defense system will work. 
   A deterrent is not effective if enemies can be confident it may not, or will not, work. If tests demonstrate for the world that the United States has a strong missile defense system, our adversaries are much less likely to want to test our defenses. 
   Another reason assurances are needed: Increasing number of studies that raise questions about whether current missile defense testing program can provide future leaders with adequate level of confidence. 
   Philip Coyle III, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation, issued a report to Congress earlier this year. The report concluded the pre-deployment tests will not be conducted ``in a realistic enough manner to support acquisition decisions.'' 
   A recent report by MIT found that relatively simple countermeasures could defeat the planned NMD system--and that current testing is not capable of evaluating the operational effectiveness of the system against likely countermeasures. This is a critical deficiency. 
   Technical experts warn that any emerging ``missile state'' that is capable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile is also capable of building countermeasures that could defeat a NMD system. 
   The intelligence community released a report last year on ``Foreign Missile Development and the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States through 2015.'' The report warned that emerging ``missile states'' could develop countermeasures such as decoy balloons by the time they flight test their first long-range missiles. 
   They could also acquire countermeasure technologies from Russia and China--both of whom possess such technologies, and both of whom strongly oppose a U.S. NMD system. 
   Reasons to oppose amendment? I can think of only one reason to oppose this amendment: Belief that we should deploy an NMD system at any cost. Regardless of whether the system can work. Regardless of the cost to American taxpayers. Regardless of the effects deployment could have on our relationships with our allies. Regardless of how it might escalate an international nuclear arms race. Regardless of everything. 
   I understand that there are some who feel this way. Frankly, I cannot understand this sort of thinking. They wouldn't buy a car before test-driving it. Why in the world would they buy a $60 billion defense system before knowing that it can work? 
   A missile defense system that undermines our Nation politically, economically, and strategically--without strengthening our defense--is no defense at all. 
   The American people have a right to know that--if we deploy a national missile defense system--it will work. The Durban amendment will take a big step toward providing them with that assurance. We should adopt it.

I ask that we delete that for this time only. I know it is a very important matter, and oftentimes it is essential for Members to understand the amendments.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life and work of Gerald Clifford, an important and influential South Dakotan and Oglala Sioux tribal member who recently passed away after courageously battling a debilitating illness. 
   Gerald Clifford, with whom I worked for many years, was a leader and a driving force for change among Native Americans in South Dakota and across the country. He was a champion for rural water development in southwestern South Dakota and a strong advocate for Indian education and Indian self-determination. Earlier this week, Mr. Clifford began his journey to the spirit world at the young age of sixty. I express my heartfelt condolences to Gerald's family and relatives during this difficult time. My prayers and thoughts are with them. 
   The void left by Gerald's passing was felt especially deeply today, as his life was celebrated at a funeral service in  Manderson, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation. While the work of this body required my presence in Washington today, I do want to honor and remember Gerald here in the Senate for his many outstanding contributions to his community and state. 
   Over the years, Gerald and I worked together on a number of projects. And I can tell you for a fact: he is a tenacious advocate for his causes and never gives up. Never. 
   I had the honor and pleasure of working closely with Gerald on the construction of the Mini Wiconi Rural Water System. In his role as director of the Mini Wiconi project, Gerald accepted the daunting challenge of bringing the state of South Dakota, three South Dakota tribes and local non-Indian communities together to achieve a common vision. The project bridged historically-vast political and cultural gaps to bring the precious resources of clean water to rural communities and remote reservations areas. 
   Even after many South Dakotans had lost hope of ever seeing the Mini Wiconi water project finished, Gerald kept working at it. He shepherded the Mini Wiconi project during the last several years, a critical period in its construction, fulfilled the promise of clean water for many, and laid a strong foundation for completing the project in the foreseeable future. 
   Gerald managed this project with skill and with diplomacy, and I am proud to have been able to work with him to accomplish our mutual goal. His contribution will be felt for decades to come. 
   Gerald made many other contributions to his people and his state in addition to Mini Wiconi. I would like to highlight just a few examples that provide a snapshot of the magnitude of this involvement in efforts to benefit the people of South Dakota and our nation. 
   Gerald Clifford was first and foremost an articulate and impassioned advocate for justice for his people. No one who knew Gerald could ever question the intensity or sincerity of his commitment to this overriding goal. 
   Gerald also understood the critical importance of education as a means of improving the quality of life for Indian people, working hard to promote tribally-controlled education, particularly tribal colleges and universities, and contributing to the initiation and development in the early 1970's of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) and the tribal college movement. He was also among the first to have assisted in the creation of tribally-controlled entities, such as the Coalition of Indian-Controlled School Boards. Through this work, he helped provide educational opportunities for 26,000 students at the nation's thirty-three tribal colleges and universities, and opened a major educational pathway for many generations to come. 
   Gerald Clifford was a highly respected leader of the American Indian people. He was elected by Great Plains tribal leaders and tribal peers to serve as the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) Aberdeen area Vice-President. As their voice on Capital Hill, Gerald helped many tribes in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska and throughout the mid-West. 
   Gerald was a dominant presence at the forefront of the many struggles that the Aberdeen area tribes faced over the past four decades. It was through his focused dedication and skilled advocacy that Indian people have prevailed in the face of numerous adversities placed in their way. Gerald served as an elder, mentor, colleague and friend to so many young Indian men and women, imparting many of his outstanding qualities to this and future generations of tribal leaders. 
   Earlier this year, I addressed the National Congress of American Indians general assembly while Gerald was in Washington fighting hard on issues that meant so much to him. Later, I learned that he was forced to return to South Dakota prematurely because he was struggling with his health. As a result, I was unable to see him. I will always regret that I did not get to visit with Gerald during his last visit here. 
   Gerald fought illness with courage, determination and indomitable spirit. Even as he was ailing, he was not deterred from the pursuit of his work. He continued to fight for Indian people and for the causes that cared so much about. He never gave up. 
   In passing, Gerald Clifford left a large, significant and important legacy. He truly will be missed, but his work will live on, enriching the lives of South Dakotans for generations

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, while the majority leader and I have profound differences of opinion with regard to the estate tax and what to do with estate tax policy, I have been very appreciative of his willingness to work with us to accommodate the opportunity for Senators to offer amendments, which is what this agreement will allow. 
   This is a fair agreement. This isn't everything that our caucus or our colleagues have indicated they would like. There are far more amendments than this agreement will allow. But I underscore a comment just made by the majority leader. This is not going to be the last word on tax policy in this session of Congress. There will be other opportunities. I will do my utmost to accommodate Senators who have amendments they want to offer, if they are not going to be offered as part of this agreement. 
   I thank all of my caucus for their willingness to accommodate this agreement and for the opportunity to work through a very difficult set of procedural circumstances. This is far better than the old way that we were likely to be subscribing to, which is a cloture vote denying amendments of any kind, and maybe even denying an ultimate result. This will allow an ultimate result. 
   I hope we can have a good debate. I hope we can deal with these issues in a way that will afford us a real opportunity to consider alternatives. I think this agreement allows that. 
   I appreciate very much the majority leader's willingness to work with us. I appreciate especially the indulgence and the cooperation of all members of the Democratic caucus. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   July 12, 1999: 
   Craig Briskey, 15, Atlanta, GA; Deleane Briskey, 33, Atlanta, GA; Torsha Briskey, 16, Atlanta, GA; Darius Cox, 31, Baltimore, MD; Willie Dampier, 31, Lansing, MI; Albert Fain, 25, Cincinnati, OH; Victor Gonzalez, 20, Holyoke, MA; Larry W. Gray, 52, Memphis, TN; Arvell Henderson, 28, St. Louis, MO; Essie Hugley, 37, Atlanta, GA; Wardell L. Jackson, 19, Chicago, IL; William Kuhn, 25, Pittsburgh, PA; Antoine Lucas, 9, Atlanta, GA; David Antonio Lucas, 13, Atlanta, GA; Edgar McDaniel, 34, Atlanta, GA; Sims Miller, 32, St. Louis, MO; Erica Reyes, 20, Holyoke, MA; Darryl Solomon, 28, Detroit, MI; James Sweeden, 48, Dallas, TX; Anthony White, Detroit, MI; Darrell Lewis White, 28, Memphis, TN; Unidentified male, 15, Chicago, IL. 
   Deleane Brisky from Atlanta was one of six people I mentioned who was shot and killed one year ago today. On that day, her ex-boyfriend burst into her home, killed her, her sister and four of her six children. The gunman then shot and wounded her 11-year-old son Santonio, who was hiding in a closet, before turning the gun on himself. 
   The time has come to enact sensible gun legislation. These people, who lost their lives in tragic acts of gun violence, are a reminder of why we need to take action now.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator from Montana for making the point again, with his unanimous consent request this morning, that we are simply asking for a date certain. 
   I am concerned that this issue, as was discussed and reported yesterday, could slip into September. If it slips into September, it might not be considered at all. In September there will be little opportunity to confront what we know is going to be a difficult challenge for us in terms of procedural factors in the consideration of this legislation. 
   So I have a very deep concern about this legislation slipping. This needs to be done this month. It ought to be done this week. We are going to continue to press for its consideration. I applaud the Senator from Montana in his willingness to do it. 
   There is an array of legislation that has been left undone. We will call attention to those issues as often as we can to encourage and to welcome the involvement and participation on the other side. 
   Another issue is the H-1B bill. It has been languishing now for a long period of time. I have expressed a willingness to cut down the amendments that we  know are pending on the H-1B bill from the scores, maybe even over 100 amendments that could be offered to 10 amendments with time limits--with time limits. We would be willing to consider the H-1B bill with a time limit on each amendment, taking it up as soon as possible, in an effort to get that legislation passed as well. For whatever reason, the majority has continued to refuse to allow us consideration of the H-1B legislation as well. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights, the prescription drug bill, the minimum wage bill, education amendments, the juvenile justice legislation--there is a legislative landfill, that gets larger and larger, in large measure because of the reluctance and outright opposition on the part of some of our colleagues on the other side to deal with these issues in a constructive manner in order that we may complete them yet this year.

So, Mr. President, I again ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the Interior appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 2045, the H-1B visa bill, that it be considered under the following time agreement: One managers' amendment; that there be 10 relevant amendments per each leader in order to the bill; that relevant amendments shall include those related to H-1B, technology-related job training, education and access, and/or immigration; that debate on those amendments shall be limited to 30 minutes, equally divided in the usual form, and that relevant second-degree amendments be in order; that upon the disposition of the amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on final passage. 
   The unanimous consent request would allow us to complete the H-1B bill in one day--one day. So I am hoping our colleagues will agree to this. I ask that unanimous consent at this time.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, to respond, I don't know what would be nonrelevant about technology-related job training. Is that relevant to H-1B? Of course, it is. I don't know what would be nonrelevant about technology-related education amendments. What could be nonrelevant about a technology-related education and access amendments? What is nonrelevant about immigration amendments? We are talking about the possibility of allowing 200,000 new immigrants to enter our country to work. We want to offer amendments we feel are relevant to H-1B, and we are not allowed. 
   Senators want to be Senators. In the Senate, we offer amendments to bills. We want to get this legislation passed as well. In the true tradition of the Senate, we ought to be able to offer amendments, relevant amendments.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I am more than happy to deal with relevant amendments. Of course, as the Senator from New Hampshire knows, according to the strict definition of the word ``relevance,'' our amendments would have to be related specifically to H-1B. He is unwilling to talk about relevant amendments as we understand it in the English language. Under the common understanding of the English language, ``relevance'' would allow the consideration of an immigration-related amendment during the H-1B debate because the H-1B bill is an immigration bill. It would allow technology-related education amendments to be considered relevant to the H-1B bill in this context. Certainly, technology-related job training amendments would be ``relevant'' under our common understanding of that term, but you can hide behind those specific defenses if you like. Again, I am happy to yield.

   Mr. DASCHLE. It is the position of this Senator that the term ``relevant'' fits the amendments that we have attempted to offer. Of course, the reason why our colleagues don't want to deal with these issues is not because they are not relevant. It is because they don't want to vote on immigration issues. They don't want to vote on education. They don't want to vote on technology-related job training. They have a take-it-or-leave-it approach to consideration of important legislation such as this. 
   We can go back to the time when they were in the minority. Relevance was never a question then for them. Then relevance was something they considered and accorded the right of every Senator, 
   just as we are now advocating. We are talking about relevance. We are talking about the importance of relevant amendments.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. He said it so eloquently. This is a relevance issue. Whether or not we continue to allow immigrants who come in to meet certain skill demands in this country is directly relevant to whether or not we are going to have an educated workforce. It is directly relevant to whether or not we are going to put the resources forward to train American workers in order to ensure that we might someday fill these jobs with workers from this country. If that is not relevant, I really don't know what is.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, let me end by saying again, I am disappointed. 
   I note the Senator from New Hampshire offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution relating to Social Security on the Commerce-State-Justice bill in the last Congress. There was no concern then about whether it was relevant or not. Our distinguished majority leader offered an amendment relating to prayer in schools and at memorial services on the juvenile justice bill last year. Again, there was no concern about relevance. Senator HELMS offered an amendment that some of us may recall having to do with a patent for the Daughters of the Confederacy on the community service bill. He also offered a Lithuanian independence resolution on the Clean Air Act. Senator NICKLES offered an amendment to require a supermajority for tax increases on the unemployment insurance extension. Senator ROTH has offered tax cuts on appropriations bills. 
   There is a lot of interesting history having to do with relevance and amendments that may or may not pertain directly to the bill under Senate consideration. That is all we are asking. 
   What is even more noteworthy is the fact that we are willing to limit ourselves to 10 amendments with time limits. You can't do much better than that. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If we could accommodate our distinguished colleagues in the past when they have offered amendments, certainly they should accommodate us. That is why the relevancy issue is so important here. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I welcome everyone back from our week away for the Fourth of July recess. I did not have an opportunity to talk this morning with the majority leader, and I understand he was able to come to the floor and indicate there is a lot of work to be done, and I share his view about the extent to which work should be done. 
   I hope we can work as productively this coming work period as we worked in the last work period. We had an arrangement that I think worked very well following an unfortunate confrontation prior to the time we went away for the Memorial Day recess. The cooperation and partnership that was demonstrated over this last work period is one that I hope we can model again. 
   I say that because I am concerned about the precarious way with which we are starting this week. Senator LOTT has filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the estate tax, and then it is my understanding his intention is to file a cloture motion on the bill itself. I remind my colleagues that is exactly what got us into the position we were in prior to the Memorial Day recess. I hope we can work through that. 
   I have offered Senator LOTT a limit on the number of amendments to the estate tax bill and a time limit on the amendment. I am very disappointed that we are not able to do what we have been able to do on so many bills, and that is reach some sort of accommodation for both sides. We still have some time this week, and I am hopeful that will happen. 
   Let me also say that I am increasingly not only concerned but alarmed that we have yet to schedule a date certain for the consideration of permanent normal trade relations with China. I had a clear understanding we would take up the bill this month. Yet I am told now that at a Republican staff meeting today there was a good deal of discussion about the need to move it to September. 
   I inform my colleagues that we will ask unanimous consent to take up PNTR. If that fails, at some point this week, we will actually make a motion to proceed to PNTR by a time certain this month. We cannot fail to act on that issue any longer. We must act. So we will make that motion to proceed to PNTR if the majority leader chooses not to make the motion for whatever reason. 
   I will also say that, as he has indicated, there is a good deal of business left undone that, for whatever reason, has been blocked by some of our colleagues on the other side. We will want to address those issues as well. 
   We will offer a motion to proceed to the Patients' Bill of Rights. We will certainly want to do that, as well as prescription drugs, minimum wage, and a number of issues relating to common sense gun legislation, such as closing the so-called gun show loophole and dealing with the incremental approaches to gun safety that the Senate supported as part of the juvenile justice bill. 
   I will say, we will also want to move to proceed to the H-1B legislation that passed in the House overwhelmingly. We want to be able to offer amendments. We would like to take it up. It should happen this week; if not this week, next week. But we ought to take up H-1B as well. 
   You could call this week the ``Trillion Dollar Week,'' the Trillion Dollar Week because our Republican colleagues are choosing to ignore all of the legislation I have just noted, given the limited time we have, and instead commit this country to $1 trillion in two tax cuts relating, first, to the marriage penalty, which we are told by CBO would cost a little over $250 billion over a 10-year period of time; and the estate tax repeal, which, over a fully implemented 10-year period, costs $750 billion. 
   That is $1 trillion dealing with just two issues: the estate tax and the marriage penalty. It does not even go to the array of other tax-related questions that some of our Republican colleagues have addressed in the past. We could be up into $3 or $4 trillion worth of tax cuts if all of the tax proposals made by our Republican colleagues were enacted. But we may want to call this the ``Trillion Dollar Week'' if our Republican colleagues have their way: $750 billion on the estate tax; $250 billion on the marriage tax penalty--and, I will say, $1 trillion, with very limited debate, with no real opportunity to offer amendments, with no real suggestion about whether or not we ought to have at least the right to offer alternatives to spending that much money. 
   The Democrats believe very strongly in the need to ensure that small businesses and farms are protected and that the ability is provided to transfer small businesses and farms. But we can do that for a lot less than $750 billion. We believe very strongly in the importance of the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. But we do not have to spend $250 billion to deal with it.  
   In fact, the regular order right now is the marriage tax penalty. We have offered a limit on amendments, a limit on time on those 10 amendments. We could take it up and deal with it this week--or could have last week, last month, the month before. Instead, what our Republicans colleagues are doing--and, I might add, all the time calling for our cooperation--is saying: No, we are not going to do that. We are not going to give you relevant amendments on the marriage penalty. We are going to go to the first reconciliation bill so you can't have amendments. We are going to take up the bill that way. But we still want your cooperation. 
   Now we are told that we will have an opportunity to vote on cloture because we are given the same mandate, the same ultimatum, when it comes to amendments on estate taxes. 
   So let me end where I started. I really do hope that we can have as productive a time this coming month as we had last month. I thought it was a good month. But I must say, this is a precarious beginning with this Trillion Dollar Week. It is a precarious beginning when, with all of the people's business the majority leader referred to, we are not actually going to deal 
   with the people's business. We are going to deal with 2 percent of the population affected by the estate tax, and we are going to deal with a marriage penalty bill that goes way beyond repealing the marriage penalty, that actually gives a bonus to some taxpayers, all the time denying Democratic Senators the right to offer amendments on other directions that we might take. 
   So I look forward to talking and working with the majority leader, and I look forward to a good and rigorous debate about all of the issues having to do with the people's business.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The assistant Democratic leader has made a very important point. The list I referred to certainly is not all inclusive. He listed one important omission; that is the export administration bill. In fact, I do not know of anyone who has put more time in trying to get that bill scheduled than the assistant Democratic leader. I thank him publicly for his willingness to try to find a way with which to bring this legislation up. 
   He is absolutely right. As we consider our huge deficit in our balance of payments, it is the only real black eye we have in an otherwise extraordinary economic record. As we consider that, I cannot think of anything more important than ensuring we stay competitive in the international marketplace today. There is no better way to do that than to address export enhancement legislation, as the assistant Democratic leader has noted. 
   I also say to the assistant Democratic leader, today, again, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, has called upon the Senate to act. He has called upon the Senate to act on PNTR immediately. I am sure he would also call upon the Senate to act on the export administration bill. 
   But there is a growing crescendo of people out there concerned that this is a Senate which has done little, which has blocked the people's business, not enacted it. Prescription drugs, the Patients' Bill of Rights, the minimum wage, effective gun legislation, China PNTR, and H-1B--all of those ought to be done. All of those ought to be done this month. We will have very little time left when we get back after the August recess. So we have to make every day count. We want to work with the majority to make that happen. 
   With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud and pleased that today the Senate has voted to authorize a memorial in our Nation's Capital to honor disabled American veterans. 
   I must say that it is humbling for me to be a co-sponsor of this bill alongside some of the very people we are honoring--my fellow Senators MAX CLELAND, DANIEL INOUYE and BOB KERREY. I know there are thousands of others across our country--some of whom I know personally--and they deserve much more than a monument. They all have had their lives disrupted, sometimes painfully, as a result of their willingness to fight for America and all that it stands for. 
   But we cannot undo the damage to limb and spirit that has already been inflicted. So we now authorize a permanent monument that will call attention to the special esteem we hold for our disabled veterans--living and dead. It is my sincere hope that we can create a singular commemorative site that will encourage all Americans to come, pause, and reflect on the meaning of sacrifice, patriotism, and the place of disabled citizens in our society. 
   Mr. President, wish the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation all the best in the hard work to come, and I look forward to the day when the people of America can admire the memorial and reflect on the significant sacrifices it represents.

As Senator LOTT has indicated, this was not an easy task. All the way to the very last moment it looked as if this could have been derailed. It wasn't, in part because of leadership and in part because of cooperation. 
   I think we have done a good thing today, an important thing. It is important we finish this work prior to the time we leave. This bill will now go to the President, as it should. I know he will sign it. I think we are ending the way we should have ended, on a high note with a good deal accomplished. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. 
   Mr. President, this week, we got our first glimpse of the first rough draft of the human genetic code. 
   The public-private partnership known as the Human Genome Project is the genetic equivalent of putting man on the moon. 
   By decoding our genetic makeup, researchers may soon discover how to cure and even prevent heart disease, cancer, birth defects, and other serious medical conditions. 
   We have every reason to be hopeful about this breakthrough. But we also have some reason to be concerned, because genetic information--used improperly--can also cause great harm. 
   Improvements in genetic testing can determine whether a person has an increased chance of developing breast cancer, or colon cancer, or some other serious illness--years before symptoms even appear. 
   In the right hands, that information could save your life. In the wrong hands, that same information could be used to deny you insurance, a mortgage, or even a job. 
   We need to make sure this new research--which has been funded largely by American taxpayers--is used to help America's families, not hurt them. That is the goal of this amendment. 
   Francis Collins probably knows more about the potential of genetic testing than anyone in the world. He is the head of the international research team that makes up the Human Genome Project. 
   Listen to what Dr. Collins said on Monday, the day the results of the first phase of the Human Genome Project were unveiled:  
   Genetic discrimination in insurance and the workplace is wrong and it ought to be prevented by effective federal legislation.  
   He added:  
   If we needed a wake-up call to say that it's time to do this, isn't today the wake-up call?  
   Dr. Collins is right. It would be an absolute travesty if a test that could save your life ends up costing you your job or your financial security. 
   Genetic discrimination isn't just a theoretical possibility. It isn't just something that might happen in the future. It is already happening--even without the information the human genome promises to uncover. 
   It is already happening to people like Terri Seargent. 
   Terri was a model employee who was moving up the corporate ladder--until  the day a test revealed that she carried a gene that might--here I emphasize ``might''--make her more susceptible to a potentially fatal pulmonary condition. 
   Before her employers saw those test results, they used to give Terri glowing job performance reviews. But after they saw the results, they asked her to resign. She did, because she had no choice, because genetic discrimination is not clearly prohibited--in the workplace, or anywhere else. 
   The solution is obvious. Dr. Collins is right. Our laws must keep pace with advances in science and technology. No one should suffer discrimination solely because of his or her genetic makeup. 
   Last year, the President signed an executive order outlawing genetic discrimination in the workplace for Federal employees. It is now time to expand these important protections to all Americans. 
   That is why I am offering, along with my colleagues--Senators KENNEDY, DODD, and HARKIN--the Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act as an amendment to this bill. 
   Our bill has three major components: 
   First, it forbids employers from discriminating in hiring, or in the terms and conditions of employment, on the basis of genetic information; 
   Second, it forbids health insurers from discriminating against individuals on the basis of genetic information; and 
   Third, it prevents the disclosure of genetic information to health insurers, health insurance data banks, employers, and anyone else who has no legitimate need for information of this kind. 
   Discrimination based on genetic factors is just as unacceptable as that based on race, national origin, religion, sex or disability. In each case, people are treated unfairly, not because of their inherent abilities but solely because of irrelevant characteristics. 
   Genetic discrimination, like other forms of discrimination, hurts us all. It hurts our economy by keeping talented people out of the workforce and diminishes us as a people. We cannot take one step forward in science but two steps back in civil rights. 
   And we will all pay the price in increased health care costs if we allow employers or insurers to use genetic information to discriminate. If fear of discrimination stops people from getting genetic tests, early diagnosis and preventative treatments, they may suffer much more serious and more expensive health problems in the long run. And we all have to pay for that, as well. 
   Finally, genetic discrimination undercuts the Human Genome Project's fundamental purpose of promoting public health. Investing resources in the Human Genome Project is justified by the benefits of identifying, preventing and developing effective treatments for disease. But if fear of discrimination deters people from genetic diagnosis, our understanding of the humane genome will be in vain.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we now know what this is all about. Some of our Republican colleagues are going to try to convince a majority in this body that employment ought not be included when we consider discrimination based upon genetic character. I do not think employment discrimination should be treated differently from insurance discrimination. I do not think people who have experienced discrimination, as we have already seen in so many illustrations, ought to be told they have to be concerned about their job simply because of some genetic defect. 
   That has already happened. We have already seen that happen in case after case. I described a case this morning where Terri Seargent, who had moved up the corporate ladder and was given promotion after promotion, was asked to resign when it was learned that she had the genetic marker for ``Alpha 1''. No woman, no man, no person, no employee, should be subjected to discrimination based upon genetic characteristics, and that is happening today. 
   ADA passed a long time ago. That law did not envision the challenges science presents us today. We are simply proposing that we clarify that it should be unlawful to discriminate on the basis of genetic information. 
   The bottom line question is, when it comes down to these two proposals, whether we should prohibit both health insurers and employers from using predictive genetic information in a discriminatory fashion? There is agreement, at least with regard to one issue: we should prohibit health insurers from doing it, but our Republican colleagues--at least the senior Senator from Vermont--are saying we just should not cover employers. We should not do it because he would like to have us believe it is already being done. Tell that to Terri Seargent. Tell that to myriad 
   other people who already have had difficulty explaining their situation, in large measure because they have found some genetic defect. 
   We agree that insurance companies should not discriminate. We agree there should not be any tests for conditions of coverage. We simply disagree at this moment about whether or not we ought to take what we have already done for virtually every other form of discrimination in this country and extend it to genetic information. 
   The senior Senator from Vermont says no, he does not want to do that. But I cannot imagine that in this day, in this age, given what we are doing with the genome project and our recognition of what it will mean, both good and bad, for this country and for our people that now is not the time to ensure that, regardless of circumstance, we will not allow this to be used as a means of discrimination in the workplace. 
   Listen to what Francis Collins, one of the key people who headed the international research team that makes up  the human genome project, said about this very issue:  
   Genetic discrimination in insurance and the workplace is wrong and it ought to be prevented by effective Federal legislation.  
   This is from the head of the research unit. He does not have any question about whether or not ADA covers genetic discrimination. He has already decided. He is the head of the research team. He said this ought to be a wake-up call; let's ban it today. He did not say let's wait for more hearings. He did not say let's get out there and try to figure out a way to do it through regulation. He said this ought to be a wake-up call. That is not TOM DASCHLE; that is not Terri Seargent who has been discriminated against; that is Francis Collins, the head of the international research project calling upon the Senate today to ban discrimination based upon employment. It cannot be any clearer than that, Mr. President. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond to a few of the arguments posed by the Senator from Tennessee. 
   First of all, with regard to the technicalities to which he made reference, I do not know what technicalities and what information could be murky about what it is we are trying to do.  
   We simply say there should not be any employment discrimination based on genetic information. That is it. He talked about these discrimination actions being subjected to a mysterious penalty. All we have said in section 4 of the bill is that if you think you were discriminated against, you can go to court and have a court make some decision with regard to whether there is discrimination or not. That is the penalty. We do not prescribe any penalties. We prescribe some degree of accountability. We simply say, if you think you were discriminated against, you get to sue, period. That is all. 
   On another point, let me say that the legislation proposed by our Republican colleagues has already been analyzed in some detail as part of their Patients' Bill of Rights, as the Senator from Vermont has said. 
   On April 12, Senator HARKIN received a letter from 59 health organizations that wrote with concern about the language propounded in this amendment by the Senator from Vermont. Fifty-nine health organizations have already said: This is not the way we ought to do it. 
   They don't need more hearings. They don't need more information. They have looked at the bill. They have come to the conclusion that if we are going to write public policy regarding genetic discrimination, this isn't it.

We have a bill pending that will allow us to do just that. We have another bill pending that does not provide that protection in terms of discrimination. Fifty-nine health organizations, including the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, the Genetic Alliance, the CARE Foundation, the Oncology Nursing Society have said: Please, do more than the legislation offered by the Senator from Vermont. 
   So it isn't just Dr. Collins, it isn't just Terri Seargent, it is a list of health organizations, the likes of which you rarely see, who have come together to say: We ought to do better than this. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Massachusetts.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification. I am delighted to hear that there is still some hope I can persuade him with the merits of our legislation. 
   To ensure that everybody understands--I think it is pretty basic--three-fourths of the people in this country obtain their health insurance through their employer. Whether or not employers may discriminate against employees and potential employees on the basis of genetic information, in large measure, will be determined by whether or not we write into law a pretty simple concept. It doesn't take any complex legalism to say, look, you should not discriminate based upon genetic information, period. If you think you are discriminated against, you ought to have recourse in a court of law. That is all we are saying. 
   Now, the Jeffords amendment provides no protection against employment discrimination. That is clear. It does not prohibit insurers from disclosing the results of genetic tests without consent. That is clear. It does not prohibit the use of predictive genetic information for hiring, advancement, salary, or other workplace rights and privileges. That is clear. It doesn't provide persons who have suffered genetic discrimination in either arena with the right to seek redress through a legal action. That is clear. 
   It is no wonder that 59 health organizations have said: We have looked at what Senator JEFFORDS is proposing and we think you can do better. That is no accident. They are asking us not to support this legislation because there is no meaningful protection in the Jeffords amendment. 
   I am all for more hearings, but it is ironic--how many times has the majority bypassed a committee to go straight to the floor without hearings on bills of great import? We are going to do that as soon as we come back from the Fourth of July recess. We are going to vote on an estate tax provision that will cost, in the full 10-year period, three quarters of $1 trillion; we are going to vote on it without one hearing, without one committee markup. I will bet you we are not going to hear the argument by the other side that we ought to have hearings on that. This is pretty simple. This is basic math. If you don't want discrimination in the workplace, vote for the Daschle amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have great admiration for the Senator from Wyoming. I have worked with him on many issues. I never find it easy to disagree with a colleague, but let me say with regard to his argument that this is going to be a turnstile to more lawsuits; that is the same argument used on so many occasions and that was used against the ADA. 
   I was on the floor. I remember those debates so well. I participated in them. They said this was going to cause a flurry of lawsuits. 
   Who today would vote to repeal the ADA? I daresay not one Senator--Republican or Democrat. 
   He made reference to the EEOC's position on whether the ADA covers genetic discrimination. I hope they are right. But what is wrong with making absolutely sure they are right? That is what this bill does. This bill isn't complicated. I know some of our colleagues would like to point to the volume of this amendment and say that bulk is clear evidence of complication. 
   We are simply saying, as simply as we can, that you shouldn't discriminate in the workplace; and, if you do, you ought to have some opportunity to redress that problem. 
   I have a real concern as well about what inaction means for research. Dr. Craig Venter was on the Hill on several occasions and has made several public statements. His concern about discrimination is one that we ought to be truly appreciative of as well. Dr. Venter, president of Celera Genomics, said:  
   The biggest concern I have is genetic discrimination. This would be the biggest barrier against having a real medical revolution based on this tremendous new scientific information.  
   Dr. Venter is worried, if we see discrimination, that automatically and almost immediately it is going to bottle up his opportunity to continue the research. 
   I go to the next chart, and look at what others have said. Dr. Collins, somebody I have quoted on several occasions, says:  
   Genetic information and genetic technology can be used in ways that are fundamentally unjust ..... Already, people have lost their jobs, lost their health insurance, and lost their economic well-being because of the misuse of genetic information.  
   It doesn't get any clearer than that. First, you have the top researcher saying they are concerned about the ramifications of a lack of congressional action, not only for job discrimination, but for research. Then you have Dr. Collins who says we have already seen cases where people have lost their jobs and lost their health insurance as a result of this.  
   The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing was equally as concerned in their public statement. Keep in mind that this isn't some Democratic advocate; this is the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing. This is a quote:  
   Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit discrimination in employment and health insurance based on genetic information......Without these protections, individuals will be reluctant to participate in research on, or the application of, genetic testing.  
   How much more information do we need? How many more hearings do we have to have when you have the most credible experts anywhere to be found, here or anywhere else, who are pleading with the Congress to do something before it gets even worse, before more people lose their jobs and their health insurance, and before we see some real ramifications with regard to medical testing? 
   That is what we are doing. That is what this amendment does. That is why it needs to be passed this afternoon. 
   I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I compliment the Senator from New Mexico. He truly has been one of those leaders in the field. In fact, I have before me S. 422 which he introduced in the 105th Congress. Title IV of his bill, discrimination by employers or potential employers, is almost exactly what is in the Daschle amendment this afternoon. 
   He was one of the first to be out there. I give him great credit for what he has already done with his leadership on this issue. He has given some history this afternoon about how this started. He was here in the last Congress advocating that this body oppose discrimination in the workplace. 
   So that everyone knows prior to the time they vote what it is we are talking about, the Jeffords amendment does not prohibit insurers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information in the workplace. The Jeffords amendment does not prohibit the disclosure of test results without consent. It does not prohibit the use of predictive genetic information for hiring. It does not ensure that those who suffer from genetic discrimination have the right to seek redress through legal action. It fails on a basic level with regards to what we ought to do with respect to genetic discrimination. 
   It is on that basis I remind my colleagues that 59 organizations have come forward to urge Members to say no to legislation that fails to regulate the workplace. Don't listen to me. Listen to those organizations. Listen to Craig Venter of the Clera Genomics. Listen to Francis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. Listen to the 
   editorial writers from papers across this country who have said, again and again, we must pass legislation quickly before it is too late. 
   This is a no-brainer. This is our opportunity today to say yes to Craig Venter, to say yes to Dr. Collins, to say yes to the organizations, and to say yes to Terri Seargent, who has already been victimized as a result of this. This is our opportunity to say no to discrimination in the workplace, to say the Senate will go on record for the first time that we will not allow any genetic discrimination regardless of circumstances. 
   I hope on a bipartisan basis our colleagues will join in support of this legislation. The time has come. It was introduced in the last Congress. It is now being offered in this Congress with every expectation and hope that we can send the clearest message possible that we will not tolerate discrimination. We will allow the research to go forward without any question that the information can be protected. That is what we want. That is what the health organizations want. That is what Terri Seargent wants. That is what we all should want in the Senate.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can add my thoughts, I share the view expressed just now by the majority leader. We really want to help the managers finish their work on this bill. They have been working on it now for weeks. We have come a long way. 
   The majority leader has also indicated to colleagues who have concerns about nonrelevant amendments that we will have an opportunity to consider other vehicles immediately following the completion of the Defense authorization bill so we will be able to continue this procedure of a dual track to allow the consideration of other issues. 
   With that understanding, we want to work with the managers to rid ourselves of nonrelevant amendments, stick to those amendments which are relevant in an effort to, as the leader suggested, finish the bill in a matter of a night or two. I commend the managers for the effort they have made thus far. We will work with them to see we finish it.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Rural Recovery Act of 2000 to help address the economic malaise that has gripped certain rural areas of our country. The legislation will authorize the Department of Agriculture to provide grants to rural communities suffering from out-migration and low per-capita income. 
   Rural areas of our nation continue to experience an erosion in their economic well-being. Statistics bear out the decline in rural economic activity, but they fail to fully capture the human suffering that lies just beyond the numbers. Economic downturns lead to the migration away from farm-dependent, rural communities, further stifling economic opportunities for those left behind. The 1990 Census highlighted these migratory trends, and I anticipate that similar trends will be captured by the 2000 Census, as well. 
   In short, the prosperity from which many Americans have benefited from during the past decade has left many rural areas standing by the wayside. If this trend continues, more and more young people will be forced to leave the towns they grew up in for opportunities in urban areas. In towns like Webster, Eureka, and Martin, South Dakota, we are seeing farm families broken up, populations decline, and main street businesses close their doors. While there is no doubt that economic growth in our urban areas has benefited our nation, the disparity of economic development between our rural and urban areas cannot be ignored. If nothing is done to address the economic challenges facing these areas, we will jeopardize the future of rural America. 
   That is why I have introduced legislation to provide the nation's rural areas with the resources necessary to make critical investments in their future and, by doing so, to create economic opportunities that will help them sustain a valuable and important way of life. It also will help rural areas provide basic services at times when they are losing a significant part of  their tax base. While federal agencies, such as the United States Department of Agriculture's Office of Rural Development and the Economic Development Administration, provide assistance for rural development purposes, there are no federal programs that provide a steady source of funding for rural areas most affected by severe out-migration and low per-capita income. For these areas, the process of economic development is often most arduous. This legislation will provide the basic, long-term assistance necessary to aid the coordination efforts of local community leaders as they begin economic recovery efforts and struggle to provide basic public services. 
   County and tribal governments will be able to use this federal funding to improve their industrial parks, purchase land for development, build affordable housing and create economic recovery strategies according to their needs. All of these important steps will help rural communities address their economic problems and plan for long-term growth and development. 
   Mr. President, I believe this legislation holds great potential for revitalizing many of our nation's most neglected and vulnerable areas. I urge my colleagues to support its enactment.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of the thousands of individuals who have been impacted by prenatal exposure to alcohol, their families, and the estimated 12,000 children who will be born with fetal alcohol syndrome, FAS, or fetal alcohol effects, FAE, during the next year. 
   My amendment will provide $25 million to establish a competitive grant program to fund prevention and treatment services to individuals with FAS and FAE and their families. This grant program is absolutely critical for several reasons. 
   FAS and FAE are 100 percent preventable. Despite this fact, the Centers for Disease Control have reported a six-fold increase in the incidence of babies born with FAS between 1960 and 1995. One in five women still drink during pregnancy.  
   Once a child has been born with FAS or FAE, there is still much we can do to help prevent the secondary disabilities that often accompany the disease. 
   For too long, we have treated the birth of an FAS or FAE child as the losing end of a battle, rather than the beginning of one we can win. We have neglected children with FAS and FAE at the peril of those individuals, their families and their communities. 
   Let me illustrate this point with two real life examples--Karli Schrider and Lucy Klene. 
   Twenty-eight years ago, when Karli's mother, Kathy, was pregnant with Karli, it was not uncommon for expectant mothers to be told to ``drink a beer a day for a fat, healthy baby.'' Women who were in danger of miscarrying were sometimes hospitalized and given alcohol intravenously for five or six hours in the mistaken belief it would prevent miscarriage. 
   Back then, it never crossed Kathy's mind that her occasional glasses of wine might be harming her unborn child. Besides, just the year before, Kathy had had another baby who was perfectly healthy, and she drank during that pregnancy too. 
   The first time Karli was misdiagnosed, she was an infant. A doctor attributed her developmental delays to chronic ear infections. When she was 4 years old, a psychologist offered another explanation for Karli's difficulties. He said she was being ``willfully disobedient.'' 
   When Karli was 8, a team of specialists misdiagnosed her again--with cerebral palsy. 
   Eight years later, when Karli was 16, Kathy was training to be a substance abuse counselor. As part of her training, she attended a conference on ``crack babies.'' Sitting in the audience, she was stunned. Every characteristic of ``crack babies'' the lecturer described, Karli had. But Kathy had never used crack. 
   She tracked down the few studies that had been done at that time on the effects of alcohol on fetuses. Again, she saw the same list of symptoms. 
   Years later, researchers would announce that most of the symptoms they originally thought were the result of fetal exposure to crack were actually the result of fetal alcohol exposure, and that alcohol is much more devastating to fetuses than crack--or any other drug. 
   Learning the real cause of Karli's special challenges has not lessened them. FAS and FAE are lifelong conditions. But, knowing the truth has enabled Kathy--and others in Karli's life --to focus less on Karli's deficits, and more on her strengths. 
   One of those strengths is Karli's extraordinary kindness and empathy. In addition to her volunteer work at NOFAS, Karli also volunteers to help people with cerebral palsy, and the elderly. Two years ago, she was named one of America's ``Thousand Points of Light'' by former President Bush. She is an inspiration to everyone who meets her, and one of the reasons I believe so deeply in advocating for children with FAS and FAE. 
   Another reason is a pint-sized girl named Lucy Klene. Lucy is 4 years old. She spent the first two years of her life in an orphanage in Russia. When she was 2, she was adopted by Stephan and Lydia Klene, of Herndon, Virginia. The Klenes also adopted a son from Russia, Paul, who is 3 years old and has no apparent fetal alcohol effects. 
   Within a month after bringing Lucy and Paul home, Stephan and Lydia began to suspect that Lucy had special challenges. Over the next 16 months, Lucy was evaluated eight times by pediatricians and other specialists. 
   Not one of them recognized the symptoms of Lucy's fetal alcohol effects. Finally, scouring the Internet, Stephan stumbled on the truth. He and Lydia took their research to Lucy's pediatrician, who read it and confirmed their hunch. 
   Today, Lucy is a talented little gymnast who attends special education pre-school. And while it's still too early to know for sure, her doctor and parents think there is a good chance she will be able to live an independent and productive life when she grows up. 
   Together, Karli and Lucy illustrate the challenges that families with FAS and FAE face and the need for expanded prevention, early detection and real support for FAS/FAE families. While we have certainly seen progress--it took Karli's family 16 years to get a correct diagnosis and Lucy's family about 16 months--there is still much more that needs to be done. 
   A study recently released by Anne Streissguth at the University of Washington illustrates the importance of early intervention with individuals with FAS and FAE: 
   94 percent of children and adults with FAS experience mental health problems; 
   45 percent exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior; 
   43 percent have a disrupted school experience; 
   42 percent have trouble with the law; 
   Of the 90 adults studied, 83 percent do not live independently and 79 percent have problems with employment; and, 
   72 percent have been victims of physical or sexual abuse or domestic violence. 
   This study also showed that the presence of protective factors such as an early diagnosis and a stable and nurturing home reduce secondary disabilities. Even though early diagnosis is critical for preventing secondary disabilities, only 11 percent of kids and adults studied were diagnosed by age 6. 
   While intensive intervention is critical to enabling individuals with FAS and FAE to live productive, safe lives, there is still widespread ignorance about this disease in the health care, scientific and educational communities. There is little advice available to families on parenting skills or how to utilize outside resources. 
   Even when parents seek help from professionals, those teachers, counselors or health care providers may not have the training to provide necessary assistance or offer the right information. 
   Teachers often do not have the tools they need to serve these special-need students. Physicians frequently do not know which medications to provide, if any. And, like Karli, many individuals with FAS and FAE still remain unidentified and mislabeled as noncompliant or delinquent. 
   This amendment will fund a grant program within HHS to develop FAS training and treatment models that can be replicated around the country. The grant program was authorized by Congress in the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill. The program will provide much-needed assistance to families, who, in many cases, have been bearing the burden of this national public health problem unaided and alone. 
   The grant program will be directed by the Centers for Disease Control and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Portions of the funding for the grant will come from each of these agencies. 
   It is time for Congress to join those who have already dedicated time and resources to this effort. Particularly, I want to recognize the National Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome that has been aiding children and families and fighting for prevention for the last 10 years. I would also like to thank the directors of the Family Resource Institute, who have educated and been a voice for parents of children with alcohol-related birth defects. I also greatly appreciate the work of those in my own state, including Judy Struck and those at the University Affiliated Program, Charles Schaad, and the South Dakota March of Dimes. 
   The National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, NIAAA, has been studying FAS and FAE for more than 20 years, and it has provided excellent leadership with the Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee. The Centers for Disease Control and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration should also be commended for their growing dedication to this cause. 
   We have developed a model for dealing with FAS and FAE that will bring our nation's best scientists together with advocates, service providers and families and will enable us to develop our knowledge of successful prevention, diagnosis, early detection, and education. It is the result of extensive consultation and input from experts in the field. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this important amendment.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join in the request made by the majority leader to try to cooperate in a way to allow us closure on this bill. He has proposed an aggressive agenda. At the very least, we have to finish this bill. As he said, there are scores of amendments that have to be addressed before we can complete our work. I want to finish this bill this week. I want to be as cooperative and as forceful with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in accommodating that kind of schedule. We have been on this bill, and we have had a good debate with good amendments and a lot of votes. There will be more amendments and votes. 
   There comes a time when we have to try to bring this to a close. I want to do it as soon as we can and still accommodate Senators who have good amendments to offer. Please come to the floor and agree to time limits for each amendment. Work with us to see if we can't winnow down the list a little bit. We have had some cooperation, but it is going to take a lot more cooperation if we, indeed, are going to get the bill done on time. 
   I believe we are ready to vote, Mr. President.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is passing S. 1515, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act Amendments of 2000. I deeply appreciate the hard work of my colleague, Senator HATCH, in developing this legislation and bringing it to this point. 
   Hundreds of former uranium workers in South Dakota and thousands across the nation have developed cancer and other life-threatening diseases as a result of their work producing uranium on behalf of the United States government. Although the federal government knew that this work put the health of these men and women at risk, it failed to take appropriate steps to warn or protect them. 
   In 1990, Congress passed landmark legislation to compensate these individuals. The legislation before us today takes critically-needed steps to amend this act to make it easier for victims to apply for and receive compensation. It also broadens the availability of compensation by updating the list of compensable diseases to take into account the latest science and by extending compensation to groups of workers excluded from the original law. Most importantly, it makes compensation available to workers in all states, including my home state of South Dakota. The original law limited compensation to workers in five states only, despite the fact that workers in other states faced identical circumstances. 
   It is critical that we pass this legislation as quickly as possible in order to provide these individuals with compensation. Many are sick, and unable to afford adequate health insurance. This compensation will provide them with vital assistance. 
   While I believe we need to send this legislation to the President immediately, there is one issue I hope to address as quickly as possible. The current version of this legislation sets different standards of eligibility for compensation for uranium millers and uranium miners. Uranium millers must demonstrate that they worked in a mill for a year. However, miners must demonstrate that they were exposed to 40 or more working level months of radiation. Given that miners' records about their level of exposure have now been lost, or were kept inaccurately, I believe we should set the one year standard for both categories of workers. Would the Senator from Utah agree at the first available opportunity to seek to amend this legislation to state that miners must simply demonstrate that they worked in a mine for one year to be eligible to receive compensation?

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Air Force is currently evaluating five military bases to see which would be the best home for its new unmanned surveillance craft, known as Global Hawk. Accordingly, the Air Force is using the final 2 weeks of June to send a team out to each of the five candidates to solicit public opinion on potential environmental impacts. The next such meeting occurs Friday in Rapid City, SD and focuses on Ellsworth Air Force Base. 
   For the past year or so, I have been making the case for Ellsworth to senior officials in the Department of Defense and the Air Force. Perhaps not surprisingly, I firmly believe Ellsworth represents the best choice for the Air Force to host this important new mission. As we approach the date of the Air Force's meeting in South Dakota, I thought I would say a few words here in the Senate about why I feel as strongly as I do. Although I am confident none of my colleagues will be surprised by this position, they may find some of what I have to say about Ellsworth surprising. 
   Friday's meeting moves the Air Force one step closer to a deployment decision on the Global Hawk system. I and the scores of other supporters of Ellsworth welcome a careful, objective review. We are confident that at the end of such a process the Air Force will conclude that Ellsworth is the most appropriate home for the Air Force's next generation of surveillance aircraft. 
   We hold this view for three very important reasons. First, geography. Ellsworth offers uncrowded airspace and largely open spaces. Such a setting is ideal for conducting the kinds of training missions necessary to ensure the Air Force maximizes the technological possibilities offered by Global Hawk. 
   The second reason Ellsworth has an edge over its competitors is base infrastructure. Many people who have never visited Ellsworth or who have not visited recently will be surprised to see the modern facilities at this base. Many people perceive Ellsworth as a sleepy, rundown former Strategic Air Command Base. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a result of years of effort, it now has the facilities to match the fine personnel it has always had. 
   The final advantage Ellsworth enjoys is community support that is as deep as it is widespread. From elected officials, to business owners, to hardworking South Dakotan families living in the surrounding area, all stand completely behind what Ellsworth does for South Dakota and our national security. The Air Force will be hard pressed to find a community more supportive of its mission. 
   For all of these reasons, I stand behind Ellsworth and welcome the Air Force to my state so they can see first hand what I have been talking about in meetings with defense officials and here today on the Senate floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to commend the passage of the bipartisan Kennedy-Smith Amendment--the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2000. The Senate's consideration of this important measure was long overdue and its passage is one of the major civil rights victories of this century. 
   We are all aware of the tragic deaths of James Byrd in Texas and Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. James Byrd was murdered because of the color of his skin. Matthew Shepard was murdered because of his sexual orientation. 
   In the Byrd killing, the federal government could help. 
   In the Shepard killing, the federal government could not help local law enforcement. Why? Because our current hate crimes statute is full of holes and desperately needs to be updated. 
   Right now the federal hate crimes law does not cover disability, gender or sexual orientation. In addition, the federal government can prosecute only those crimes where the victim was chosen because he or she was engaged in a ``federally protected activity,'' such as attending public school or serving as a juror. That is a very narrow basis on which to bring a lawsuit. 
   Because Matthew Shepard was killed because he was gay, the federal government could not provide the resources Laramie, Wyoming's law enforcement so desperately needed. This is why our federal hate crimes law ought to apply whenever a hate crime occurs. 
   Last year Dennis and Judy Shepard, Matthew's parents, came to Capitol Hill to plead with us to broaden the hate crimes law. I suspect that no Senator who met them will ever forget their words or the anguish in their eyes. It was an anguish that probably only a parent who has lost a child can possibly understand. 
   During their visit to Capitol Hill, and all across America, the Shepards have found the strength to talk about their own tragic experience to help prevent other parents from experiencing their nightmare. Had we not passed the Kennedy-Smith Amendment we would have been ignoring their pleas, and the pleas of so many others. 
   The Kennedy-Smith Amendment will end, once and for all, the contortions that federal prosecutors must undertake to exercise jurisdiction over hate crimes. The Hatch Amendment will not. 
   The Kennedy-Smith Amendment will allow federal authorities to assist in state and local prosecutions of hate crimes on the basis of disability, gender and sexual orientation. The Hatch Amendment will not. 
   We don't need to collect more data on hate crimes. We don't need to analyze the problem. We need to solve it. 
   We already collect information on hate crimes and the statistics are grim. In the last year for which we have statistics, 1998, almost 8,000 hate crime incidents were reported. 
   And we already know that state and local law enforcement needs our help because they have told us so. The National Sheriff's Association has told us so. The International Association of Police Chiefs has told us so. Both the Sheriff and Police Commander of Laramie, Wyoming have urged us to pass the Kennedy-Smith Amendment. The Laramie Sheriff and Police Commander came with Dennis and Judy Shepard to Capitol Hill. They told us what it meant for their departments to be without the assistance of the federal government in investigating and prosecuting Matthew Shepard's murder. It meant that they had to lay off 5 law enforcement officials as a result of the financial strain of the prosecution of Matthew Shepard's killers. 
   If the Kennedy-Smith Amendment had been law, those officers would not have been laid off. 
   We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will bring about substantial change. We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will provide law enforcement, in places like Laramie, Wyoming, the tools they need to investigate and prosecute hate crimes wherever they occur. We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will send a strong message that the federal government will prosecute every hate crime with vigor. 
   I am proud that this Senate has now stood with Dennis and Judy Shepard. I am proud this Senate did not let the politics of misunderstanding keep us from enacting a bill that would enable prosecutions of crimes motivated by hatred of gays and lesbians--the motivation for some of the most vicious hate crimes. 
   There are those who argued that this amendment was not needed because it only affects a small percentage of Americans. I am troubled by this suggestion. Hate crimes diminish us all. Did this Congress say, in 1965, that we didn't need a Civil Rights Act because racial discrimination ``only'' affected a small percentage of Americans? No. We are talking about basic protections that all Americans should be afforded. If they are denied to any of us, we are all affected. 
   We must make sure that the federal government leaves no American unprotected. The Kennedy-Smith Amendment is a bipartisan, reasonable, measured response to a serious problem. Now we must ensure that it becomes law.

I wanted to come to the floor to associate myself with his eloquence and his heartfelt expression regarding this important moment in the life of one of the most respected and revered U.S. Senators today. 
   At long last, our country will recognize the valor, the courage, and the extraordinary commitment that one man made to his country now over 50 years ago. 
   I know I speak for all of our colleagues--frankly, all of the country--in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to him, our admiration for him, and the extraordinary pride we have in the knowledge that we served with him. 
   Senator DAN INOUYE is not only an extraordinary Senator and great American in this day of the dearth of the hero; we find the true hero in DAN INOUYE. There ought to be more role models in our country today. But if one looks to the DAN INOUYEs, you don't need many more. 
   I have admired him for the kind of person he is, for the kind of model that he has been, and for the extraordinarily unique and very remarkable way in which he represents his State and all of the people he serves so well in the Senate. 
   The people of Hawaii can be very proud of their delegation. They can be very proud of their senior Senator, and on this day in particular they can be very proud of this country in recognizing the remarkable achievement for which this unique leader has now been recognized. 
   So we congratulate Senator INOUYE. We congratulate him not only on being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, but we congratulate him for his lifetime of service to his country--not only in the military but here in the Senate as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think we all agree how important it is for our young people to understand the history of our nation and how the events of the past have helped to shape our country today and will continue to shape it in the future. 
   On August 3, 1949, Congress designated June 14 as Flag Day. Last week, a Dallas Morning News editorial reminded us of the origins and meaning of this national day of commemoration. Flag Day was established to ensure that each year on that day we recall our nation's proud history and its role as a symbol of freedom and democracy to our citizens and to people around the world fighting for justice. I was much surprised to discover that this editorial, written with great wisdom and eloquence, was penned by Elizabeth McGarr, an intern at the Dallas Morning News in her first week with the newspaper. 
   America is a diverse and culturally rich country, but as Elizabeth points out in her editorial, we are all able to unite around the flag and celebrate our commitment to the ideals embodied in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth, who has just graduated from the Hockaday School in Dallas and will attend the University of Texas in the fall, is an outstanding role model for her peers and every American. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth McGarr's editorial be entered into the RECORD.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, when I was in high school, there was a great deal of discussion in the Senate and across the country about our country's role in preserving and promoting world peace. With the end of the cold war, the focus of that debate has changed dramatically. The arms race with the Soviet Union and the threat of communism spreading in Europe are, thankfully, a part of our history. The challenge of promoting peace, however, is as relevant today as it was at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
   From Northern Ireland to the Middle East; from Africa to Asia, too many innocent lives are destroyed by war and violence. We must be creative in developing and adapting strategies for peace. Thankfully, there are young people from across the country who have given thoughtful consideration to how to create and sustain peace in the world. The National Peace Essay Contest recognizes high school students who have articulated a commitment to peace, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to recognize one of those young people. 
   Tomorrow, I will meet with David Redlinger of Watertown, South Dakota who is this year's South Dakota winner of the National Peace Essay Contest. David's essay on Tajikistan and Sudan is eloquent, and demonstrates his commitment to the fight for peace in the world. I would like to congratulate David, and I ask that his essay be inserted into the RECORD.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this weekend we will commemorate an important day in American history. June 25th, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, will provide all Americans the opportunity to pause and remember the men and women who fought and died in the Korean War. 
   Some historians refer to the Korean War as the ``forgotten war.'' Perhaps the reason the Korean War has receded in our memories is because it was unlike either the war that preceded it or the war that followed it. Rationing brought World War II into every American home. And television brought the Vietnam War into every home with unforgettable images and daily updates. 
   But Korea was different. Except for those who actually fought there, Korea was a distant land and eventually, a distant memory. Today, as we remember those who served in Korea, it is fitting that we remember what happened in Korea, and why we fought there. 
   The wall of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, bears an inscription that reads, ``Freedom is not free.'' And in the case of South Korea, the price of repelling communist aggression and preserving freedom was very high indeed. Nearly one-and-a-half million Americans fought to prevent the spread of communism into South Korea. It was the bloodiest armed conflict in which our nation has ever engaged. In three years, 54,246 Americans died in Korea--nearly as many as were killed during the 15 years of the Vietnam War. 
   The nobility of their sacrifice is now recorded for all of history in the Korean War Veterans Memorial. As you walk through the memorial and look into the faces of the 19 soldier-statues, you can feel the danger surrounding them. But you can also feel the courage with which our troops confronted that danger. It is a fitting tribute, indeed, to the sacrifices of those who fought and died in Korea. 
   But there is also another tribute half a world away. And that is democracy in the Republic of South Korea. Over the last five decades, the special relationship between our two nations that was forged in war has grown into a genuine partnership. Our two nations are more prosperous, and the world is safer, because of it. 
   The historic summit in North Korea earlier this month offers new hope for a reduction in tensions and enhanced stability in the region. We can dream of a day when Korea is unified under a democratic government and freedom is allowed to thrive. 
   As we continue to move forward, however, we pause today to remember how the free world won an important battle in the struggle against communism in South Korea. Let us not forget that it is the responsibility of all those who value freedom to remember that struggle and to honor those who fought it. The enormous sacrifices they made for our country should never be forgotten.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader in his commendation of an extraordinary part of this wonderful institution. Jim Talbert, as the majority leader has indicated, is retiring at the end of this week as the Superintendent of the Senate Periodical Press Gallery. He is one of hundreds of members of our Capitol family whom C-SPAN viewers never see but without whom this institution would simply not function. He has served Congress with distinction for 32 years. 
   Born on February 22, 1943, in Washington, D.C., he has resided here all of his life. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in journalism in 1964 and began his career on Capitol Hill in 1966, covering politics for the Timmons News Service. 
   In 1968, he joined the House Daily Press Gallery where he worked for 23 years. Much to our good fortune, he came to the Senate in 1991 as the Superintendent of the Senate Periodical Press Gallery. The periodical gallery is one of three press galleries in the Senate. It is the nerve center for Capitol Hill reporters representing national and local magazines and newsletters. More than 1,700 journalists representing 250 different news organizations are credentialed to use the Periodical Press Gallery to file stories, stay in contact with home offices, and get information on Senate activities. As head of the periodical gallery, Jim approves credentials for reporters covering Capitol Hill. He acts as a liaison between the press and Senate staff and keeps up-to-the-minute information on what is happening on the Senate floor. 
   Reporters do not turn to Jim simply for information about where a press conference is being held or when a bill might be coming to the floor. They also depend on his vast knowledge of Senate history and legislative procedure to make sense of our sometimes confusing parliamentary rules. He is a professional, an efficient and fairminded person in carrying out all of his duties. He is also generous and always has a humorous story to share. 
   While his departure will have reporters scrambling to find a good source on Senate procedure, he can leave knowing that the periodical gallery staff he has worked so hard to train is committed to maintaining his same high standards. 
   Besides his retirement, Jim will celebrate another happy milestone this year. In 1995, Jim was diagnosed with throat cancer. In his 5-year fight to beat cancer, he endured several rounds of radiation treatment and surgery and missed only 1 month of work. Recently, Jim was declared cancer free. 
   Finally, I always sensed that there was something unusually wise about Jim. That hunch was confirmed recently when I learned that he and his wife, Judy, will be moving to her hometown, Brookings, SD, home of South Dakota State University. I can't think of a better place to retire. I am glad to call them constituents and look forward to seeing them many times in my State and now their State. 
   I wish Jim and Judy well. Jim has served this Senate with dedication and distinction. I look forward to being able to serve with him, for a change, as his Senator. I wish him and Judy all of the best as they begin their new life in South Dakota.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just urge the cooperation of all Senators. The only way this dual track is going to work is if we can accommodate each other's needs. That is what generated our agreement to address both bills in this fashion. Senators on both sides want to be accommodated. They have amendments to offer. This allows for that process to continue--to allow amendments on Defense authorization  in the morning up until early afternoon, and then to take up appropriations in the afternoon--so that we can work through the appropriations bills that we know we must get done. 
   We will be unable to go to appropriations bills in the future if we can't continue to accommodate each other's needs. I think this is working well. I hope we can continue to work well to work off the list of amendments. Senator REID does his magic with our list, and I know we have our colleagues on the other side who are attempting to do the same there. But we ought to have these votes and debates. I think it is good for the country and good for the institution to be able to have the opportunity to debate some of these issues. That is what we are doing, and that is why you see the cooperation you have this week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 10 years ago, I met with an extraordinary group of people in the basement of a home in suburban Maryland, just outside Washington, DC. They came from all kinds of backgrounds and fields, but they were united by one common desire, and that was to try to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and help children and families who are living with its consequences. 
   The other night, I saw some of those same people again at a reception celebrating the 10th anniversary of NOFAS, the National Organization for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 
   Born in that suburban Maryland basement 10 years ago, NOFAS is now the world's leading clearinghouse for information on fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects. I am proud to say that my wife and I serve on its board of directors. 
   At the reception the other night, I was asked to say a few words about why I support NOFAS. I could have cited its pivotal role in the significant advances in our understanding of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect. Ten years ago, we knew very little about fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects, its only slightly milder version. Today, we know that as many as 40,000 children are born each year in this country with FAS and other alcohol-related conditions, costing Americans more than $3 billion a year in direct health care expenses. 
   We know that fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading known cause of mental retardation among children. We know that FAS and FAE are both 100 percent preventable when pregnant women abstain from alcohol. And we know now that there is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy. That is progress, and it is possible we still would not know these things today were it not for 10 years of diligent and dedicated work by the National Organization for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Instead, I talked about two other reasons that I support NOFAS. Those reasons are Karli Schrider and Lucy Klene. If you ever drop by the NOFAS office in Washington on a Friday afternoon, there is a good chance you will run into Karli. She volunteers at NOFAS every Friday stuffing information packets. It is one of her many volunteer jobs. 
   Twenty-eight years ago, when Karli's mother, Kathy, was pregnant with Karli, it was not uncommon for expectant mothers to be told to ``drink a beer a day for a fat, healthy baby.'' Women who were in danger of miscarrying were sometimes hospitalized and given alcohol intravenously for 5 or 6 hours in the mistaken belief it would prevent miscarriage. Back then, it never crossed Kathy's mind that her occasional glasses of wine might be harming her unborn child. Besides, just the year before, Kathy had had another baby who was perfectly healthy, and she drank during that pregnancy, too. The first time Karli was misdiagnosed, she was an infant. A doctor attributed her developmental delays to chronic ear infections. 
   When he was 4 years old, a psychologist offered another explanation for Karli's difficulties. He said she was  being ``willfully disobedient.'' When Karli was 8, a team of specialists misdiagnosed her again with cerebral palsy. Eight years later, when Karli was 16, Kathy was training to be a substance abuse counselor. As part of her training, she attended a conference on crack babies. 
   Sitting in the audience, she was stunned. Every characteristic of crack babies the lecturer described, Karli had. But Kathy had never used crack. She tracked down the few studies that had been done at that time on the effects of alcohol on fetuses. Again, she saw the same list of symptoms. 
   Years later, researchers would announce that most of the symptoms they originally thought were the result of fetal exposure to crack were actually the result of fetal alcohol exposure, and that alcohol is much more devastating to fetuses than crack or any other drug. That was 11 years ago, before NOFAS was born. Learning the real cause of Karli's special challenges has not erased those challenges. FAS and FAE are lifelong conditions. 
   But knowing the truth has enabled Kathy--and others in Karli's life to focus less on Karli's deficits, and more on her strengths. One of those strengths is Karli's extraordinary kindness and empathy. In addition to her volunteer work at NOFAS, Karli also volunteers to help people with cerebral palsy and the elderly. Two years ago, she was named one of America's ``Thousand Points of Life'' by former President Bush. She is an inspiration to everyone who meets her, and one of the reasons I believe so deeply in the work NOFAS does. 
   Another reason I believe in NOFAS is because of a pint-sized little girl named Lucy Klene. Lucy is 4 years old. She spent the first two years of her life in an orphanage in Russia. When she was 2, she was adopted by Stephan and Lydia Klene, of Herndon, VA. The Klenes also adopted a son from Russia, Paul, who is 3 years old and has no apparent fetal alcohol effects. Within a month after bringing Lucy and Paul home, Stephan and Lydia began to suspect that Lucy had special challenges. Over the next 16 months, Lucy was evaluated eight times by pediatricians and other specialists. Not one of them recognized the symptoms of Lucy's fetal alcohol effects. Finally, scouring the Internet, Stephan stumbled on the truth. He and Lydia took their research to Lucy's pediatrician, who read it and confirmed their hunch. 
   Today, Lucy is a talented little gymnast who attends special education preschool. While it is still too early to know for sure, her doctor and parents think there is a good chance she will be able to live an independent and productive life when she grows up. Together, Karli and Lucy illustrate some of the progress that has been made in the 10 years since NOFAS was born. We still have a long way to go. Today children with FAS and FAE are being diagnosed earlier. That means they are getting help earlier, which means they have a better chance at full and productive lives. 
   It took Karli's family 16 years to get a correct diagnosis. It took Lucy's family 16 months. That is progress. Eleven years ago, when Karli was diagnosed, there was very little research on the effects of alcohol on fetuses. Ten years later, Lucy's father was able to find an enormous amount of information on the Internet. Slowly but surely, the studies are being done and the information is reaching the people who need it. That is real progress. When Karli was diagnosed, there were few, if any, people Kathy could turn to for support and advice. Today, Stephan and Lydia attend a NOFAS support group for parents of children with FAS and FAE, and they know they are not alone. That, too, is progress. 
   At the reception the other night, we celebrated an incredible milestone, the 10th anniversary of NOFAS. But next Thursday, June 15, will mark another milestone. At the urging of Stephan and Lydia, in Fairfax, VA, the school district will hold its first ever meeting to help preschool teachers recognize FAS and FAE and help children and families living with this challenge each and every day. And NOFAS will conduct the training. That is real progress. 
   I hope everyone today will recognize how fortunate we are--those of us lucky enough to be born healthy, those of us lucky enough to be born without fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effect. 
   I hope everyone will congratulate those who have worked so diligently over the course of the last 10 years to make NOFAS what it is today, and to recognize NOFAS for the difference they are making in the lives of Karli and Lucy and hundreds of thousands of others who live with the challenges of FAS and FAE, and for millions of babies who have been born healthy these last 10 years because of NOFAS. May their next 10 years be even more remarkable. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me second what the majority leader has just said. I appreciate the fact that he has taken this bill to the floor under the regular order. I have indicated a desire to work with him to complete work on this bill under regular order. Again, as I always do, I thank the assistant Democratic leader for his efforts in trying to narrow the scope and the list. 
   We have to start here. Now we know what the universe is. Unfortunately, I think the universe includes the ``kitchen sink'' in this case. I think it is important to try to eliminate the ``kitchen sink'' and other matters that may or may not be essential to take up. I think there are nonrelevant matters that could be taken up under very short time constraints, as we are about to do. We need to finish the bill as well. I certainly plan to work with the majority leader to see that we accomplish that over the course of the next couple of days.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I come to the floor this afternoon--reluctance because we had hoped that this would not be necessary. We had hoped that the action taken by the Senate--now almost a year ago--would have provided us with an opportunity to have finished by now the work begun more than a year ago. The Senate acted in a way that we felt was not as acceptable as we would have liked. The House acted in a way that met the expectations of many of us. On a bipartisan basis the House passed a bill to protect patients' rights in ways that I think lives up to the expectations not only of those of us who have advocated this legislation but of the American people and many others who care deeply about these circumstances. 
   It was our hope that the conferees, over the course of the last 12 months, could have resolved differences and we could have sent this legislation to the President by now. That has not happened. 
   Under the circumstances, we are left with no choice but to come to the floor and once again have the debate and press the issue--to try to say with as much definition as we can that this legislation must pass; that this legislation must be sent to the President; that this legislation must be signed into law. 
   The urgency of our effort could not be better represented than by what we see on the charts immediately behind me. The first chart shows what is happening to patients day by day as this Congress fails to act. The Patients' Bill of Rights affects thousands and thousands of people on a daily basis--thousands of people who go into hospitals and clinics hoping that they might be able to get the care they so desperately need. 
   This chart says it all when it comes to what happens to patients as a result of our inaction. 
   Thirty-five thousand Americans on a daily basis fail to get the kind of care they absolutely have to have to restore their health. 
   Thirty-five thousand people are denied specialty care in instances when doctors have prescribed it. 
   Thirty-one thousand are forced on a daily basis to change doctors--we are not talking about what has happened over the course of the last 12 months. We are saying every single day in the United States of America that 31,000 people are forced to change doctors, against their will in many cases. 
   Eighteen-thousand are forced to change medication. 
   Fifty-nine thousand a day, as a result of the inaction in the Congress--a number exceeding the second largest city in  the State of South Dakota--are subjected to more pain and suffering and a worsening of their condition. 
   Those aren't our figures. Those are figures from the California Managed Care Improvement Task Force and other reputable organizations that have analyzed the cost of the inaction in the Congress over the course of the last year. 
   A second way to look at this issue is doctors' perceptions of our inaction. 
   The number of doctors each day who see patients with a serious decline in health as a result of health plan abuse is striking. 
   Fourteen-thousand people are denied coverage of recommended prescription drugs as a result of our inaction. 
   Ten-thousand are denied coverage of needed diagnostic tests. 
   Seven-thousand are denied referral to needed specialty care. 
   Six-thousand are denied overnight hospital stay, and 6,000 are denied referral to mental health and substance abuse treatment. 
   One could just sit down after that and say the Senate must act. Let's vote. I think those numbers are as compelling a reason as I have heard about the importance of this body acting on this legislation, as we should have acted now more than 12 months ago. We have not acted. And tens of thousands of people are paying a price that they shouldn't have to pay because we have not acted. 
   I have been encouraged by correspondence that we have been sent just in the last few hours: One from the sponsors of the legislation on the House side, Congressman CHARLIE NORWOOD, and Congressman JOHN DINGELL.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an excerpt from the statement:  
   Rhetoric is not enough. The Senate must do the right thing and pass the Norwood-Dingell provisions.  
   You can't say it any more directly nor any more powerfully than that--whether it is the sponsors of the House-passed bipartisan bill, or whether it is those in the trenches on a daily basis who recognize the importance and the urgency of this issue and have asked us to address it posthaste, or whether it is the thousands of people out there being denied health care on a daily basis. The commitment we must make to those who are left in the lurch must be restated and reemphasized. The only way to restate and reemphasize our commitment to their need is to pass this bipartisan bill this afternoon as part of this vehicle. 
   I share the view expressed by some that we don't want to slow down this bill. We just had that discussion on another amendment. I recognize that. It is for that reason that we have expressed a willingness to limit the debate on this amendment to no more than 2 hours, with an hour on each side. 
   We want to move this legislation. But we also want to move the defense bill. We can do that by limiting the amount of time, and we have voluntarily accommodated those who wish to move this legislation quickly by allowing the time limit on this amendment. 
   I think it is very clear why we are offering this amendment, when you look at what it does and why it is so important and the pressing need for it. Again, I emphasize it was passed on a strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives. 
   When you look at this chart, it lays out in a very short and succinct manner the differences between what--on a bipartisan basis the House has supported and many of us now support in the Senate--versus what our Republican colleagues in the Senate have advocated as their response to the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights for the country today. 
   First and foremost, protecting all patients and making sure that everybody has access to protections is a fundamental difference between the bipartisan plan and the Republican plan. We protect all patients; they don't. 
   Holding plans accountable is the second criteria by which we judge whether or not we are truly interested in solving this problem. 
   Accountability has to be the first or second priority if we are truly going to resolve these problems and address the concerns raised by millions of Americans. 
   The bipartisan plan holds insurance companies accountable. Unfortunately, the Republican plan does not. 
   Definitions of medical necessity are a very complex and increasingly disturbing way with which the insurance companies eliminate access to good quality care. 
   We ensure unfair definitions of ``medical necessity'' used by insurance companies don't prevent patients from getting needed care. Our bipartisan plan  addresses that issue. The Republicans do not. 
   Guaranteed access to specialists is also an issue that so many people believe needs to be resolved. We address it. The Republicans barely address it at all. 
   We can go down the list. Access to OB/GYN, access to clinical trials, access to nonphysician providers, choice of providers, point-of-service, emergency room access, prohibition of improper financial incentives. On all of these issues and many more, there is a clear choice between what the Republicans have proposed and what the bipartisan plan adopted in the House requires. 
   Time is running out. We have about 21 legislative days between now and the August recess. We have about 15 legislative days when we come back from the August recess. We have fewer and fewer days with which to resolve these differences. The time has come now to simply take what has been passed in theHouse, pass it in the Senate, add it to this bill, get it to the President, and send a clear message that our commitment to resolving these issues could not be stronger. 
   Our commitment has not eroded. We are determined to deal with this issue this year on a bipartisan basis. We join with our House colleagues in addressing the issue in a comprehensive way. That is what this amendment does. That is why we hope on a bipartisan basis we can make an unequivocal statement about our commitment for resolving this matter first and foremost in this context today. 
   I am deeply appreciative of the extraordinary leadership provided, once again, by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. No one has committed more time and effort and has demonstrated more leadership on an issue than he. On behalf of the entire Democratic caucus, I am extraordinarily grateful to him, appreciative of his leadership and his determination to resolve this matter in a successful way before the end of this session of Congress. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate has just spoken on one of the most important national security issues facing this Nation today--the quality of health care services we provide for those who have so selflessly served this Nation. As pointed out during this debate, we promised millions of Americans lifetime, quality healthcare as partial compensation for their service to this country. Sadly, for far too many of America's veterans, this promise remains unfulfilled. 
   The amendments just voted on by the Senate represent efforts by their supporters to keep that commitment. These measures adopted a fundamentally different approach toward solving this problem. And although I had some reservations about each, I supported both. 
   I would like to briefly discuss my reasons for doing so. However, before getting into the specifics of these very different amendments, I would like to commend the efforts of Senators JOHNSON and WARNER. As a result of their hard work, we are much closer than ever before to keeping our health care commitment to this Nation's veterans. They are both to be commended for keeping this issue alive and forcing the Senate to deal with it on the bill currently before us. 
   Under current law, military retirees under the age of 65 are eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime or to use TRICARE's insurance programs. Those who use TRICARE's insurance may also seek care at a military treatment facility, MTF, on a space-available basis. Once retirees turn 65, they are no longer eligible to use TRICARE, though they may continue to seek care at an MTF when space is available. The same eligibility rules apply to survivors of veterans. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the current system are well known to thousands of America's veterans. I receive letters virtually every week describing the failures of TRICARE. 
   Senator JOHNSON's amendment would address some of these failures and increase health insurance benefits for retirees. Specifically, retirees who entered military service before June 7, 1956 and their spouses would be able to use military health insurance and enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP. Those enrolling in FEHBP would pay no out-of-pocket premiums. Military retirees who entered the service after June 7, 1956 and their survivors would be eligible for increase coverage regardless of their age. They could either enroll in FEHBP or use TRICARE's insurance program. 
   Senator JOHNSON's amendment clearly would provide better health care coverage for millions of veterans. My concerns with it are twofold and both are cost-related. First, I am somewhat troubled by the overall cost of this proposal. Although I believe no price is too high to keep our commitment to America's veterans--and Senator JOHNSON's amendment certainly represents a giant step in that direction--I wonder whether there may be a more cost effective means of doing so. Second, I am concerned that for those retirees who entered service after 1956 and who choose FEHBP, the Government would only pick up about 70 percent of the premium. Retirees and their families would be expected to pick up the remaining 30 percent. Depending on the plan chosen, this could represent an annual out-of-pocket expense of $2,000 or more--not an insignificant expenditure for many. 
   Senator WARNER's amendment also has merit as well as one fundamental flaw. Under the Warner amendment, all Medicare-eligible retirees would be allowed to remain in TRICARE. In other words, TRICARE would be a second-payer to Medicare, covering certain costs above and beyond those covered by Medicare. This change would greatly improve the quality of health care provided to our Nation's veterans. Unfortunately, in order to comply with a flawed Republican budget resolution, Senator WARNER was forced to sunset this new benefit in 2003. In other words, the Warner amendment provides veterans a new health benefit with one hand and, two years later, takes it away with the other. 
   As I said at the outset, I supported both of these amendments despite the flaws I have just discussed. I did so because I believe it is important we focus on the forest and not the trees and because both of these amendments would bring us closer to keeping this Nation's commitment to its military retirees. And I did so because I believed it was the right thing to do. I commend Senators WARNER and JOHNSON for their work on behalf of our veterans and look forward to working with them to fulfill the promise we made to those who sacrificed so much to serve this Nation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate the distinguished chairman and his interest in accommodating the many colleagues who want to offer amendments. I think we are almost there. I don't think we are quite able to reach agreement yet on this side. I wonder if it would be appropriate, given the fact that we could not yet agree to that sequencing, if we might proceed with the amendment to be offered by the Senator from Nevada, and while that amendment was being considered, address the other parts of the unanimous  consent request just propounded by the Senator from Virginia. If he would be interested in pursuing that approach, we might be able to find some final resolution to the other elements of the proposal he suggested.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we address two issues vital to our Nation's farmers and ranchers: the need to reform the Federal Crop Insurance Program, and the need for financial relief to help producers deal with the third year in a row of low prices. 
   I support this Crop Insurance conference report, and I will vote for it. But I must also express my deep concerns about the farm relief provisions of the bill. 
   Half of this bill represents Congress at its best. 
   Last year Congress was given a mandate to improve the federal crop insurance program--both by the strength of public support for reform, and by the Budget Committee's allocation of $6 billion last year and $8 billion this year expressly to implement that reform. 
   Half of this bill responds to that call, and offers increased benefits to farmers. Those benefits are well-conceived, and they are equitable. 
   The program invests public resources in a system that effectively leverages funds in the private sector, and empowers producers to use their own best judgment in managing their production risk. 
   I want to thank my colleagues and their staffs, who have dedicated long hours over the past year, for their excellent work in reforming this vital program. 
   However, I believe that the other half of this bill represents a low moment for Congress. 
   The other half of this bill represents, for the third year in a row, Congress' stubborn refusal to address another significant risk of farming: price risk. 
   Across the country, and for numerous commodities, poor prices have dogged producers for three years now. 
   The $7.1 billion in this bill that will go to producers as ad hoc emergency relief is critically needed in the countryside. We should be providing resources to struggling farmers and ranchers. 
   But I am deeply disappointed with the way the funds are distributed. 
   Clearly, it would have been impossible to perfectly match resources to need--particularly under the time constraints we face. 
   But we could have done better than this. 
   This year could have been different than the past two years. Producers pleaded with Congress to make it different, and it should have been different. 
   First, by including the relief allocation in the Budget resolution, the Budget Committee allowed Congress to avoid the rancorous fight over emergency spending authorization that has plagued us in the past two years. 
   Second, in contrast to the previous two years, this year the Agriculture Committee was made the arbiter of how the funding would be allocated. 
   This should have resulted in hearings and the kind of substantive, constructive debate that yields good policy. 
   Third, Congress was given a deadline of June 29 by which to determine how to spend this money, which provided more than adequate time for such a debate to occur. 
   Despite all of these advantages, here we are, a month early, with a bill produced in the very same way as the two emergency relief bills that preceded it--behind closed doors, without the free and open exchange of ideas, and without the opportunity for amendments by members on behalf of their constituents. 
   So, we are left with farm relief that I and many of my colleagues believe is deeply flawed. 
   Once again, our assistance fails to target family farmers. 
   Once again, it wastes public dollars on the biggest operators, who have little or no need for emergency relief. 
   Once again, it wastes public dollars on some people who do not farm at all. 
   Most importantly--once again--it fails to meet critical needs in farm country. 
   With over $7 billion at our disposal, Agriculture Committee jurisdiction, and time for debate, not one hearing has been held to assess the scope of need. 
   A flawed process has produced a flawed bill. But because farmers and ranchers are in need of relief, I intend to vote for the conference report. 
   For the third year in a row, I urge my colleagues to acknowledge the failures of current farm policy, and come together to change it. 
   We need policies that better address the interests of family farmers and ranchers. 
   In addition to crop insurance, fair trade, and competitive opportunities for all producers, farmers and ranchers must have an income safety-net that can offset severe price fluctuations, and that can help manage uncertainties in the marketplace. 
   Such policies are critical to long-term survival in an industry in which the majority of producers operate on margins of less than 5 percent. 
   I believe there is a lot we can agree on. 
   And by working together, in the spirit of the crop insurance portion of this bill, I am certain that there is a lot we can accomplish.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, ``Mother's Day''--that special day when children the world over celebrate and honor their mothers--falls during the month of May. Appropriately, the month of May is also the month when one of the most selfless and dedicated mothers I know celebrates her birthday. Today, I would like to share the story of that remarkable woman from my home state of South Dakota. 
   I have known and admired Katherine ``Kitty'' Wilka for more than two decades. Today, as she celebrates her 70th birthday, she will be surrounded by numerous family members and friends. Kitty Wilka is the mother of 12, the grandmother of 29 and, as of last week, the great-grandmother of 3. But it is not just the size of the Wilka family that is noteworthy. It is also the quality of their character and the diversity of their accomplishments. 
   Kitty Wilka and her late husband, Bill, led by example and instilled admirable values in all their children. Widowed for over a decade, Kitty is the  heart and soul of her extended family. She is a role model for her children and grandchildren. Her life example epitomizes both the love of family and commitment to community. 
   Kitty has raised public servants, community and church leaders and business owners. After working for 18 years at McKennan Hospital in Sioux Falls, she continues to contribute to her community, volunteering at St. Lambert's Catholic Church and its school. 
   I must confess that I have personally benefitted from the Wilka family's belief in public service. Kitty's son, Jeff, has volunteered in my Sioux Falls office since my first election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978. 
   Born with cerebral palsy, Jeff grew up with a positive attitude and a determination to be involved in his community. He has been a loyal, dedicated and valued member of my Sioux Falls staff for over two decades. In fact, Jeff has become a fixture of sorts, having the second longest running tenure on my staff. 
   With the help of his loving mother and close-knit family, Jeff has overcome many obstacles in his life, including physical ailments that required surgery and therapy, and a dependency on alcohol. He has been sober for 11 years and is an ardent worker on behalf of many civic causes, including the Children's Care Hospital and School, the March of Dimes and Easter Seals. He also has a deeply held faith in our electoral process, working in the political trenches for many years for a variety of local, state and federal candidates in whose philosophy he believes. 
   I am proud of what Jeff has accomplished and the significant challenges he has overcome. I think he would be the first to tell you that his successes have been based upon the solid Midwestern values that Kitty and Bill Wilka instilled in him and his siblings. They taught their children to work hard, to never give up and to do their part to improve the communities in which they live. It is clear that Jeff has taken those lessons to heart. 
   Kitty Wilka has much to be proud of in her life. And I know that her loving family is extremely proud of her. I want to join her 12 children, 29 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren in wishing Kitty the very best on her birthday. She deserves it. 
   Happy 70th birthday, Kitty!

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me simply respond to the distinguished majority leader. 
   As he knows, in past debates on ESEA, there have been an average of 22 Republican amendments that have been considered, an average. In some cases, that number has exceeded 30 amendments. The average number of  amendments in total considered during the ESEA debate has been 37 amendments. 
   I have no objection at all to the amendment suggested by the distinguished majority leader. 
   I note with interest that the school safety amendment offered by Senator LAUTENBERG was not on his list. 
   I would ask that the Senate resume consideration of the ESEA bill, and following the two amendments previously ordered, the Senate consider the following first-degree amendments subject to relevant second-degree amendments, and they be considered in alternating fashion as the sponsors become available: Senator SANTORUM, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator HUTCHISON, Senator DODD, Senator GREGG, Senator HARKIN, Senator VOINOVICH, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator STEVENS, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator GRAMS, Senator REED, Senator KYL, and Senator LAUTENBERG.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I guess I would have to consult with the majority leader in greater detail to know whether each of these amendments is exactly referenced in his unanimous consent list. As I understand it, this is the list that our two sides have been building upon in reaching some agreement on proceeding to the next block of amendments. Obviously, there are other amendments we would want to consider. But this is a block of amendments for which there would be no opposition to addressing as the next block on this side.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader is correct. We will be in a position--and could be in a position in the not too distant future--to agree ultimately to a finite list of amendments. I was not aware that the distinguished leader would 
   be interested in pursuing this this afternoon. This is the first I heard of it. But we would be prepared at some point certainly during the time these amendments are being considered to offer perhaps a final list that would bring us to closure on the bill. I would be happy to work with the majority leader over the recess in an effort to finalize that list, and proceed with that goal in mind.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object. I simply again indicate my reason for objecting is not because I don't want to go to DOD authorization. I would love very much to work with our majority leader in attempting to proceed to that bill. I have no problem with calling it up and permitting the full Senate to work its will. 
   Again, he has proposed that it be done with only relevant amendments. I remind the majority leader, Senator HUTCHINSON offered a forced abortions in China amendment to DOD authorization just 2 years ago, and there have been many Republican nonrelevant amendments offered. 
   I assume I am protecting the rights of Members on both sides of the aisle in insisting we have the opportunity to offer amendments, and I will work with the majority leader to see that we can take up this bill and work through his concern about amendments. 
   Until we can work that out, I object to moving to it.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object again for two reasons: First, the bill is not here; and, second, because we have not taken up the authorization bill and our colleagues have indicated that is a very important matter. We always attempt to deal with the authorization requirements prior to the time we deal with the appropriations requirements. This unanimous consent request does not allow for that. 
   I ask the majority leader what is wrong with taking up the one appropriations bill that has been sent here by the House. I note that on May 22 the Transportation appropriations bill was received from the House. It is pending in the Senate. 
   I won't ask unanimous consent, but I ask the majority leader whether his intention would be to take up the one House-passed bill that is here. Clearly, we would have no objections to doing that. It is important we make the most use of our time. Because the House-passed appropriations bill having to do with transportation is already here, I am curious as to why we have chosen not to take it up until now and why we wouldn't take it up just as soon as we come back.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to talk about a couple of issues. First of all, I commend the distinguished ranking member, Senator FEINSTEIN, and the chair of the appropriations subcommittee for their outstanding work on the legislative appropriations bill. Many of our colleagues have come to the floor already to speak as eloquently as I have heard about the importance of the Capitol Police, about the importance of those who serve us in so many capacities throughout the Capitol and throughout the Capitol complex itself. 
   I want to express my support for this bill and for the statement that it makes about the importance that we as Senators put on the work done by our Capitol Police each and every day. Those of us who are fortunate enough to be in Leadership especially recognize the unique role the Capitol Police play. They are with us almost from the time we leave the house to the time we are dropped off at the house late at night. They are with us publicly. They follow us. They protect us. They provide service to us in the most exemplary and professional manner. I think it would be all too easy for some to misinterpret the ill-advised actions taken thus far by the House in their legislative branch appropriations bill. 
   It was really for that reason many of us felt the need not only to support a good Senate legislative appropriations bill, but to underscore the numbers and the commitment made in the Senate version of this bill by cosponsoring and supporting the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Maryland. 
   We want to say just two words without equivocation to the Capitol Police, to the members of the Congressional Research Service, to the GAO, and to all of those who work so diligently and professionally each and every day: Thank you. Thank you for what you do. Thank you for how you do it. Thank you for setting the example. Thank you for the extraordinary dedication you demonstrate to public service. 
   That is really the message. I will be surprised if we don't see a 100-0 vote in our expression of gratitude and our desire to ensure that they realize how much we appreciate what they do. While we may not say it each and every day, and we may not walk up as we probably should from time to time to a Capitol Police officer, or to one of our floor staff, or to any of those who serve us, maybe in this small way we can say as a body, as Senators, regardless of political or philosophical persuasion, thank you. We express our sincere and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for dedicating your lives to public service, and in some cases dedicating your lives to the safety of others, safety that oftentimes asks too much of police officers and their families, as we saw just 2 years ago. 
   So this is as an important a statement as I think we will make this year regarding our Capitol Police and our staff in many respects, and I am hopeful that it won't go unnoticed. I am hopeful that this will serve as a big exclamation point that we are very grateful, and that we are appreciative in ways that probably are not articulated on a regular basis.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President I also want to address the matter concerning Bradley Smith. I know there will be time allocated for his nomination later on this afternoon. I will simply take time as if in morning business using the quorum call to address his nomination at this time. 
   As I have stated before, I have come to the conclusion that I must oppose this nomination. For me, this is not just a vote on a particular nominee with whom I don't agree, this vote is about whether or not we will prove the cynics in America wrong in demonstrating our commitment to strong campaign finance laws. 
   Yesterday morning in the Washington Post, a Republican strategist who advises Governor Bush and the Republican National Committee said the following:  
   There are no rules any more ..... There were few if any to begin with but there are virtually none today. They know it, we know it, everybody knows it.  
   That wasn't Common Cause or Ralph Nader. That was an adviser to Texas Governor George W. Bush. 
   Governor Bush's adviser is right. In many ways, we have entered the post-Federal Election Campaign Act era. It is the Wild West of ``soft money,'' issue advocacy ads and secret donors. 
   The system is broken, and everybody knows it. A vote in favor of this nomination will simply confirm what we already know. It doesn't have to be this way. It shouldn't be this way. 
   I know very few Members of the House and the Senate, of either party, who like our current campaign finance system. I know very few members of either party who prefer raising money to meeting with constituents and working on issues. I know very few members of either party who enjoy the fact that, every time they face reelection, the amount of money that has to be raised to be competitive has risen exponentially. And frankly, I know very few members of either party who don't resent the fact that so many of our legislative activities are scrutinized solely in the context of donations--which groups backed which said of the argument, and whose money prevailed. 
   I am irritated by that. I am frustrated by that. That screen should not be the consideration. Even in the media, it shouldn't be the frame within which we view the debate on issues. But that is exactly how it is framed on the Sunday talk shows and in the newspapers. 
   If we think the current system is unacceptable, that is nothing compared to the way our constituents feel. 
   Our constituents don't like the current campaign finance system. They don't think it puts their interests first. But they also don't think we'll ever really change it. 
   In fact, they are convinced of it. Poll after poll showed the American people responding in single digits--not double digits, but single digits--to the question: Do you think Congress will ever change the campaign finance laws? Overwhelmingly, over 90 percent say no. 
   Today, it seems to me, the Senate can take the first step toward restoring at least a modicum of public trust in American political campaigns. 
   One thing we can do to promote greater confidence in our electoral system is to ask a simple question before we confirm the men and women who will serve on the Federal Election Commission. It seems to me that fundamental question ought to be: whether those who may be interested in serving believe in the laws on the books today? Do you believe you can objectively enforce the laws? We are asked that question every time we are sworn in. Will you uphold the Constitution? It seems to me upholding the Constitution and all the statutes and the compendium of laws that have been created as a result of our fundamental freedoms established in the Constitution is a prerequisite for serving in public office. 
   The men and women who, as Commissioners, would have the courage to issue clearer guidelines about what is permissible, and would have the courage to enforce those guidelines are the people whom we should encourage to serve on this and all bodies. 
   Brad Smith, it is clear to me, does not fit that description. Rather than decrying the weaknesses of our current campaign laws, Mr. Smith has made a career out of criticizing the utility of our federal election law scheme. He has argued for the repeal of the Federal Elections Campaign Act, and he denies that money has a corrupting influence on the political system. 
   Simply put, when it comes to campaign finance laws, Brad Smith is an anarchist. This is not the marshal who will save the day in Dodge City. Confirming Brad Smith is more like asking Billy the Kid to preserve peace. 
   Let's be clear. Putting reform-minded FEC Commissioners in place is not enough by itself. We created the FEC and our inaction has created some of  the problems within the FEC with respect to enforcing the laws we have today. Congress has a responsibility to act today to close loopholes, clarify the law, and do everything possible to stem the endless chase of money in which we all engage. 
   We should pass McCain-Feingold immediately. We should end the abuse of section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code immediately. 
   Our Constitution doesn't stand in the way. The only thing standing in the way of our taking these modest steps is the reluctance to tamper with the system that we know and that has gotten us elected, even if we don't like it. 
   We are worried our careers won't survive. It seems to me we should be more worried about whether faith in our system will survive. 
   The trends are ominous. The soft money accounts in both parties' coffers are at record levels. In the first 15 months of the 2000 election cycle, the national Democratic and Republican Party committees have raised over $160 million in soft money. 
   Mr. President, $160 million in corporate, union, and large individual contributions. Is there any real question why Americans are losing faith in our elections system? 
   Every election cycle, the cost of campaigns goes up and the number of people who vote goes down. If we really want to increase voter participation, we have to address that reality. The reality is, there is simply too much money in politics. We all know, whether we admit it or not, that the current system is broken. We have a choice: Do we reduce the influence of special interests money in Washington? Do we want to wink and nod at the few flimsy campaign laws we have? 
   Today we have an opportunity to answer that question. It seems to me that if we defeat Brad Smith's nomination and demand we be presented a nominee who will work with us to regain public confidence in our campaign laws, we will be taking the first step. Then we could pass campaign finance reform, the McCain-Feingold bill, and put an end to the flood of soft money into campaigns once and for all, and then shut down the so-called 527 loophole. Those three steps would go a long way in this election cycle, in this session of Congress, to do the right thing. They are things we can and should do. The currency of politics should be ideas, not cash. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this day marks the retirement of a legend in broadcast journalism in South Dakota. Steve Hemmingsen, who has faithfully delivered news to living rooms in my home state for over twenty-five years, will give his last regular broadcast tonight. 
   There's an old story about Calvin Coolidge, told shortly after he left the White House. He was filling out a standard form, which asked for standard information. Line 1 asked for his name and address. Line 2 asked for his ``Occupation'', for which he answered ``Retired''. Line 3 was titled ``Remarks.'' Mr. Coolidge responded ``Glad of it.'' 
   I hope that Steve Hemmingsen will share that sentiment: glad to be retired from the rigors of his job--but never fully removed from his audience, the thousands of people who have relied on him for their news for more than two decades. 
   Steve grew up just across the border in Minnesota, and after graduating from high school, he landed his first job in broadcasting at the ``Polka Station of the Nation'' in New Ulm. Later, he studied at the Brown Institute and was hired by KELO-TV in 1969. He has been a fixture there and on our nightly news ever since. 
   It has been estimated that since Steve began working the 6:00 and 10:00 pm news at KELO, he has delivered about eighteen thousand newscasts. He's shouldered the responsibility of helping our state get through some of its most trying times--such as the devastating Rapid City flood in 1972, the tragic plane crash that took the lives of Governor George Mickelson and several of South Dakota's economic development leaders in 1993, the horrible tornado in Spencer two years ago and countless South Dakota blizzards. When South Dakotans have faced adversity, Steve's steady voice and calm demeanor brought us up to speed on the latest events and talked us through each crisis we encountered. 
   But Steve has been there through the good times as well. When we celebrated our state's centennial in 1989, Steve reported on the numerous celebrations going on around South Dakota, giving us insight on where our state had been, and where it was going. When Scotland, South Dakota's own Chuck Gemar went into space, Steve helped express the collective sense of pride that was felt throughout the state. You could say that during his career at KELO, Steve's familiar voice was the first that brought news of noteworthy events to the people in South Dakota. 
   Over the last twenty-five years, Steve Hemmingsen has earned the trust of the people of South Dakota. Although Steve and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye on some issues, I have never had a reason to question his dedication as a broadcaster, his fairness as a reporter or his integrity as a person. In my years in public service, I have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of reporters both in South Dakota and across the nation and there is no doubt in my mind that Steve Hemmingsen is one of the best. Today we congratulate him, but tomorrow he will certainly be missed. 
   It brings me great pleasure to join all of KELO-Land in wishing Steve the best as he signs off tonight. The evening news will never be the same.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just say that there are 19 nominations still pending on the calendar if we are able to adopt this unanimous consent request today. Some of those nominations have been on the calendar for well over a year. I think it is the view of virtually every member of the caucus on our side that to hold nominations that long is cruel. It is wrong. It should not be tolerated. We are in a position to clear all nominations, including those 19.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I listened to Senator CRAIG's remarks about Senator Mitchell's use of cloture in the 103d Congress. As to the cloture numbers the Senator mentioned, yes Senator Mitchell filed cloture 23 times on the first day of an item's consideration but what he failed to mention was that only one of those instances was on a bill. Let me repeat that--in only one instance in the entire 103d Congress did Senator Mitchell file cloture on the first day a bill was considered, and in that instance it was with the bill sponsor's permission. It was Senator ROCKEFELLER and the bill was product liability. In all but four of the other instances the Senate was not in an amendable situation, they were on motions to proceed, conference reports, or attempts to go to conference. 
   There were two instances where Senator Mitchell filed on amendments on their first day, the first was on Senator KENNEDY's substitute amendment to the national community service bill and the other was on the Mitchell-Dole Brady gun amendment, in each case a true filibuster was going to be waged. In other words members of the minority had indicated a willingness to try and kill the legislation by extended debate. This has not been the case this Congress', cloture is filed in attempt to stifle the ability of individual Senators to offer amendments and that is the crucial difference that I pointed out last week. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, was it the intention of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia to yield back his time? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-daschle-sd-2-20000518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his graciousness, as is so often the case. 
   I begin by commenting on our two colleagues, Senators WARNER and BYRD. Some of the finest security thinkers this Senate has ever produced have chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   I think of the names Russell, Stennis, Nunn, STROM THURMOND. They have all made significant contributions to this Nation's debate on national security. Although he has chaired the Armed Services Committee for less than 2 years, Senator WARNER has demonstrated many of the traits that made his predecessors so successful. I have great respect for him. 
   What can one say about Senator ROBERT C. BYRD? This is a rare and unique occasion for me. I can't remember the last time I was on the opposite side of an issue with Senator BYRD. I admire him immensely. 
   No Member, past or present, has ever displayed a greater love or respect for this institution than has ROBERT C. BYRD. No Member enjoys greater respect and admiration from his colleagues. No Member is more reluctant than this Member to come to the floor and disagree with ROBERT C. BYRD. 
   There is another reason this is difficult, besides the high regard I hold for him. The other reason I find this difficult is that I share many of the concerns that led Senators WARNER and BYRD to draft this resolution in the first place. 
   As we close this debate, I compliment our extraordinary member, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator LEVIN, for the outstanding job he has done in presenting the arguments over the course of this debate and providing us his leadership. We owe him a major debt of gratitude. 
   I think he shares my view that this debate is not about a number of things. It is not about whether the U.S. military commitment to Kosovo or any region of the world should be open-ended. Supporters of this amendment agree with the supporters of the Byrd-Warner amendment. Every U.S. commitment should be examined regularly by Congress and the President to ensure that it remains in our national interest. This debate is not about whether the U.S. commitment to Kosovo or any other region of the world should be open ended. 
   This debate is not about whether our NATO allies should pay a fair share of any joint operation. We all agree. We have great difficulty reaching unanimity in many areas these days, but we are not in disagreement over that fact. Our allies should be sharing the burden, and, in fact, they are. 
   As my colleagues have already noted in several of their excellent presentations to this body, they are supplying 85 percent of the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo today. They are shouldering the vast majority of the effort on the civilian side. That is not the debate either. 
   We agree that they should pay more than we are paying, and they are. Eighty-seven percent of their pledge to Kosovo's budget has been made by our NATO allies; 63 percent of the pledge to the civilian police force has now been fulfilled by our NATO allies; 75 percent of their pledge on humanitarian assistance has been fulfilled by our NATO allies. They have begun to step up their commitment on reconstruction assistance. 
   Third, this debate is not about whether Congress has a responsibility to exercise its constitutional duties over the power of the purse. I heard the eloquence once more of ROBERT C. BYRD. We all understand the importance of this responsibility. No one is more adamant and eloquent in pointing out that responsibility than is he. Anyone who does not understand the significance of this responsibility should simply spend a moment or two, an hour or two, a day or two, with Senator BYRD to discuss our founders' deliberations over the importance of vesting the power of the purse in the people's representatives, and all doubts will disappear. 
   This debate is not about whether the Byrd-Warner amendment is constitutionally permissible. This debate is about whether the course of action it espouses is in our Nation's best interest. As much as I respect the two authors of the provisions incorporated in this bill, I join Senator LEVIN, our Secretary of Defense, our senior military leaders, this administration, and many others who have concluded that it is not. 
   I am deeply concerned about the effect this amendment would have. First and foremost, it would increase the risk to U.S. forces. There is a fragile peace in Kosovo today and no one has spoken more powerfully, eloquently, or compellingly about the ramifications of setting a date certain for a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kosovo than Wesley Clark. General Clark has said that setting a date certain for withdrawal would trigger instability throughout the region and increase violence in the area. 
   I hope everyone will listen, regardless of whether or not he is a constituent of ours; he is the expert. If we do anything as we make these decisions, I think we need to listen to those who are expert in their fields. Triggering instability throughout the region and increasing violence in the area is something about which all Members ought to be concerned. 
   Second, this action rewards Slobodan Milosevic for his ethnic cleansing campaigns and would greatly strengthen him and his supporters in the region. Again, according to General Clark:

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, up and down the Missouri River in South Dakota, silt is building up on the river bottom as a result of the operation of federal dams on the river. Water levels are rising as a result, flooding hundreds of homes in the cities of Pierre and Ft. Pierre and causing considerable anguish for these families. Two years ago, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the Corps to conduct a $35 million buyout of affected property to provide much-needed relief to these homeowners. 
   Today, that project is at a standstill. We could start buying homes tomorrow, but the Corps of Engineers is contending that the price of moving forward is releasing more water through the Oahe dam, thereby generating electricity and revenue that will provide an economic justification for the project. City officials in Pierre and Fort Pierre have rejected this idea because raising water levels will cause new flooding in their towns. 
   This problem has been caused because the relocation legislation requires that this project be economically justified. I support that provision. Some might question why a project intended to provide relief to homeowners for damages caused by the federal government must earn more than it pays out. Nonetheless, I believe it is important that all Corps projects should be justified, and I agreed to language requiring an economic justification for this relief project. 
   Nonetheless, I am deeply concerned with the way this language has been interpreted. The only option considered by the Corps for providing an economic justification is raising hydropower revenues. It has ignored a far more appropriate way to justify the project: by relieving the government of potential liability it faces for damage to these  homes. In Pierre and Ft. Pierre, groundwater elevations track closely with the elevation of the Missouri River. City officials and homeowners tell me that sometimes just minutes after the Corps begins releasing water from the dam, raising water levels in the river, water begins seeping into basements. For that reason, I am offering an amendment directing the Corps to take into account its responsibility for this damage as part of its economic analysis. 
   It flies in the face of common sense to provide an economic justification for a flood relief project by flooding new parts of these communities. My amendment will put an end to the Corps' insistence that it raise water levels, and allow the project to move forward. I am continuing to work with the Corps on the language for this amendment, and hope that we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to all. 
   Time is running short. In April, I hosted a meeting of over 150 homeowners in Ft. Pierre to discuss this project. They were angry and frustrated. One young mother stood before me in tears, at her wit's end because she must stay with her home in Pierre while her children grow up in another city. She's depending on this buyout to allow her to join her children. 
   Other families have already placed downpayments on new property based upon the Corps' word that this project would begin in April. They now risk losing that money unless the project moves forward. And all residents are watching the construction season slowly slip away, raising the specter that they will be forced to live another year in their flood-damaged homes. 
   The facts make it clear why we need to start this project immediately. My amendment will allow it to move forward. I hope my colleagues will give it their support.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I objected, as I noted I would do yesterday, to taking up a bill that has yet to be acted upon in the House. The regular order is the bill must be approved in the House prior to the time we finish our work on the legislation. I see no need to deal with the same bill twice, to deal with it now and to deal with it again later once the bill is acted upon in the House of Representatives. 
   The distinguished majority leader had noted that there is emergency funding incorporated in this bill. I am sympathetic to that. I won't ask him at this point, but I note I could ask unanimous consent--which I will not do--to take up H.R. 3908, the emergency supplemental bill for the year 2000. The House passed it and urged the Senate to take it up and pass it. The Appropriations Committee had hoped they could take it up and pass it. It was the majority leader's determination not to take it up, not to pass it, but to leave it in committee. I am not as sympathetic as I wish I could be about his desire to deal with these emergency matters when we could easily and quickly and very efficiently deal with emergency funding by simply taking up the bill that is right now on the calendar. Again, that is H.R. 3908. 
   That is, of course, the right of the majority and the right of the majority leader, especially, to make that decision. I am disappointed. Until that House bill comes before the Senate, it is not my intention to have to require the Senate to go through a debate on the same issue twice. That was the reason the rules were written as they were. Constitutionally, appropriations bills must begin in the House of Representatives. We are, in a sense, circumventing the rules of the Congress by allowing these bills to be debated and considered prior to the time the bill comes before the Senate. 
   We will certainly object. We will look forward to the House acting, as we hope they will soon, and not only on this bill but on others. Senator LOTT is absolutely right. This legislation should have been reported out it should have been passed in the House by now. It hasn't been. It is disappointing that it hasn't been. That is the only reason we are not taking it up this afternoon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Senator LEVIN is not presently on the floor. I know Senator MCCAIN has worked with Senator LEVIN on this. Maybe I can defer to him. In speaking with Senator LEVIN, I know he also wanted the opportunity to offer an amendment to the Byrd language. I am sure he would want to be included in any kind of unanimous consent that would allow for amendments. Perhaps we would want to include that as well. Perhaps we could revisit this question after we get the general agreement to accommodate the Senators.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have witnessed an extraordinary political spectacle in the last 24 hours. Yesterday we spent approximately 3 hours in a quorum call because the Republican caucus could not decide how to respond to a simple Sense of the Senate amendment commending the Million Mom March and demanding that this Congress act now to pass sensible gun safety legislation. 
   Today, the Republicans attempted for the second time to rule our amendment out of order. 
   What, I ask, is so disconcerting about the Democratic amendment? 
   Are there really members of this Senate who do not believe that the stalling has gone on too long? Are there really members of this Senate who believe that it is not a national emergency that children are dying in this country every day from gun violence? Are there really members of this Senate who believe that this emergency is too insignificant to command time on the Senate floor? 
   Yesterday, after 3 hours of silence and paralysis, our Republican colleagues decided that they could not simply join us in commending the Million Moms. Instead, they decided to offer their own amendment. 
   Let us not be distracted. We will vote on the Republican amendment, but the vote that matters, the vote that may just prevent more kids from dying, is on the amendment I have offered. 
   Constitutional scholars may disagree about the meaning of the Second Amendment, but I for one believe there is nothing inconsistent about protecting the Second Amendment and closing the gun-show loophole, requiring trigger locks on handguns, or banning juvenile possession of military style assault weapons. 
   Moreover, I agree we should enforce our gun laws. But that is only part of the solution. It is just a basic fact that you can't enforce a loophole. We need a policy of zero loopholes, and zero tolerance. 
   The gun lobby keeps trying to confuse us. They say the debate is either new gun laws or education. They say it is either new gun laws or enforcement of existing laws. But this is not an either/or debate. We need a multifaceted solution to end gun violence. 
   Let's look at what the Republican amendment says: 
   They call for better enforcement of existing gun laws. But they can't resist attacking the Clinton Administration's efforts. They twist statistics to make the case they want. 
   The reality is that the number of firearms offenders sentenced to 5 years or more in federal prison has increased more than 41 percent since 1992. The reality is that federal authorities have worked diligently with state and local authorities, during this Administration, to reduce violent crime in a cooperative and coordinated fashion. The reality is the total number of prosecutions for weapons offenses has increased more than 22 percent since the beginning of this Administration and violent crime has dropped by 35 percent. 
   I think we should commend America's hard-working law enforcement officials for these successes, not vilify them. Sadly, my Republican colleagues do not agree. 
   Next, the Republican Sense of the Senate acknowledges the existence of the Juvenile Justice Conference Committee. And they point to provisions passed by this Senate as part of the Juvenile Justice bill that they support, such as strengthening penalties for gun crimes and illegal gun purchases and prohibiting juveniles who commit felonies from ever possessing a gun. 
   Democrats support these provisions, too. But these measures, by themselves, are not enough. This Senate did better. This Senate passed the Lautenberg amendment to close the gun show loophole. And just a month and a half ago, 53 Senators reaffirmed that the conference report should include this provision. Sadly, my Republican colleagues chose not to include the Lautenberg amendment on their list of priorities. 
   The Republican amendment, however, while it acknowledges the existence of the Juvenile Justice Conference, does not explain why that conference report has yet to come before this Senate. 
   The biggest problem may not be difference over which provisions are most important. The biggest problem may be the fact that special interest politics have prevented this conference from meeting at all. 
   Finally, the Republican amendment concludes that each U.S. Attorney's office should designate a prosecutor to pursue firearms violations, that we should update the national instant criminal background system, and that we should encourage states to impose mandatory minimum sentences for firearm offenses. Again, most Democrats support these measures. But are they enough? We know they are not. 
   Their amendment also concludes that law-abiding citizens have the right to own a firearm for self-defense and recreation. I agree with this statement. I myself am a hunter. But I am also a father and I feel for all the other fathers--and mothers--who have lost a child to gun violence. That is why I introduced this amendment. 
   On the whole, I have decided to vote against this amendment because I disagree too strongly with many of the findings in the Republican Sense of the Senate amendment, and their one-sided nature. However, I must make clear that I support the second amendment, like other constitutional provisions, and believe that the second amendment does not preclude reasonable regulation of the use of firearms. But this Republican amendment does not go far enough and will not stop the violence in our communities. 
   Democrats have offered an amendment that acknowledges the dreadful cost that gun violence is having on our country. We cannot forget that 12 young people are killed every day in America by gunfire. We cannot forget that American children under the age of 15 are 12 times more likely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other industrial countries combined. And we cannot forget that every day we spend in political gridlock is a day we waste solving this terrible problem--a day we do less than we should to stop the killing. 
   That is why the Democratic amendment, in addition to commending the mothers and fathers that gathered across the country this Mother's Day to call for meaningful, common-sense gun policy, insists that Congress act now to improve our gun safety laws. 
   This Senate needs to demonstrate to America's mothers and fathers that we heard their call. This Senate needs to resolve today, as the Democratic amendment demands, that the Juvenile Justice Conference must meet and must pass a conference report that includes the Lautenberg amendment and other critical provisions to limit access to firearms by juveniles, convicted felons, and other prohibited persons. 
   It is the least we should do, and it is long overdue.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time and not the time allocated to others for consideration of their remarks. 
   Let me just say the majority leader was able to get some things off his chest. I have not heard all of what he has unloaded this afternoon. 
   But I look forward to reading the RECORD. I don't know if there is any possible way, in a period of a couple minutes, for us to get everything off of our chests. 
   I will tell you this. The way the Senate is being run is wrong. No majority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate debate as aggressively as Senator LOTT has chosen to do. Now, that is his right. People ask, on many occasions, what my feelings are personally about that. That is his right. He has chosen the way he runs the Senate. I think he is doing that for what many believe is a laudatory reason. He is trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough issues. 
   Let's get it out on the table. If I am going to get everything off my chest, I think he is trying to protect his members. He sees that as his role. I understand that. But no majority leader has ever gone to the extent that he has--no one in history. I defy anybody to come to the floor and challenge that statement. No majority leader has come to the floor to say, before we take up any bill, we will have to limit the entire Senate to relevant amendments. No one has done that. So let's get that straight. I ask any of the 99 colleagues to challenge that statement. No one can. So we start from that. 
   Why do we want to have debate on amendments? Because that is the only ability for the minority to express itself. The majority leader has phrased it very interestingly. He said: I don't want all these amendments to cause trouble. The more they cause trouble, the more in jeopardy the bills will be. 
   He made reference to that regarding the education bill. He didn't want amendments to cause trouble. Cause trouble for whom? What kind of trouble? What are we talking about here? We are talking about the ability of Senators to express themselves, to offer amendments, to have debate. There is an old-fashioned way of dealing with it. It is called a tabling motion. Or you can get elaborate and offer a second-degree amendment. You can do all kinds of things. But to say, ``We are going to come to the floor and do it my way or no way,'' is unacceptable. 
   Over and over and over and over again, we are told that is the way it is going to be. One of our colleagues the other day said it is like the frog sitting in a pot of water who doesn't notice that the water keeps getting hotter and ultimately the frog boils to death. Well, the water continues to heat, and we are slowly boiling to death, procedurally. 
   We just lost another right this afternoon, and it is outrageous--outrageous. How many more times do we have to limit ourselves to debate on the Senate floor, and how many other ways are we  going to limit debate and expression and gag Senators? That is wrong. That is absolutely the wrong way to run the Senate. We hear a lot about cooperation, but I am telling you, there will not be cooperation unless we understand that the minority has to have its rights, too. Those rights have to be respected. 
   I hope, when we are in the majority, we understand the rights of the minority. I will admonish my colleagues to do that. But this is getting to be more and more a second House of Representatives. This is getting to be more and more a gagged body. This has nothing to do with the traditions of the Senate that I admired when I became a Senator. We have gagged Senators on the budget. We have gagged Senators on appropriations. We have gagged Senators on sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. We have gagged Senators on the right to participate in conferences. Do you know that we have not had a conference report this year come back with a kind of conference that we have always historically and traditionally organized as a result of passing legislation? We just don't have real conference committees anymore. 
   I just heard a report in our ranking member's lunch today, where staff reported on virtually every bill that has passed the Senate, where we are meeting at the staff level trying to work 
   things out for the conference report, and Republican staff told Democratic staff: If you don't like it, don't come because that is the way it is going to be. That is cooperation? 
   So I will say to my colleagues on the other side that we are not going to tolerate it anymore. We are not going to accept that anymore. I am going to demand that every single appropriations bill that comes to the Senate before it can be completed be passed in the House first because that is regular order. Let's stay through a recess for a change. I am ready. We are going to require the regular order when it comes to appropriations bills. We are not going to do unanimous consent requests routinely as we have done so easily and quickly in the past. 
   It is over. If there is going to be cooperation, I want to see it on both sides. I want to see some respect for the rights of the minority when we deal with these issues, and I will not allow our members to be gagged. We will have a lot more to say about this, but I am telling you, we have drawn the line. We are not going to be conducting business as we have in the last several months. That is over. That is behind us. We can do it the Senate way, or we are not going to do it at all. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am sure I have a little time remaining. 
   Let me just say no one wants to stomp their feet and get red in the face--certainly not me. That is not my style. If it has happened, it is only because the frustration level continues to mount. 
   It is ironic that the majority leader uses the word ``cooperation'' so frequently because that irony has struck me to be the essence of the problem. There is so little opportunity for cooperation when the majority acts in the manner it has throughout this Congress. That is the problem--no cooperation. We are prepared to work through appropriations bills and to work through the authorization bills. 
   He mentioned the need for cooperation. He also mentioned, I might add, the urgency of the emergency funding in these appropriations bills. The House begged the majority leader for cooperation on the emergency supplemental. The administration begged the majority leader for cooperation on the emergency supplemental. Many of us on the Democratic side urged the majority leader to cooperate on the emergency supplemental. But do you know what the majority leader said? I have decided there will not be any cooperation on the emergency supplemental. I have decided it will go piece by piece in appropriations bills, and you take it or leave it. 
   I am not trying to get excited here. But let me just say as softly and as sincerely as I can: That is not cooperation. That is a Senate version of dictatorship that I think is unacceptable. We work by committee. We work by consensus. We work by genuine cooperation. We work by trying to deal  with these issues one by one. I could cite many other examples. We want cooperation. We are willing to work with the majority quietly and productively. But we want cooperation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr President, it is a great honor for me to represent the people of South Dakota in the United States Senate. On occasion, I have the opportunity to recognize individual South Dakotans for their accomplishments, and, today, it brings me great pleasure to focus the attention of everyone in this chamber on one of South Dakota's most talented and determined athletes. 
   Rod DeHaven, a native of Huron, South Dakota, and a graduate of South Dakota State University, won the U.S.  Olympic Marathon Trials last week in Pittsburgh. Braving eighty degree temperatures and high humidity, Rod fought off the sweltering weather and his competition and completed the race in just over two hours and fifteen minutes. Rod's incredible effort and inspiring victory in Pittsburgh earned him a spot on our Olympic team, and later this year he will travel to Sydney, Australia, to represent the United States in the marathon in the 2000 Olympic games. 
   Anyone who has ever trained for or run a marathon can tell you without equivocation that the work required to put them in a position just to finish the twenty-six mile race is exceptional. Having run my first marathon last year, I can only imagine the extraordinary effort it must take to compete and win at the national and international level. Rod DeHaven--who, in addition to training for marathons and working full-time as a computer programmer--is also raising two young children with his wife, Shelli, clearly has the work ethic it takes to be a great long-distance runner. 
   Last week in Pittsburgh, however, Rod proved that he had much more than just a strong work ethic. In outrunning some of this country's toughest competitors in extremely difficult conditions, he also proved that he has the heart and courage of a champion. 
   Rod learned what it takes to be a champion growing up in South Dakota. As a member of the Huron Tigers cross-country and track teams in the eighties, Rod was a cross country state champion in the fall of 1983, and in track, he was state champion in the mile, two-mile and two-mile relay in both 1983 and 1984. Rod attended college at South Dakota State University where he won the North Central Conference cross country championships as a freshman and the NCAA Division II indoor 1500 meter championship as a sophomore. 
   South Dakota has produced some tremendous long distance runners through the years, and Rod DeHaven is the latest in that great line. In 1964, another young man from South Dakota named Billy Mills stunned the world with his remarkable victory in the 10,000 meters in the Tokyo Olympics. Billy's story became legendary, and it is no surprise that in a state known for hard work, we are now sending another one of our best to compete in one of the Olympic Game's most challenging and difficult events. 
   All of South Dakota is pulling for Rod DeHaven as he heads to Sydney, and we wish him the best of luck as he strives to be the next gold medal winner from our great state.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this weekend an estimated 750,000 mothers, fathers, and children united for the Million Mom March here in the District. These women and men took the first step toward ending the epidemic of gun violence in our country. 
   Certainly, Congress needs to take the next step. It is intolerable that commonsense gun safety legislation is stalled in a conference committee that has not met since August 5 of 1999. Twelve kids die a day from gun violence and we do nothing. We have more safety regulations for toy guns than for real guns, and we do nothing. We have watched children shot in schools and day-care centers, but still we do nothing. 
   Yesterday, the Democratic Policy Committee held a hearing with mothers from the Million Mom March. At the hearing, I heard stories that I must say will haunt me for a long time. I listened to a kindergarten schoolteacher talk about her horror when one of her seemingly innocent students, a kindergartner, brought a gun to school to kill a classmate. She remains afraid to teach and afraid for her students. 
   I listened to the mother of an aspiring high school graduate who was gunned down in front of his girlfriend's home while unloading groceries. As she talked about her loss, and demanded Congress act, she said simply:  
   I don't want this to happen to any other mother, father, sister or brother. I don't want anyone else to suffer like this.  
   I listened to a mother whose oldest son was shot and killed by a neighbor in a sleepy town in California. She told us:  
   I came to the District to protect my son, Brandon, from gun violence because he is the only child that I have left.  
   I ask my colleagues, what else will it take for us to act to stem this domestic war of violence that is infecting every city and county in our beloved country? We cannot wait any longer for the juvenile justice conference to meet and act. 
   I was disappointed by comments made by the National Rifle Association when asked whether all of this effort, 750,000 people coming to Washington as peacefully as any group I have ever seen come, organized in a respectful way, telling their stories, as tragic as they are, with the courage that I don't think I personally could muster, the personal stories of lost sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--the NRA was asked the question, Will this translate to political power? Their answer:  
   It's one thing to say it. It's another thing to do it.  
   They understand political power. They have it. But I do think that is changing. The landscape is changing, and it is changing dramatically. As a South Dakotan who has been raised with guns all my life, who is proud to be a hunter--I have many guns myself--I will say without equivocation that it, too, is even changing in my home State. 
   Given the fact it has now been more than a year, given the fact that we have not yet acted, given the fact that we ought to respond to all those people who came to Washington with their courage and with what few pennies they had to pay for their trips, I ask unanimous consent that no rule XVI point of order lie against any gun-related amendment to the military construction appropriations. This would apply to Republican or Democratic amendments.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the debt we owe to the men and women who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces is one that we will never be able to repay adequately. They sacrifice so much of themselves to defend our nation and its ideals, and ask for so little in return. 
   Today, I would like to focus the Senate's attention on one such veteran, who entered the United States Marine Corps more than a quarter-century ago. Colonel Wayne Shaw, who was a Marine for over 28 years, retired recently and delivered a farewell address to his fellow officers at Quantico, Virginia. 
   Colonel Shaw's address at Quantico was not your typical ``feel-good'' retirement speech. In it, he makes a number of observations about how the Marine Corps has changed in recent years--and how, in his view, many of those changes have weakened the Corps that, for the sake of our country and the world, needs to remain strong. Not a man to mince words, Colonel Shaw lists in his speech a number of concerns he has about the future of the Marine Corps. 
   Colonel Shaw does not question the future of the Corps because of any disillusionment he may have about the institution. Rather, he questions the future of the Corps because of his love for and devotion to it. Colonel Shaw is certainly entitled--if anyone is--to critique the Marine Corps because of his unique commitment to this country for nearly three decades. I believe we owe it to Colonel Shaw and other veterans like him to pay heed to his words of warning and carefully consider his suggestions to sustain the integrity of the U.S. Marine Corps. I hope each and every member of this chamber will do so. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Colonel Shaw's retirement address be printed into the RECORD.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the majority leader for his statement and for the effort he has put forward in bringing us to this point. 
   I agree with virtually every word he has just spoken about the importance of this matter and about the extraordinary influence it will have on trade policy to important parts of the world today. This is not only good trade policy, it is good economic policy, and it is good diplomatic policy. It is extremely important that people realize the diplomatic, economic, and trade ramifications of this legislation. 
   I have watched with great admiration as this legislation has been produced. I must say it is one of the many reasons I have come to admire our ranking member on the Finance Committee and his extraordinary effort in getting us to this point. I don't know that I have talked to him about any matter as often as I have talked to him about this in recent months. This is one he has lived and breathed. We are very grateful to him for his leadership and for all of the work he did to get us to this point. 
   I have already expressed myself in regard to the importance of the legislation and the extraordinary amount of effort that has gone into the work today. This would not have happened were it not for the involvement of a number of our colleagues. Its importance cannot be overemphasized. This is good for this country, and as I noted, it is important we recognize the new opportunities that it presents, not only for the Caribbean countries and Africa but for this country especially. 
   I would be remiss if I were not to mention the tremendous leadership demonstrated by the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD. On every issue involving Central and Latin America, our caucus depends upon him to a remarkable degree. He is, without a doubt, our expert on South America, on Central America, and on international issues. I personally find myself required, in many cases, to turn to him as the person in whom I have the greatest trust and for whom I have the greatest admiration when it comes to his knowledge of these issues. I thank Senator DODD for all of his efforts in getting us to this point. 
   I also thank Senator GRAHAM from Florida who has put a great deal of effort into the vote we were able to get this morning, and I am grateful to him. 
   Finally, Senator BAUCUS also has worked diligently with all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and is also extraordinarily knowledgeable on trade matters. 
   We have a number of our colleagues who, because they worked as hard as they did, because they showed the leadership they did, because they were as committed as they were to resolving outstanding differences and working through these many issues in a way that allowed us this success, we ought to pause and thank today. It is not often we see legislation, and trade legislation in particular, of this import with the kind of vote we just cast. It is a great day for this country. I again publicly express my appreciation for their diligence and for their work in getting us to this point.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend our colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG, for his efforts. He has done the Senate a service and has called the Senate and the Nation's attention to the importance of the Million Mom March. I appreciate as well the participation and the leadership Senator BOXER is always able to provide for our caucus on so many issues before the Senate. They have articulated very ably and admirably for our caucus today in expressing to all of those coming from all parts of the country how important it is they express themselves, how important it is they exercise their constitutional opportunities in this great country, how important it is they send a message to the rest of the country, as well as to Members of the Congress, the critical nature of the need to address the gun issue in an effective way. 
   That is all they are coming to express themselves on, and it is appropriate at this time, and given the tremendous message that numbers of women will send by their presence, that we acknowledge their presence and welcome them to this city; that we tell them we are listening; that we resolve to respond in as effective a way as we can. 
   Again, I thank the senior Senator from New Jersey for his efforts, and the Senator from California for participating, for sending that message loudly and clearly and for doing all they can to recognize the importance of what will happen in Washington on Sunday. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are about to go out. Before we do, I wanted to call attention to the fact that I wish we could have taken up the ESEA bill again this afternoon. The fact is that we have amendments that could have been offered on either side. We have indicated a willingness to even offer time agreements on virtually all amendments. There are a number of amendments that are pending. We are told that we just do not have time on the schedule to revisit ESEA this week. I really question that. The fact is that we have been in morning business all afternoon. We are not going to be in session tomorrow. We will be in debate only scheduled on Monday for the military construction bill. We are not overworked here. 
   It seems to me that on an issue as important as ESEA needs to be addressed. The fact is, it should have been reauthorized last year. It wasn't. It needs to be reauthorized this year. 
   We have fewer than 40 legislative days left between now and the time that we are scheduled to adjourn. With appropriations bills, the China debate, and a number of other issues unfinished--bankruptcy we hope, and other issues--there is very little time. 
   So it seems to me that we ought to be using what time we have available to us to our best advantage. Being in morning business for most of the day is not my concept of utilization of time in an appropriate way. 
   Again, I express the regret that we haven't had more of a chance this week to deal with this very, very critical bill. The education bill ought to be finished. We worked on it in a very constructive way, I have felt. There has been progress--limited, but, nonetheless, progress. We could have had a lot more progress. There is no reason why we can't finish this bill. There is no reason why we couldn't have done another bloc of amendments today and some amendments tomorrow. In fact, I think maybe we could have finished the bill this week. That is now impossible. And there is no prospect of bringing the bill up at least for the foreseeable future, given what the majority leader has indicated is his intention with regard to appropriations bills. 
   I am troubled and disappointed by that. 
   I make note of that as we end the day today. Hopefully, we will have more productive weeks and more opportunities to debate this issue. But time is going by quickly. We don't have that much more time. I hope we can better use the time we have. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with 34 of our Senate Democratic colleagues in introducing the Medicare Expansion for Needed Drugs Act, a bill to mend Medicare by adding a long overdue prescription drug benefit. 
   I want to begin by thanking all the people who have brought us to this point. 
   Senator DORGAN and many of our other colleagues have held numerous hearings in Washington, and around the country on the issue of Medicare prescription drug coverage. I thank my colleagues and all who came to the hearings. 
   I know that they heard from people at those hearings they would not have otherwise heard from. The testimony they heard was virtually unanimous at each of these hearings, that Medicare must now, this year, be expanded to include necessary coverage. 
   I also thank all of the seniors, pharmacists, doctors, and others who took the time to educate us on this important matter. Their wisdom has made this a better bill. 
   In addition, I thank the President--for keeping the issue of Medicare prescription drugs on the national agenda, and for providing the framework for our proposal. 
   I thank the many organizations representing seniors and consumers who told us about the terrible strain paying for prescription drugs places on seniors and their families. 
   Most of all, I thank the many seniors from all across America who told us about their struggles to pay for prescription drugs. 
   I want to share with you one example from my State. 
   Fran Novotny is a 70-year-old retired nurse from Hill City, SD. She takes prescription medications every day to control diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. She has also had bypass surgery. 
   Every month, she gets a Social Security check for $616. 
   Every month, she spends about $550 on prescriptions. 
   She has a small pension, but it doesn't add up to much. So she is quickly depleting her entire life savings. After it is gone, she has no idea how she will pay for her medications. 
   Her story, and many others like it, are the reason we must move forward and enact a Medicare prescription drug benefit this year. We must make sure that Fran Novotny--and the millions of seniors like her--can afford their prescriptions--and their grocery bills and their rent and their clothing and their utility bills. 
   The average Medicare beneficiary fills 18 prescriptions a year. 
   Yet three-in-five Medicare beneficiaries lack decent, dependable coverage for prescription drugs. And more than one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries--more than 15 million seniors--have no prescription drug coverage at all. 
   This is not a problem faced only by the poorest beneficiaries. More than half of all Medicare beneficiaries without coverage have incomes above 150 percent of poverty,  
   That is why two-thirds of the Democratic caucus has joined in introducing this bill to make prescription drug coverage available and affordable to all Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Our plan is universal. 
   Every single Medicare beneficiary who wants the coverage has it under this bill. 
   Second, our plan is voluntary. 
   It is not a requirement that you sign up for this legislation. If you have a good plan, use it. If you have a good company, stay with it. If you have a plan that works for you, for whatever reason, this plan encourages you to stay right where you are. But if you do not have coverage, if you need coverage and cannot get it anywhere else, this bill will make it available to you for the first time. 
   Every Medicare beneficiary can choose to participate, whether he or she is in traditional, fee-for-service Medicare or a Medicare Plus Choice plan. Retirees who already have private prescription drug coverage can keep it. It is up to them. 
   We also provide incentives to employers to provide and maintain drug coverage. We do not want to see the people who are now providing it to their employees or retirees dropping these people once this plan becomes available, so we have encouraged, we have incentivized businesses to do that. 
   Our plan provides meaningful coverage. 
   Medicare would cover half of beneficiaries' discounted prescription drug bills, up to $5,000 a year. That means that Fran Novotny--who spends $550 a month on prescription drugs--would be able to save at least $275 a month. That $275 a month will make a real difference in her life. 
   Our plan also provides catastrophic coverage for people who need to take very expensive drugs that can cost $5,000, or $10,000 a year, or more. It is our hope that after a Medicare beneficiary has paid the first $3,000 or $4,000 in catastrophic care costs, Medicare would pick up the balance. 
   Our program is also affordable. 
   Beneficiaries would pay premiums to cover about half the cost of the program. Medicare would contribute the other half. 
   Seniors with incomes between 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty would receive assistance with their premiums. Those with incomes below 135 percent of poverty would receive assistance with premiums and copays. 
   Our plan would give seniors bargaining power that they just don't have today. 
   The problem today isn't just that seniors end up paying out-of-pocket expenses for their prescriptions, they also pay a lot more for those out-of-pocket costs. On average, seniors pay twice as much for their medications as big insurance companies and HMOs do today. 
   The fact that seniors face the highest prices at the drugstore is, frankly, wrong. Our plan gives seniors the bargaining power that comes with numbers. 
   Another thing our plan does--which is very important to many of us in rural areas--is to include special protections to make sure that Medicare beneficiaries who live in rural communities have the same affordable, timely access to prescription drugs as everyone else. 
   It gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to offer pharmacists incentives to cover rural communities and other hard-to-serve areas. Every American should be able to get affordable prescription drugs--when they need them--whether they live in a big city or a small town. 
   Our plan mirrors the best practices used in the private sector. 
   For beneficiaries in traditional Medicare, prescription drug coverage would be delivered by private entities that negotiate prices with drug manufacturers. This is the same mechanism used by private insurers. 
   Beneficiaries in Medicare Plus Choice plans would get their prescription drug coverage through their Plus Choice plan. 
   Finally, the bill recognizes that we need to shift the focus of Medicare from simply treating illness, to keeping beneficiaries well. 
   While prescription drug coverage is an important first step in this effort, there are likely other changes we should make. So this bill sets up a process for Congress to consider further benefit changes--to enhance prevention--on an expedited basis. I want to thank Senator GRAHAM for his leadership on this important issue. 
   On the issue of broader Medicare reform, I would like to see prescription drugs pass as part of a larger package of reforms and modernizations, and I believe this bill and its benefit is consistent with such efforts. 
   I'm also pleased to report that our bill is supported by an array of important groups: The National Council of Senior Citizens; the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare; National Council on the Aging; the Older Women's League; the AFL-CIO; The National Community Pharmacists Association; Families USA; Consumers Union; the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations; the Association for Homes and Services for the Aging; the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging; and AARP. 
   We hope we will have support from our Republican colleagues, too. 
   Prescription drug coverage for all seniors is an issue on which we cannot afford to procrastinate. The cost of delay is too great--in lost opportunities, lost health, and lost lives. 
   In 1965, when Medicare was created, it didn't include prescription drug coverage. Neither did most private insurance plans. Today, virtually all private health plans offer some sort of prescription drug coverage--but not Medicare. 
   It is time--it is past time--to close this gap. Prescription drugs are an integral part of medicine today. They ought to be an integral part of Medicare. Period. 
   Now--before the Baby Boomers retire, and the problems are still manageable--is the time to strengthen Medicare. Now, while our economy is strong, and we have a surplus, is the time to add a universal, voluntary, and affordable prescription drug benefit to Medicare.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not ask for time. As the majority leader has indicated, this does not in any way reflect what we have attempted to do beyond this agreement. We have some amendments on either side. Senator DODD has a very important afterschool amendment that will come shortly after this lineup. 
   We also have Senator BINGAMAN, dealing with accountability; Senator HARKIN on construction; Senator MIKULSKI on digital divide; and Senator DODD's amendment will likely come up after this agreement. I know there are Senators on the other side who will be in the mix as well. No one should think this limits their ability to be heard and to offer their amendments. 
   I appreciate very much the cooperation of everybody. 
   I will not object.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, ten years ago I joined with two distinguished colleagues, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Senator TOM HARKIN, to introduce the reformulated gasoline (RFG) provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The RFG provision, with its minimum oxygen standard, was adopted in the Senate by the overwhelming vote of 69 to 30 and eventually signed into law by President George Bush. 
   I am proud to say that this program has resulted in substantial improvement in air quality around the country. It also has stimulated increased production and use of renewable ethanol and other oxygenates needed to meet the minimum oxygen standard. 
   Unfortunately, an unanticipated development involving the petroleum-based oxygenate MTBE requires us to re-examine the many benefits of the RFG program. The detection of MTBE in ground water around the country has generated considerable debate in recent months over how to deal with this fuel additive and the oxygen requirement of the reformulated gasoline program. The resolution of this debate will have significant consequences for the environment, for farmers and for the rural economy. 
   The pace of activity to resolve the MTBE issue is accelerating rapidly. Battlelines are being drawn as the state of California and its allies focus on scrapping the oxygen requirement. 
   It is clear that Congress and/or the Clinton administration will respond to the MTBE problem. My focus is on ensuring that that response not only serves the environment, but also retains a prominent place for ethanol--a place that assures long-term, predictable growth of the industry. 
   I believe a comprehensive legislative solution is necessary in this case--one that recognizes and preserves the important air quality benefits of the RFG program, protects water supplies and leads the nation away from greater dependence on imported oil. 
   I have worked for the last year with the ethanol industry, Republican and Democratic colleagues in the Senate, the Governor's Ethanol Coalition, environmental organizations and the administration in search of a solution that gives states the tools they need to address MTBE contamination, ensures the future growth of domestic renewable fuels, and prevents supply shortages and price spikes in the nation's fuels supply. 
   This process has led me to two basic conclusions. 
   First, the MTBE crisis has left the RFG oxygen requirement vulnerable to legislative attack. Those who doubt this conclusion should reflect on the following facts. 
   California refiners have shown that clean-burning gasoline can be produced without oxygen. 
   EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel has recommended that the oxygen requirement be repealed. 
   The RFG oxygen requirement is opposed by a diverse coalition that includes the American Lung Association, the American Petroleum Institute, the New England States Coordinated Air Use Management agency, the State of California and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). 
   Second, support for the oxygen requirement will weaken over time. Improvements in auto emissions control technology will cause the air quality benefits of oxygen in gasoline to decline and the justification for the RFG oxygen requirement to diminish. 
   As one of the original authors of the reformulated gasoline provisions of the Clean Air Act, I feel something of a proprietary interest in the oxygen requirement. As a legislator, I recognize that circumstances change, and obstinacy should not be allowed to become a barrier to the achievement of important policy goals. 
   Ethanol advocates face a choice between defending the oxygen requirement in the near term, realizing that its days ultimately are numbered, or using the current MTBE debate to guarantee the future growth of the ethanol industry based on important public policy goals, such as energy security, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and domestic economic growth. 
   In my judgment, providing states with the flexibility to waive the RFG oxygen requirement is a fair tradeoff for the establishment of a renewable fuels standard. It represents the most effective way to achieve the environmental and economic goals of governors and consumers, while putting the ethanol industry on a steady growth path well into the future and promoting ethanol production in new regions of the nation. 
   Therefore, today, with Senator RICHARD LUGAR, I am introducing the Renewable Fuels Act of 2000. Under our  legislation, EPA is directed to reduce the use of MTBE to safe levels, and states can obtain waivers from the RFG oxygen requirement and further regulate MTBE if they desire. This will allow the nation to deal with the MTBE contamination issue responsibly and avoid gasoline supply disruptions. The bill also includes provisions protecting the air quality gains that have resulted from the use of oxygenated fuels. 
   To protect market opportunities for renewable fuels, the bill establishes a renewable fuels standard for the nation's gasoline, which begins in 2000 at 1.3 percent--roughly where renewable fuels production stands today--and gradually increases over the next decade to 3.3 percent of the nation's gasoline in 2010. Considering the fact that overall gasoline use is expected to increase over the next decade, this standard will more than triple ethanol use over that period. 
   In meeting that requirement, our legislation stipulates that a gallon of biomass ethanol counts as much as 1.5 gallons of starch-based ethanol, thereby providing a strong incentive for the development of biomass-based ethanol plans throughout the country. It also established a renewable fuels standard for diesel fuels to promote the use of biodiesel. These renewable fuels standards can be met through nationwide credit trading, to allow for the most economomical use of ethanol and biodiesel. 
   For those who are concerned about the potential impact of a drought or other natural disaster on the ability of the renewable fuels industry to supply this market, the legislation allows the EPA Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to waive the renewable requirement in any given year upon determination that there is indequate domestic supply or distribution capacity, or that the requirement would severely harm the economic or environment of a State, a region, or the United States. 
   I also intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to establish a strategic corn reserve as a complement to the renewable fuel standard. A properly managed strategic corn reserve could serve 
   as the equivalent of the strategic petroleum reserve and ensure stable feedstocks for domestic ethanol producers in the event of weather induced supply interruptions. Taxpayers would benefit as farmers could receive fair market prices, thereby reducing the need for emergency assistance each year. 
   It is important to recognize that under Senator LUGAR's and my approach, the oxygen requirement is not waived entirely. States can decide for themselves whether to apply for a waiver from the RFG oxygen requirement. We fully expect that RFG programs that currently are using ethanol and have not experienced MTBE contamination, such as Chicago and Milwaukee, will stay in the program. Moreover, the bill allows any governor to apply to EPA to opt into the RFG program, thus expanding its air quality benefits to new regions of the country. Those areas that remain in the program or opt into it, and use ethanol, will generate credits that can be sold to other regions of the country. 
   Finally, the bill prevents adverse effects on states' highway trust fund tax allocations, with ``hold harmless'' language ensuring that states reporting Federal excise tax receipts on gasoline are not penalized for their ethanol blend sales. 
   Again, my goal in introducing this legislation is both to support states that want to get MTBE out of gasoline and to ensure that this effort does not adversely affect ethanol production. It is also to put into place a program that will grow the ethanol industry steadily over the next decade, thereby assuring the market stability necessary to attract investment in the construction of new plants and significantly increasing the market for corn and biomass. This approach not only will get MTBE out of groundwater; it will do so without backsliding on the air quality improvements generated by the RFG program while increasing corn demand by 600 million bushels per year. 
   Mr. President, since first floating this concept in May of last year, I have heard from numerous stakeholders in this complex debate. The legislative concept that Senator LUGAR and I unveil today has been endorsed by diverse interests ranging from the American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to the 24-state Governors' Ethanol Coalition, to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) to Mr. Leo Leibowitz, chairman of Getty Petroleum. I believe that we have struck a delicate balance between the interests of farmers, consumers, state regulatory officials, refiners and those concerned about the environment. This plan is a worthy successor to the original 1990 RFG provision, preserving all of the good things it has achieved and rectifying those elements that need fixing. 
   I look forward to working with Senators SMITH and BAUCUS, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, to enact legislation resolving the MTBE issue. I hope that other colleagues will join Senator LUGAR and me in support of this legislation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not sure what the time allocation is, but I will use my leader time to make a few remarks, if I may. 
   Mr. President, every day--until very recently--if you looked toward the west entrance to the Senate floor, as my colleague from Nevada has just noted, chances are, you would see Mike Epstein--with that wonderful, warm smile--Senator WELLSTONE's learned and much-loved legislative director. 
   Today, however, as so many of my colleagues have already noted, Mike is not with us. He is at home resting, because he is very, very sick. His absence from this floor, from this Senate he loves so well, is conspicuous. It is being felt in the hearts of every member of the Senate community. Indeed, it is being felt in the very heart of this institution itself. 
   For Mike Epstein is actually an institution within an institution.  
   He is a Senate staffer of the old school. He came to the Senate in 1971--before virtually every member of the Senate staff, and before all but seven sitting Senators. 
   That is not the kind of thing Mike would ever tell you. As a staffer of the old school, he isn't given to boasting or self-promotion. Then again, he doesn't have to: his experience and his ability speak for themselves. 
   During Mike's tenure here, he has served on the staffs, as I am sure my colleagues have already noted, of some of our most distinguished Senators to serve in my lifetime, including Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, Senator TED KENNEDY, Senator PAUL SARBANES, and now--for the last 9 years--our dear, dear Senator from Minnesota, Mr. PAUL WELLSTONE.  
   He also served as a member of the staffs of the Committees on Foreign Relations, Ethics, Labor and Human Resources, and Judiciary. 
   He first came to Washington in 1962 as a young attorney working at the Department of Justice for Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. 
   Along the way he picked up a library full of knowledge, and a mind full of wisdom. 
   He became--at the elbow of the master, Senator ROBERT C. BYRD--an expert in Senate history, rules, and parliamentary procedure. 
   He also became a friend, teacher, and mentor to generations of Senate staff. 
   And he became a valued and trusted counselor to the Senators for whom he worked, and for many others--this Senator included. 
   What a career. What a remarkable achievement. But then again, what a remarkable man. 
   What is perhaps most remarkable about Mike is his passion. 
   Even though all those years of public service tends to wear someone down, Mike is still fiercely, proudly committed to the ideals of a progressive agenda, much like his boss, Senator WELLSTONE.  
   But ``boss'' is the wrong term to use in describing the relationship between Mike and PAUL. They are more like family. In fact, Mike says PAUL is like a brother to him. I know PAUL feels exactly the same way about Mike. 
   Before joining PAUL's staff in 1991, Mike told a friend that his dream job would be to work as Senator PAUL WELLSTONE's legislative director. That dream came true for Mike, and he and PAUL have been inseparable ever since. 
   So, Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic Conference, the Democratic staff, and frankly, the entire Democratic Party, not to mention our Senate community, I thank my friend, PAUL WELLSTONE for being here today and for telling this Senate how much Mike Epstein means to this institution and to all of us. 
   Most of all, I want to express our heartfelt gratitude to our gallant, courageous colleague, Mike Epstein, for his friendship--and for his inspired service to the Senate and to the Nation. 
   Mike, we are keeping you and your family very much in our thoughts and in our prayers. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to participate in this debate over the last couple of days. This is the first chance I have had. I would like to make a statement, and at the end of my statement I will be introducing the Democratic substitute which, under the agreed-upon order, will be the second amendment to be considered during the debate on this legislation. 
   I think, as everyone has already noted, this is an important debate for a lot of reasons. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is truly the blueprint that guides all Federal education policy from prekindergarten through high school. So this is the big one. This is the one that really counts when it comes to the Federal policy framework under which we will work for the next 6 years. Every 5 or 6 years,  Congress has the responsibility to do what we are doing now, to decide what is working, to fix what is not. 
   In the past, this debate on ESEA has always been vigorous, but it has always been bipartisan. In the end, the votes have always been bipartisan. Unfortunately, that is not the way things have shaped up so far this year. 
   Two months ago, Republican leaders in the Senate stunned us by announcing that they were abandoning efforts to develop the bipartisan approach we have used now for 35 years. Instead, they put forward legislation so sharply partisan that even the Republican chair voted ``present'' on two major Republican amendments in committee. 
   The truth is, this bill does not redefine the Federal role in education, it abandons it. It essentially repeals the role of the Federal Government in education. Instead of targeting Federal education dollars where they can do the most good, the bill takes money from Federal education programs and puts it in block grants. All the Federal Government would do is sign blank checks. Governors and State legislators would decide how the money is spent. Block grants eliminate any guarantee the funds will be spent where they are most needed or on reforms that are most effective. 
   Our Republican colleagues claim to hold States accountable for the results. They require states to have a plan in this legislation, but in that plan the State sets their own performance goals and the goals be based on State averages. If children from well-off families made all the gains, that would be good enough. This bill does nothing to make sure the children in disadvantaged communities have access to good teachers and strong academic programs. 
   If States fail to achieve their goals, nothing happens for 5 years. After 5 years, the only penalty for failure to comply is that a State cannot participate in the block grant program for the next year. 
   It is also ironic that they are claiming to ``do something new.'' What new suggestion they are proposing is to take the block grant idea that goes all the way back, at least to 1981, to repeat it again now in the year 2000. That is their new idea. They take an idea that was proposed and passed in 1981, to convert several Federal education programs into a block grant, and to do now what we did then. 
   It is important, as my Democratic colleagues have noted, to look at what has happened to that new idea back in 1981. Since then, the funding for that new idea, funding for that blank check, that block grant, has been cut in half, largely because it is difficult to advocate for a blank check. 
   Republicans have made clear their highest priority is enacting huge tax cuts. Those irresponsible policies would leave absolutely no room for critical investments in education. So this cutting in half of the blank check might fit that scenario. 
   Perhaps we should not be so surprised at their interest in creating new education block grants. This new, revolutionary reform idea of the year 2000, similar to the one in 1981 might be the design: Let's create a block grant, let's sign a blank check, let's cut that blank check in half in 20 years, and let's provide more in tax cuts. What we need is a bipartisan commitment to maintain the national commitment to education and invest in solutions that we know work. 
   One of our great leaders in South Dakota history has been the Indian leader Sitting Bull. More than a century ago, he actually came to Washington and noted in a speech to policymakers at the time that if we put our minds together and see what life can make for our children, we will all be the beneficiaries. 
   Today, we make that same request of all of our colleagues. For the sake of our children, let's put aside these extraordinary partisan differences, put our minds together, and see what we can do for our children's future. That, in essence, is what Democrats are providing with this comprehensive plan to improve America's public schools. Our entire caucus has worked hard on this plan. I am very gratified that our entire caucus supports it. 
   Our plan is a substitute for the Republican block grant proposal that is now on the Senate floor. It actually includes many pieces of the bipartisan plan our Republican colleagues abandoned in March. It is not a blank check. It sets high standards for students and teachers. It gives communities the resources and tools to meet those standards. It holds them accountable for results. It targets Federal education dollars where they will do the most good. 
   We do this by helping communities reduce class size, by recruiting and training qualified teachers, by helping to rebuild and replace overcrowded and crumbling schools and helping close the digital divide so all children can compete in the new economy, and by strengthening parents' involvement in their children's education, through report cards and other information, so they can hold schools accountable. 
   It also helps create opportunities for safe before- and afterschool programs where children can receive responsible adult supervision. It is troubling to many of us that every afternoon in America, 5 million kids go home after school to empty houses while their parents sit at work and worry about their safety. Our Democratic colleagues believe we can do better than that. 
   Improving public education must be our top priority. 
   State and local governments clearly have the responsibility for funding and running our Nation's public school programs. Federal programs should be the catalyst for change. We need to focus our efforts on fundamental changes that work to make sure every child has the opportunity to learn. 
   We took important steps in 1994 by requiring States to set high standards for learning and to assess student performance, and we are starting already to see some results in some areas, as some of my colleagues have noted. 
   Student performance is rising in reading, math, and science. Why? Because we took action in 1994. 
   SAT scores are rising. Why? Because we took action in 1994. Why? Because the Federal Government created the incentives. Why? Because we have been the catalyst to move these programs in the right direction. 
   More students are taking rigorous courses and doing better in them. The percentage of students taking biology, chemistry, and physics has doubled. Why? Because we took action in 1994. Why? Because the Federal Government has been directly involved, not in decisionmaking but in incentivizing. 
   More students are passing AP exams. Fewer students are dropping out. Why? Because we took action. 
   What we are saying now is that it is time for us to continue to build on those success stories at the national level that worked then, that are working now, and that provide us with the opportunity to do even more. 
   There is much more to do. Not all schools and not all students are reaching their potential. The achievement gap between rich and poor, between whites and minorities, is unacceptable. Students from disadvantaged communities have significantly less access today to technology. We cannot afford to leave any child behind, and we have to do better. 
   Schools face many challenges that must be addressed if all students are challenged to achieve high standards. School enrollments are at record levels and continuing to rise. A large part of the teaching corps is getting ready to retire. 
   Diversity is increasing, bringing new languages and cultures into the classroom. 
   Family structures are changing. More women are in the workplace creating the need for quality afterschool and summer school activities. 
   We are learning how important good development in early childhood is in determining success in school. 
   The importance of higher education has never been greater. Our public schools need to make sure that all students are prepared to continue to learn in college or in technical training or on the job. 
   These are national changes, and the Federal Government, as we have been, must be a partner in addressing them. 
   My State of South Dakota has many small rural school districts. These schools face a particular set of challenges and limited resources to address them. Many have a hard time attracting qualified teachers, and teachers often have to teach more than one subject. Course offerings may be limited. Because students can come from long distances, many rural schools have  high transportation costs. In many rural communities, the tax base is actually shrinking. The crisis in the farm economy is making it difficult to modernize schools and meet all of these student needs. 
   Federal resources are important for these schools, but they do not even get enough funding to make effective programs in the first place. 
   The Democratic alternative includes a provision to provide supplemental payments to qualifying rural schools that they can use to hire and train teachers, reduce class size, improve school 
   safety, and upgrade technology. 
   For more than 50 years, and going all the way back prior to that period 50 years ago when the first baby boomers were born, our parents committed themselves to the most ambitious school construction program in our Nation's history. They had just fought the Second World War, and they could have said: We have sacrificed enough for a while. We fought the war; we won the war. Now it is somebody else's responsibility. 
   Instead, they said: We love this country; we love our children; we want them to have at least as good a life as we have had, and we are willing to work to give them that chance. 
   Most of us who now serve in Congress attended those schools. We have benefited greatly from the decisions and sacrifices they made. The question facing us now is pretty simple, but awfully important: Are we willing to give our own children, are we willing to give our own grandchildren, the same chance we were given? Are we willing to work with each other, with parents, teachers, and community and business leaders to strengthen our schools? Or are we going to turn our backs? 
   The answer to that question is going to be decided in part by the decisions we make over the next several days on the education bill and, frankly, on this amendment. 
   If one visits London, they will see the work of Christopher Wren everywhere. He was the 17th century architect whose work defines London's skyline today. He built 51 churches. He built palaces, hospitals, and libraries. His most famous work, of course, is St. Paul's Cathedral. If one goes to the crypt at St. Paul's and looks hard, he will see a small black stone marking the architect's final resting place. It is written in Latin. It simply says: If you seek his monument, look around. 
   The blueprint we are drafting today is like a cathedral. It is like a blueprint that will help shape our children's education and, thus, their future. If we do it well, it will inspire them to find the best in themselves. 
   The monuments we are creating are for our children, and we need to ask ourselves what will our monuments say about us and what we value. 
   Twelve years ago, America's Governors were able to do just that. All 50 Governors, Republicans and Democrats, agreed on eight national goals: 
   No. 1, all children will start school ready to learn. 
   No. 2, graduation rates will increase by 90 percent. 
   No. 3, all children will demonstrate competency in challenging subject matter. 
   No. 4, teachers will have access to programs to improve their professional skills. 
   No. 5, U.S. students will be first in the world in math and science achievement. 
   No. 6, every American adult will be literate. 
   No. 7, every school will be disciplined, safe, and drug free. 
   And finally, No. 8, every school will promote parental involvement and participation. 
   In a few weeks, the children who were in the first grade when those goals were written will graduate from high school. Children grow up quickly. Instead of abandoning our Federal commitment to education, we need to work together to build that monument so one day we, too, can say: If you want to see what this great country did on education, look around. If you want to see how good we are, go into the schools where eight goals were pronounced and now are reality. If you want to see whether or not we as Senators have succeeded and achieved our goals representing the great legacy left to us by others, look around. 
   Let us do this right. Let us pass good comprehensive elementary and secondary education today so that we can provide the kind of incentive, the kind of commitment, the kind of investments, the kind of direct, responsible approach that is so warranted if, indeed, we say that our children are important and our future is really what it is all about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleague from Washington for her leadership on this issue, and particularly on the issue of class size, and all of the work that she has done to get us to this point. 
   Mr. President, I will use whatever additional time I need out of my leader allotment to finish my remarks. 
   Let me begin by complimenting the distinguished chairman and manager on the other side for the manner in which he has closed the debate. 
   There is no one who has worked on a more bipartisan basis on so many issues than has he. I respect him and appreciate the tone that he has set, once again, in calling for bipartisanship. I guess the irony is that we find ourselves, in spite of his desire for bipartisanship, at a point where we have very little of it. 
   I am as disappointed as he is that in committee, after more than a year's worth of work, the document the committee had been using, the work they had been constructing was shelved in favor of a very partisan approach to the Federal role in education for the next 6 years through ESEA. 
   I know, I am sure--I do not know--I am sure that he shares my disappointment that the kind of bipartisan tradition we have had in drafting this legislation over 35 years was not represented in the final vote during the markup of the ESEA in committee. So his call for bipartisanship, I know, on his part is genuine. 
   I am disappointed it was not reflected in the actions taken by the committee. I am disappointed that it does not reflect our current status on the Senate floor. As a result, I am really disappointed that we are relegated now to offering a Democratic substitute, when we could have worked on a bipartisan bill that would have allowed both parties to claim achievement and some success, and the confidence that we are doing the right thing in addressing education at the Federal level. 
   I thank all of my colleagues for the extraordinary effort they have made to bring us to this point within my caucus. I have mentioned Senator MURRAY. I thank, first and foremost, Senator KENNEDY, for all the work he has done as our ranking member. I thank Senator DODD and all of the members of the HELP Committee. But I must say, all of our colleagues--Senator LIEBERMAN, and others--have joined with us in an effort to make this the very best proposal we could make. 
   I believe we have achieved that. I believe there is a lot more we can do. But given our circumstances, given where we are, I believe this represents the finest opportunity that we will be able to construct to ensure that for the next 6 years, during this ESEA authorization, we build upon the things that have worked, change the things that have not. We as we acknowledge the report 
   card that still stands in the back of this Chamber--the report card by the American Society of Civil Engineers issued just a little more than a year ago--as we look at our infrastructure, in all of its different facets, as we determine what is working and what is not, we can say, with some authority and with some absolute certainty that too many of our schools are failing when it comes to the infrastructure. 
   We are getting poor results. We are not doing what we should in large measure because we have not made the commitment in infrastructure that we must make in education. So they gave schools an F. So we are faced with that reality, that we can do a better job. 
   We are faced really with two choices. One choice is to say: Let's take those tools. Let's assure that those things we know are working can be built upon, and that we can provide the kind of leadership and be the catalyst we know we can be in improving teacher quality, in improving accountability, in reducing class size, in ensuring there is more technology in all schools, and to make sure there is more parental involvement--taking all of those things that school boards and parents and teachers and school officials tell us we have to do a better job on. We can work to improve those specific areas with the knowledge it is going to take resources. We can do that. That is what the Democratic substitute does do. 
   On the other hand, we can do what we attempted to do back in 1981, in the name of flexibility, 
   in the name of local control. Ironically, we created a blank-check approach that, I believe, has been an abysmal failure--a failure in terms of the kind of commitment to that approach, represented in real dollars, now cut by more than half since the legislation was passed, an approach that probably is far more bureaucratic, when you think about it. We go from the people administering the program at the Federal level through the people administering the program at the State level, to the people administering the program at the city or school district level, to the people administering the program in the schools themselves. That is the Republican approach. That is the blank check. If that isn't bureaucratic, I don't know what is. 
   What we say is, if you really want local control, if you want to ensure that the maximum number of dollars get right into the school, bypass all of that and you will directly affect the school and provide the resources. That is what we say you should do. That is what our substitute does. That is real local control. That is providing the resources in the place where it can do the most good, without all of the bureaucratic hurdles, without all of the money going from here to the State capital, to the county, to the city, to the school district, to the school. We should not have to do that. 
   So I find a real irony in this local control argument used by some on the other side. I will say that I am hopeful, in spite of the history over the last several days--a somewhat partisan approach to this debate--we can actually reach some sort of a bipartisan consensus before the end of the debate. I am hopeful, as the chairman has indicated, that there is yet some opportunity for us to reach across the aisle. This is our best hope in doing that. We know all of the things that we are suggesting have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. These have not been partisan issues. There is no reason why now it must be. So we offer this amendment in good faith, hoping that our Republican colleagues will join us in building on the success of the past and ensuring that we really have local control, in recognizing the educational tools that can be of extraordinary benefit to students and teachers all over this country. That is what this amendment is about, and I urge its adoption. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is important to be clear what this vote is about--and what it is not about. This vote is not a test of who supports eliminating the marriage penalty. Virtually every member of this Senate agrees: Married couples who work hard just to make ends meet should not have to pay more in taxes simply because they are married. 
   If the plan proposed by our Republican colleagues only eliminated the marriage penalty in a way that was fair and responsible, I would vote for it. And so, I suspect, would every other Democrat in this Senate. 
   But the Republican plan goes far beyond fixing the marriage penalty. Sixty percent of their $248 billion plan has nothing to do with fixing the marriage penalty. That is what this vote is about. This vote is about the tens of billions of dollars of tax cuts hidden in this bill that have nothing to do with eliminating the marriage penalty on working families. 
   In addition to the $99 billion it costs to address the marriage penalty, the Republican plan includes another $149 billion for tax breaks that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty. Most of these new tax breaks would go to those who arguably need it least--including couples at the top of the income ladder who already get a marriage bonus! 
   We believe there is a better use for that additional $149 billion: creating an affordable, voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit. That is what this vote is about: Should we use the extra tens of billions of dollars in this bill to create more tax breaks that disproportionately benefit upper income Americans--people who, in many cases, get a marriage bonus? Or should we eliminate the marriage penalty for couples who need a tax cut, and use the other $149 billion in this bill to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit? 
   What is really going on here? What are Republicans afraid of? Evidently, they are absolutely terrified of voting on our prescription drug amendment. They seem to recoil at even the slightest mention of those two words. 
   Our Republican colleagues filed cloture on this bill before debate had even begun. They hope to rig the procedural situation so as to shield their faulty bill from public scrutiny and avoid voting on prescription drugs. 
   Senator LOTT has said our amendments are ``ridiculous.'' He has said it would give him great joy to vote against them. We want to make his day. We want to give him that chance. That is why I once again will vote against cloture on this bill. If Republicans really think our amendments are ``ridiculous,'' they can vote against them. If they think that adding a prescription drug benefit is a ``poison pill,'' they can vote against it. But let us vote and get on with the Senate's business and the business of the American people.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I regret that this vote had to have been taken. I have made it clear from the very beginning that my hope is we can find some way to compromise. We have thought we have already compromised extensively. We have limited the number of amendments. We have limited the time on those amendments. We are now even prepared to allow second degrees so long as we get a vote. That is the regular order. 
   We believe, as strongly as we want to resolve the marriage tax penalty, that having the opportunity to offer a better alternative is something that is so fundamental to the rights of every Democratic Senator. This vote we took had nothing to do with the marriage tax penalty. It had everything to do with a Senator's right to offer an amendment that would improve a marriage tax penalty bill. I am hopeful we can have some resolution on this matter at some point in the not-too-distant future. 
   I will tell our colleagues in the majority that this vote will not change. This vote will stay at 45 for whatever  length of time it takes. So there will not be any diminution or any erosion in the strength of feeling we have about our right to offer amendments. I am hopeful with that realization we can reach some compromise. 
   Mr. President, I yield 2 hours to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia under the cloture to be used as he deems appropriate during the debate on the marriage tax penalty.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize all the Senators who participated in this important and healthy debate. In particular, I thank Senator LEAHY and Senator BYRD for their tireless defense of the Constitution. 
   In addition, however, I also want to recognize Senator FEINSTEIN for her commitment to victims of violence and for working to ensure that they are treated with fairness and decency and respect. While I strongly disagree with the approach the proponents of this amendment have taken, I completely agree with the sentiments they express. Victims should have a strong voice in our criminal justice system. Senator FEINSTEIN has been committed to this cause for decades and I believe her passion has brought new focus to this important issue. 
   Like many of us, I know what it is like when violence strikes your own family. I would not wish that pain on anyone. And I certainly do not want to see any victim's grief compounded by a needlessly callous or insensitive judicial system. 
   The question we have been debating, however, is not whether victims should have a voice in the criminal justice process. The question before us is whether we must amend our nation's Constitution to achieve that goal. I believe the answer is ``no.'' 
   On September 17, 1789, as our new Constitution was about to be signed--after four long months of debate--Benjamin Franklin announced with typical irony: ``I consent, sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure it is not the best.'' 
   Two-hundred and 12 years later, Mr. President, the United States Constitution is still the best constitution this world has ever known. It is, in my opinion, nearly sacred. James Madison, who penned most of our Constitution, urged that it be amended only in--quote--``certain great and extraordinary occasions.'' 
   For 212 years, Americans have heeded his words of caution. As Senator LEAHY and Senator BYRD remind us, our Constitution has been amended only 17 times since 1791, when the first 10 amendments--Our Bill of Rights--was added. 
   More than 11,000 amendments have been offered during that time. But only 17 have actually been added to our Constitution. Because of the genius of the Framers, and the wise restraint of those who came after them, we have today a document that we can fit in our pockets ..... that we can understand ..... that we can refer to, and live by. 
   This beautiful document contains fundamental, unifying principles that protect our individual liberties and guarantee our democratic rights. The amendment we have been considering--while clearly well-intentioned--does not belong in this document. 
   With all due respect to its authors, it is not a constitutional amendment. It does not describe universal and eternal truths about human nature, or set forth the broad working of government. It is a statute. 
   Last month, we debated another Constitutional amendment--to make flag-  burning a crime. During that debate, some members of this Senate said it was right to take that extraordinary step because Americans had died to defend our flag. 
   Mr. President, this Constitution is why Americans have fought and died for more than 200 years--not to protect a flag, but to protect the principles enshrined in this document. As United States Senators, we take an oath to defend the Constitution. It is our most important obligation, our most sacred duty. 
   There is no ``great and extraordinary occasion'' requiring us to adopt this Victims' Rights Amendment. This amendment is popular. But it is not necessary. Every state--every single state--has some type of statute that identifies and protects victims' rights. Thirty-two states have passed state constitutional amendments protecting victims' rights. Not one of those statutes has been overturned. Not one of these state constitutional amendments has been found to conflict with our federal Constitution. 
   Amending--re-writing--our Constitution--is a remedy that ought to be tried only when we have exhausted every other possible means, and they have been found inadequate. When it comes to protecting victims' rights, there is much we can do, short of amending the Constitution. 
   Indeed, in my home state of South Dakota, every single protection identified in this proposed amendment is guaranteed by state law. In South Dakota, victims are included in every stage of the criminal justice process. They have the right to be notified about every court proceeding involving their case. They are told in advance about bond hearings, plea offers and sentencing hearings, and they have the opportunity to have their opinions heard on these matters. 
   Crime victims in South Dakota are told about all of these rights, and offered help, if they need it, to exercise them. These state laws provide South Dakotans with wide-ranging and effective protections. They may not, however, be a blueprint for Massachusetts, or Mississippi, or California. 
   There is another reason we should reject this amendment, Mr. President. Not only is it unwarranted. But also, ironically, this amendment could actually weaken victims' rights by making it harder for police and prosecutors to do their jobs. That is not simply my opinion. 
   This is a letter from the Chief Justice of the South Dakota Supreme Court. ``Victims' rights will not be furthered by SJR 3--and may indeed be harmed--as past state efforts in this area run headlong into an ethereal national standard that is incapable of responding to the constantly changing circumstances of the justice system.'' 
   Here is another letter--this one from the State's Attorney and the Victim Witness Advocate representing my most heavily populated county. Quote--``While victims' rights are a very important issue, this amendment would make it difficult for us to do our jobs and make appropriate decisions regarding the prosecution of criminal cases.'' 
   Many of my fellow Senators have voiced similar concerns. Senator THOMPSON has said--quote--``This constitutional amendment will make the procedure by which the District Attorneys around the country are trying to prosecute defendants more complex, more costly, more time-consuming in many respects, and ultimately will harm [the goal] that the victim is the most interested in--seeing justice done and a guilty defendant found guilty by our court system.'' 
   The federal government should encourage states to set minimum standards for victims' rights. But we should not trample the principles that have served us so well for so many years. Under our system of government, police powers are reserved for the states. That is why 95 percent of all crimes are prosecuted at the state and local level. 
   Do we really believe it is time to re-write this fundamental division of responsibility? Do we really believe we need to supercede state and local police powers with a national standard? A standard that can only be enforced by an act of Congress? Wouldn't the wiser, more prudent course of action be to encourage or require states to devise and enforce their own victims' rights standards? 
   In addition to the threat this amendment poses to our constitutional framework, I am also concerned it may erode the rights of the accused. I know full well that accused criminals are not a popular group. But the cornerstone of our justice system is the belief that we are all presumed innocent until proven guilty. If we undermine that basic principle in any way, we are all hurt. 
   Our Bill of Rights reflects our framers deeply held belief that the enormous power of the government to deprive persons of life, liberty and property in criminal prosecutions must be checked. Thus, the document I hold in my pocket protects us all from unreasonable searches ..... guarantees us all impartial juries, and protects us all against cruel and unusual punishments. 
   When these rights are diminished for some, they are diminished for all. For that reason, they should not be compromised lightly--no matter how politically popular it might be to do so. What crime victims need is real hope, not paper promises. For that reason, I strongly support both the Leahy ``Crime Victim Assistance Act'' and the Biden ``Violence Against Women Act'' re-authorization. Let's pass these bills. 
   Let's also look at making certain federal funds contingent on states' implementation of meaningful victims' rights at the state level. In fact, I declare today that I will work tirelessly with any member of this Senate who wishes to enact legislation to bolster the rights of victims. But let us stop treating our Constitution so cavalierly. 
   I am deeply troubled by the increasing tendency of this Congress to turn to constitutional tinkering to solve problems, rather than taking up the hard job of legislating. This is the second 
   constitutional amendment we have debated in this Senate in a month! 
   In his final speech to the Constitutional Convention, just before the Constitution was signed, Benjamin Franklin said something that pertains here. After calling the Constitution very likely ``the best'' human beings could hope for, he told his fellow signers: ``I hope for our own sakes and for the sake of our posterity, we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this constitution and turn our future thoughts and endeavors to the means of having it well administered.'' 
   That is our real responsibility as members of this Senate--not to second-guess the genius of this document not to alter and undermine it but to see that it is well administered. In that regard, we have much work to do. Let us do that work. 
   Again, I say to the sponsors of this amendment, I am as committed as anyone in this body to working with you to strengthen victims' rights. Indeed, I would consider every option--even conditioning federal funds on state implementation of basic protections for victims. I cannot, however, and will not--as much as I respect the Senators from California and Arizona--amend our great Constitution unless absolutely necessary. 
   By withdrawing their amendment, I believe the sponsors have acted responsibly, in Senatorial fashion. The Senate should be proud that one more time we have resisted the urge to tamper with the miracle created in Philadelphia in 1787--our Constitution. 
   At this time, I ask unanimous consent that letters from United State District Judge Lawrence Piersol, Chief Justice Robert Miller, State's Attorney Dave Nelson, Victim Witness Assistant Becky Hess and Marshal Lyle Swenson be inserted into the RECORD following my remarks.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, quite often on the floor of the Senate, we give speeches about extraordinary people who do extraordinary things. Today, I'd like to recognize someone whose name you won't see in the headlines, but who is truly extraordinary in every sense of the word. Earlier this year, my good friend Dr. Herb Cheever, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at South Dakota State University (SDSU), announced that he would retire. 
   Dr. Cheever grew up in Brookings, South Dakota and received his undergraduate degree from SDSU. After earning his doctorate from the University of Iowa and teaching in Kansas and Wisconsin, Dr. Cheever returned to his alma mater. He and his wife Sydna raised three boys in Brookings--Jason, Michael and Gene--and Herb and Sydna have long been tireless advocates of the arts in our state. 
   South Dakota State University is a wonderful school. Its reputation for academic excellence and cutting edge research is known across the country. Dr. Cheever is to be commended for the critical role he played in the development of the University, but he should also be recognized for his commitment to the things one can't measure by a standardized test. 
   Dean Cheever is a passionate believer in the importance of public service.  Throughout his teaching career, his commitment to serving others was something that was impressed upon all of his students. When I was an undergraduate at SDSU, Dean Cheever taught me more about the importance of public service than I could have imagined possible, and there is no doubt in my mind that he helped steer me down the career path that I eventually chose to follow. 
   The impact Dean Cheever had on me wasn't confined to his work as an educator. He was also instrumental in helping shape my interest in politics. Dr. Cheever and I volunteered together on George McGovern's race for the Senate in 1968. It was a true pleasure for me to work alongside him during that exciting time. 
   Later, Dean Cheever took leave from SDSU to help Dick Kneip remain governor, and to direct the South Dakota Democratic Party. Politically--and luckily for me--Herb Cheever has worked on behalf of the Democratic Party. However, as everyone who knows him can attest, that is the only venue in which he plays favorites. Dean Cheever's commitment to education and his community, and his passion for public service have made a deep and lasting impression on thousands of young people on SDSU's campus over the years, and I am pleased that I was fortunate enough to be among them. 
   I am proud to call Dean Herbert Cheever a friend, and I am pleased to join Sydna, their friends and family in wishing him the best as he begins the next important chapter of his life. While his colleagues and students will undoubtedly miss his daily presence in the classrooms of SDSU, I am confident that he will continue to touch many lives.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the last week, this budget has gone from bad to worse. That is the only ``progress'' we've seen. After a conference from which Democrats were excluded, our Republicans colleagues are now proposing even bigger tax cuts. Last week, Senate Republicans voted for $150 billion in tax cuts over five years, plus a ``summer surprise'' of more tax cuts. This resolution calls for $175 billion over five years, plus a ``summer surprise.'' 
   To pay for those bigger tax cuts, this resolution calls for even deeper cuts in education, health care, other critical priorities. It still calls for 6 percent across-the-board cut in discretionary spending next year. That hasn't changed--for obvious reasons; our colleagues don't want to make things even worse just before an election. 
   But things do get much worse after the election--and every year for the foreseeable future--under this plan. The additional cuts all ratchet up in the ``out years.'' Instead of 8 percent across-the-board cuts by 2005, this plan calls for cuts of nearly 10 percent across-the-board by 2005. 
   This plan dramatically weakens--in fact, it all but eliminates--any commitment to a prescription drug benefit. Last week, this Senate passed a plan that dedicated $40 billion over five years for prescription drugs. That commitment is not included in this resolution. This resolution includes $20 billion to quote--``improve access to prescription drugs''--whatever that means. There's another $20 billion--but that's available only after we cut Medicare benefits. 
   As if that's not bad enough, this plan says the money for a prescription drug benefit will be available ``whenever'' the Finance Committee reports out a prescription drug bill. ``Whenever''? Why don't they just say the money will be available ``if we feel like it,'' or, the money will be available ``if there's anything left after we pass all our tax breaks''? 
   The Senate-passed Republican budget at least included a date. It said money for prescription drug benefit would be available by Sept. 1, 2000--whether or not the Finance Committee did its job. Now they've scratched out that date and written in ``whenever.'' You can practically see the budget writers winking! What they really mean is ``never.'' 
   Last week, a majority of Senators voted that Congress should put prescription drugs ahead of tax cuts. Fifty-one Senators--Republicans and Democrats--said we should not spend one dollar on tax cuts until we pass a real prescription drug bill. This resolution directly contradicts that statement. It says, ``Forget what we said last week. Spend nearly $200 billion on tax cuts now. Worry about prescription drugs whenever.'' The contradiction would be laughable if it weren't so deadly serious.  
   Our Republican colleagues claim that, under their plan, total discretionary spending next year would be $14 billion above freeze. The operative word is ``total.'' What they don't like to say about their budget is defense spending is $21 billion above a freeze; non-defense discretionary spending is $7 billion below a freeze. 
   There's another thing our colleagues don't like to talk about: According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total non-Social Security surplus over the next five years will be $171 billion. The reason our colleagues don't like to talk about that is their tax cut costs $196 billion over 5 years--$25 billion more than entire non-Social Security surplus. 
   I am tempted to recycle that classic old Yogi Berra line--``It's deja vu all over again.''--because it seems like we've had this same debate every year for the last five years. Instead, let me use a different Yogi Berra quote: ``It ain't over `til it's over.'' This is just the beginning of the budget process. We have many months to go. 
   This budget does not meet the priorities of American people. If we pass this flawed plan, America would miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sustain and expand this economic prosperity; protect Social Security and Medicare; and invest in America's future--in education, medical research, safe communities, clean water--all the things we need to remain strong and competitive. 
   In the five years since they regained control of Congress, Republicans have never passed a budget without a major ``train wreck.'' This budget, unfortunately, sets us up to extend that record. To quote the Republican Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, these numbers are ``unrealistic.'' They do not add up. It's obvious. We know it, and they know it. 
   We hope that this year, our colleagues will admit their plan can't work--before the train wreck. If they do, Democrats are ready, willing and determined to work with them to get the budget process back on track. We want to work with Republicans to write a responsible budget. A budget that extends the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, so we can avoid a Baby Boomer retirement crisis; a budget that includes a real Medicare prescription drug plan that is voluntary, affordable and universal. 
   We want to work with Republicans to pass a budget that pays down our national debt--so we can stop wasting $220 billion a year--$600 million a day--on interest payments. We want to work with our colleagues to pass a budget that provides tax cuts to help working families with real needs--like child care, day care, and caring for older parents--a budget that invests education, health care and other critical priorities. We want to work with Republicans to pass a budget, in short, that allows us to seize, not squander, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity now before us.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today Senator LIEBERMAN and I, along with a group of our colleagues, are introducing a resolution emphasizing to all Americans the importance of accurately and completely filling out their census forms. It is my hope that all members of the Senate will cosponsor this important resolution to support the Census Bureau as it carries out the role that the Constitution and Congress have directed it to take. 
   I continue to be concerned with the statements of some elected officials urging Americans not to respond to some of the questions on their census forms. These statements are reckless and irresponsible. 
   First, every question on the census form is required by the Constitution or by law. All of these questions were reviewed by Congress before the census began, and received virtually no comment at that time. Second, an accurate census is absolutely critical to meet the needs of the public. Local, state and federal aid programs all depend upon an accurate census count to properly distribute funding for roads, schools and health care. Disaster response agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency use census data to prepare for and respond to hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Finally, accurate information about population is absolutely essential to fairly distribute congressional seats to ensure that all Americans have equal representation in Congress. 
   Any effort to encourage Americans not to complete their census questionnaire will only hinder our ability to allow every community to live up to its potential, and provide its citizens with the roads, hospitals and schools they need. 
   As you know, last week the Senate approved an amendment stating that no American should be prosecuted for failing to fill out his or her census form. This resolution was distracting and unnecessary. No American is--or for years has been--prosecuted for failing to complete a census form. 
   The Census Bureau needs to know that it has the full support of the Congress as it carries out its vital task. This resolution makes clear just how important the bureau's task is, and the need for every American to comply with the law and complete the census form. I urge all my colleagues to give it their support.

   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 amendments to be considered during the debate on the marriage tax penalty be the following: 
   An alternative amendment offered by Senator BAUCUS, or his designee; 
   an alternative amendment offered by Senator BAYH; an alternative amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY having to do with Medicaid and family care, or a motion to commit on the part of Senator KENNEDY; a Robb motion regarding marriage tax penalty and prescription drugs; a Wellstone amendment on prescription drugs; a Graham amendment on Medicare and Social Security priorities having to do with the marriage tax penalty; a Schumer amendment having to do with college tuition tax credit and the marriage tax penalty; a Dorgan amendment having to do with taxation of CRP income; a Torricelli amendment having to do with tax consequences of national disaster assistance; and a Harkin amendment having to do with capping benefits in the bill and putting the savings into Medicare and Social Security trust funds on the marriage tax penalty relief legislation, as well. 
   I further ask that each amendment be limited to debate for 1 hour equally divided.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on several occasions we have had debates with the Parliamentarian and with the majority with regard to the issue of relevancy. I point out to my colleagues, the concept of relevancy is only defined as it relates to an appropriations bill. There is no definition of relevancy. 
   In our view, all of these issues are relevant to the debate on marriage tax penalty. We believe relevancy ought to be taken in that context. I am troubled by the interpretation we have gotten from the Parliamentarian a couple of times on the issue of relevancy. In our view, these matters are certainly relevant to the debate on tax consequences and marriage penalties.

   Mr. DASCHLE. No. I am simply saying in most of the amendments offered there is a direct relevancy to the issue of marriage tax penalty. 
   I am also suggesting in all cases we would be prepared to limit the debate to 1 hour equally divided. Regardless of its relevancy, the fact is the majority leader would be able to begin this debate, conduct his debate as he has anticipated, with an expectation that we could finish by the end of the day tomorrow. 
   He has noted, of course, that he doesn't necessarily support or endorse many of these amendments. It is the right of the majority leader, especially given the fact that we have now submitted to a 1-hour time limit, that he can oppose them, he can table them.

   Mr. DASCHLE. We would not agree to second-degree amendments. 
   To ask for the details on top of all of that seems to me to be a real stretch. I am sure that in good faith we can work through these amendments one by one. 
   That is quite an acknowledgment on our part, a willingness to submit to the debate, 10 amendments, 1 hour equally divided on each of these, most of them directly relevant to marriage tax penalty, but in all cases certainly relevant to the debate about priorities of the money being spent.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, maybe you have to be in the minority to appreciate the position in which the minority has now been put once again. 
   The Republican majority is saying, first and foremost, we want to debate the marriage tax penalty. We say to that, absolutely; we want to debate the marriage tax penalty. We strongly support marriage tax penalty relief. 
   Then they say, we want you to limit your amendments. So we say, OK, we will limit our amendments. 
   Then they say, we not only want you to limit your amendments, we want to be able to tell you which amendments you can offer. 
   After saying first of all we will debate the marriage tax penalty, after secondly saying we will limit amendments, to give the majority now the right to dictate to the minority that they have the ability to determine what the context, what the definition, what the scope of our amendments ought to be, it seems to me to be an abrogation of all that is fair in debating an important issue such as this. 
   If we are going to spend $248 billion, there are other ways in which we can spend that money. Every one of these amendments in that context is relevant. Should we spend $248 billion on  a marriage tax relief bill, 60 percent of which does not go to those experiencing a marriage tax penalty? Sixty percent of that $248 billion does not have anything to do with the marriage tax penalty. It goes in most cases to people who get a marriage bonus. 
   We are saying let's fix the marriage tax penalty. But if you are going to spend all that money, we have a whole list of other things we think we ought to be looking at. It is in that context that I think we are being reasonable and fair, especially given the fact that we are simply saying we will agree to a limit on amendments, we will agree to a limit on time. 
   I think this Republican bill is a marriage tax penalty relief bill in name only. It is a Trojan horse for the other risky tax schemes that have been proposed so far this year. If this bill passes, Republicans will then have enacted $566 billion in tax cuts this year before they have even completed the budget resolution. That is not even counting the audacious $1.3 trillion their Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, has proposed as their standard bearer. Add $1.3 trillion and the $566 billion, and that is $2 trillion in tax cuts they are proposing without a budget resolution. 
   Is this the way we ought to spend the surplus, including the Social Security surplus? We are saying we can do better than that. We are saying we ought to look at providing prescription drugs for our senior citizens. We are saying we ought to look at college tuition tax credits. We are saying we ought to look at the Medicaid and CHIP health programs. 
   I remind my colleague, just this day last week, 51 Senators--Republican and Democrat--voted for passing a prescription drug benefit before we pass the first dollar in tax cuts. 
   Mr. President, 51 Senators voted for that; a majority of Senators said we are for a prescription drug benefit before we are for a tax cut, any kind of tax cut. 
   We want to deal with the marriage tax penalty. We want to come up with an agreement on the marriage tax penalty. But if some Republicans want to run for Democratic leader so they can dictate to the Democratic caucus what our agenda ought to be and what our amendments ought to be, let them run. I will take them on. We can have that debate. We will have a good election in the Democratic caucus. 
   But until they are elected Democratic leader, I think Democrats ought to make the decision about what Democrats offer as amendments. 
   They can agree with us on time, on a limitation on numbers, but not on context, not on text, not on substance. That is what this is all about. 
   We will have the debate time on cloture if we have to. Like the majority leader, I am an optimist. I am hopeful we can come to some agreement. It certainly is within reach. But not if we are dictated to with regard to the text of the amendments. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Basically, the letter says what a number of our colleagues have been saying throughout this debate, that this could have devastating consequences on general revenues as well as on the Social Security trust fund per se. 
   It says, briefly reading a couple of paragraphs:  
   In any case in which the rate reduction results in a deficit, the ultimate effect is that a portion of the Social Security Trust Fund equal to that deficit is diverted to maintain highway spending programs at the current level. In addition, S. 2285 would affect receipts and is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. 
   We are concerned that this proposal cannot be administered. S. 2285 provides that the aggregate revenue effect of rate reductions in excess of 4.3 cents per gallon not exceed the on-budget surplus during the period the taxes are reduced. We are concerned about our ability to administer this limitation if the rate reductions in excess of 4.3 cents per gallon are triggered. Because the rate reduction period does not coincide with normal budgetary accounting periods, the budget surplus for the period may never be known.  
   We ought to have a very good and thorough discussion about the implications of this bill prior to the time we are called upon to vote on it. By voting for cloture now, we cut off debate that never was. We cut off a debate that ought to provide a thorough examination of the implications on the Social Security trust fund, of the budget overall, of highway construction this year, of the implications for infrastructure in the outyears, of the solvency of the trust fund in periods beyond this fiscal year. All of those issues have not been debated. 
   For that reason, I hope my colleagues will join me in opposition to the cloture vote to be cast today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say that I talked briefly to the majority leader about an hour or so ago. He made the request at that time for a list of our amendments. I must say I want to accommodate the majority leader. But here we are on a bill of some consequence, a bill that has not yet had any time for debate on the Senate floor. It was the subject of good consideration and discussion in the committee. But now, on the very first day, we are on this bill on the Senate floor and cloture has been filed. We don't object to proceeding to the bill. That was done by unanimous consent. But now the majority leader has chosen already to file cloture on the bill. I remind my colleagues that filing cloture is to end the debate. Once again, for the second time in the same day, we are ending debate before it even begins. 
   We don't want to hold up a good debate and a good discussion with some other ideas with regard to how to proceed on the marriage tax penalty. We can do that. But a good debate entails offering alternatives, other ideas, and other suggestions. 
   All we are simply saying is, why don't we have the opportunity to offer some amendment? Let's lay down the amendments. Let's get on with it. But what the majority seems to be saying is we will not have the debate at all. We will move on to morning business, if we can't have a list of amendments defined and specified prior to the time the debate even begins. 
   I am sure the majority leader can empathize with our 
   frustration at being given yet another situation where we do not have the opportunity to have that debate, and we are closing the debate before it even starts. 
   I will work with the majority leader. We will see if we can't come up with a list. We want to pass marriage penalty reduction, but we think we can do it in ways that aren't as costly and that could be a lot more focused. We will deal with that. 
   But I am disappointed, frankly, that we aren't able to offer amendments. That is why the objection is made to the request made by the majority leader. 
   I thank the leader.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, one thing we all agree is we want to resolve the problem of the marriage tax penalty. I think that is unanimous. Republicans and Democrats want to find a way to end the marriage tax penalty. 
   I think there is also a possibility we can reach agreement on how to proceed on this bill. We are not going to do it today under the confines that have been laid down. I think the majority leader's suggestion we go out now is appropriate. Let's go back, try to define the list, let's share lists, let's look at what we have, let's see if we cannot resolve this procedurally first thing in the morning, and we will go from there. 
   I share the frustration expressed by my colleague. We are not going to resolve this matter this afternoon. In the interests of expediting this bill, and in consideration of the debate, why don't we just go out and pick it up first thing tomorrow.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, briefly. I appreciate that very much. 
   I compliment the distinguished chairman for his work. This is not easy. While we may have ended up at different places at the end of the resolution, I admire him for the work he has done and applaud him for the way he did it. 
   Let me also thank and congratulate our ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG. This is the last time he will manage a budget. He has been an outstanding member of the Senate Budget Committee. I consider Senator LAUTENBERG a close personal friend. I have admired his work not only on this committee but all of the work he does on appropriations and other issues he cares about. 
   Let me also thank our assistant Democratic leader, Senator REID. He is the best. We could not have come to this point in the debate and concluded this afternoon were it not for his work as well. A lot of work has gone into the completion of the budget resolution. We are very fortunate to have the leadership and the extraordinary work done by our chair and our ranking member. 
   I wanted to take a moment to thank them both. 
   I want to thank our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for joining us in saying that the long delay over reasonable gun-safety measures must end. The Juvenile Justice conference committee must send us its report--with the Senate-passed gun safety measures included--no later than the first anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, so we can vote on those measures. 
   I also want to congratulate my Republican colleagues on another accomplishment. The law says Congress must pass a budget resolution by April 15. By passing this resolution today, you are well on your way to meeting that deadline. Considering the difficulty you have had doing that in the past, passing the calendar test is no mean feat. 
   On every other test that matters, however, this budget resolution--your budget resolution--fails. This budget resolution does not continue the fiscal discipline that is at the heart of today's unprecedented economic prosperity. This budget resolution does not reflect the priorities of ordinary Americans. This budget resolution does not use honest numbers. This budget resolution does not give priority to paying down our national debt; in fact, if it were to become law, it would almost certainly risk a return to the days where we relied on the Social Security surplus to fund the rest of the government. 
   Despite all the assurances to the contrary, this budget resolution does not extend the solvency of Social Security or Medicare. This budget resolution does not guarantee a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. This budget resolution does not allow us to increase our investments in education, the environment, or any other critical national priority; in fact, if it were to pass, this budget resolution would force deep cuts--of up to 12 percent--in many of these priorities. 
   So, this budget resolution passes the first test. It meets the calendar deadline. But it fails all the tests that really matter. 
   It's worth reviewing what we tried to do this week. 
   First, Senator ROBB offered an amendment that said simply: Before we pass a huge tax cut, we ought to add an affordable, voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare. An overwhelming majority of Americans agree with that statement. A majority of this Senate also agrees with it. Unfortunately, we were not able to clear the 60-vote hurdle erected by those who oppose it. So this budget resolution now puts tax cuts ahead of prescription drugs. 
   Senator BINGAMAN offered an amendment to reduce the Republican tax cut by $28 billion and use that money to improve America's public schools. We would have reduced the $150 billion Republican tax cut by less than 20 percent. And we would have used that money to do things like reduce class size, improve teacher training, and help students pay for college. That amendment, too, was defeated--largely along party lines. 
   Senator CONRAD offered an amendment to reduce the Republican tax cut by $75 billion, and use that money to pay down the federal debt. This Republican budget allows for $150 billion--or more--in tax cuts, but only $19 billion in deficit reduction. We could have done better. Instead of a paltry down payment on the debt, we could have made a significant down payment. That amendment also was defeated. 
   Senator ROBB offered a second school-related amendment--a plan to reduce the Republican tax cut by nearly $6 billion, and use that money instead to modernize our children's public schools. To repair schools that are in disrepair, replace schools that are too crowded, and make sure every school is connected to the Internet. Despite all of the talk we hear about the importance of education, that amendment, too, was defeated. 
   Senators SCHUMER and DURBIN offered an amendment to reduce the Republican tax cut by $284 million and use that money to hire 1,000 new local, state and federal law enforcement officers--to ensure better enforcement of existing gun laws. Given all the talk we've heard recently on the need to enforce gun laws, you would have thought that amendment would pass 100-0. Instead, it was rejected. 
   Finally, Senator DURBIN offered as an amendment the Bush tax cut, the same tax cut so many of our Republican colleagues have implicitly--and in some cases explicitly--endorsed. Four times previously--once in the House Ways and Means Committee, once in the House Rules Committee, and twice in the Senate Budget Committee, our Republican colleagues were asked to vote up or down on the Bush tax cut. Every time, they used some parliamentary  procedure to duck the vote. To borrow a phrase used by our old friend Dale Bumpers and resurrected by our colleague DICK DURBIN, they ran from the Bush tax cut like the devil runs from holy water. They tried to duck the vote again on the Senate floor during this debate. But they were unable to do so. 
   So what did our Republican colleagues do when they were finally forced to take a stand on the Bush tax cut? Every single Republican Senator rejected the Bush tax cut. This Senate voted 99-0 vote to table the plan. 
   The vote against the Bush tax cut was probably the most significant of all the votes we cast on this budget resolution--because tax policy isn't just the centerpiece of the Bush candidacy. Tax policy is the centerpiece of any economic and fiscal program. 
   By repeatedly refusing to support the Bush tax plan, our Republican colleagues have sent a very clear message. That message is: They know the Bush tax cut will not work. They know we cannot afford the Bush tax cut. They know that, in order to pay for the Bush tax cut, we will have to raid Social Security, and cut critical programs deeply, and hurt working families. 
   So, we are now about to vote on a budget that would end this economic expansion by abdicating the fiscal discipline that has produced and nurtured it. A budget that blows the entire non-Social Security surplus on risky, exploding tax cuts--leaving virtually nothing for Medicare, or prescription drugs. Nothing for debt reduction. And nothing for increased investment in education, law enforcement, the environment and other urgent, national priorities. 
   If this budget were to become law, there are only three ways we could pay for those tax cuts and still make essential investments in education and other priorities: We could make massive cuts in the rest of the budget. We could raid Social Security. Or, we could drive up the deficit, and the debt. At a time when we could have so many good choices before us, it is astounding that this budget presents us only with bad choices. 
   The next step is for our colleagues to reconcile their budget with the plan passed by House Republicans--a plan that contains even bigger tax cuts, and even deeper budget cuts in key priorities. I have no doubt they will reconcile their plans. And this budget will go from bad to worse. The real test, though, is not in reconciling the House plan and the Senate plan. The real test is in trying to reconcile either plan with reality. Frankly, there is no way they can meet that test. The numbers simply do not add up. 
   Our colleagues did everything they could this week to limit debate on their plan. Right out of the box, they yielded back over 20 hours of debate time on their budget. That's how determined they were to limit debate on their plan. That's how desperate they were to avoid any discussion of their priorities, versus our priorities, and the priorities of the American people. 
   I would remind our friends across the aisle, though, that this debate has only begun. We have months to go before this budget is finished. We will raise these issues again and again and again so that every American knows the choices facing our nation, and the consequences of those choices. We will make the improvements in this budget that we sought to make this week, or the proposals contained in this budget will not become law. 
   So I say again to our colleagues across the aisle, congratulations on meeting this first test of your budget. We look forward to working with you in coming months to produce a budget that passes the tests that truly matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I just suggest that we also ensure that either side has at least a block of five amendments that are going to be offered so we can look at them ahead of time. Nobody knows, on either side, what the amendments are. If we can at least take them five by five, we can analyze them and decide whether we will table them, second degree them, or whatever. I think it is very important to do that. I suggest that as well.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to represent the people of South Dakota in the United States Senate. They are the best resource in a state with an infinite number of tremendous attributes, and the best part of my job is getting to know and work with them on a daily basis. 
   I have often stood before my colleagues here in the Senate to recognize the accomplishments of South Dakotans. Many times, the names sound unfamiliar to those in this chamber. Today, however, I want to congratulate a young man who made the country stand up and take notice--and who showed the country how we play basketball in South Dakota. His name is Mike Miller, and, as every college basketball fan knows, he recently led the Florida Gators to the NCAA Division I National Championship basketball game. Although the Gators fell in a hard fought battle to the Michigan State Spartans, anyone who saw that game knows that Mike Miller is a very special basketball player.  
   Mike was named Most Outstanding Player in his region for the tournament. That is a tremendous feat for any college player and was made possible only because Mike's last-second shot against Butler advanced Florida and kept his team's hopes of reaching the championship game alive. His clutch play continued in every game of the tournament, making it easy to see why Mike was named the best player in his region. Remarkably, Mike did all of this as just a sophomore. 
   Mike Miller is from Mitchell--a leader in South Dakota high school basketball--and as a Kernel he played under the legendary Gary Munsen. Mike started learning about the game of basketball long before he got to high school, however. His uncle, Dakota Wesleyan great Alan Miller, is the all-time leading college scorer in South Dakota. And Mike's older brother Ryan, who played for Northern State, currently plays professionally in Australia. The Millers are a big part of the reason that growing up in Mitchell means growing up around basketball. 
   In a time when too many athletes seem to be more concerned with individual statistics than playing as a team, when the bottom line seems to matter more to some professionals than the love of the game, it's refreshing to see someone like Mike Miller on the court. Through the course of the tournament and the championship game in Indianapolis, Mike showed his opponents and the country how basketball is played in South Dakota--and how it should be played everywhere else. His unselfish play makes the players around him better; he has an uncanny ability to step up his game during crunch time; and he never stops working to improve. That's what he learned in Mitchell--that's what he learned in South Dakota--and that's what he's showing the college basketball world. 
   Although the Gators fell a few points shy the other night in Indiana, Mike Miller made us proud in South Dakota. He proved to the country what those at the Corn Palace and at Mitchell High already know--that Mike Miller is a champion. We are very proud to call him one of our own. 
   Let me, of course, congratulate the Michigan State Spartans and the University of Connecticut Huskies women's team for their championship seasons. But, on behalf of everyone who cheered for him, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mike, his team and his parents--Tom and Sheryl Miller of Mitchell--for the incredible run the Florida Gators had this season. It was fun to watch, and I know we all look forward to seeing more of Mike Miller in the years to come.

   Mr. DASCHLE. First, I compliment my colleague, Senator JOHNSON, for the extraordinary efforts he has made in reaching this compromise. I compliment, as well, the Republican manager, Senator GRAMM, for the work that has gone into the agreement that we now have reached. 
   This is an important piece of legislation. I think we are going to see a very strong vote. It is, in large measure, due to the contributions and leadership of Senator JOHNSON and Senator GRAMM. I hope we can dispose of both of these matters shortly. 
   It has been a long time coming. But it was worth the wait. 
   I want to thank my colleagues--especially Senator JOHNSON--for making essential improvements. Because of their patience and persistence, we are now--finally--on the verge of passing a bill that will give rural Americans the same access to affordable local TV programming as everyone else in our nation. 
   Senator JOHNSON's amendment is the heart of this bill. 
   It will allow banks associated with rural cooperatives to lend coops enough money to build their own satellite facilities. 
   The reason this is so critical is because commercial satellite broadcasters have made it absolutely clear: They have no interest in serving rural markets. They don't think it's worth their time or money to build satellite TV facilities for rural markets. 
   The same is true of many commercial banks. 
   If the only choice for rural communities was to borrow from commercial banks to build satellite facilities, the communities--very likely--would end up paying high interest rates. 
   Those high interest rates would drive up the costs of building the satellite facilities. 
   That, in turn, would drive up the price rural Americans would be forced to pay for local TV programming. 
   Senator JOHNSON's amendment, though, means that banks associated with rural cooperatives can also make loans to build satellite facilities. The coops will charge lower interest rates than commercial banks. 
   This is a huge victory for people in small towns and rural communities in South Dakota, and all across America. 
   The reason we fought so hard to get this bill right is because this is not just about entertainment. This is about public safety. 
   It is potentially about life and death. 
   Local stations provide local news and public affairs programming. They also provide weather updates. 
   A year and a half ago, a tornado destroyed much of the town of Spencer, South Dakota. As devastating as that tornado was, it could have been far worse. It could have claimed many lives. 
   One reason it did not may very well have been because Spencer is within the Sioux Falls local broadcast area. 
   People could turn on their TVs and see that the tornado was coming, and take cover. 
   But most South Dakota communities are outside both the Sioux Falls and the Rapid City broadcast areas. 
   Without Senator JOHNSON's amendment, it is doubtful that they would be able to receive local weather or news reports. 
   Rural coops have a 60-year history of responsibly promoting economic development throughout rural America. By  adding them to the pool of qualified lenders, we have greatly improved this bill. 
   I commend Senator JOHNSON again for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to vote for his amendment and this bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to explain the procedural situation we are in with regard to the motion to proceed on the so-called gas tax repeal. I could not be more strongly in opposition to the repeal of the gas tax because of its potential to devastate our highway and transit programs. 
   Nevertheless, I intend to support the motion to proceed this afternoon and I urge my colleagues on this side to do so for a couple of reasons. 
   First of all, it seems to me this ought to be a debate that we have early next week. I think there are a lot of very important questions that ought to be raised about the advisability of the repeal of the gas tax. I think Governors and those from industries that are involved in the construction of our infrastructure this year ought to have the opportunity to be heard. 
   I will read for my colleagues some of the comments made by my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle with regard to the gas tax. I think they ought to be heard, as well. 
   Let me quote from Speaker DENNIS HASTERT, who on March 26, said:  
   But the problem is that this doesn't solve the problem.....that's just a little tick in what the cost of gas is. We need to solve the real problems out there.  
   So said the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   The House Transportation Committee chairman, BUD SHUSTER said:  
   Repeal of the fuel tax is the wrong way to go. [It's] counterproductive because reducing a portion of the price without reducing the underlying cost of crude oil makes it easier for OPEC countries to keep prices high.  
   So says the chairman, the Republican chairman of the House Transportation Committee. 
   Here is what the House majority leader, DICK ARMEY said:  
   Let's not get bogged down on only one dimension of the problem--a short-term dimension that offers scant relief. Even if we repealed, that it would give little relief to consumers.  
   Here is what my colleague, the very respected and distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, JOHN WARNER said:  
   Repealing the 4.3 cents will have little or no impact on the price of fuel. It will, however, severely limit all of our States' abilities to make needed surface transportation improvements.  
   Here is what our colleague, Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH, said on March 24:  
   Even with this repeal, there is no guarantee it is going to bring down the cost at the pump. It defies common sense.  
   Here is what the GOP conference chair, J.C. WATTS, said in the House of Representatives on March 19:   
   I don't know if the tax has any affect on fuel tax. Supply and demand is driving price right now.  
   Finally, here is what Congressman DON YOUNG said. He gets the award for the bluntest assessment of the advisability of this 
   particular legislation.  
   Absolutely the dumbest thing ever thought of.  
   This ought to be debated. We ought to have a good discussion about its advisability. This is one of those rare occasions when I happen to be on the same side as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority leader on the House of Representatives, the conference chair on the House of Representatives, Congressman YOUNG from the House of Representatives, and some of my distinguished colleagues here in the Senate. 
   We ought to debate it. It ought to be amended. We don't oftentimes have a vehicle that could be offered that will allow an opportunity to debate energy and tax policy such as this. I am hoping we can offer amendments to this bill and we would expect we would have the opportunity to do so. This is one of those rare occasions when many of our colleagues share the view expressed so powerfully and eloquently by our Republican colleagues. 
   I am not giving the credit they deserve to my Democratic colleagues on the House side. I could come up with at least as long a list on that side. 
   We look forward to this debate. We are certainly not going to object at all to having the motion to proceed presented to us this afternoon. 
   We just want to get to the bill and have this debate. That is my reason for supporting the motion to proceed, to have a good debate, to ensure the American people know what the implications of this particular vote will be and the unusual coalition that has already been created in opposition to this repeal. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate recently lost a very dear friend. Larry Harrison, who worked in the Capitol for over 36 years prior to his retirement in 1997, died early this week. Larry's many years of dedicated and distinguished work made him an institution within this institution. It was tough on all of us when he retired a few years ago, but it is much more difficult to say goodbye to him today. 
   Larry served this country and the Senate in a variety of ways for nearly four decades. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, participating in the D-Day invasion at Normandy, and following the war worked for the Architect of the Capitol for five years. Larry returned to the Capitol to work for the Sergeant at Arms in 1967. He stayed there until 1997, outlasting all but five of the Senators who were serving in this chamber when he started. 
   Larry had an extraordinary work ethic, and he committed himself to his job with tremendous pride, energy, and humor. During his time in the Capitol, Larry was responsible for maintaining the President's Room, the Cloakroom, and the Senate Chamber. Somehow, he even found time to operate a shoe shine station in the Senator's bathroom, and I know I speak for everyone when I say that this place hasn't been the same without Larry's friendly smile and kind voice. 
   When he retired in 1997, our loss was his family's gain. His wife, Jean, and sons, Michael Henry, Albert Philips and Kevin Harrison got their husband and father back full-time. Sadly, their time with him has now been cut all too short. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with Larry Harrison's friends and family, especially his wife, Jean, and their three sons. Larry was a good man, a caring husband, and great father. He will be missed.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take whatever time may be required and use my leader time. 
   Mr. President, the debate over the last two days has been deeply moving. When we began this debate, I thought to myself how much I would prefer it if we were talking about veterans' health care, prescription drugs, or raising the minimum wage. 
   But, I stand corrected. This debate has proved meaningful and proved that our reputation as the deliberative body is earned. 
   I thank especially the distinguished Senior Senator from Vermont, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY for his fine stewardship of this debate. As always Senator LEAHY has offered much wisdom and demonstrated much skill as he managed this amendment. 
   This afternoon, as we close this debate I want to draw my colleagues' attention to the statements of Senator ROBERT BYRD and Senator CHUCK ROBB. Both men gave eloquent statements about how they came to their decision to oppose this constitutional amendment. These statements moved me and I dwell on them because they represent my views so well. For neither of these men, was their decision easy. I have come to believe, however, that it is not in easy decisions that you find the measure of a Senator--it is the hard decisions that distinguish the men and women we remember long after they leave this place. 
   Senator BYRD, in his usual way, reminded us why the Bill of Rights has never been amended in our history. Why? Because it was our founders' design. They set the bar for passage of a constitutional amendment high because they strongly believed that the Constitution should be amended in only the rarest of circumstances. And that has been the case. As Senator BYRD points out, setting aside the amendments involving prohibition, the Constitution has been amended only 15 times in 209 years. 
   As Senator BYRD noted, ``In the final analysis, it is the Constitution--not the flag--that is the foundation and guarantor of the people's liberties.'' Thus, Senator BYRD conceded that, as much as he loves the flag, and as much as he salutes the patriotism of those who support this measure, he must oppose the amendment. His sentiments reflect so well the struggle I have felt over the years when we have considered this amendment in the past. 
   I, like other veterans, love the flag that has united us at so many critical times. I cannot understand why anyone would burn the flag simply to call attention to a cause. But as Senator ROBB reminded me--it was to protect the rights of such an unpopular dissenter that I once wore a military uniform. Senator ROBB noted that there will always be another flag to hold high, when one is defiled, but there will be no other Constitution--should we defile it. 
   Senator ROBB held dying men in his arms in Southeast Asia. He understands the sacrifices men and women will make to save this democracy. This afternoon, as we cast this vote, I am proud to stand with him, to stand with Senator BYRD, to stand with Senators BOB KERREY and JOHN KERRY, and others, to fight here--today--to preserve the principals and ideals these patriots fought for. 
   As Senator BYRD said today: ``From Tripoli in 1805 to Iwo Jima in 1945 to the moon in 1969, the flag has been raised to commemorate some of America's proudest moments.'' By honoring and preserving the Constitution, we ensure that this symbol--our flag--continues to represent a country devoted to democracy and free speech. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I came to the floor to thank the distinguished senior Senator from New York, but also my two colleagues, Senators ROBB and KERREY, for their extraordinary statements on the Senate floor. I hope the American people have had the opportunity to hear, and I hope the opportunity to read what they have said is made to schoolkids and others who have given a great deal of thought to our Constitution and the reason our Founding Fathers wrote as they did. 
   Their eloquence and their power and their extraordinary persuasiveness ought to be tonic for us all late in the day on an afternoon which has seen a good debate. I am hopeful people have had the opportunity to hear this contribution, above and beyond all of those made so far in this debate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the last couple of months the Washington Post has published a number of very troubling articles about the operations of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
   These stories expose the existence of independent agendas within the Corps. They suggest cost-benefit analyses rigged to justify billion dollar projects; disregard for environmental laws, and a pattern of catering to special interests. 
   The actions described in the Post articles raise serious questions about the accountability of the Corps. And they present a compelling case for a thorough review of the agency's operations and management. 
   And it is not only the Post articles that cause me to believe this. 
   The Corps' current effort to update the Missouri River Master Control Manual--the policy document that governs the Corps' management of the river from Montana to Missouri--illustrates not only that the Corps can be indifferent to the environment. Too often, it actually erects institutional barriers that make achieving certain critical ecological goals difficult or impossible. 
   This ought to be a concern to all Americans. It is a deep concern to South Dakotans. The Missouri runs down the center of our state and is a major source of income, recreation and pride for us. 
   More than 40 years ago, the Corps built dams up and down the Missouri River in order to harness hydroelectric power. In return, it promised to manage the river wisely and efficiently. 
   That promise has not been kept. 
   Silt has built up, choking the river in several spots. 
   In recent years, studies have been done to determine how to restore the river to health. An overwhelming amount of scientific and technical data all point to the same conclusion. 
   The flow of the river should more closely mimic nature. Flows should be higher in the spring, and lower in the summer--just as they are in nature. 
   Yet the Corps proposes to continue doing largely what it has been doing all these years--knowing the consequences, knowing exactly what the practices have produced now for the last 50-plus years. 
   The agency's refusal to change will further jeopardize endangered species. And, it will continue to erode the recreational value of the river, which is 12 times more important to the economy than its navigational value. 
   Why does the Corps insist--despite all the evidence--on this course? 
   It does it to protect the barge industry--a $7 million-a-year industry that American taxpayers already spend $8 million a year to support. $8 million. That's how much American taxpayers pay each year for channel maintenance, to accommodate the barge industry. 
   The Washington Post suggests that the Corps handling of the Missouri River Master Manual is not an isolated case. 
   The Post articles contain allegations by a Corps whistleblower who says that a study of proposed upper-Mississippi lock expansions was rigged to provide an economic justification for that billion-dollar project. 
   In response to these allegations, the Corps' own Office of Special Counsel concluded that the agency--quote-- ``probably broke laws and engaged in a gross waste of funds.'' 
   In my own dealings with the Corps of Engineers, I too have experienced the institutional problems recorded so starkly in the Post series. 
   In South Dakota, where the Corps operates four hydroelectric dams, we have fought for more than 40 years to force the agency to meet its responsibilities under the 1958 Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and mitigate the loss of wildlife habitat resulting from the construction of those dams. 
   For 40 years, the Corps has failed to meet those responsibilities. 
   That is why I have worked closely with the Governor of my state, Bill Janklow, and with many other South Dakotans, to come up with a plan to transfer of Corps lands back to the state of South Dakota and two Indian tribes. 
   Unfortunately, instead of attempting to work with us, the Corps is fighting us.  
   The litany of excuses, scare tactics and misinformation the Corps employed to try to defeat our proposal is outrageous. It appears Corps officials are not nearly as concerned with preserving the river as they are with preserving their own bureaucracy. 
   After the legislation was enacted, the Chief of the Engineers, General Joseph Ballard continued to resist its implementation. In fact, my own experiences with the Corps, and the experiences of other members, repeatedly demonstrates General Ballard's unwillingness to follow civilian direction and ensure the faithful implementation of the law. 
   When considered in the context of the litany of problems that have come to light in the Post series, Congress has no choice but to consider seriously moving the responsibilities of the Corps from the Army and placing them within the Department of the Interior. Too much power now is concentrated in the hands of the Chief of the Engineers, and that power too often has been abused. 
   General Ballard's lack of responsiveness to the law, to meeting environmental objectives and to civilian direction, has serious consequences for individual projects. 
   Beyond that, it raises very troubling questions about the lack of meaningful civilian control over this federal agency. 
   In a democracy, institutions of government must be held accountable. That is the job of Congress--to hold them responsible. 
   The existence of separate agendas within the Corps bureaucracy cannot be tolerated if our democracy is to succeed in representing the will of the people. Its elected representatives and the civil servants appointed by them must maintain control of the apparatus of government. 
   Moreover, contempt for environmental laws and self-serving economic analyses simply cannot be tolerated if Congress is to make well-informed decisions regarding the authorization of expensive projects, and if the American taxpayer is to be assured that federal monies are being spent wisely. 
   The Corps of Engineers provides a valuable national service. It constructs and manages needed projects throughout the country. 
   The size and scope of the biannual Water Resources Development Act is clear evidence of the importance of the Corps' civil works mission. 
   Because the Corps' work is so critical, it is essential that steps be taken immediately to determine the extent of the problems within the agency--and to design meaningful and lasting reforms to correct them. 
   Our nation needs a civil works program we can depend on. We need a Corps of Engineers that conducts credible analysis. 
   We need a Corps that balances economic development and environmental protection as required by its mandate--not one that ignores environmental laws as it chooses. 
   History does not offer much room for confidence that the Army Corps of Engineers can meet these standards under its current management structure. Therefore, I am introducing legislation today to establish an independent Corps of Engineers Investigation and Review Commission. 
   The commission will take a hard and systemic look at the agency and make recommendations to Congress on needed reforms. 
   It will examine a number of issues, including: 
   The effectiveness of civilian control in the Corps, particularly the effectiveness of the relationship between uniformed officers and the Assistant Secretary for civil works with regard to responsiveness, lines of authority, and coordination; 
   The Corps' compliance with environmental laws--including the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act and NEPA--in the design and operation of projects; 
   The quality and objectivity of the agency's scientific and economic analysis; 
   The extent to which the Corps coordinates and cooperates with other state and federal agencies in designing and implementing projects; 
   The appropriateness of the agency's size, budget and personnel; and 
   Whether the civil works program should be transferred from the Corps to a civilian agency, and whether certain responsibilities should be privatized. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review this legislation. 
   It is my hope that all those who care about the integrity of the Army Corps of Engineers and its mission will support this effort to identify and implement whatever reforms are necessary to rebuild public support for its work. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, this bill has never been in committee. It has not had the opportunity afforded most legislation to be considered, have hearings, have people come forth and talk about the implications of eliminating the gas tax. Normally bills go through committee, and then they come to the floor. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, what kind of a debate would one have when no amendments are made available? I cannot imagine that on an issue of this import we would want to accelerate the debate, accelerate the consideration, and prevent Senators from offering amendments and other ideas. 
   For those reasons, I object.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk briefly about a matter that we have been especially concerned about in recent months, and that has to do with the Corps of Engineers. 
   Prior to that, I rise to express my disappointment that we were not able to get to the electronic signature bill conference report today. I thought we had worked out all of the problems. Now, as I understand it, there are some problems on the Republican side. I hope it won't be held up too much longer. We need to get on with that legislation, and we have been trying to move this bill to conference now for some time. We had worked out our concerns with regard to representation, and I was certain we would be able to finish that work today. But given the problems there now appear to be on the Republican side, I am hopeful we can resolve those no later than tomorrow.  
   I am reminded, again, as we file cloture, that the motion to invoke cloture is a motion to end debate. I am always amused by that phrase, ``end debate.'' How do you end debate that you haven't even started? That is what we are being asked to do on Thursday, end debate on a tax bill that didn't go to the committee, on a tax bill that hasn't had one hearing. 
   How is it that we would limit Senators' rights to offer amendments when those considerations are paramount as we consider a tax bill--a gas tax bill? 
   So we are very concerned about why it is we need to move rapidly to this legislation if it is this important, if it is this much a part of finding ways in which to provide relief. You would think that, consistent with past practice and consistent with the recognition of the importance of the issue, it at least would have been given a hearing or some consideration in committee. That has not happened.

Senator LUGAR, in the committee as well as on the floor, demonstrated once again why he is admired on both sides of the aisle as a leader in agriculture. This was not easy for him, beginning last year. He maneuvered the committee and brought the Senate to a point where we successfully completed our work.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say with enthusiasm how completely this Senator agrees with the statement made by the majority leader. Ted STEVENS is one who is admired, I say even loved, by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have worked with him; we have admired his work; we have seen on so many occasions he has effectively led not only the Appropriations Committee but the Senate itself in bringing together the kind of consensus, the  kind of compromises, for successful legislative action. 
   We all joke about his temperament. We sometimes say it is hard to understand how a guy from so cold a State could be so hot under the collar. I have to say, as Senator LOTT has noted, he is quick to respond and quick to find ways with which to overcome his frustrations, as we all face them and deal with them on both sides of the aisle. 
   Alaskans have every right to be proud. They have every reason to nominate and name this individual as Alaskan of the Year. Indeed, he is an Alaskan of the Century. We are proud to work with him, proud to call him a colleague, proud in this case to call him our chairman, and proud of the fact that Alaskans recognize him for the unique talents and the unique dedication and the unique leadership that he provides not only his State as an Alaskan, but his country as a Senator. I congratulate him on this special occasion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the distinguished and esteemed Senator from Massachusetts and I are reintroducing the Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage. 
   For those familiar with the legislation, they know that our legislation--the bill being reintroduced this afternoon--raises the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years, to $6.15 an hour. It is a modest but badly needed bill. It is overdue. It has already passed in the House, as most of our colleagues know, by an overwhelming margin, with strong bipartisan support. It deserves equally strong and bipartisan support in this Chamber. 
   Among the many people who support our proposal are America's religious leaders--the U.S. Catholic Conference, the United Church of Christ, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the American Friends Service Committee, the Unitarian Association of Congregations, the Episcopal Church, the Methodist Church, and many more religious organizations. There are Republicans and Democrats in this coalition of religious leaders, and all have joined together in supporting the effort to raise the minimum wage by $1 an hour over 2 years. 
   A job isn't only a source of income. A job, frankly, is a source of pride--or it should be. The Catholic Conference tells us that the minimum wage ought to reflect the principles of human dignity and economic justice. That is what it ought to reflect. There ought to be more to a minimum wage than simply what pay you get. There ought to be a sense of dignity and a sense of pride and a sense of accomplishment. There ought to be a feeling of goodwill in a workplace. But today's minimum wage precludes much of that. The U.S. Catholic Conference is right, the minimum wage today denies dignity, it denies economic justice. 
   When you adjust the increased cost of living, the real value of the minimum wage today is almost $2.50 below what it was in 1968. This chart reflects, very graphically, what we are talking about. This shows the value of the minimum wage over the years. 
   We started in 1968, with a value of the minimum wage, in today's dollars, at $7.66. But look what has happened. We come down now to the year 2000, and we have a minimum wage value of slightly over $5. 
   But look what has been happening to the trendline representing the value of the minimum wage, in the last couple years. While there have been peaks the trend is actually going down. Next year, the value of the increase, in constant dollars, will be $4.90--almost $3 below what it was 30 years ago. 
   Is it any wonder people are working two and three jobs? Is it any wonder we have lost some of the value, some of the dignity, some of the economic justice that was concomitant with the minimum wage of 30 years ago? 
   What is remarkable is that all we are asking with this increase is to bring it to $5.85 next year. This proposal, as you can see, is still below the value of the minimum wage in 1968. That is what is disconcerting. If we do not raise the minimum wage by the end of the year, every single penny of the value of the 1996 increase will be erased by increases in the cost of living. 
   As the chart shows, at one time we were able to increase the value of the minimum wage. Now, we would like to bring the wage back to its value in 1996. But look what happens. If we do not raise the wage, we will have eliminated entirely the previous increases of the minimum wage. 
   I think people ought to remember, all we are trying to do is to maintain virtually the status quo. We are not even able to bring it up to where it should be. So forget economic justice, dignity--working families are living in poverty. 
   The Senate passed the welfare reform legislation several years ago. We said we want to dignify work. We want to reward work. We want to ensure that people who work get the rewards that otherwise they would get on welfare. Look what has happened. As the minimum wage continues to decline, the poverty line continues to go up. So even with the minimum wage increase, minimum wage workers are going to be below the poverty line. How does that reward work? How does that keep people off welfare? If this gap continues to spread, where is the economic justice? 
   Under our proposal, a full-time minimum-wage worker would earn $12,792 a year. That is an increase of $2,000. That doesn't sound like a lot of money. As I noted, right now minimum wage workers are below the poverty line. But the fact is, $2,000 would buy 7 months of groceries for a family of four. 
   I was in a grocery store not long ago. Somebody came up to me, a total  stranger, and said: I know you are Senator DASCHLE. I hate to interrupt. I know you are out there buying your groceries. I am just one person, but I want to thank you. I want to thank you for trying to fight for the minimum wage increase because I am a minimum wage worker. I have two jobs. I have no health insurance. I have a daughter who is very sick. You don't know me, and you may never see me again. I'm telling you, Senator DASCHLE, I need that money, without it I don't know what I am going to do. 
   You remember conversations like that. That brings life to charts like this. 
   It is very troubling to me that, as we fight over the minimum wage this year, we are fighting about that worker, working two jobs, trying to stay above the poverty line with a sick daughter. We are trying to decide in the Senate today whether we are going to make this worker wait another year and lose $1,200 over that period of time in this era of economic growth and vitality. 
   What do we say to that man in that grocery store: Look, I am glad you are working two jobs. I am sorry your daughter is sick? We want you to stay off welfare? And while we have more and more people becoming billionaires in this country, we are going to make you wait 1 more year to get that full $1 increase in minimum wage, even though it is $3 below what it was in 1968? 
   I can't do that. I don't know how anybody can do that. But that is what we are asking. That is why we care so much about this fight now. We didn't have the chance to bring it up last year. We forced it on the bankruptcy bill. Now the House, because I believe we forced that action last year, has acted, as they should, on minimum wage. I have some real problems with the House-passed tax package, but they acted appropriately on the minimum wage. 
   Why, in Heaven's name, given the economic strength we have in this economy, given the extraordinary increase we have seen in income at just about all levels but the lowest, why would we make that man, or anybody like him, wait 3 years rather than 2 to get a $1 increase so that he might be able to stay above the poverty line? 
   Recently, my State created 17,000 new jobs. Unemployment is lower now than it has been in 30 years. Yet we hear our colleagues say this somehow is going to hurt small business. This age-old argument has been so totally ripped apart by virtually every credible source. The Wall Street 
   Journal, Business Week--hardly the mouthpiece of a liberal agenda--now say the 1996 predictions about job loss, the last time we increased the minimum wage, could not have been further from the truth. They were wrong. We have created more jobs in my State and in every State. Unemployment is lower, not higher. There is no question whatsoever, we can create more jobs and still provide dignity in the workplace. 
   Of what value is a job if you need four of them to survive? Of what value can a job be if you can't even buy health insurance for your children? 
   The other argument we hear so often is that minimum-wage workers are teenagers, or that they are part-time people, who pay for cars and CD players, who will be working in a high paying job someday. Again, the facts could not be more the opposite: Seventy percent of all minimum-wage workers are in their twenties or older; 60 percent of minimum-wage workers today are women in that age category; 40 percent of minimum-wage workers today are the sole breadwinners in their families. 
   You hear these arguments over and over again: The minimum wage costs jobs. These jobs are for teenagers. That is just bunk. There is absolutely no truth to these assertions that we hear over and over again. We are talking about people who walk up to me in grocery stores telling me about their kids, telling me they have more than two jobs, telling me that unless they get this increase in the minimum wage, they don't know how they are going to survive. What an irony--talk of survival in a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity. 
   I am hopeful that somehow over the course of the next couple of weeks we can reach an agreement. The House has acted on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. The Senate ought to go to conference. We ought to resolve this minimum wage issue. But we ought to accept the fact that we have no real argument to ask that person or anybody else to wait 3 years for a $1 increase in the minimum wage when they need it so badly right now. I am very hopeful that we can work out a procedural arrangement whereby every single person this year can count on a minimum wage increase within 2 years. 
   The average family now works an additional 265 hours a year just to maintain the same standard of living they had at the beginning of this decade. That is an additional 6 weeks a year that parents could be spending with their children that they are not. How much more in that direction should we be going? Three hundred hours more a year to maintain the status quo; 7 or 8 weeks a year that parents ought to be spending with their kids that they are now spending on a second or third job? 
   The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and I, and so many of our colleagues, have said if we do anything this year, if we really mean what we say about economic justice and about dignity in the workplace and keeping people off welfare and addressing the real needs of working families, there is nothing more important than ensuring an increase in the minimum wage, this year, over 2 years. It ought to be over 1 year, but if we can't do it in 1 year, the compromise was, well, then let us at least try it in 2. If we can't do it in 2 years, I don't know how we turn to those working those extra hours, those extra weeks, with any sense of compassion or understanding for their circumstances. 
   I ask whether or not it could be a bipartisan goal that we sign and pass a measure before Mother's Day this year. What better opportunity to tell those women who make up 40 percent of the minimum wage workforce and who head households that we are going to give you some help. We are going to do all we can to keep you off welfare. We are going to try to put a little more dignity into the workplace, and we are going to provide the kind of economic justice we all say is important to us. 
   I have admired Bob Dole for a lot of reasons, but one thing he once said, while he was the Republican leader, is something we ought to remember again and again. He said:  
   I never thought the Republican Party would stand for squeezing every nickel out of the minimum wage.  
   That wasn't something Senator KENNEDY or I said or anybody else on our side said. That was the Republican leader who said it wasn't the role of the Republican Party to squeeze every nickel out of the minimum wage. 
   I hope the majority will not squeeze every last nickel from this minimum wage either. I hope they will join us. I hope they will remember the families below the poverty line. I hope they will remember where we are and from where we have come, when it comes to dignity, economic justice, and the minimum wage today. I hope they will join us in passing this 2-year bill before Mother's Day. 
   Let's sign it into law. Let's send the right message.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. We have declared now an end of official business. We are in morning business this afternoon. We are not going to be in session tomorrow. We will be taking up the flag  amendment on Monday and voting on it on Tuesday. But we are told there is not time to bring this matter to the floor. Yet tomorrow is a perfectly opportune time for us to be debating and talking about this. We would love nothing more than to have a good debate. Let's talk about whether or not this affects jobs. Let's talk about whether or not this is for teenagers or for working mothers and working families. Let's entertain amendments. 
   The fact is, we wouldn't have debated this last year were it not for the extraordinary efforts made by the Senator from Massachusetts who offered this amendment to a bankruptcy bill. That is what triggered the action in the Senate. I believe that is what triggered the action in the House. Now we are in a situation where we are prepared to split the bankruptcy conference from the minimum wage conference. But unless we have a vehicle with which to go to conference, it is very hard for us to conference a minimum wage that has never been considered in the Senate. 
   How can we go to conference without a vehicle? That is unheard of. I think Daniel Webster would be rolling over in his grave trying to understand what the modern Senate has done to the process. The process, as I used to understand it is you pass a bill in the Senate, you pass it in the House, it goes to conference, you work out the differences, and you bring it back. We haven't passed a minimum wage bill in the House. 
   The distinguished Senator is right. We are introducing this bill. We could bring it up today. We could have a vote on it tomorrow.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator is so right. This is a $2,000 increase. That $2,000 increase is probably made, in the case of many American entrepreneurs, in a matter of moments, minutes, or hours. We are talking about a $2,000 increase over the course of a couple of years. That is what we are talking about. These people are already struggling to retain some form of dignity in the workplace. They are determined not to go back on welfare. They are determined to try to find ways to ensure that their children have the quality of life we all dream about as Americans. 
   As the Senator said, how ironic it is that at a time when we have more billionaires in this country than we have ever had in our Nation's history, at a time when income has gone up exponentially for the top 20 percent of those in this country, at that very time we see potentially the lowest level of purchasing power the minimum wage has ever brought about in our Nation's history. What an incredible irony that is. 
   The Senator is absolutely right. I appreciate his calling attention to that.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Montana raises a very good point. It used to be that we considered a workweek working 5 days. The workweek is becoming more and more 3 days. Not only that; our work periods are only 3 weeks. Then there is no workweek at all. It is a remarkable juxtaposition. 
   First of all, we have a limited time each week. Then we have these periods for which there is no legislative work. Then we are told we don't have time to bring up the minimum wage. We don't have time to bring up issues that are of importance to families all across this country.

But if we want to bring about the kind of cost-of-living increases that we understand we need at our salary level, I think everyone would also understand the need for a cost-of-living adjustment for minimum-wage workers to at least stay equal to the poverty line, and to at least give them some encouragement not to go back on welfare. 
   I appreciate very much the Senator from Montana pointing out that matter.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Missouri River is one of our nation's greatest natural resources. Millions of visitors travel to the river each year to hunt, camp and fish. Millions more Americans rely on the Missouri's federal dams for affordable electricity. And, tens of thousands of South Dakotans depend upon the river as their only source of clean drinking water. 
   The river is rich in history. For thousands of years, Native Americans have lived along the river, and countless sites of deep spiritual and cultural importance to tribes line its shores. The river was also part of the route used by Lewis and Clark as they explored our nation. As we approach the bicentennial of that journey, it is expected that  millions of Americans will visit the Missouri River to retrace their steps. 
   Because the river is so important to the economy of our nation and to its heritage, it is critical that we meet head-on the growing array of challenges that it is facing. That is why I am introducing the Missouri River Restoration Act of 2000. This legislation will provide critically needed resources to ensure that future generations will continue to benefit from the river as we do today. 
   I am deeply concerned by the dramatic changes that we have witnessed since the construction of four federal dams on the river in South Dakota decades ago. These dams, which have prevented billions of dollars of flood-related damage downstream to cities like St. Louis, have altered the natural flow of the river. Sediment that used to be carried downstream, giving the river its nickname of ``Big Muddy,'' is now being deposited in South Dakota's reservoirs, Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case and Lewis and Clark Lake. 
   The siltation of the river is having a dramatic impact. In the cities of Pierre and Ft. Pierre, it has raised the water table and flooded shoreline homes. Already, Congress has had to authorize a $35 million project to relocate hundreds of affected families, and the Corps of Engineers has been forced to curtail the generation of electricity at Oahe dam in the wintertime to prevent additional flooding. In the town of Springfield, the economy has suffered a decline in tourism because few boaters can navigate the tons of silt that have clogged the river. 
   The problem will only grow more serious in the future. Each year, the river's tributaries deliver more than 40 million tons of sediment to the reservoirs. It is estimated that in less than 75 years, Lewis and Clark lake--the smallest of the reservoirs--will fill with sediment completely. The lake, and the development and recreation the lake has created for cities like Springfield and Yankton, will disappear altogether. 
   The economic impact of these changes on South Dakota would be very serious. Currently, visitors to counties bordering the Missouri River spend over $85 million each year. Anglers spend over $200 million in the state, and support more than 5,400 jobs. The loss of the Missouri's fisheries to sedimentation and the decline in the number of visitors to the river would have grave economic consequences. Furthermore, limitations imposed on electrical generation and flood control caused by sedimentation will have a dramatic impact in states throughout our region, as electricity prices and damages from flooding increase. 
   In addition to the problems caused by the siltation of the river, the river has faced a growing amount of erosion. While erosion is natural on all rivers, its pace has picked up on the Missouri due to the operation of the dams. Erosion has destroyed thousands of acres of farmland and is a serious threat to irreplaceable sites of spiritual importance to Indian tribes. Thousands of sites, ranging from burial grounds to campsites, are found up and down the Missouri River in South Dakota. It is unacceptable to let them wash away into the river. We must respect 
   all those who came before us, and preserve this part of our nation's heritage. 
   Last January, Governor Bill Janklow, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Chairman Mike Jandreau and I hosted a Missouri River Summit in the city of Springfield to bring together the best minds in the state to find a solution to these pressing problems. Over 400 South Dakotans attended this meeting and provided their thoughts and ideas. Virtually all those in attendance agreed that there is a critical need for more resources to improve conservation, to stop erosion and to help communities better utilize the river. The Missouri River Restoration Act of 2000 will help us to meet these goals as soon as possible. 
   This legislation, which I have developed in consultation with Governor Janklow of South Dakota, Chairman Jandreau and other state leaders, would establish a $200 million federal trust fund to provide the resources necessary to address the critical needs of the Missouri River watershed. Of these funds, 30 percent would be set aside for projects in Indian reservations or administered by Indian tribes. 
   Trust fund revenues would be administered by a 25-member ``Missouri River Trust'' composed of all the river's major stakeholders. Each of South Dakota's nine Indian tribes would appoint one member, as would the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota. The remainder would be appointed by the Governor, and must equally represent environmental, agricultural, hydropower and other river interests. In consultation with appropriate federal agencies, the Trust must develop a plan for the use of trust fund revenues that will reduce the siltation of the river by improving conservation in fragile riparian lands, better protect Indian cultural and historical sites, reduce erosion and improve our ability to recreate on the river. It will also be responsible for reviewing grant proposals to meet these goals. 
   Funding decisions would be made by a 5-member Executive Committee. To ensure that its decisions are balanced and represent the best interests of the state, the Executive Committee must be composed of members representing tribal, hydropower, agricultural, environmental and state government interests. 
   By establishing a trust fund and administrating board that effectively represents all stakeholders, we can provide South Dakota with the tools it needs to preserve the Missouri River for generations to come. I hope my colleagues will give this important legislation their support.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the time is right to repeal the Social Security earnings test. I ask my colleagues to join with me today in support of the passage of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 1999. 
   We all know that reaching retirement age does not necessarily mean a person is ready to retire. It is good news that Americans are now living longer and healthier lives, and I believe that the Social Security system should not penalize those who want to work longer. I understand that many older workers choose to remain in the workforce because they need additional income or have no desire to stop working. I fully support this choice, and I believe that no one should face financial penalties for that personal decision. 
   In South Dakota this year, 2000 people have seen their Social Security benefits reduced because they chose to continue working when they reached the age of 65. All told, Social Security withheld about $8 million in Social Security payments last year from those South Dakotans. That works out to a loss of about $4000 in Social Security benefits for each of those 2000 South Dakotans. That is not right. Let's not penalize them for staying in the work force to achieve a better standard of living. I know many Americans over 65 in my state who could use that money to pay for health insurance, prescription drugs, and electric bills. 
   H.R. 5 will not only help these 2000 workers who are not receiving their Social Security benefits, but also encourage those who want to work, but are not doing so now because they fear the earnings limit would consume most or all of their earned benefits. As baby boomers begin to retire, it is especially important that these older Americans who want to work be encouraged to do so. Our nation is celebrating record low unemployment. Let us seize this opportunity to recognize the skills, knowledge, and experience that people over 65 have to offer. I am pleased that Congress is on the verge of removing the earnings limit to encourage citizens in my state and across the country to continue making an important contribution to the American economy. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to build on the momentum created by this bipartisan bill to work toward Social Security reform. We can pass legislation this year that will extend the solvency of Social Security for 50 years by using the interest savings earned by paying down the debt. We should take that simple step this year on a bipartisan basis, just as we are passing this bill today.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's effort to try to move this legislation along. This bill, the bankruptcy bill, passed the Senate with more than 80 votes. Whether or not we get unanimous consent is not relevant. What is relevant is that we get these two pieces of legislation successfully completed in a timely manner. If we are not able to get unanimous consent, I intend to support finding a way to assure that we do go to conference both on the bankruptcy bill and the minimum wage. 
   I am hopeful we can instruct the conferees with regard to minimum wage. It would be my hope, at least, that the Senate could express itself in regard to the issue on minimum wage prior to the time we go to conference. But if we could accommodate that request, that we have at least an opportunity to express ourselves on the conference itself, then I would certainly be supportive of moving on a motion to proceed to two conferences--one on bankruptcy and one on minimum wage. 
   The distinguished Senator from Vermont, and others, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator DURBIN, and others, have done an extraordinary job in getting us to this point. 
   We have a much better bill, a stronger bill, in the Senate on bankruptcy than we do in the House. I hope we can take what we have been able to accomplish in the Senate and bring our House colleagues to the realization that that is the kind of legislation that will be signed into law. 
   On the minimum wage, the House version, at least in terms of the 2-year approach, is the one the President said he will support. It enjoys strong support in the Senate as well. We are concerned about the size and magnitude of the tax provisions. If we could target those, we would be in good shape on that as well. 
   I understand the majority leader's interest in moving this. We want to be supportive in that regard; most of us do. I am hopeful we can accomplish it through a unanimous consent request.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the interest of the majority leader in moving this legislation along. I recall how long it was that we had to wait even to go to conference because of amendments that were outstanding. If I recall, we had to wait months, really, to accommodate, in fact, in this case, the majority; they wanted to offer some specific amendments that they were not interested in voting on until we got back from the first session of the Congress. So this has been languishing for a long time in large measure because some on the majority side were not interested in expediting consideration of this legislation. We clamored for conference last year and were unsuccessful in getting the conferees appointed last year. Now the majority leader, understandably, is frustrated and concerned for the lack of progress. That is understandable. There should not be any question that the overwhelming majority of the Senate wants to move to finish this legislation as soon as possible. It is what we clamored for last year, and it is what we have been trying to get this year. 
   I hope there will be some degree of cooperation and communication with regard to how we proceed. I look forward to talking more comprehensively about my suggestion. It seems to me that going to the conference with the bankruptcy bill, as he has proposed, would make sense. Going to the conference on minimum wage would make sense if we had the opportunity, once again, to express ourselves on it, since we haven't been able to do that independent of the bankruptcy debate. If we are going to have a separate minimum wage conference, there ought to be a separate consideration, at least on the motion to instruct conferees. We could agree that it would not be amendable, that it would be expedited and not delayed, but simply a vote would make a lot of sense, it seems to me. I am prepared to talk with the majority leader at greater length. We all recall how long it took to even get the bill completed, and that was in large measure because we weren't able to complete it as a result of concerns expressed by the majority. 
   We have now completed it. We now want to move on to the second phase of it. I want to work with the majority leader to 
   see that it happens.

   I understand there are some strong feelings by a very distinct minority of the minority. It is their right, and certainly I respect their right to object. But there are other ways to deal with the issue, and I am prepared to find ways.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object. 
   If I could just explain for a moment, we have been working closely with a number of our colleagues, I understand, on a bipartisan basis from the Northeast who want to be able to offer an amendment. I know at least in some cases they haven't had the opportunity to see the bill until yesterday. So they have asked for our indulgence in working with them to see if we can accommodate their needs. I have indicated a willingness to do that. 
   I noted to Senator LOTT just a few minutes ago that we are close to reaching a procedural arrangement whereby that could be done. I am hopeful that we will be able to get that agreement sometime shortly. I have no objection to proceeding to the bill. We could certainly do that. 
   Earlier, a suggestion was made and a unanimous consent request I think was offered which would allow us to go to the bill for general debate only. As I understand it, that was objected to. But whether we go to the bill without an agreement or go to the bill and seek a unanimous consent that would allow for a general debate, either of those approaches would work. 
   I hope that by the end of the day we can get a unanimous consent agreement that would spell out in more detail, as perhaps the chairman has suggested, an amendment list. As I said, we are close. I certainly have no objection myself to moving forward, as he has suggested. I want to accommodate Senators who have been working in good faith to try to find a way in which to amend the bill, and they should be prepared to do that before the end of the day. 
   I will object at this time.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall not, let me thank all Senators for their cooperation and for their willingness to work with the leadership to accommodate the many concerns that have existed on both sides. 
   Let me say briefly, however, for the record, this is yet another example of the minority again cooperating with the majority and denying ourselves the right to offer nonrelevant amendments first, that is nonagricultural amendments, or any other amendments that are nonrelevant, and limiting ourselves to relevant amendments to this particular bill. We are doing it as a result of the urgency that I think everyone understands about this matter, and we are doing it in an effort to try to accelerate consideration of this bill and also ultimately come to a conclusion. It is an abrogation of the rights of all Senators to again be asked that they preclude the consideration of any nonrelevant amendments. 
   We will do it again in this case. But I think that, at some point, the Senate has to be the Senate, where Senators have the right to offer amendments regardless of subject matter. Again, in this case, I appreciate the cooperation of everybody. I hope we don't continue in the Senate what I think is a dangerous pattern--that we limit Senators in such a narrow way, as we are doing in this case. We are doing it for good reason, but I hope we can find ways in which to allow Senators to express themselves and be full participants in debate on other matters and other vehicles. 
   I certainly don't object. I commend the chairman for getting this agreement.

   Mr. DASCHLE. In this time of instant millionaires, it's easy to close our eyes to the fact that people, particularly children, go hungry in this country. But hunger is a fact and it's a national tragedy. It's particularly troubling that many working families find themselves short of food. 
   When Congress enacted welfare reform in 1996, we worked to ensure that families would have the support they need to get off welfare. Food stamps are a critical part of that support. Yet food stamp enrollment has declined more rapidly than the poverty data would suggest is warranted. 
   The policies we are talking about today are urgently needed to reduce hunger in this country, particularly in working families that need extra help as they work to become self-sufficient. 
   I commend the Senators who have spoken today for their efforts to address the serious problem of hunger in America. A number of us met recently with Secretary Glickman to discuss this issue. I look forward to working with them to enact hunger relief legislation this year and urge the Budget Committee to reserve $2.5 billion for this effort.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the farmers and ranchers of this country have been struggling with terrible economic conditions over the past three years. They have seen their prices collapse and remain at, or in many cases below, the cost of production. Not only have farmers in my state and across the country endured these low prices, they have also been subject to the unpredictable forces of droughts, floods and crop disease. 
   We have before us a bill that will help farmers and ranchers survive these bad times and manage production risks. S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, is a comprehensive approach to reforming and improving crop insurance for producers across the country. It will make the federal crop insurance program more affordable and effective. 
   Currently, the government provides subsidies for multi-peril crop insurance, but subsidies are progressively less at higher levels of coverage. This aspect of the crop insurance program often has the effect of restricting farmers from investing in the most efficient levels of coverage for their farms. This bill inverts this subsidy, so the higher levels of coverage are subsidized at the highest levels. This makes meaningful and comprehensive coverage much more affordable to farmers in this country who rely on the program to manage their production risks. 
   This bill also addresses another issue of critical importance to farmers in South Dakota and nationwide. Many parts of the country have suffered devastating crop losses for several years in a row. As disastrous conditions persist, farmers' eligibility under the current crop insurance program decreases--the opposite of what common sense would dictate. This bill enables producers to protect and sustain their crop insurance eligibility so that crop insurance remains an economically viable option for them for the long term. 
   This legislation also authorizes the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to develop insurance products on a pilot basis for livestock producers. For too long, we have excluded our cattle ranchers, hog producers, and other livestock producers from federal agriculture programs, including crop--or perhaps we should say ``commodity''--insurance. This bill expands the flexibility of the program in this way so that more producers can benefit from this important investment. 
   This legislation also provides great benefits for producers of specialty crops. It improves catastrophic loss insurance coverage by increasing the access specialty crop farmers have to quality crop insurance policies. Current crop insurance policies do not cover the unique characteristics associated with the planting, growing, and harvesting of specialty crops. This bill will promote specialty crop producer participation in the federal crop insurance program, encourage higher levels of coverage than provided by catastrophic insurance, and enable those producers to make better planning and marketing decisions. Furthermore, the bill requires that at least fifty percent of the funds dedicated to research and development for new crop insurance products are focused on specialty crop product development. This legislation also specifically provides funds to the RMA to enter into public and private partnerships to develop specialty crop insurance policies, and authorizes funds for pilot programs that would be conducted at the state, regional, and national levels. 
   Finally, this bill eliminates the area trigger for the non-insured assistance program, making any grower whose crop is uninsurable and who experiences a federally-declared disaster eligible for disaster funds. 
   Some have shared a concern that this crop insurance plan does not adequately address the range of problems across the country. They should be assured that this bill was written with the input and support of lawmakers, farmers, and agricultural organizations from all regions of the country. 
   The crop insurance program has grown in popularity over the last several years. This bill will significantly improve an already important and successful program. Effective and affordable crop insurance is a vital part of an improved safety net that farmers and ranchers need to protect themselves from production risks, and to survive and succeed this year and in years to come. 
   But make no mistake. Passage of this bill is only one part of our overall effort to improve farm policy. We must consider the many other ways in which our current policies have contributed to the poor economic conditions plaguing our farmers and ranchers. I look forward to that debate.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time and allocate that time to my comments on the floor this morning. 
   Let me begin by acknowledging, as well, the extraordinary leadership, not only of Senator REED, but of Senator BOXER. Everything Senator BOXER has said about Senator REED is a view that I think is shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. He has come to the Senate and in a very short period of time established himself as an authority on a number of key issues, including education and defense matters, as well as now, on neighborhood safety. I applaud him again for taking the leadership, as he has. 
   Senator BOXER, on this, as well as on so many other issues, comes to the floor, grinds it out, and speaks as passionately and as eloquently as anybody in this Chamber. It is an extraordinary privilege to work with her as well. 
   I have heard the proposal made by the Senator from Rhode Island that we set for ourselves a date by which we must act with respect to juvenile safety, and that we choose a date that we all ought to remember--April 20th. Last year, that date, the date of the Columbine tragedy, triggered our commitment to better safety and prompted the Senate to act. We left with an expectation that, as a result of that action in the Senate, things were going to happen, that we could send a message of hope to the people of Colorado and to the people of this Nation that we will not tolerate the violence that exists in this country. We sent the message that we will respond to tragedy with careful, commonsense approaches that will make schools and neighborhoods safer, such as balanced gun legislation. That is what we said and that is how we voted. We are on record as having supported such commonsense legislation. 
   In poll after poll, it is remarkable the degree to which the American people support the actions taken by the Senate and the amendments offered by our Democratic colleagues. It is overwhelming. 
   There has been a sea change, an attitudinal progression on this issue in the country--a sea change. I represent a Western State where, after you are born, on your first or second birthday, virtually, you get a shotgun--because that is what we do. I am proud I have shotguns. I love to go hunting. I love to walk and take in nature in all of its splendor in the fall. That is part of the culture of the West. It is a part of the culture of growing up in South Dakota of which I am very proud and I love. I will defend it, and I will work to ensure that my children and grandchildren and great grandchildren have these same experiences. 
   But there is a difference. That difference is becoming even more extraordinarily evident as we read about experiences such as we read this morning in the Washington Post, an agonizing description of what kind of setting created this despicable act in Michigan. A young boy, 6 years old, takes a gun, walks into a school full of children, his school, picks out a girl, says, ``I don't like you,'' and shoots her to death. That story generated a front page article and a spread, inside the paper, of two full pages--and it should have. Why? Because this incident illustrates the magnitude of the torturous existence that now is becoming more and more prevalent all across this country in schools and in neighborhoods. 
   But you could put that kind of story on the front page of the Washington Post every single day. It happened in Michigan, but it happened yesterday somewhere else. It happened in Rhode Island shortly after that. It happens every day. Those of us who appreciate the culture of a good pheasant hunt recognize there is a huge difference between that and the disastrous consequences of this proliferation of guns that now has become a real threat to the safety and well-being of children in virtually every school in America today. 
   All the Senator from Rhode Island is suggesting is that at long last we say: Look, we've talked enough. Let's act. We took the first step last May. We expected that we would take additional steps. We have not. We have talked. We have positioned. We have wrung our hands in agony as one shooting after another has been pasted on the pages of every single newspaper in the country. 
   The litany of additional Columbines has continued all across the country. These new shootings may not have claimed as many lives. But they are tragedies nonetheless. They ought to trigger action. 
   Let us act. Let us meet in conference and work through our differences so that we can finally say: We are not only going to talk about this. We are going to do something about it. 
   We recognize that passing the modest gun safety measures in the Juvenile Justice report will not completely solve the problem of gun violence. There may be other things that can be done. I am very grateful to HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, and others in the administration, for having worked out a remarkable and historic new agreement with Smith & Wesson. 
   What a statement: for Smith & Wesson to acknowledge that guns are inherently dangerous, and that they are going to do something about it. Regardless of what their motivation may be, the fact is, they are going to do something about it. In making this commitment, they are setting a precedent. I would love to see every gun manufacturer follow Smith & Wesson's lead. It is common sense. 
   I have long admired President Ford, for many reasons. My admiration for him increased again this past week when he spoke about the need for this Congress to respond in a commonsense way to the gun violence that is claiming too many of our children. 
   The American people are looking to us. They want to know that we hear them. They want us to give them some hope that we can solve the real problems facing families and communities--not only in Columbine, but in South Dakota, Michigan, Rhode Island, California, and all across America. The American people want to know that our democratic process works. 
   In these days before the first anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, we ought to take President Ford's wise counsel to heart. For the sake of our children, we need to come together and pass common-sense gun safety laws. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time so as not to take time of either side. 
   I want to add my voice especially to those of the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont and the Senator from California, who have spoken so eloquently on this matter for what seems to be several days. I want to make three points. 
   I think the most disconcerting aspect of this debate, for those who may be watching, is the concern that I would have, having heard many of our colleagues express their virtual desire to influence the Ninth Circuit and the decisions made there. Our Founding Fathers did an extraordinary job of creating the checks and balances in our constitutional system. As I travel around the world and talk to leaders from other parts of the world, who have not enjoyed that delicate balance between the judiciary, the executive, and legislative branches, the lament I hear all around the world is: We don't have an independent judiciary. We have a politicized judiciary. Because it is politicized, we don't have the rule of law. Because we don't have the rule of law, we don't have the predictability in law that creates the extraordinary stability that you have in your country. 
   These leaders tell me: We want the rule of law, and we recognize that if we are ever going to acquire it, what we have to do is to depoliticize our judiciary, and we have to ensure that we do what you have done--respect its independence. 
   There is a huge difference between voting against somebody's philosophy or experience or qualifications based upon past judgments in a particular trial--and Senators have every right to do so on the basis of whatever qualifications they may choose. All of those criteria, it seems to me, are fair game. But if we are saying we ought to vote against someone, or for someone, because we want to influence the direction of a certain circuit, I think we get precariously close to creating the kind of politicization of the judiciary that, to me, is frightening. We need to be very, very careful. For 200 years, we have been able to maintain that independence and discipline it takes to ensure the rule of law will always prevail. 
   I hope as we cast our votes, people will cast them based upon whether they think Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon are capable--whether they have the right qualifications. And, frankly, if they want to throw in philosophy, so be it. But let us not say this ought to be some judgment on the Ninth Circuit. Let us not say that somehow we want to send a message to the Ninth Circuit or any circuit, for that matter. That is not our role. That is not our responsibility. In the Constitution, the Founding Fathers had no design, no possible thought that we as Senators ought to be influencing in any way decisions made by the court, an independent and coequal branch of government. 
   That is my first point. 
   My second point is that I believe there is a time and a place for us to consider any nominee and, once having done so, we need to get on with it. I cannot imagine that anybody could justify, anybody could rationalize, anybody could explain why, in the name of public service, we would put anyone through the misery and the extraordinary anguish that these two nominees have had to face for years. Why would anyone ever offer themselves for public service if they knew what they had to go through was what these two people have had to experience and endure? 
   I do not know who is going to be President next. I do not know who is going to be in the majority in the next Congress. But let's just assume that the roles are reversed and we, the Democrats, are in the majority and we have a Republican President--which I do not think is going to happen. If that happens, do we really want to wait 4 years to take up a Republican nominee? Do we want to pay back our colleagues for having made these people wait as long as they have? I know that I have heard from people over the last several months: that we should do to them what they have done to us. 
   But, I do not want to hear about that in this body. There is going to be no payback. We are not going to do to Republican nominees, whenever that happens, what they have done to Democratic nominees. Why? Because it is not right. 
   Will we differ? Absolutely. Will we have votes and vote against nominees on the basis of whatever we choose? Absolutely. But are we going to make them wait for years and years to get their fair opportunity to be voted on and considered? Absolutely not. That is not right. I do not care who is in charge. I do not care which President is making the nomination. That is not right. 
   I hope somehow the nominations that are still pending will not be subjected to the same extraordinary, unfair process to which these nominees were subjected. We have 34 nominees pending. There is no reason why every single one of them cannot be confirmed or at least considered in the next few months.  
   The last point I will make is one I have made a couple of times before, but it bears repeating. This has been a very difficult process for a lot of people, and there are a lot of 
   people who deserve some credit. I have already cited the extraordinary contribution of the senior Senator from Vermont, our ranking Judiciary Committee member. I have already noted the efforts made by the California delegation, especially Senator BOXER. Senator HATCH is here. I note his cooperation and the effort he has made in getting us to this point. 
   I thank the majority leader. He and I have talked about this on several occasions, and it is never easy when you have dissent within your own caucus to make decisions. He made a commitment last year, and he held to that commitment this year. He said we would have these votes, up or down, on the confirmation of these two judicial nominees before the 15th of March, and we are going to do that. I publicly thank him and commend him for holding to that commitment. It is not easy. He has done a difficult thing, but he has done it. 
   I hope today we can celebrate not only the confirmation of two judges, but renewed comity between our parties when it comes to all nominees--regardless of party, regardless of administration, and regardless of who controls the Senate. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I intend to use my leader time for purposes of making a couple of statements this morning. I would like first to voice my support for the conference report to H.R. 1000, which, as has already been noted, is the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. 
   I hope our former colleague, Senator Wendell Ford, a dear and very special friend of mine who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee's Aviation Subcommittee for many years, is watching because this truly is a tribute to his dedication not only to aviation but to his country and to the Senate for a long time. It is a very appropriate designation for this legislation. 
   The conference report we are considering today will help repair our aviation system for the skyrocketing number of passengers who will travel in the 21st century. It is also a fitting tribute to Senator Ford's vision that he expressed to us on many occasions as he was leading us on this and many other issues. 
   I thank as well the majority leader, Senator LOTT, for his persistence in providing leadership on this matter and in getting us to this point. I think the credit also must go to our distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member. It is clear they have the chemistry and the working relationship it takes to accomplish something of this complexity, and I pay tribute to both of them for their efforts and for their arduous work in getting us to this point. We ought to be celebrating this morning the accomplishments of something that many of us have been hoping to achieve for a long period of time. Were it not for their leadership and support, it would not have happened. 
   I have been reminded oftentimes of the movie ``Groundhog Day'' with Bill Murray, with the Senate waking up once a year to consider the same FAA reauthorization bill. The Senate first began considering this bill in 1998 and passed S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act, in September of that year. Although there was overwhelming support for that legislation in the Senate, House and Senate negotiators could not agree on a multiyear bill at that time. 
   Last year, the Senate passed S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1999, in October. As my colleagues have recalled, this legislation was almost identical to the FAA reauthorization bill we approved the year before. Again, there was overwhelming support for the legislation in the Senate. However, House and Senate negotiators could not agree on a multiyear FAA reauthorization bill, just as they were unable to do the year before. 
   As the Senate has considered and reconsidered the FAA reauthorization bill in recent years, the FAA has been operating for the most part under short-term extensions. I have mentioned on many occasions my view that this is no way to fund such an important Federal agency. Short-term extension after short-term extension disrupts long-term planning at the FAA and airports around the country that rely on Federal funds to improve their facilities and enhance aviation safety. The only thing worse than passing a short-term extension is allowing funding for FAA programs to lapse altogether. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the Congress did when the House again refused to consider the 6-month extension the Senate passed on November 10 of last year. For the last 4 months, funds for airport improvement projects have been tied up because Congress has been unable to forge an agreement on the FAA reauthorization bill. 
   So today we begin to rectify that mistake and prepare for the increased demand that will be placed on our aviation system in the 21st century. This bill will authorize approximately $40 billion for aviation programs over the next 3 years. In fiscal year 2001, the bill will authorize $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion over current levels. In the next fiscal year, it will enhance aviation safety by authorizing $3.2 billion for airport improvement projects, $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2002, and $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2003. 
   It will also allow airports to increase passenger facility charges from $3 to $4.50. 
   This PFC increase is expected to generate $700 million for much-needed construction projects that will improve airports in South Dakota and around the country, in every State. 
   The conference report to the FAA reauthorization bill also includes a number of provisions that would encourage competition among the airlines and ensure quality air service for communities. For instance, it would authorize funding for a 4-year pilot program to improve commercial air service in small communities that have not benefited from deregulation. 
   Specifically, the bill calls for the establishment of an Office of Small Community Air Service Development at the Department of Transportation (DOT) to work with local communities, states, airports and air carriers and develop public-private partnerships that bring commercial air service including regional jet service to small communities. 
   We have often commented on how critical the Essential Air Service Program has been to small communities in South Dakota and around the country in their efforts to retain air service. The Small Community Aviation Development Program would give DOT the authority to provide up to $500,000 per year to as many as 40 communities that participate in the program and agree to pay 25 percent in matching funds. In addition, the legislation would establish an air traffic control service pilot program that would allow up to 20 small communities to share in the cost of building contract control towers. 
   I am hopeful that South Dakota will have the opportunity to participate in the Small Community Aviation Development Program. I think it is one of the better features of this legislation. I commend my colleagues for their inclusion of it. 
   Mr. President, I know some of our colleagues may oppose this bill because it would increase the number of flights at the four slot-controlled airports. The proposal to increase the number of flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has been particularly controversial, and I would again like to commend Senator ROBB for being a strong advocate for his constituents in northern Virginia. 
   I know some of our colleagues on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation will also oppose this bill because of the budgetary treatment of the aviation trust fund. I understand their concerns and look forward to working with them to ensure that Amtrak, Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board, and FAA operations are adequately funded. 
   Although there may be different provisions in this bill that each of us may find objectional, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 1000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. Spring is just around the corner, and we cannot afford to delay construction on airport improvement projects any longer. 
   It is unfair to FAA, it is unfair to airports in South Dakota and throughout the country, and it is unfair to passengers who rely on the aviation system for their travel needs. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the conference report to the FAA reauthorization bill. 
   Again, I commend my colleagues, especially the chairman and ranking member, for their work on this bill. I hope we can pass it this afternoon on a bipartisan basis.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, among the constitutional responsibilities entrusted to the Senate, none is more critical to the well-being of our democracy than providing advice and consent on Presidential nominations. Later on today, we take up that solemn responsibility in connection with two very distinguished judicial nominees, Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez. 
   Let me commend the majority leader for his commitment to the Senate, and to these nominees, that we would take up these nominees for consideration and ultimately for a vote on confirmation before the 15th of March. We  would not be here were it not for the fact that he persisted and that he was willing to hold to the commitment he made to us last year. 
   Both nominees have waited an extraordinarily long time for this consideration. Marsha Berzon, a nominee for the Ninth Circuit, has been kept waiting for a vote more than 2 years. Judge Paez, another Ninth Circuit nominee, has waited for more than 4 years. That is longer than any Federal court nominee in history--a statistic that should shame the Senate. 
   Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon are both exceptional legal minds and remarkable people. But before I discuss their qualifications, I wish to say something about the context in which these nominations are being considered. Since the 106th Congress convened in January, the President has nominated 79 men and women to fill the vacancies on the Federal bench. Without exception, these nominees have come to us with the highest marks from their peers. Yet of the 79 nominees, only 34--fewer than half--were confirmed last year, and only 4 have been confirmed so far this year. 
   Looking at those figures, one might assume we have no pressing need for Federal judges. In fact, just the opposite is true. Today, there are 76 vacancies on the Federal bench. Of those 76 vacancies, 29 have been empty so long they are officially classified as ``judicial emergencies.'' The failure to fill these vacancies is straining our Federal court system and delaying justice for people all across this country. 
   This cannot continue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist warns, ``Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.'' 
   The Ninth Circuit court, to which both Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon have been nominated, is also one of our Nation's busiest courts. It has also been hardest hit by our neglect. More than 20 percent of the Ninth Circuit bench is vacant. This is a court that serves almost 20 percent of the United States. 
   Procter Hug, the Chief Justice of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, was appointed in 1980 when the court had 23 active judges and a caseload of 3,000 appeals. Today, with six vacancies, the Ninth Circuit has 22 active judges to hear more than 9,000 appeals. They have one fewer judge today than they had 20 years ago--with 300 percent more cases. 
   So I thank my colleagues for finally coming together to address this urgent question. The failure to fill Federal court vacancies harms plaintiffs and defendants alike. Both are forced to wait too long for justice. The failure to fill Federal court vacancies also imposes heavy and unjustifiable burdens on judicial nominees and their families. Can any of us imagine what it would be like to be kept waiting more than 4 years, as Judge Paez has? What would it be like to be unable to make personal or professional plans for 4 years? I have met Judge Paez, and I have to tell you, I am amazed by the dignity and grace he has exhibited during this ordeal. Perhaps that is not surprising, though, from a man lawyers routinely rate as exceptional in both his judicial temperament and his command of legal doctrine. 
   For a long time, those who opposed Marsha Berzon and Judge Paez would not say why. Now some of them say the problem isn't with the nominees, the problem is with the court itself. The Ninth Circuit, they claim, is a ``rogue'' circuit. They claim the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate by the Supreme Court is too high. They argue, therefore, that we should refuse to confirm anymore Ninth Circuit judges. We should just let the vacancies go unfilled. 
   The fact is, the Eleventh, Seventh, and Fifth Circuits all have a higher rate of reversal than the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is completely within the mainstream of prevailing judicial opinion. 
   Even if that were not the case, this Senate has no right to attempt to punish the citizens who rely on the Ninth Circuit in this manner. Nor do we have the right to try to influence the independence of the court in this way. That is unconstitutional. 
   Our responsibility under the Constitution is to vote on whether to confirm judges. It is not our responsibility, and it is not our right, to try to influence or intimidate judges after they are confirmed. 
   As we consider the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, let us remember that these votes are not a referendum on the Ninth Circuit, or on President Clinton. 
   And they should not be about partisan politics. These votes are about two people. Two distinguished and inspiring Americans who are eminently qualified for the bench. 
   Richard Paez has been a judge for 18 years. He is the first Mexican-American ever to serve as a federal district judge in Los Angeles. He was confirmed by this body in 1994; that vote was unanimous. 
   Judge Paez has received the highest rating the American Bar Association gives for federal judicial nominees. He has worked for the public good throughout his career, working first as a legal aid lawyer, and then, for 13 years, as a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge. 
   In his current position, as a United States District Judge, Judge Paez has presided over a wide variety of complex civil and criminal cases. For his work, he has garnered bipartisan support, and the support of such law enforcement organizations as the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association and the National Association of Police Organizations. 
   Time and again, on the bench he has demonstrated the qualities that are essential to a strong and respected judicial system--wisdom, courage, and compassion. We need judges like Richard Paez on the bench. Without public servants like him, this system fails. 
   Marsha Berzon is equally qualified. 
   She is a nationally known and extremely well regarded appellate litigator with a highly respected San Francisco law firm. She is also a former clerk for the United States Supreme Court. She has served as a visiting professor at both Cornell Law School and Indiana University Law School. She is a widely recognized expert in the field of employment law--an area of the law that requires the increasing attention of our federal judiciary. 
   She has argued four cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, and has filed dozens of Supreme Court briefs on complex issues. To quote my friend Senator HATCH, her ``competence as a lawyer is beyond question.'' 
   Ms. Berzon also has the support of the National Association of Police Organizations, business and Republican leaders. She enjoys a reputation among colleagues and opposing counsel for being a fair-minded, well prepared, and principled advocate. I have also met Ms. Berzon, and I find her temperament and seriousness well-suited for the job she has been nominated to fill. 
   The federal judiciary has been described as ``the thin black line between order and chaos.'' I have faith that Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, once confirmed, will live up to that challenge. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader yielding to me. 
   As we go through our daily schedules and responsibilities, I bet I do a lot of things which are a source of concern for the majority leader. I am sure he is not surprised that the way this matter has been handled is a source of concern to me. We talk daily. Sometimes we talk hourly. Sometimes I am sure we talk more than he would like. But, nonetheless, we talk. To say we were surprised and disappointed that a unanimous consent request could be propounded without any notification is an understatement. It is disappointing. 
   I hope we can avoid surprising one another. But, of course, we do it. That is understandable. Certainly, the majority leader has every right to proceed in any way he sees most appropriate. I think it is a violation of the trust and communication that we try to maintain. And I am very disappointed he sought to come to the floor without any notification of the issue. 
   Let me say three things.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's graciousness and accept the apology. 
   As I say, we have had a great working relationship this year already on a lot of different issues. I appreciate very much the manner in which he has expressed himself on this particular situation. 
   Let me say to the issue, as he noted, we have attempted to resolve this in the past. I give Senator LOTT great credit for trying to find as many innovative ways in which to address what has been an irresolvable conflict. 
   We have indicated a willingness to go to conference so long as it involves the committee that was responsible for passing this legislation. The Commerce Committee held hearings. They marked up the bill. They passed it. We are now at a point where the conference includes conferees from the Commerce Committee in the House, and we are prepared as we move to conference to accept conferees from the Commerce Committee. 
   The problem is, the chairman of the Banking Committee wants to be part of the conference, and, frankly, the Banking Committee didn't have jurisdiction. 
   The Banking Committee is not represented on the House side. There is no reason that we can understand why the Banking Committee, in and of itself, ought to be involved in the conference when they didn't have jurisdiction. 
   Certainly, the chairman ought to be heard and he ought to be recognized as one who certainly has every right to express himself to the conferees, as other Members. Let him go to the conference and express himself. Let him offer suggestions on the Senate floor. 
   But to make him a conferee when we have already agreed that the Commerce Committee could move forward, could accomplish what I think is unanimous support for the legislation--I am sure we could achieve that at some point, and it would be the fastest and most meaningful way with which to get it done. 
   I am hopeful we can do that. There is no reason for this legislation to be delayed anymore. Let's have the conferees work their will. Let's get this legislation passed. Like Senator LOTT, I think there are a lot of people out there, including his son, who ought to see the Senate act. I desire that no less than he. Hopefully, we can do it soon.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I share the desire expressed by the majority leader to get this done. I want to publicly, again, commend Senator LEAHY for all of his leadership and effort to get the Senate to this point. He spoke earlier and I appreciate very much his willingness to stay committed and his persistence in getting the Senate to a point where we actually could see this become law. 
   Maybe there is a way, if we go beyond Commerce jurisdiction, to include the leadership of the Judiciary Committee and the leadership of the Banking Committee and maybe expand it to include a lot more Members than just Commerce Committee members. 
   As Senator LOTT noted, we can perhaps try to find another innovative mix of participants. Certainly if this happens, the distinguished Senator from Vermont ought to be a part of the conference. I am sure we can work it out at some point. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know there is another unanimous consent to propound. 
   Let me briefly thank the majority leader for keeping his commitment. He and I both hoped we wouldn't have to file cloture. We may yet have the opportunity to vitiate cloture if something can be worked out. I am hopeful that we will have an opportunity to have the votes as he has anticipated tomorrow at 5 o'clock. This agreement accords everybody their rights. People will have an opportunity to further discuss this matter. They will be able to respond to whatever statements may be made on the floor. We will have a good debate about these nominees tomorrow, even though we will be taking up other legislation. 
   I think this is a very good agreement. I am grateful to him and to all of our colleagues for their cooperation. I appreciate the fact that we have come this far. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think this is a very good agreement. I think we can have a good discussion about the conference report. 
   I know there are other Senators who may want to enter into a colloquy with the majority leader or others with regard to some of the implications of the FAA bill. This will accommodate any colloquies Senators may desire. 
   I also am pleased that we are able to move to the Export Administration Act. As the majority leader noted, this bill is important. We ought to finish it this week. There is no reason why we can't finish it this week, if we can get agreement. It passed out of the committee unanimously. It is long overdue. It is important for us to act on it. 
   I think this would be a good week for us to be able to deal not only with these nominations, not only with the FAA, but also with the Export Administration. We have an opportunity to do some real good work, and this agreement accommodates that. 
   I appreciate Senators' cooperation on both sides. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time in discussing the Boxer amendment for a moment. 
   First, I came to the floor to commend Senator BOXER for her amendment and applaud her for her leadership in drawing attention once again to this very important matter. This amendment simply highlights the fact that students can't learn when they are afraid. 
   Why are they afraid? They are afraid because too many communities and too many children live worried that today's playground will be tomorrow's crime scene. This week's tragedy in Michigan is just one more bloody reminder of this phenomena. 
   As the President stated today, now is the time for us--for the Administration, for the Congress--to do its part to respond. So, I say with as much heartfelt emphasis as I can, now is the time for Congress to stop stalling. 
   It was on May 20 of 1999 that the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill. That was over 9 months ago. It was on June 17 of 1999 that the House passed the juvenile justice bill. That was over 8 months ago. After waiting weeks, on August 5 of 1999, almost 7 months ago, the juvenile justice conference had its first, and regrettably, only meeting. 
   We are still stalled, with a phantom conference, today. Stalled in that conference are measures that will help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, help keep schools safe, and provide some balance, some degree of confidence that children can go to school more safe and more secure than they are today. 
   What are we talking about? We are talking about handgun safety locks, something that could have easily helped this week. We are talking about a measure to close the gun show loophole. We are talking about a juvenile Brady bill. And we are talking about the banning of the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips, once and for all. That is what we are talking about. 
   On virtually every one of these issues, the overwhelming majority of the American people said: Why didn't you do this last year or years before? Why is it now, the year 2000, 9 months after the Senate began this debate, and we still have yet to act? How many more children must die? How much more must we and the American people endure? We need to stop listening to narrow special interests and pass these commonsense gun safety measures now. 
   The tragedy in Michigan should shock us all into action; although Columbine and Jonesboro, and countless other shootings have not seemed to prompt Congress into action. Just think, a 6-year-old girl lost her life, lost her life, because a young boy, who probably still doesn't understand the consequences of his act, had access to a deadly weapon. The truly sad fact is these tragedies happen every day in this country and do not generate the news attention this particular incident did. If they did, we would all be in the Chamber today. If we had a daily rollcall of those who no longer are living as a result of our inaction, we would all be called to action. Thirteen children under the age of 19 are killed with guns every single day, and other children suffer from witnessing those deaths and fearing for their own lives. 
   I just listened to the letters by children read by Senator FEINSTEIN. All you have to do is listen to one of them. All you have to do is imagine a child sitting down writing that letter. A child should be writing about baseball and soccer and all the good things that happen in school. But they are writing about fear. They are writing about guns. They are writing about violence. They are writing about death. I do not know how much more tragedy this country has to endure before Congress wakes up. 
   This amendment simply asks us to recognize we need to act now. This amendment should be more than just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It should be a call to action. Today, we lay down a marker that if by April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, the Congress has not sent the President a juvenile justice bill that includes commonsense gun safety measures, we have failed. We have failed. That is what this amendment is all about. That is the endeavor in which I hope all my colleagues will join. 
   This does not have to be, and is not, a partisan issue. This is an education issue. It is a family issue. It is a life or death issue. I hope we all realize its consequences. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment and applaud the authors. I am very hopeful that we can get good bipartisan support for this legislation, in large measure because it is exactly what we need to be doing right now, if, indeed, we are serious when we say we want more technology in schools. 
   I can't think of a better way to encourage more technology in schools than to ensure that companies are able to use the incentives that are there to maximize the opportunities for schools to acquire the kinds of hardware and software they need to fully equip every school across the country. 
   As I travel throughout South Dakota, it is with great pride that superintendents and principals will show me their computer room. They will show me how computer literate their students are. They show me how integrated technology is now becoming in schools. But the one consistent lament they have is that they just don't have the resources to ensure that they can acquire the equipment or, in a timely way, replace that equipment, knowing it is going to be outdated in 3 years, knowing they are going to be faced with the same budgetary decisions once again in a very short period of time. There is a longer life for acquiring sports equipment, books, desks, or almost anything else related to schools. The timeframe within which the technology becomes outdated, as we all know, is extremely short. 
   So this amendment is simply designed to acknowledge that fact--to acknowledge the fact that schools desperately need this technology and all of the equipment associated with it. They need to have the assurance that once they have acquired this technology, they are going to continue to get it in the future. This relatively minor tax incentive, from the perspective of a budgetary impact, will have profound consequences with respect to its effect on companies and the incentive it will create, and with its effect on what can happen in schools if we pass it. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Senators WYDEN, BAUCUS, ABRAHAM, and others for their effort to make this issue the prominent one it is with this debate on  how we might improve our educational opportunities. As I say, I think that as we look at the next 10 or 20 years, one of the biggest challenges schools are going to face--whether they are rural or urban, private or public--will be the insurmountable task of technology acquisition. I do hope they can overcome the fiscal challenges they all face. Whether or not they do, in part, will be dependent upon whether or not something as simple as this can be passed, creating an incentive that will ultimately provide companies with more reasons to support schools in their effort to acquire technology. 
   That is what this amendment is all about. It deserves our support. I am sure it will have our support, and I am sure it may not be the last word on what it is we need to do with regard to technology acquisition. But it is a good beginning. I applaud my colleagues--especially Senators WYDEN and BAUCUS--for all their efforts in bringing it to this point. I urge its passage. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to speak briefly on a matter we will probably have the opportunity to discuss in greater detail at a later time. That has to do with the nomination of Bradley Smith to be a Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. 
   The President has made this nomination with the greatest reluctance. He delayed it for many months while fending off hard lobbying on behalf of Mr. Smith by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   In the end, the President forwarded this nomination to us, acknowledging the Republican leadership's strongly held view that, under standard practice for FEC appointments, each party is entitled to have the President nominate its choice for a Commission seat allocated by law to that party. 
   I understand the President's decision. He did what he believes that he, as President, was required to do, notwithstanding his concerns about the suitability of Mr. Smith. 
   Now we, as Senators, must do what we are required to do by the Constitution--to consider this nomination on the merits. 
   I have examined the candidacy of Mr. Smith carefully, guided by only one question--indeed the only question that should guide us: Is he qualified, as Commissioner of the FEC, to enforce the laws we have passed to control federal campaign fundraising and spending? 
   In my view, Mr. Smith's complete disdain for federal election law renders him unqualified for the role of an FEC Commissioner, whose principal job is to administer the Federal Election Campaign Act as enacted by Congress and upheld by the courts. 
   Madan President, the American people must be able to trust that we, as legislators, mean what we say when we write the laws of the land. They should not fear that we are passing laws professing the noblest motives, while actively working against those laws by whatever means we can find. 
   Nowhere is there a more critical need for this consistency of purpose than in our consideration, enactment and oversight of laws governing campaign finance. 
   We are, after all, candidates, and also party leaders, directly affected, in our own campaigns and political activities, by the operation of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Few laws that we pass as elected officials more acutely raise the spector of conflict of interest--that we might structure rules and encourage enforcement policies designed more to serve our own interests than the public interest. 
   Why would the public not be suspicious, observing our failure session-after-session to enact comprehensive campaign finance reform? 
   Now our Republican colleagues would like the Senate to confirm Mr. Smith. He comes to them highly recommended by those who would oppose meaningful controls on campaign finance. And he has earned the respect of those in the forefront of the fight against reform. 
   Why? 
   Because he believes that ``the most sensible reform . . . is repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act.'' Because he believes that most of the problems we have faced in controlling political money have been ``exacerbated or created by the Federal Election Campaign Act.'' Because he believes that the federal election law is ``profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the First Amendment.'' And because--and I quote again--``people should be allowed to spend whatever they want.'' 
   This is the man our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like us to seat on the Federal Election Commission, charged with the enforcement of the very laws he believes are undemocratic and should be repealed. 
   This is not just asking the fox to guard the chicken coop. It is inviting the fox inside and locking the door behind him. 
   What would be better calculated to promote and spread public cynicism about our commitment to campaign finance reform--indeed, cynicism about our commitment to responsible enforcement of the law already on the books--than confirmation of this nominee? 
   In considering this nomination, we are bound by the law we passed that speaks specifically to the qualifications required of an FEC Commissioner. That law states that Commissioners should be ``chosen on the basis of their experience, integrity, impartiality and good judgment.'' 
   Certainly a fair, and in my view fatal, objection could be raised to the Smith nomination on the grounds that he lacks the prerequisite quality of ``impartiality.'' He would be asked, as a Commissioner, to apply the law evenhandedly, in accord with our intent, without regard to his own opinions about the wisdom of the legislative choice we have made. Yet Mr. Smith has made his academic and journalistic reputation out of questioning that choice. 
   How will he reconcile that conflict, between his strongly held views and ours, in the often difficult cases the FEC must decide? When the Commission must enforce our contribution and spending limits, what degree of impartiality can be expected of a Commissioner who believes, in his words, that ``people should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics''? 
   I am concerned, too, about the requirement of judgment. For Mr. Smith has insisted for years that the Federal campaign finance laws are an offense against the First Amendment of the Constitution, undemocratic and in need of repeal. The Supreme Court has held in clear terms to the contrary. 
   Perhaps Mr. Smith imagined that the Court's jurisprudence had changed. If so, he is seriously mistaken, as made plain by the Court's decision only weeks ago in the Shrink Missouri PAC decision effectively to affirm Buckley v. Valeo. 
   A commissioner who neither understands nor acknowledges the constitutional law of the land is poorly equipped to balance real First Amendment guarantees against real Congressional authority to limit campaign spending in the public interest. This is particularly true where he questions our laws, not merely on constitutional grounds, but on the sweeping claim that they are undemocratic. 
   Mr. Smith is an energetic advocate for his views. We can respect his wish to express those views, and some indeed may agree with them. But this nomination places at issue whether he is the proper choice to act not as warrior in his own cause, but as agent of the public, as a faithful, impartial administrator of the law. 
   I must conclude that he is not the right choice, not even close, and so I will oppose that nomination, and I will vote against confirmation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be brief. 
   I come to the floor for just a couple of moments to express my sincere regret that we have not been able to come together to resolve the outstanding differences that are represented today in the debate and will be represented in the final outcome of the vote. 
   I give great credit to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator BINGAMAN, and to our colleagues, both from Alaska and Nevada, for the effort that has been made to try to reach some accommodation. 
   Unfortunately, in part because of a lack of willingness on the part of some of our Republican colleagues to come to the middle, we have lost a golden opportunity to finally resolve this matter once and for all. 
   The administration has indicated it will veto this bill in its current form. The EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and others, have expressed vehement opposition. Environmental groups, both liberal and conservative, the energy utility companies, oftentimes in favor of this legislation, in many cases today have come out in opposition to this bill, in part because of the failure to reach some compromise, and in part because this situation now makes their lives even more complicated and more difficult than it was before. Furthermore, there is deep concern that this bill undermines EPA's ability to protect the American public by delaying its authority to issue a radiation safety standard until 2001. 
   Instead of streamlining the process of moving nuclear waste to Nevada, this bill has complicated it even more. And, it fails to relieve American taxpayers of the extraordinary liability they face due to the failure to establish a long-term storage site. As a result, we have no choice but to continue to oppose the legislation in its current form. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in opposition to this bill. Maybe in conference we can work it out. If we can, maybe we can come to the floor at another date, with another opportunity to see if we cannot successfully resolve these outstanding problems. But today that has not happened. 
   Today, Senator BINGAMAN and others have expressed their regret and their opposition. We simply cannot allow a bad bill to pass and be signed into law. This is the one opportunity we will have to do it right. We have to do it right before it is signed into law. The President has insisted on that. I think it is incumbent on us to insist on that. I think the American people expect no less. 
   Mr. President, in just a short while we will have the opportunity to vote. It is my sincere hope that a large number of colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, will join us in saying: No. We have not done the job yet. Until we do it right, our vote will remain no. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last several days the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator MURKOWSKI, and the Ranking Member, Senator BINGAMAN, have been working to come to an agreement on legislation to resolve how our nation will provide long-term storage for deadly nuclear waste that is currently stockpiled near nuclear reactors around the country. 
   Despite many hours of hard work, an agreement was not reached. The legislation before the Senate today will not ensure the safety of the American public or deal with the critical issues of liability that first led us to consider this legislation. 
   I would like to take a few moments this morning to explain why I will be opposing the substitute amendment to S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Amendments Act of 2000. 
   As Senator BINGAMAN explained last night, this legislation was proposed because the federal government was unable to meet its obligation under the law to provide a long-term storage site for nuclear waste. In 1982, Congress directed the Department of Energy to begin accepting waste at a long-term storage site by 1998. This deadline has not been met, and as a result, the taxpayers are facing billions of dollars in potential liability.  
   Originally, this bill would have allowed the Department to settle these lawsuits by taking title to the waste in its current sites pending completion of a long-term storage facility. This provision has now been removed from the bill. As a result, this legislation does nothing to relieve the taxpayers of the enormous bill they may have to foot. 
   I am also deeply concerned by steps taken in the bill to undermine the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to set radiation safety standards. EPA has currently proposed tough but reasonable standards to protect groundwater and those living in the area. These standards are consistent with a report of the National Academy of Sciences issued in 1995. 
   However, this legislation prevents EPA from issuing final standards until June 1, 2001. The clear expectation underlying this provision is that a new president will be in office who will support weaker standards than those currently proposed. 
   Mr. President, it is unacceptable to gamble with the health of Americans who will be living near the long-term storage site. It is very likely that waste will be stored at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Nearby, there is a dairy farm and fields of crops that use groundwater for irrigation. If we do not support tough safety standards, there is a chance that radiation in the groundwater will end up in the water used in these farms and for drinking by those who live there, putting public health at risk. 
   Finally, I am concerned about an enormous potential write-off for nuclear utilities in this bill. Currently, utilities pay into a Nuclear Waste Fund to ensure that the Department of Energy has the resources it needs to pay for long-term storage. This bill caps the amount that must be paid by utilities, setting up the taxpayer to fund whatever costs remain. 
   We need to do a better job of protecting the safety of the American public and the taxpayers from the bottomless liability that may result from this legislation. For these reasons, I will oppose this bill. 
   Finally, I want to thank Senator BINGAMAN for his hard work on this issue, and Senators REID and BRYAN. While this bill today is not yet satisfactory, it is significantly better than those we have seen in the past. It is largely thanks to the efforts of these Senators that these changes have been made.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Illinois in bringing Members to the floor for a colloquy of this import as we consider the extraordinary implications of this budget. 
   I was disappointed this morning to read in one of the newspapers some of our Republican colleagues have already pronounced this budget dead on arrival. What is there not to like about this budget? This is a budget that protects the Social Security surplus, a budget that ensures we protect the non-Social Security surplus for other commitments we may want to make in tax cuts or in dedicated investments, a budget that ensures the solvency of the Social Security trust fund through the year 2050 and Medicare through 2025, a budget that understands, as the Senator from Illinois said, there is a prudent middle-center approach that recognizes the importance of ensuring the tremendous strides we have made in reining in Government and doing what we must to make the efficiency of the Government our task. All this is in this budget, and we are told it is dead on arrival. 
   I am somewhat stunned and disappointed that some of our colleagues, who I am sure have not thought through the implications of their statement, would comment without a more careful consideration of the extraordinary impact that this budget could have if we pursued it this year. 
   I thank the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. DASCHLE. In answer to the Senator from New York, I have to say no. What a contrast from the 1980s when we made the huge cuts in taxes and then ran up the huge trillions of dollars in a deficit we are still trying to pay off today. What a remarkable contrast this is. This recognizes the importance of fiscal responsibility. First and foremost, it says we have made some tremendous strides in our budgetary and fiscal policy in the last 7 years. This will build on it. 
   It is no accident today that we are seeing the economic achievement in this country with the fiscal and monetary policy. This says we want to build on that, we want to continue in this coming decade what we have pursued in the last decade: We have the lowest number of Federal employees since 1962, with the lowest percentage of spending for GDP since 1967. We recognize we can do a lot more with a lot less. We recognize we can still target tax cuts to the middle class. We recognize the importance of education by providing the largest single Head Start expansion in history in this budget. 
   How remarkable it is in this budget we are able to keep our current services at below the cost of inflation in the coming year and still provide the largest Head Start expansion in history 
   or deal with child care by providing low-income families with more affordable child care than they ever had in any other budget. 
   You can look all the way down the list of opportunities this budget presents: Helping working families with greater EITC, helping working families with greater opportunities for college through deductibility, helping working families by providing safer communities. This is a budget of which we can be proud. It builds on what we have already done. Are there going to be naysayers? Of course. There always are. We have overcome them for 7 years. We will have to do it again. 
   But it is here. I ask my colleagues to look at it. My colleague from New York asked exactly the right question:  Is this a balanced budget? By any definition of that word, this is a balanced budget.

   Mr. DASCHLE. It was so hard that there are some colleagues who are no longer here because they paid the price. Before we could see the results, of course, there were some across the country who made a judgment about the prudence of their very difficult decisions in 1993 and chose not to send them back to Washington. They paid the ultimate political price so we could enjoy the fiscal glory we are enjoying today. 
   I can recall so vividly talking to some of my colleagues who, up until the very last moment, weighed whether this was the right thing to do. Only in the last few moments they made the decision to take the chance. But this was in the face of tremendous opposition, vocal opposition from the other side, projecting recessions and unemployment and extraordinary fiscal repercussions that we would feel for perhaps the rest of our professional lives. There were warnings, extraordinary in their scope and depth and visceral disgust, for what we were attempting to do. 
   It was an overpowering moment, to see the Vice President cast that tie-breaking vote to give us the opportunity to put this budget on the fiscal path, a moment that we now look back on with great pride. What remarkable opportunities it presented. Twenty million new jobs--how do you put a value on that? We have an economy that has taken the stock market to heights we never dreamed. We have more homeowners than at any time in our history; two out of every three people have their own homes today, in large measure because of our fiscal responsibility and the incredible success we have enjoyed. I would say these did not come easy. 
   Maybe the fight this year will not be in any way near the proportions or depth of feeling as when it was fought out on the floor of the Senate back in 1993. But it has the same repercussions. How fragile this all is. How easy it would be to go back and cast our votes for a huge tax cut that would destroy all of this in one fell swoop. It could happen again. If we don't understand the repercussions of a tax cut by now, it could happen again. 
   I urge my colleagues to read this budget, to think carefully about what it is we have been able to do and how we have been able to do it, and make absolutely certain, before we depart from a blueprint that I think demonstrates remarkable balance, that we think long and hard about alternatives. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the question proposed by the Senator from California.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week I joined several of my Democratic colleagues at a hearing on the agriculture crisis that is forcing many family farmers out of operation. We heard a number of witnesses tell compelling stories about how the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' Act has failed them and their communities. 
   Lori Hintz, a registered nurse and farm wife, talked about the impact of the '96 farm bill on her community in Beadle County, South Dakota. She emphasized that farmers are not the only ones in her area that are struggling. 
   When farm prices are depressed in a rural community--like they are in Lori's--small businesses, health clinics and schools also feel the pinch. Lori spoke eloquently about the urgent need to invest in rural communities and promote a healthy farm economy, thereby reducing out-migration and preserving the way of life that built and still defines the Midwest. 
   I believe I speak for all Democratic Senators who participated in last week's hearing when I say that the testimony presented by each witness was both powerful and thought-provoking. That testimony only strengthened our determination to address the agriculture crisis facing this country. 
   Few people have a better appreciation for the problems confronting our family farmers, and for what we in the Senate need to do to fix those problems, than my close friend and colleague, Senator BYRON DORGAN. Senator DORGAN has stood throughout his public career as an effective and tireless advocate for America's family farmers and ranchers, and his perspective on the economic difficulties felt by many rural residents merits the undivided attention of policymakers in Congress and the Administration. 
   Today, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Senator DORGAN for an article published in a recent edition of the Washington Monthly that presents a poignant and persuasive argument for the family farm. I commend this article, entitled ``Don't Be Down on the Farm,'' to my colleagues' attention. 
   Senator DORGAN knows this topic as well as anyone. We have all learned from Senator DORGAN's entreaties, many of which have been delivered in this chamber, about the economic challenges facing the people to whom we entrust the safe and abundant production of our nation's food and fiber supply. We have listened to Senator DORGAN's impassioned oratory about conditions in rural North Dakota, and how the economic survival of many communities in his state depends on successful family farms. His words resonate deeply in me, because they often evoke similar scenarios in my state. 
   In his article, Senator DORGAN makes a number of important observations--things we know to be true, but that too often are recklessly discounted in the crafting of farm policy. He reminds us of the proven efficiency of family farms, and how viable family farms translate into robust, successful communities. He also asks a question to which we still have not received a persuasive answer. What does society gain by replacing family farms with corporate farming operations? 
   Senator DORGAN also reminds us of the social costs that we may all have to bear for the emergence of corporate agriculture, including the challenge of waste disposal, the threat of related environmental degradation and the loss of a valued way of life. 
   Finally, Senator DORGAN asks whether we will take steps necessary to ensure the survival of family farms and ranches for the future. That is a question of interest to many members in this chamber, and one to which we simply must find the right answer. 
   The eloquence and urgency of Senator DORGAN's message reinforces the views of the many Senators who want to secure a strong future for our country's family farms. I appreciate both the effort and conviction evident in the article, and thank Senator DORGAN for his commitment to this vital issue.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to express my whole-hearted support for S. 1052, the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act, which the Senate considered and passed on Monday, and to recognize Senator AKAKA, Energy Committee Chairman MURKOWSKI, and Ranking Senator BINGAMAN for their determined efforts to shepard this bill through the Senate. During the recent recess, I had the opportunity to travel with Senator AKAKA to South Asia. Once again, I was reminded why Senator AKAKA is one of the most respected members of the Senate. As we met with leaders from India and Pakistan, Senator AKAKA's humanitarian focus was evident time and again. Yesterday, Senator AKAKA's concern for those without wealth and privilege was on display once more. I wish I could have been here, yesterday, to celebrate his legislative victory. 
   Senator AKAKA's special interest in the welfare of the residents of the Northern Mariana Islands dates back to WW II when he served with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and spent time on both Saipan and Tinian. In 1996, he and Senator MURKOWSKI traveled to the Commonwealth to investigate reports of the horrible working conditions first hand. Senator AKAKA returned with confirmation of those reports and worked quickly to introduce legislation, with Chairman MURKOWSKI, to improve the often horrific conditions faced by alien workers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Since then, Senator AKAKA has come to the floor repeatedly to draw attention to this problem and he has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to build effective bipartisan support for this measure. Senator AKAKA's  dedication to this issue reminds us that our work here is not confined to the headline grabbing issues of the day but extends to the quiet pursuit of humane working conditions everywhere.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a couple of days ago marked the longest economic expansion in U.S. history: 107 months. Alan Greenspan deserves credit for coordinating closely with the administration foster that growth. 
   Mr. Greespan has been described as a master of the art of monetary policy. He has certainly learned and grown in office. His renomination deserves our full support. 
   President Clinton renominated Chairman Greenspan for two reasons: Our unprecedented record of economic success; and his ability to coordinate Fed monetary policy with our fiscal policy. 
   Those two reasons are, in fact, inseparable. It is the marriage of fiscal and monetary policy that created and has sustained current economic expansion. This successful working partnership has worked despite his being a lifelong Republican--though we would gladly welcome him as a Democrat. 
   The best illustration of Mr. Greenspan's ability to coordinate closely with administration is the 1993 economic plan. Mr. Greenspan signaled that if the new President attacked the deficit aggressively, it would produce lower interest rates. The President followed that advice. A Democratic Congress passed that plan. 
   As a result, we have gone from the biggest budget deficits in U.S. history to the biggest surplus. Largely as a result of the 1993 economic plan, we now have the lowest interest rates since WWII. We have created more than 20 million new jobs. Unemployment is at the lowest level in 30 years. The poverty rate is the lowest in two decades. Homeownership is at an all-time high. Real wages have grown faster and longer than at any time in more than two decades. 
   What is most remarkable is that we have achieved all of this while keeping inflation under control: 2.7% inflation last year. It used to be an article of faith among many conservative economists that you had to have at least 6% unemployment or you would trigger inflation. Chairman Greesnpan had the courage to challenge that orthodoxy and prove it wrong. The result is millions of people are working today who would not have had jobs under the old rules. 
   He has done so without sacrificing his commitment to taming inflation and has succeeded in maintaining record low inflation. 
   We should confirm Chairman Greenspan for a fourth term as Fed Chairman. We should also continue to uphold our end of the partnership. We have confidence Chairman Greenspan will continue to exercise strong monetary leadership. We should commit ourselves to continuing to exercise strong fiscal discipline. 
   People sometimes find Chairman Greenspan's messages a little difficult to decipher. They tend to look for shades of meaning in his statements. But on the question of our national debt, he has been absolutely clear and unequivocal. He has said over and over: We must pay down the debt. Huge new tax cuts or excessive Government spending could destroy our prosperity. He could not be clearer on that point. 
   We need to listen to Chairman Greenspan. Many inside this Congress--and outside--are now seizing on new surplus estimates from the Congressional Budget Office to justify massive new tax breaks. Their plans stand in direct contradiction to Chairman Greenspan's advice to us. Their plans represent a total abdication of the fiscal discipline that has helped get us to this point. 
   Our best first use of the surplus is not to pay for an election-year tax cut. It is to pay down the debt. That will enable us to protect this economic recovery today and protect Social Security and Medicare tomorrow. 
   We support tax cuts to help working families with real, pressing needs like child care and college tuition. We support tax cuts to help working families care for sick and aging relatives. We support eliminating the marriage penalty tax. 
   The American people have made it clear that these are the kinds of tax cuts we should aim for: tax cuts that expand our prosperity, not undermine it; that help all Americans, not just a privileged few. We should listen to them. But we also share Mr. Greenspan's view that the best tax cut for America's families and businesses is to pay down the debt. This year because of the progress we have made since 1993 in eliminating the deficit and reducing the debt, the average American family will save: $2,000 on its mortgage; $200 on its car loan; and $200 more on student loans. 
   Shortly after it was clear the Asian ``flu''--the Asian monetary crisis--had been successfully contained, Time magazine ran a cover story. The picture on the cover showed Alan Greenspan and, standing behind him, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers. The headline read: ``The Committee that Saved the World: The inside story of how the Three Marketeers *.*.* prevented a global economic meltdown.'' 
   That is strong praise and it is deserved. Chairman Greenspan, working with this Administration, has earned our vote of confidence. I am proud to cast my vote in support of is renomination. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased that this nomination is before us, and I am hopeful that we will see an overwhelming vote in favor of Alan Greenspan this morning. We have made remarkable progress in this economy and in our country, in large measure because of the marriage between fiscal and monetary policy. 
   That monetary policy was created because of the leadership of Chairman Greenspan. He has been a leader not only in creating monetary policy but in setting the tone for this country as we make some difficult choices in our fiscal policy. 
   He has said to all of us we need to be very prudent in making decisions about how we spend our surplus, about how we manage our budget, about the commitments we make to tax cuts we cannot afford, about the importance of paying off the debt and bringing long-lasting fiscal responsibility by eliminating the public debt. 
   That kind of advice is advice we all ought to take. It is the kind of advice that has given us the longest economic expansion in history. It is an expansion that ought to be continued for years and years to come. It will if we follow the advice of Alan Greenspan. It will if we keep this marriage of fiscal and monetary policy. It will if we pay off the debt and do what we should to ensure the fiscal prudence we have demonstrated in our budgets over the last couple of years. 
   I very enthusiastically endorse this nomination and hope that on a bipartisan basis we can provide the kind of vote of confidence this Chairman deserves. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to correct an inadvertent but significant error in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of November 19, 1999, the last day of the first session of this Congress. It concerns a statement submitted for the RECORD by Senator LOTT (145 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD S15048) regarding the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, which was passed as part of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. The statement erroneously was attributed to both Senator LOTT and me. In fact, the statement did not then and does not now reflect my understanding of the Superfund recycling amendments. 
   I make this clarification at the earliest opportunity, in order to minimize the possibility of any mistaken reliance on the statement as the consensus view of two original cosponsors, particularly with respect to the availability of relief in pending cases. It is not. 
   The recycling amendments were passed as part of the end of year appropriations process and did not have the benefit of hearings, debates, or substantive committee consideration during the 106th legislative session. Thus, there is no conference report, and there are no committee reports or hearing transcripts, to guide interpretation of the bill. 
   However, much, though not all, of the language in the recycling amendments originated in the 103d Congress. At that time, key stakeholders, including EPA, members of the environmental community and the recycling industry, agreed on recycling provisions as part of efforts to pass a comprehensive Superfund reform bill. Although Superfund reform legislation did not reach the floor in the 103d Congress, it was reported by the major Committees of jurisdiction in both the Senate (S. 1834) and the House with bi-partisan support. In reporting these bills in the 103d Congress, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Public Works and Transportation Committee each produced reports that include discussions of the recycling provisions. 
   Since the recycling provisions of S. 1834 were identical in most respects to the Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999, and the meaning of key provisions of that bill were actively considered and discussed, the Senate Committee Report contains probably the best description of the consensus on the meaning of those provisions. 
   To the extent the Committee Report does not address a particular provision of the recycling amendments, the Committee may very well have chosen to be silent on the point. With respect to such provisions, the ``plain language'' of the statute must be our guide.  
   I am proud of our accomplishment in finally passing the Superfund Recycling Equity Act with broad bi-partisan support. This could not have happened without the hard work and cooperation of Senator LOTT. And the significance of this accomplishment is by no means compromised by the absence of agreement on any legislative history. As usual, it will be for the courts to resolve questions of interpretation on a case-by-case basis, applying the bill to a wide range of potential factual situations. 
   I again thank the distinguished majority leader for his work on this bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we just received word that Floyd M. Riddick, the Parliamentarian Emeritus of the Senate, passed away yesterday. As many of our colleagues may recall, Floyd M. Riddick was the Senate Parliamentarian from 1964 to 1974. 
   He was a parliamentarian of extraordinary depth and value. In 1954, under the supervision of then-Parliamentarian Charles L. Watkins, he began working on the first edition of ``Senate Procedure.'' The Senate procedure book that came as a result of his work now bears his name. 
   I think that says everything about the impact and the remarkable contribution Floyd Riddick has made to the Senate, to the way we continue to legislate, and certainly to the contribution he made in his time in public life. 
   Floyd Riddick received a Ph.D. from Duke University in 1941. His dissertation was on congressional procedure, and he began work for the Senate in 1947, being the very first to publish a Daily Digest, which we all use every day from the back of the Congressional RECORD. 
   Doc Riddick, as he was often referred to, was born in Trotville, NC, on July 13, 1908. As Senator BYRD has noted in his foreword to the current edition of ``Senate Procedure,'' he was truly a unique scholar. 
   His contributions to the Senate will be utilized, as they have been utilized and valued, by future generations of Senators and staff who have not yet even been born. 
   Floyd Riddick made his mark on the Senate, on Congress, and on history for the publication of ``Riddick's Senate Procedure.'' 
   I know I speak for all of my colleagues and all of our staff in expressing heartfelt condolences to his wife Margo, to his friends, and his family.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week, to my regret, my good friend, Senator BOB KERREY, announced that he will be leaving this Senate at the end of this year to return to private life. I'm sure my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will agree that his decision is a loss not only to Nebraskans, and to the Democratic party, but to the entire Senate. 
   Over the years, Senator KERREY has made us all laugh. More importantly, he has made us all think. He has challenged us to face the big questions of our time and to reach across party lines to find solutions. 
   It has been said that some people seek public office to be someone; others seek office to do something. Clearly, BOB KERREY is of the ``do something'' school. 
   Before he ever came to the Senate, he had achieved more than almost anyone I know. A pharmacist by training, he has also been a Navy SEAL, a decorated war hero, a successful entrepreneur, and a popular governor--all by the time he was 44 years old. 
   Perhaps even more impressive than his professional accomplishments, however, are his personal achievements. 
   As we all know much of the story. BOB KERREY was nearly killed 30 years ago in Vietnam. On a moonless night, while he was leading a surprise attack on North Vietnamese snipers, an enemy grenade exploded on the ground beside him, shattering his right leg, badly wounding his right hand, and piercing much of his body with shrapnel. Days later, doctors were focused to amputate his injured leg just below the knee. 
   For his sacrifice, Lieutenant KERREY was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the highest award our nation bestows for bravery, the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   He returned from Vietnam angry and disillusioned. What he endured in Vietnam, and what he saw later at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital, where he spent nine months learning how to walk again, shook his faith--both in the war, and in the government that had sent him to it. It forced him to re-  examine everything he had ever believed about his country. But slowly, out of his pain and anger and doubt, he began to acquire a new faith in this nation. 
   Years ago, when he was Governor of Nebraska, he described that faith to a reporter. He said, ``There are ..... people who like to say, `You know all these subsidy programs we've got? They make people lazy.' And I like to jump right in their face and say, that is an absolute lie.'' Government help ``didn't make me lazy. It made me grateful.'' 
   It was the United States Government, he said, that fitted him with a prosthesis and taught him to walk again. It was the government that paid for the countless operations he needed. 
   Later, it was the government that helped him open his first restaurant with his brother-in-law. And when that restaurant was destroyed in a tornado, it was the government--the people of the United States--that loaned them the money to rebuild. 
   For 4 years as Nebraska's Governor, and for the last 11 years as a Member of this Senate, BOB KERREY has fought to make sure the people of the United States, through their government, work for all Americans. 
   He has fought to make health care more affordable and accessible. He has fought to give entrepreneurs the chance to turn their good ideas into profitable businesses. He has fought to make sure this Nation keeps its promises to veterans. 
   He has fought tirelessly to preserve family farms and rural communities. As someone, like Senator KERREY, who comes from a state that is made up mostly of small towns and rural communities, I am personally grateful to him for his insistence that rural America be treated fairly. 
   But Senator KERREY's greatest contribution to this Senate, and to this nation, may be the fact that he is not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. 
   In 1994, almost singlehandedly, he created and chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. Conventional wisdom said, don't get involved with entitlements. You can't make anyone happy; you can only make enemies. But BOB KERREY's personal experience told him that preserving Social Security and Medicare was worth taking a political risk. 
   He has repeatedy opposed efforts to amend our Constitution to make flag-burning a crime. It is politically risky, even for a wounded war hero, to take such a position. But Senator KERREY has taken that risk, time and time again, because--in his words, ``America is a beacon of hope for the people of this world who yearn for freedom from the despotism of repressive government. This hope is diluted when we advise others that we are frightened by flag burning.'' 
   He is a genuine patriot, and a genuine American hero. 
   There is a story Senator KERREY has told many times about a conversation he had with his mother 30 years ago. Doctors at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital had just amputated his leg. When he awoke from surgery, his mother was standing at his bedside. ``How much is left?'' he asked her. His mother responded, ``There's a lot left.'' As Senator KERREY says, ``She wasn't talking about body parts. She was talking about here.'' She was talking about what was in his heart. 
   He has said that he would like to focus now on his private life. As much as I regret his decision, I respect it. Public life offers great regards, but it also makes great demands--on the officeholder, and on his or her family. 
   The only consolation in seeing BOB KERREY leave this Senate will be watching what he does next with his remarkable life. There is still a lot left. I have no doubt he will continue to contribute in significant ways to our Nation. And until he goes, we will continue to look to him for unorthodox solutions and uncommon courage. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me again welcome our colleagues back. I had the opportunity this morning to discuss the schedule and the many mutual matters of concern with the majority leader. Let me again welcome back our staff and express heartfelt appreciation for the great job that so many of our people have done over the last couple of months while we have been gone. I welcome our colleagues back not only to a new session but a new year, a new century, and a new millennium. 
   As we begin this new year, Americans have every reason to be proud and optimistic. In the last decade of the last century, we saw freedom and democracy triumph around the globe. We saw Eastern Europe abandon communism and the Soviet Union disintegrate. We saw Nelson Mandela walk out of prison and into history as the first democratically elected President of the new South Africa. 
   Here at home we restored strength to America's economy. We started the last decade with the biggest budget deficits in our Nation's history, and we ended it with the biggest budget surplus. We have seen more than 20 million new jobs created in the last 7 years. Today we have the lowest unemployment in 40 years, and the lowest unemployment ever among African Americans and Hispanics. Americans are working again. 
   Finally, after 20 years, real wages for America's families are growing again. Family incomes are up, and inflation is virtually nonexistent. 
   We also made progress in the last decade on the many social problems that some people thought were intractable. Since 1993, we have seen a 48-percent decrease in the welfare rolls, the largest decline in our Nation's history. We put 100,000 new police officers on the street, and today the violent crime rate is the lowest it has been in a generation. We enacted the single largest investment in children's health since 1965 and the largest increases in higher education since the GI bill. Today our Nation is prospering, and we are at peace. 
   The question facing us as we begin this new session of Congress, this first session of the 21st century, is: How do we keep America moving in the right direction? How do we provide the leadership that will help continue the global march toward freedom and democracy? 
   Here at home, how do we keep our economy growing? How do we help ordinary Americans provide for their families and prepare for their future? How do we widen the circle of opportunity to include those who have been left out up until now? 
   There are many, frankly, who believe we will not answer those questions this year. They look at how little we accomplished last year and the fact that this is a Presidential year and conclude that little or nothing will happen between now and November. It does not have to be that way. 
   A month ago, a lot of people thought the Y2K bug might cause all kinds of chaos. Instead, almost nothing happened. When it comes to us, when it comes to this Congress, people expect nothing to happen this year. Why not surprise them? We have extraordinary opportunities to do significant work this year, and we should work together to seize those opportunities. 
   Let's not worry about who gets the credit. Let's worry about getting the job done. 
   If the best minds in this country could work together to kill the Y2K bug, surely the best minds in the Senate can work 
    together this year to protect Social Security, to modernize Medicare, and to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We can work together to improve our children's schools. Working together, surely we can find new ways to help ordinary working families earn more and keep more of what they earn. 
   There are all kinds of reasons for inaction, but there is not one good excuse. Henry Ford once said, ``You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.'' 
   You cannot construct much of an argument for governing either just talking about what you are going to do. Eventually, one has to act. 
   I believe there are essentially three challenges facing us this year. If we meet these challenges, I believe, frankly, that it will be good for both of our parties next November. Good policy, as they say, is good politics. 
   More importantly, if we meet these challenges, it will be good for America, for our economy, for our families, and certainly for our future. 
   Our first challenge is to maintain our fiscal discipline. Later this week, we expect new estimates from CBO and OMB about how large the surplus might be in the year 2010. We do not know today what their predictions will be, but we do know today that the best first use of whatever surplus we have is to protect Social Security and strengthen Medicare. 
   Now--when our economy is strong, when we have a surplus, when we still have time on our side--is the time to prepare for the baby boomers' retirement by extending the life of the Social Security trust fund. Now is the time to modernize Medicare and add the prescription drug benefit so people do not have to choose between filling prescriptions and paying utility bills. That is an essential part of maintaining fiscal discipline. 
   Maintaining fiscal discipline also means paying down our $5 trillion national debt. Mr. President, $2,200 is how much our national debt will cost every family in America this year. Think what a family could do with that much money. 
   My colleagues and I support tax cuts that help working families with real, pressing needs such as child care and paying for college and caring for sick and aging relatives. We support eliminating the marriage penalty tax for couples who pay a marriage penalty. We support tax cuts that help small businesses grow and make it easier to keep family businesses in families. 
   We want to work with our friends on the other side of the aisle to pass responsible, targeted tax cuts this year, but we all know what the best tax cut is. The best tax cut for America's families and America's businesses is to pay down the Federal debt. 
   This year, because of the progress we have made since 1993 in eliminating the deficit and reducing the debt, the average American family will save $2,000 on  their mortgage, $200 on their car loan, and $200 more on student loans. 
   The American people made it clear last year they do not want a tax cut that is so big it wrecks the economy. They do not want a tax cut that is going to explode in a few years and add to our debt. They do not want a tax cut that disproportionately rewards the people at the very top at the expense of everyone else. What they want is for us to maintain our commitment to fiscal discipline and to Social Security and Medicare. 
   Our second challenge is to expand our economic recovery, not just sustain it, but to broaden and deepen it to include more families and more communities. 
   These are extraordinarily good times for many Americans, but too many families in this country are still struggling to afford even the basics. 
   Too many children go to bed hungry. Too many Americans still live on the outskirts of hope. The people who have been left out of this recovery include some of the hardest working, most decent people you would ever want to meet. 
   They include working mothers who get up before it is light and take three buses to get to their jobs at nursing homes. They include former factory workers who lost their economic footing when the plant closed, who work now at jobs that pay one-third as much, with no benefits. 
   They include farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the country who work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, who are out there right now in the bitter cold and snow, not even making back their production costs, earning less than their parents and grandparents earned in the Great Depression. 
   Throughout our history, from our earliest days as a nation, Americans have always strived to do better. We did not stop when we cured polio. We said: Now let's cure cancer. 
   Next week, we will become the first Americans ever to achieve 107 consecutive months of economic expansion. Surely we will not be the first Americans to say: This is all we can do. We have reached the end of our possibilities. 
   Let us together expand this recovery. 
   Our third challenge this year is to finish what we left unfinished last year. We need to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights that lets medical professionals, not HMO bureaucrats, make medical decisions. Senator LOTT and I discussed that just this morning. I do hope there is a real possibility for compromise and ultimately for the successful completion of our work on a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We need to increase the number of Americans with private health coverage. We need to help communities repair schools that are falling down and expand schools that are filled beyond capacity. 
   We also need to help communities hire qualified teachers and keep the good teachers who are already in the classroom. It is the only way we can fill the 2.2 million teacher vacancies we know will exist within the next 10 years. 
   We need to keep the crime rates moving in the right direction by making it harder for kids and criminals to get guns, keeping our commitment to put another 50,000 new police officers on the beat by the year 2005, and giving law enforcement the resources they need to combat hate crimes. 
   We need to keep crime rates moving in the right direction by cracking down on scam artists who target the elderly and by filling the vacancies on the Federal bench this year--no more excuses, no more delays. 
   Also this year, we need to make it easier for parents who work full time to raise their families out of poverty by raising the minimum wage $1 an hour and expanding the earned-income tax credit. 
   We need to pass meaningful, comprehensive campaign finance reform. 
   Finally, we need to continue opening up new markets for American goods and services by passing the Africa trade/Caribbean Basin free trade initiative this year. 
   So those three challenges ought to be ones we all share: 
   No. 1, maintain our fiscal discipline, protect Social Security and Medicare, and pay down the debt; 
   No. 2, expand the recovery to families and communities that have not yet benefited from it; and 
   No. 3, finish what we left unfinished last year. 
   In the weeks since we were together, I was fortunate to be able to spend a wonderful holiday with my family. I got to spend a lot of time in South Dakota. I talked with some remarkable people--from business and education leaders who are working together in Sioux Falls to try to keep up with the demand for high-tech workers, to family farmers and ranchers who are working practically around the clock to scratch out a living. 
   I talked to a farm wife who gets up at 4:30 in the morning and drives over 90 miles to get to Howard, SD, to work at the PMB plant there, as they wrap every Pokemon card that is distributed in the United States--right there in Howard, SD--only to drive another 90 miles back getting home, sometime after 7:30 at night, to do it all over again the next day. 
   That work ethic is representative of the work ethic all across South Dakota and the upper Midwest. 
   I had the privilege of traveling with Senators AKAKA, DODD, and HARRY REID to one of the most amazing, and troubled, regions of the world: India and Pakistan. We went to promote trade and understanding, but we also went to encourage both India and Pakistan to defuse the tensions between their nations and to step back from their increasingly tense nuclear arms race. I am hopeful we made some progress on both matters. 
   Being in those two nations reminded me again of how fortunate we Americans are. We talked to Tibetan refugees who fled Tibet over the 19,000-foot Himalayan Mountains, suffering the worst maladies in health, recognizing that 40 percent of them might have to deal with serious frostbite on their feet and hands by the time they arrived in Nepal--only to do it because they wanted to be free, only to do it because they, too, wanted to experience at least some element of democracy. 
   There is so much we as beneficiaries of democracy take for granted. I do not mean simply our material wealth and consumer comforts; I mean our most precious possession of all, our freedom. You recognize that every time you travel abroad, whether it is Pakistan, Nepal, India, or any other country. 
   India, the world's largest democracy, is now celebrating the 53rd anniversary of its independence this year and the 50th anniversary of its Constitution. Perhaps because democracy is still relatively young in India, perhaps because of the high price they paid for their liberty, the people I spoke with in India seemed very much aware of how rare and how fragile democracy is. 
   In Pakistan, we visited a country where a democratically elected government had only a few months before been toppled and replaced by a military ruler--another reminder of how privileged we are to live in the world's oldest and most secure democracy. 
   I am encouraged by my discussions with General Musharraf and very hopeful they can restore economic progress, restore democratic institutions, and can find a way with which to begin resolving the regional conflict that is so prevalent in all the conversations we had with leaders in both countries, India and Pakistan. 
   Democracies are not perpetual motion machines. As the great poet laureate Archibald MacLeish wrote:  
   America is never finished. America is always becoming.  
   Every American has a responsibility to make our democracy work. But we who have been granted the privilege of serving in this body have a unique responsibility. The Congress is no ordinary institution. This is where Americans come to solve our common problems and shape our national destiny. This is also where younger democracies of the world turn for guidance and where people and nations not yet free look for hope. That was so evident in our conversations with people in all the countries we visited on this too brief a visit to the subcontinent a couple of weeks ago. 
   Are we going to live up to our responsibility to make this institution work, as we know it can? Are we going to meet the challenges before us and pass measures that will make a real difference in people's lives or are we simply going to pass time until the next election?  
   As we begin this new session of Congress, let us resolve together to surprise everyone and do what needs to be done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last spring I joined my colleagues in honoring President Lyndon Baines Johnson when we hung a portrait of our former president on the one blank wall left in the President's Room in our nation's capitol. As I noted at that time, I could think of no other president or American who was as deserving of this honor as LBJ. 
   As the Senate Majority Leader and President, LBJ was a man of immense skill, dedication and compassion. He is remembered by most Americans as a great leader whose strength of personality helped him preside over an extremely productive Senate that expanded Social Security, created the Interstate Highway system, and passed one of the most important civil rights laws of the 20th Century. Less well known, however, is LBJ's tremendous ability to compromise. He truly believed in the message of his favorite Bible verse: ``Come, let us reason together.'' Our nation and our government needs more men and women who share this powerful belief. 
   Today, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues and all Americans another aspect of LBJ's legacy that too often has been overlooked--his work to bring justice to disen-  
   franchised ethnic minorities and to improve the lot of the large number of Americans suffering in unimaginable poverty. John Kenneth Galbraith, the noted economist and former presidential aide, recently highlighted LBJ's accomplishments in this area in an important speech at the LBJ library in Austin, Texas. 
   As Professor Galbraith noted, historians often view LBJ's administration in terms of its involvement in the Vietnam War. While we should never underestimate the impact that war had on our country, historians are remiss to view LBJ through this narrow prism. Those who do fail to acknowledge his meaningful and lasting accomplishments in expanding civil rights, protecting voting rights, and fighting poverty. These victories have forever changed the face of America for the better. 
   Professor Galbraith's speech is based on his personal and professional relationship with LBJ. It is a testament to LBJ's leadership and a tribute to the sometimes overlooked legacy of the Great Society. This speech is an important step towards setting the historical record straight and establishing a legacy of LBJ's Administration that is historically accurate as well as comprehensive.

I will make a full statement at a later time, but let me say for the record now, no one has served this committee, this caucus, and this Senate more effectively, taking his intelligence responsibility more seriously, than the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. He has been an extraordinary leader, an extraordinary Member, and one who has taken his responsibilities on this committee as seriously as anybody has to date. 
   He departs with the actions taken today. He will leave the committee as a result of the statute requiring a certain limit of time for each Senator. I know I speak for all Senators in expressing our gratitude to him and our admiration for a job very well done, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made by the distinguished majority leader. He noted that this is a matter of great import to many Senators, including those from the Northeast. They have made their position known, and I respect that position. 
   I have also indicated to them personally, and I have said publicly, that I do not support compacts. I do not support the Northeast Dairy Compact. I do not believe it is good economic policy. I think the process that allowed the Northeast Dairy Compact in H.R. 1402 to be inserted in the budget process was flawed and wrong and unfair. This isn't the way we ought to deal with complex and extraordinarily important economic policy affecting not hundreds or thousands but millions of rural Americans. 
   I oppose compacts in any form, but I especially oppose them when they are  loaded into a bill without the opportunity of a good debate, without the opportunity of votes, without the opportunity of amendment. 
   We will come back to this issue. We must revisit this question. We must find a way by which to assure that all views are taken into account, and all sections of the country are treated fairly. 
   In this case, the two Senators from Wisconsin in particular, and the Senators from Minnesota, WELLSTONE and GRAMS, were not treated fairly. I do not fault anybody. These things happen. Senator LOTT and I have to deal with a lot of different challenges and issues. He and I have admitted that we wished this could have been done differently. Those four Senators were not treated fairly. I applaud them for coming to the floor to express themselves, and to say in as emphatic a way as they can, as eloquently as they have, how important this matter is to them and how determined they are to see it resolved. 
   My hat is off to them. I thank them. I also thank them for their cooperation in working with us to come up with a way to resolve this. It is one thing to throw things and to stomp up and down and to cause all kinds of havoc. Anyone can do that. But it takes courage, it takes character, it takes class to say, look, in spite of the fact that we were not treated fairly, we are going to work with you to assure that people in other circumstances will be treated more fairly. I thank them for that. 
   Again, I appreciate the majority leader's comments in acknowledging the unfairness of this and ensuring that we will deal with it appropriately at a later date. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I have appreciated the hard work of the Majority Leader on this issue, and I am pleased that this legislation has been included as part of the omnibus appropriations bill. I hope that this provision will serve to achieve our goal of encouraging recycling. 
   It is also my understanding that the language of the bill is not intended to exempt from liability parties who had reason to believe that the recyclable material originated from the portion of a DOD, DOE, NRC or Agreement State-licensed facility where source, byproduct or special nuclear material, as defined in the Atomic Energy Act, was processed, utilized or managed. Is it your understanding that the agreement does not cover these materials?

   Mr. DASCHLE. This past Wednesday--the day we finally produced a fragile budget agreement--marked the 199th anniversary of the first time Congress ever met in Washington, DC. They met that day in what was then an unfinished Capitol. Several times during the negotiations, the thought occurred to me that, if the same people who are running this Congress were in charge back then, the Capitol might still be unfinished. 
   These negotiations took longer, and were more difficult, than they needed to be. The good news is: We finally have a budget that will keep America moving in the right direction. Many longtime members and observers of Congress say this has been perhaps the most confusing, convoluted budget process they can remember. 
   There have been a lot of technical questions these last few weeks about accounting methods, economic growth projections, and CBO versus OMB scoring. But the big question--the fundamental question that was at the heart of this budget debate--is quite simple: Are we going to move forward--or backward? 
   We have chosen, thank goodness, to move forward. This budget continues the progress we've made over the last seven years. It maintains our hard-won fiscal discipline. It invests in America's future. And it honors our values. 
   This budget will put more teachers in our children's classrooms, and more police on our streets. It will enable us to honor our commitments to our parents, and fulfill America's obligations as a world leader. And, it will enable us to protect our environment and preserve precious wilderness areas for generations not yet born. 
   I want to thank the Majority Leader, my Democratic colleagues, especially Senator HARRY REID, our whip, and  Senator ROBERT BYRD, ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I also want to thank some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, particularly Senator STEVENS, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   In addition, I want to acknowledge and thank President Clinton and Vice President GORE, as well as the incredibly skillful, patient White House negotiating team, especially Chief of Staff John Podesta, Deputy Chief of Staff Sylvia Matthews, OMB Director Jack Lew; Larry Stein and Chris Jennings. 
   I also want to thank my own staff, and the staff of Appropriations Committee, who have worked many weekends, many late nights, to turn our ideas and debate into a workable budget document. 
   Finally, I want to acknowledge our dear friend, the late Senator John Chafee. Losing Senator Chafee so suddenly was one of the saddest moments in this difficult year. He embodied what is best about the Senate. He was a reasonable, honorable man who cared deeply about people. Completing the budget process was a major challenge. But in the end, I believe we have produced a budget John Chafee would have approved of. 
   This budget invests in our children's education - the best investment any nation can make. It maintains our commitment to reduce class size by hiring 100,000 teachers. It contains money to help communities repair old schools and build new ones. It will enable more children to get a Head Start in school, and in life. And it will allow more young people to attend after-school programs where they will be safe, and where they will have responsible adult supervision. 
   This budget protects Medicare beneficiaries by providing fair payments to the hospitals, clinics, home health care providers and nursing homes they rely on. 
   This budget will make our communities safer by putting 50,000 more police officers on the street--in addition to the 100,000 who have already been hired--and by investing in youth crime prevention. 
   This budget will help keep Americans healthy ..... by reducing hunger and malnutrition among pregnant women, infants and young children ..... and by increasing funding for the National Institute of Health and the national Centers for Disease Control. 
   This budget protects our environment. We took out riders that would have harmed our environment, and put in money to fund the President's Lands Legacy program. 
   This budget will help working families find affordable housing. 
   It will help farm and ranch families weather these hard times. 
   This budget protects our national security ..... by increasing military pay and readiness ..... and by reducing the nuclear threat at home and around the world. 
   This budget will help us fulfill our responsibilities as the world's only superpower. It provides money to pay our UN arrears and fund the Wye Accord to promote peace to the Middle East. It will also enable us to ease the crushing burden of debt on some of the world's poorest countries, so those nations can begin to invest in their own futures. 
   At the beginning of the year, our Republican colleagues proposed an $800 billion tax cut. For months, we all heard a lot of debate about what such a huge tax cut would mean. This budget makes it clear. There is no way we could have paid for an $800 billion tax cut without exploding the deficit again, or raiding Medicare, education, and other programs working families depend on. 
   Instead of moving backwards on taxes, we're moving forward. We're cutting taxes the right way. We're widening the circle of opportunity ..... by extending the R&D tax credit, and other tax credits that stimulate the economy ..... and by empowering people with disabilities by allowing them to maintain their Medicare and Medicaid coverage when they return to work. 
   There is one other point I want to make about the budget: For every dollar Democrats succeeded in restoring these last few weeks ..... for teachers, and police officers and other critical priorities ..... we have provided a dollar in offsets. Dollar for dollar, every one of our priorities is paid for. If CBO determines that this budget exceeds the caps, the overspending is in the basic budget our Republican colleagues drafted--on their own.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I certainly will not object, let me say the majority leader and I talked about this. I am appreciative of his position. I am disappointed he has filed cloture. I hope it isn't received in the wrong way by all of those who worked so hard to get to this point. 
   I had told my colleagues that if they continue to work and if they continue to cooperate, if they continue to allow time agreements, that we would not be in a position where we would have to file cloture and we would get to the final passage. That was my commitment. Senator LOTT did not make that. I made it to my colleagues. In this case, I am going to have to explain to my colleagues why what I said is not what we are going to do. 
   We are down now to a handful of amendments, with time agreements. So I am as convinced today as I was a couple of days ago, as I was before that, that cloture certainly isn't necessary. I am hopeful, with those tight time agreements, and with the opportunity to dispose of the amendments, we can come to final passage. But I will certainly work with the majority leader to see if we might find a way to make that happen. 
   I hope he will work with us to assure those who have relevant amendments will have an opportunity to have their votes and we can finish. 
   I do not object to the request.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know there is additional business to be conducted. 
   Let me say briefly that we have just passed a number of very important pieces of legislation affecting many States, and it is unfortunate at this hour and given these circumstances that Senators who have had so much to do with their passage are not on the floor to be able to watch them as they have finally passed. 
   I commend Senator JOHNSON in particular for one bill that was part of the package, the Lewis and Clark authorization project. 
   As a result of the passage of this legislation, there are tens of thousands of people in southeastern South Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, and northeastern Iowa who will benefit from good, clean, abundant sources of water, in some cases for the first time in a long time. 
   This has been a work in progress for many years. It passed in large measure because there was such a collective effort in the southeastern part of our State, and the southwestern part of Minnesota, and, as I said, in the northeastern part of Iowa. 
   I commend them for their efforts and their diligence and their persistence. I congratulate them for the fact that it now has passed. 
   Let me also thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. SMITH, and the Senator from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI, for all of their help and effort in getting us to this point. 
   It would not have happened without them as well. 
   This is a great day for my State. It is a great day for those in other States. 
   I, again, congratulate especially Senator JOHNSON for his leadership and his effort in getting us to this point. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Steve Bale is one of those individuals who serve faithfully and diligently over many years to ensure that the United States Senate runs efficiently and effectively. All Senators know and appreciate the members of the Senate community who share their pride in public service and commitment to the Senate. We know we could not do our jobs without the dedication of people such as Steve Bale. 
   Steve began his career in the Senate in 1969 as an employee of the Stationery Room under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Senate and ultimately became Keeper of the Stationery. Not many ascend to that unusual title; there have been only fourteen in the history of the Senate. The first person to hold that title was John Lewis Clubb who was given the title in 1854, after some twenty years of actually doing the job. Some may wonder what the Keeper of the Stationery does for the Senate and how that job and title came into being. 
   The Stationery Room can be traced back to the First Congress and the first Secretary of the Senate, Samuel A. Otis, who provided various writing and other supplies for the Senate. Operated initially out of a corner of the Secretary's office, the Stationery Room has occupied nine different locations within the Senate. It has grown from this corner-office operation into a multi-million dollar one serving about 240 offices in the Senate and expanded from its initial offerings of ``ink, quills, and parchment'' to a complex merchandise facility which meets the hightech and traditional needs of these offices. 
   The Stationery Room used to be a simple, service desk facility. Steve led the transition to a full self-service store. Under Steve's direction, the administrative and business functions of the Stationery Room were automated for the first time. He oversaw the installation and GAO certification of an inventory control system and has supervised the installation and testing of the new Y2K compliant computer system. With Steve at the helm, we can all be absolutely certain that the Senate's Stationery Room will NOT have Y2K problems! 
   Of particular note is the role Steve played in the development and procurement of the Senate's official flag. S. Res. 369, agreed to on September 7, 1984, directed ``the Secretary of the Senate to design and make available to Members an official Senate flag.'' Working closely with the staff of the Committee on Rules and Administration, Steve provided the expertise to have a flag designed, find the appropriate manufacturer and ensure that the Senate has official flags for all of its official functions. Few Senators know about the relatively brief history of the Senate flag and fewer still know about Steve's important role in seeing that this resolution's direction was successfully carried out and that the Senate has a suitable and dignified flag. 
   We are fortunate to share a wonderful sense of community among the members and staff who serve here. Steve is among the most respected and well liked within this small community. Always helpful, always smiling, always encouraging to the numerous staff who come into his office on a daily basis, he has found no problem too trivial and no task too difficult to handle. 
   As Steve leaves his many friends and admirers in the Senate, we wish him a long retirement filled with many hours on the golf course.

I agree entirely with his comments and with the views he has expressed. I think he and I speak for our caucuses in our admiration collectively for the Senator from Alaska. We may not always agree, but there isn't anyone who cares more deeply about this institution, about his State, and represents himself more effectively on the Senate floor and with his colleagues than the Senator from Alaska. 
   It is an honor for me to be one of those who have had the good fortune of working with him. I respect him immensely, and I, too, join in wishing him the happiest of birthdays. I wouldn't be surprised at all if Catherine knows exactly how old he is today.

I appreciate very much the involvement and the work done by the distinguished Senator from Montana. This accomplishes much of what we hoped we could do. It is not everything. I am very hopeful we can get this done before April 1, but the majority leader has made as strong a commitment to me personally, and I am sure he is prepared to do it on the record, that he will work with us to accomplish the objectives laid out in this unanimous consent agreement. 
   I appreciate, as well, the cooperation of the distinguished Banking Committee chairman, and I believe as a result of the effort we have been able to demonstrate in getting to this point, we will achieve our goal. We cannot leave rural America out. We will have an opportunity to provide service to them. This will give us the vehicle to make that happen. So I do not object.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say I agree wholeheartedly with the comments made by the majority leader. I don't know if there is a State right now that is hurting as badly as North Carolina. Senator EDWARDS has made that point over and over and over again to me, and I know that Senator HELMS has worked with Senator EDWARDS to try to provide the most comprehensive response to the situation as we can. 
   We have come a long way and made a great deal of progress in the legislation pending, the omnibus bill. As things happen when we work late into the night with a lot of different people working, there is always the possibility something will fall through the cracks. I truly believe that is what happened. I believe it was an honest mistake. 
   As the majority leader has indicated, whether it is fixed tonight, whether it is fixed before the end of the session, or whether it is fixed immediately when we come back, I don't know how one can get a stronger commitment than the one given by the majority leader or the one I am prepared to give and the one I know the chairman will be prepared to give to accommodate North Carolina. 
   I appreciate their willingness to work to do this. This should resolve this matter successfully once and for all, either tonight or at some point in the not too distant future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to Medical Treatment Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators HARKIN, REID, INOUYE and JOHNSON in this effort to increase individuals' freedom of choice in health care. 
   At the outset, I want to extend my thanks to my friend Berkley Bedell, who formerly represented the 6th District of Iowa, for first bringing this issue to my attention and for his assistance in developing this bill. Berkley Bedell has experienced first-hand the life-saving potential of alternative treatments. His story underscores the need for the legislation I am introducing today and the importance of a national debate on ways to promote consumer choice and expand access to promising new medical treatments. 
   American consumers have already voted for expanded access to alternative treatments with their feet and their pocket-books. The Journal of the American Medical Association recently published a study by David Eisenberg and others that found that Americans spent nearly $27 billion on alternative therapies in 1997. Americans made more visits to alternative practitioners--a total of 629 million--than to primary care doctors. Expenditures for alternative medicine professional services increased 45.2 percent between 1990 and 1997 to $21.2 billion. Some type of alternative therapy is used by 46.3 percent of the American population. 
   Alternative therapies are also being incorporated into mainstream medical programs and practice. The curriculum of at least 22 of the nation's 125 medical schools include courses on alternative medicine. The National Institutes of Health now has a Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine where work is underway to expand our knowledge of alternative therapies and their safe and effective use. 
   Despite the growing reliance on many types of alternative medicine, other alternative therapies remain unavailable because they do not fit the categories already carved out by Congress for exemption from the requirement to gain FDA approval. My bill would increase access to treatments that would normally be regulated by the FDA, but have not yet undergone the expensive and lengthy process currently required to gain FDA approval. 
   Given the popularity of alternative medicine among the American public and its growing acceptance among traditional medical practitioners, it would seem logical to remove some of the access barriers that consumers face when seeking certain alternative therapies. The time and expense currently required to gain FDA approval both discourages the exploration of innovative, life-saving treatments by individual practitioners, scientists and smaller companies and limits patient access to low-cost treatments. 
   Mr. President, the Access to Medical Treatment Act proposes one way to expand freedom of choice for medical consumers under carefully controlled situations. It asserts that individuals--especially those who face life-threatening afflictions for which conventional treatments have proven ineffective--should have the option of trying an alternative treatment, so long as they have been fully informed of the nature of the treatment, potential side effects, and given any other information necessary to meet carefully-crafted informed consent requirements. This is a choice that is rightly made by the consumer, and not dictated by the  Federal government. All treatments sanctioned by this Act must be prescribed by an authorized health care practitioner who has personally examined the patient. The practitioner must fully disclose all available information about the safety and effectiveness of any medical treatment, including questions that remain unanswered because the necessary research has not been conducted. Patients must be informed of any possible side effects or interactions with other drugs. 
   The bill carefully restricts the ability of practitioners to advertise or market unapproved drugs or devices or to profit financially from prescribing alternative medicine. This provision was included to ensure that practitioners keep the best interests of patients in mind and to retain incentives for seeking FDA approval. If an individual or a company wants to earn a profit from a product, they would be wise to go through the standard FDA approval process. 
   The bill protects patients by requiring practitioners to report any adverse reaction that could potentially have been caused by an unapproved drug or medical device. If an adverse reaction is reported, manufacture and distribution of the drug must cease pending a thorough investigation. If it is determined that the adverse reaction was caused by the drug or medical device, as a part of a total recall, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, along with the manufacturer, has the duty to inform all health care practitioners to whom the drug or device has been provided. 
   This legislation will help build a knowledge base regarding alternative treatments by requiring practitioners to report on effectiveness. This is critical because current information available about the effectiveness of many promising treatments is inadequate. The information generated through this Act will begin to reverse this reality, particularly because information will be collected and analyzed by the Center for Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. 
   In essence, this legislation addresses the fundamental balance between two seemingly irreconcilable interests: the protection of patients from dangerous and ineffective treatments and the preservation of the consumers' freedom to choose alternative therapies. The complexity of this policy challenge should not discourage us from seeking to solve it. I am convinced that the public good will be served by a serious attempt to reconcile these contradictory interests, and I am hopeful the discussion generated by introduction of this legislation will help point the way to its resolution. 
   Mr. President, this legislation represents an honest attempt to focus serious attention on the value of alternative treatments and overcome current obstacles to their safe development and utilization.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor for a moment to commend both Senator GRASSLEY, the manager on the Republican side, and our very distinguished assistant Democratic leader. We started the consideration of this bill several days ago. As I understand it, 20 amendments were filed. We are now down to fewer than 10 amendments. 
   As I understand it, there is a potential time agreement on virtually every amendment. Virtually every Senator has expressed their interest in bringing this bill to a conclusion and are prepared to accept time limits. 
   I further understand the majority is giving some consideration now to going out early tonight after we have had a couple votes. I hope that isn't the case because I would like to see if we could finish this bill either tonight or tomorrow. There is no reason why we cannot finish it and move on to other matters. There are a number of other matters pending. 
   So I speak for a lot of our colleagues in expressing our gratitude to the distinguished assistant Democratic leader for his effort yet again. He has done this on so many bills, but on this bill in particular he has really done an extraordinary job of not only working to accommodate Senators but also to manage the legislation on our side, along with Senators LEAHY and TORRICELLI, and, of course, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator GRASSLEY, for his work in working with Senators who wish to offer amendments. 
   I know some of these amendments have been accepted, and some of these amendments will require rollcalls. The point is, let's get the work done. Let's finish either tonight or tomorrow, but let's finish the bill. 
   There was a time when I feared we would not finish this legislation this year. Maybe that is the only silver lining for those of us who would like to bring this matter to closure: That we will have the opportunity to finish this legislation. 
   Many members still have amendments. Some of these amendments that are yet to be offered may tell the story with regard to Democratic support. There are some good amendments that are still pending. Senator KENNEDY has a very good amendment that needs to be addressed. I hope we can do that and move on the other Democratic amendments that I know Senator SCHUMER and others have indicated they are prepared to offer. 
   So we are getting down now to the final few amendments. I hope we will just keep the heat on, and finish up this critical legislation many of us have worked so long and so hard to enact. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the 40th year of broadcasting for radio station KJAM-FM, serving Madison, South Dakota and area communities. KJAM Radio first aired on December 3rd, 1959, and this December 3rd, the staff and friends of the radio station will be celebrating this remarkable feat in radio broadcasting with a well-deserved anniversary party. 
   Small town, locally owned radio stations like KJAM are one of rural America's unique cultural contributions to our nation. They mirror the strong values of the small towns they serve. KJAM has served Madison well, and I would like to commend the employees  and supporters of KJAM for their dedication over these 40 years in bringing to the area local and regional news, weather, and broadcasts of events for Dakota State University and area high schools. 
   Beginning in January, KJAM will be managed by Three Eagles Communications, which I am sure will continue to enrich the lives of area residents with quality radio broadcasting. 
   I know my colleagues will join me in honoring John and JoLynn Goeman, the owners of KJAM, who have given so much to the Madison community. John Goeman is the only employee who has been with the station since its inception, and I know his listeners will be sad to hear his last greeting to radio listeners with the ``First Edition'' of the day's news. We all owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the Goemans and KJAM for making such an invaluable contribution to Madison and the entire state of South Dakota.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I voted against the Hatch ``drug'' amendment. I voted against this amendment with some regret because I very much wanted to support one provision in this amendment--Senator HATCH's Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999.  
   Senator HATCH's Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999 is a bipartisan bill that would go a long way toward attacking the proliferation of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse that particularly plagues the Midwest. I know my friend Senator HARKIN and others have worked tirelessly with Senator HATCH to improve the bill and to ensure that prevention and treatment programs targeted at young people tempted by or addicted to methamphetamine are included in any solution to this problem. Because I feel strongly about this issue, I co-sponsored Senator HARKIN's bill the ``Comprehensive Methamphetamine Abuse Reduction Act,'' and many of the provisions of Senator HARKIN's bill are now included in this amendment. 
   We have a serous problem in South Dakota with the production, trafficking and use of methamphetamine. I have met with many members of South Dakota's law enforcement community about this problem, and I know that cracking down on meth traffickers and users has become more and more difficult as this highly addictive drug has increased in popularity, particularly among our young people. The number of methamphetamine arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs continues to escalate. In the Midwest alone, the number of clandestine methamphetamine labs confiscated and destroyed in 1998 was nearly triple the number confiscated and destroyed in 1997. 
   It has become evident that methamphetamine is fast becoming the leading illegal drug in our region, and efforts to combat its spread are complicated by the fact that the drug does not discriminate. Its users range from teenage girls who use the drug to decrease their appetite in an effort to lose weight, to middle class men looking for a cheap high. This highly addictive drug can lead to devastating consequences for its users, and far too often methamphetamine use has been a major factor in a number of violent crime cases. In recent years, the Drug Enforcement Agency has registered an increase in the percentage of arrests due to methamphetamine in South Dakota from around 20% of the total arrest rate to 70%, and several high profile crimes, including murders, in South Dakota have been attributed to methamphetamine abuse. 
   Though, we have taken some important steps to combat methamphetamine abuse in recent years, such as securing targeted funding to fight methamphetamine production and trafficking in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri, I believe it is time to do more. Accordingly, I would have liked to support the provisions in this amendment that increase penalties for amphetamine manufacturing and trafficking and provide more money for law enforcement personnel to address the methamphetamine problem in high intensity drug trafficking areas. That is why I would have liked to support the provisions that provide needed funds for hiring and training law enforcement officers to combat methamphetamine trafficking and manufacture. And that is why I would have liked to support the provisions that would fund increased methamphetamine abuse research, grants to states and Indian tribes to expand treatment activities, and grants to schools and local communities for methamphetamine prevention activities. But unfortunately, I could not because the Republicans added, at the last minute, a poison pill provision aimed at weakening our public education system. 
   The Hatch amendment includes a provision allowing school districts to use federal funds to provide vouchers to students who have been victims of violent crime on school grounds. This means that money that is supposed to be used to help public schools improve technology, to develop charter schools, or that has been set aside for special education students, could be used on vouchers for private schools. The amendment does nothing to make schools safer for children and will do nothing to increase student achievement. 
   Let there be no mistake about what this amendment is trying to do. This is just a back-door attempt to take federal resources necessary to improve our public schools and squander them on vouchers to send a few children to private schools. While the proponents claim that parents could send their child to any school, this provision actually creates an incentive to send the child to private or parochial schools by disallowing transportation expenses for public school students, while allowing transportation expenses along with tuition and fees for private or religious schools. 
   Federal resources should be invested in improving public schools for all children through higher standards, smaller classes, well-trained teachers, modern facilities, more after-school programs, and safe and secure classrooms. They should not be frittered away on ineffective and unproven programs to help just a few children. 
   Mr. President, we all know that the education provisions in this amendment will necessitate that this amendment be dropped in conference. Thus, this is not a meaningful vote. I will continue to work to enact legislation to provide law enforcement officials the tools they need to combat the methamphetamine problem in this country. But I don't want to be part of an effort that may jeopardize the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999--a bill that is aimed, rightly, at reducing the abuses of the bankruptcy system. We should be focused on enacting meaningful bankruptcy reform, and not encumbering this bill with decisive partisan issues. We need to send a bankruptcy bill to the President which he can sign into law--this amendment, unfortunately, does not further that end.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor for just a moment to express my support for the Wellstone amendment, as well. I commend the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, as well as the Senator from Iowa, for their work and for the effort that this amendment represents. 
   Basically, this amendment has a very simple purpose. It is simply to take a deep breath, take a close look, and to give careful thought to what is happening in agriculture today. We all espouse the free enterprise system. We all say that we are 
   enthusiastic advocates of real competition, which is really the essence of the free enterprise system--competition. We all express our grave concern when we find circumstances within the economy that are not competitive. Yet, as we look at agriculture today, as we look at the tremendous economic power now represented in fewer and fewer companies, with more and more mergers underway almost weekly, one has to ask, how much is enough? When do we undermine the very tenets of free enterprise by continuing to look the other way when these mergers are announced? We see it especially in livestock. The latest announcement that Smithfield Corporation will be acquiring Murphy Farms illustrates the point. There are fewer buyers. There are fewer processors. There are fewer options. There are fewer and fewer competitors. 
   Mr. President, when that happens, we reach a point where there is no competition. I am not one who is prepared today to say that there is collusion in the market, that there is something illegal going on in the market; but I am prepared to say today that what is happening in the market is not healthy for agriculture. What is happening in the market goes the wrong way from competition. What is happening in the market today precludes real opportunities for producers to be able to ensure a fair price, a real opportunity in the marketplace, a real sense of competition. 
   I was just told again last week that in many places in South Dakota, a buyer will tell you that he will be in a location for one day for as little as one-half hour, and if you want to be able to sell your cattle to that buyer, you have to be there in that half hour's time, on that appointed day, or you don't sell cattle that week. I don't know how that is competition. I don't know how we can say today this is the free enterprise system that we all defend and espouse. What is free enterprise when you have one buyer and all these producers lined up to sell, almost supplicating themselves to that buyer? That isn't free enterprise. That isn't what we say agriculture is supposed to be. Most important, that isn't ever going to allow us the confidence that we need as we look to the future and encourage young people and encourage rural people to stay where they are. They need more confidence and more assurances than what we are giving them today. 
   So this amendment is really pretty simple. It just says, let's take a deep breath, let's not do anymore until we have had a chance to analyze whether or not our fears are being realized, whether or not we really have any legitimate basis for concern, whether or not the situation is going from bad to worse. That is all we are saying. Once it happens, it can never be undone. I doubt very much that we will ever go back and say, OK, we are going to break up these companies, because that is the only way it is going to assure that we have the kind of competitive environment that we need. I don't think that is in the offing in the short term. So while we still have a chance to put everything on hold, to analyze whether or not this is good, why not simply say, let's take a deep breath. 
   I personally don't believe that we ought to be content with just this. I really worry about whether or not vertical integration in agriculture ultimately is going to destroy the young family farmer, or the livestock producer. Once you have the processor in charge of every step from to table, then you really don't have competition. More and more, that seems to be the approach the large processors are taking--get involved in production, get involved in transportation, get involved in wholesaling, get involved in retailing, get involved in every single aspect from top to bottom. I am concerned about vertical integration. 
   It seems to me that when we made the decision to break up the old telephone company back in the early 1980's we created a competitive explosion the likes of which we never imagined, and from which we are still benefiting today. We see things that are happening today that make other countries' heads spin. We broke up a large company, and we made progress the likes of which we could have never have anticipated. I would love to see the kind of competition, the kind of excitement, the kind of enthusiasm in agriculture as we now see in telecommunications. 
   Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will send the right message. I am hopeful that we can simply say, Look. At the very least, let's stop before we allow this to go any further for just a  few months--18 months. Let's make some good decisions, and calculate whether or not this is good for the country and good for the agriculture industry. 
   I think it is a good amendment. I support it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to recognize the members of the Tatanka Hotshot Crew of the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota. This fall marks the end of the first fire season that this crew has been operational, and I am delighted to say that it has proven to be an outstanding success. 
   Each year serious wildfires threaten national forests across the United States, burning thousands of acres of woodlands and endangering private property. Our first line of defense against these fires is the United States Forest Service, whose firefighters risk their lives in arduous, often isolated conditions to bring wildfires under control. 
   The best of these teams are known as Hotshot crews--elite firefighters who are sent to the worst fires, to do the most difficult, dangerous work necessary to protect our forests and the homes of nearby residents. All around the country, these teams have been recognized for their skill and bravery. 
   Last year, we created the first of these elite teams ever to be based in the Black Hills National Forest. It is called the Tatanka Hotshots, after the Lakota word for the bison that used to roam the Great Plains by the tens of thousands. The nearly two dozen members of this team, virtually all of whom are Native American, come from diverse backgrounds. Some came from South Dakota towns like Custer and Aberdeen. Some joined the Tatanka crew from other hotshot teams or elite smokejumping units. Others are veterans of the Gulf War. Still others are young individuals working their way through college. I am proud to say that after a year of intense training and working together, the Tatanka team quickly has become one of the most highly-regarded firefighting teams in the nation. 
   In addition to work in the Black Hills, the Tatanka crew spent 71 days away on wildland fire assignments, accumulating 1,550 hours of work in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and California. It conducted seven large firing/burnout operations, built miles of fireline, constructed helispots and medivac sites, and conducted large tree falling operations in steep, hazardous terrain. Other noteworthy accomplishments included backpacking 6,500 pounds of sandbags up Mount Rushmore to prepare for the July 4th fireworks display, tending the commemorative crosses at the 1994 South Canyon fire fatality sites in Colorado, and working in conjunction with the Tahoe Hotshots to rescue a pack horse which had fallen off a mountain trail in California.  
   Over the course of the summer, the Tatanka crew earned its reputation as a team that could be depended upon to get its job done quickly and effectively. Based upon its outstanding performance ratings and the respect it earned from other highly regarded Hotshot crews, Forest Service officials expect the team to attain National Type 1 status--the highest rating a firefighting team can receive--before the 2000 fire season, a full year ahead of schedule. 
   Mr. President, I am very proud of the accomplishments of this crew. Forest fires are dangerous and unpredictable, and fighting them is one of the most difficult, physically-exhausting jobs of which I know. Firefighters spend days deep in forests and far from possible help, digging fire lines and cutting trees to keep fires from spreading. In just one year, the Tatanka team has met these challenges head-on, and shown that it is equal to the toughest challenges our nation has to offer. I want to offer my congratulations to all of those who served on the team. I am sure that they will have an outstanding future.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate the clarification. That was the understanding. So there is no confusion, we now have 4 hours of debate on the two amendments. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor at this point to talk about the amendment offered on behalf of our colleagues, but really on behalf of the 11 million Americans who will benefit from this minimum wage once it is passed into law. 
   I thank especially Senator KENNEDY for his extraordinary leadership and persistence in making sure this issue was addressed prior to the end of the first session of this Congress. Were it not for his dedication and extraordinary efforts, we would not be here this afternoon. 
   I also thank Senators ROBB and BAUCUS for the leadership they have provided, and I thank many of our colleagues for their strong support for this legislation. 
   We fought all year long to bring this amendment to the floor because low-income working families need and deserve a raise. The average American family now works an additional 265 hours a year just to maintain the same standard of living they had at the beginning of this decade. That is an additional 6 weeks a year. We believe it is time parents could be spending attending parent-teacher conferences or playing with their children or maybe just reading Harry Potter with them. It is time husbands and wives could be talking with each other. It is not enough just to talk about family values, we need to show by our actions that we value families. We need to raise the minimum wage, and we need to do it this year--now. 
   I recently met a young father in South Dakota who told me that he and his wife eat only one meal a week together, and that is on Sundays after church. The rest of the week, his work schedule keeps him away from his family because he has more than one job. 
   He is one of many workers in this Nation who are working three jobs, two of them at minimum wage, just to make ends meet. We can do better than that. In this economy, we must do better than that. We are in the longest, strongest period of economic recovery in our Nation's history. The stock market and worker productivity are both at record highs. 
   It has been 3 years since the last time we increased the minimum wage, and if we do not pass another increase now, by the end of this month the purchasing power of the minimum wage will have fallen to the lowest point it has been in 40 years. The real value of the minimum wage is now at almost $2.50 below what it was in 1968--$2.50 an hour. 
   We are proposing we raise the minimum wage, not by the $2.50 required to get back to the parity level of 1968, but $1 an hour over 2 years. That is as modest a proposal as anyone can propose. Under it, the minimum-wage worker who now works full time would earn only $12,792 a year, but it would be $2,000 more than he or she now earns. 
   After doing all they could for as long as they could to block any increase in the minimum wage, now our Republican colleagues have their own proposal. They will raise the minimum wage, but they are saying to working families: ``We are not going to let you have it in 2 years. We know now you will only be making $12,792, but we want you to wait 3 years for your raise. But we are for family values, we are for helping people get ahead.'' 
   They want to believe there is not a dime's worth of difference between their plan and our plan. That is not so. There are at least three major differences. 
   First, this 3-year delay is going to cost a typical working family $1,200 over 3 years. That is what that delay costs. I know around here that does not sound like a lot of money, but to a family trying to scrape by on minimum wage, it is 10 percent of a year's income; $1,200 a year is 3 months' worth of rent. 
   It is 4 months' worth of groceries; it is 6 months' worth of utilities; and it is 1 year in tuition and fees at a 2-year college. 
   So there is a big difference. Do not let anybody say that simply waiting another year for that full dollar benefit is a minor matter. We are talking rent; we are talking utilities; we are talking groceries. It is whether or not in some cases families are going to have two or three meals a week together or whether that one meal on Sunday will have to do. 
   The second difference between our proposal and the Republican proposal has to do with the tax cuts. We offer tax cuts. I really do not think there is any connection, frankly, between the minimum wage and the need for tax cuts. Each ought to be considered in their own right. 
   I am troubled a little bit about this tendency to want to marry tax cuts into something that is important to do in its own right. But I do understand the importance of providing meaningful tax relief targeted to small businesses. I am for that. And our caucus, and I hope the Senate, is for that. 
   We offer a tax cut package that will cost $28.5 billion over 10 years. But the tax breaks the Republican plan entails would cost $75 billion--over twice as much. It is not just the cost that worries me, it is the fact that the Republican tax cuts are not paid for. 
   We have heard all of this railing about Social Security trust funds. But the Republicans do not seem to be too concerned about Social Security when it comes to this tax cut. While they pay for the first year, there is absolutely no money for the tax cuts the second through the 10th years. What that means is that it is going to have to come out of education, other priorities, or even Social Security. 
   The third difference between our tax cuts and the Republicans' is this: Our tax cuts target small businesses and family farms. The Republican tax breaks overwhelmingly benefit those in the top end of the income strata. 
   A minimum wage increase ought to be able to pass, as I said a moment ago, on its own merits. If we are going to include tax cuts, they ought to reduce the impact, as marginal as it is, of a minimum wage increase on the businesses that will be most affected by it. The Republican proposal fails this basic test of fairness, relevance, and fiscal responsibility. 
   How would the Democratic tax cuts help small businesses and family farms? 
   First, we lower the cost to small businesses of making investments by raising to $25,000 the amount of an investment a business can write off immediately. If you make a $25,000 investment, you can write it off in the first year and you do not have to wait. That is one way to help small businesses. 
   They tell me time and again we have to encourage them to reinvest and to put more money back into their businesses. There is no better way to do that than to say: make an investment and you can expense it immediately. We do that. 
   Second, we provide a tax cut of up to $4,000 to cover startup costs of adopting a pension plan so more small businesses can offer their workers pensions. This not only helps businesses, it helps the workers, and it helps businesses attract good workers and increases workers' retirement security. It is a win-win. 
   In this day and age, what business people tell me all through South Dakota, as they are attempting to compete for a very limited workforce, is that there has to be an incentive to be able to recruit and then ultimately to retain good people. There is nothing more important in retaining good people than ensuring that in the long term they are not only going to have a good income but they are going to have a good retirement. This package does it. 
   Third, we accelerate the full deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. We have already provided full 
   deductibility, and now we move it up. We more rapidly incorporate full  deductibility, so that every small business can benefit in providing health insurance in those cases when they are self-employed. 
   Fourth, our proposal raises the special estate tax exemption for family-owned small businesses and farms by $450,000. 
   Fifth, we make it easier for farm cooperatives to raise capital. 
   Finally, and very importantly, we provide tax relief to farmers who are experiencing losses during the current crisis. 
   That is how our tax cuts help small businesses and family farms. 
   But our proposal also contains tax cuts to help low-income workers. We extend the successful work opportunity and the welfare-to-work tax credits for 5 years. We increase tax incentives for entrepreneurs to invest in empowerment zones. First-round empowerment zones have shown that wage tax credits are a valuable economic development tool. 
   Currently, there are no wage tax credits available for round 2 zones. By making these tax credits available, by building on what we know works, we can bring new jobs and opportunities to places such as the Pine Ridge Reservation empowerment zone in South Dakota and other communities that desperately need opportunities like it. 
   We also include in our plan the President's new markets tax credit to help people in communities that have so far not shared in the country's record economic prosperity. The new markets tax credit will encourage private capital to flow into equity investments in businesses in these areas. Bipartisan support for this proposal is growing, and it is extremely fitting to include it in a proposal to raise the minimum wage. 
   Our tax cut is smart; it is strategic; and I emphasize, it is paid for. I especially commend Senators ROBB and BAUCUS for their efforts in helping to develop it. As members of the Senate Finance Committee, they have done an outstanding job of ensuring that as we look at the array of tax tools that would be helpful to workers and small businesses, we put the tightest, most targeted, most focused package together. And they have done it in this amendment. 
   The third difference between our minimum wage plan and the one our colleagues are offering is simply this: The President will sign our plan. The Republican proposal is absolutely dead on arrival. 
   Now, we know we will hear dire warnings from some of our colleagues on the other side. They will say raising the minimum wage will actually hurt low-income workers because employers will be forced to cut minimum-wage jobs. 
   We now know that is nonsense. We have study after study that proves raising the minimum wage does not kill jobs at all. In fact, since the last time we raised the minimum wage--in 1996--American employers have created nearly 9 million new jobs. In my State, 17,000 new jobs have been created. The national unemployment rate has fallen from 5.2 percent to just over 4 percent--the lowest jobless rate in 30 years. Even the Wall Street Journal and Business Week now say the 1996 predictions about job losses were wrong. 
   Another argument we will surely hear from our friends in the other party is that increasing the minimum wage has nothing to do with increasing family incomes. They will argue that most minimum-wage workers are teenagers who are working part time to pay for cars and CD players. 
   Again, the facts show otherwise. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70 percent of all minimum-wage workers are 20 years old or older; nearly 60 percent are women; and 40 percent are sole breadwinners in their families. 
   Our economy is the strongest it has been in my lifetime. But behind the prosperity, there are still far too many families who 
   are working too hard, too long, for too little pay. 
   In South Dakota, while many families are moving ahead, too many others are being left behind, creating, in effect, two South Dakotas. On the surface, South Dakota is fortunate. Our unemployment rate is 2.6 percent, one of the lowest in the Nation. But in some of our counties, unemployment is as high as 7 percent. South Dakota is also the home to the poorest community in America, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. 
   There are good people--hard-working people--all across this country, who are struggling to make ends meet on minimum-wage jobs. They need a raise. And they are not alone. That is why religious leaders around the country today are urging us to raise the minimum wage. 
   It is critical that we not miss this opportunity. A job isn't just a source of income; it ought to be a source of pride. The U.S. Catholic Conference tells us the minimum wage should reflect principles of human dignity and economic justice. Unfortunately, today's minimum wage does not do that. 
   I want to read something that I think probably puts it in perspective quite well. This is a quote that is not one of mine, and not one of Senator KENNEDY's. It is a quote made by former majority leader Bob Dole the last time the Congress voted to raise the minimum wage in 1996. Bob Dole said at the time: ``I never thought the Republican Party would stand for squeezing every nickel out of the minimum wage.'' 
   He was right then. If he were on the floor today, he would be right now. If we don't pass a minimum wage increase by the end of next month, more inflation will have wiped out the entire increase he was referring to in 1996. We cannot allow that to happen. It is time we stopped squeezing every last nickel out of the minimum wage. It is time to raise the minimum wage the right way, $1 an hour over 2 years, with responsible targeted tax cuts to help small business owners and family farmers, not an unpaid-for tax windfall for all those who need it the least. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this legislation has been a long time coming. Many, including this Senator, consider it long overdue. It is historic in magnitude. 
   It has been described, appropriately, as a new ``Constitution'' for financial services for the 21st Century. Because of its importance, it has been hard fought. But we can be proud of the final product. It will foster a continuation of the extraordinary economic growth this nation has seen in the last several years. 
   Most importantly, it offers new opportunities and benefits for American consumers. It allows for ``one-stop shopping'' for an array of financial services. Americans will be able to conduct their banking, insurance and investment activities under one roof, with all the convenience that entails. 
   By allowing a single company to offer an array of financial products, this bill will stimulate competition, leading to greater choices and reduced fees for consumers and businesses alike. New companies will create innovative new products for consumers. 
   It is important to remember how far we have come to reach this historic moment. Congress has been trying to pass a bill along these lines for 20 years. We came extremely close in the last Congress, but it fell apart in its waning moments over disagreements about the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Again in this Congress, the bill saw some tough moments. In the Senate, it passed by party-line votes both in committee and on the floor. 
   Because of the deep commitment of Democrats to enactment of this legislation, we did not give up. We introduced an alternative bill that could garner bipartisan support. And I am proud to say that this conference agreement embodies all of the principles that we advocated in our alternative bill. 
   We do not need to surrender our beliefs to support of this bill, because it adopts our positions on every major issue. Best of all, these victories mean that the President can sign this bill into a law, so it can improve the delivery of financial services for many years to come. 
   Our positions prevailed right down the line. 
   Our position prevailed on banking and commerce: this bill strictly limits the ability of thrifts to affiliate with commercial companies, closing a loophole in current law. 
   Our position prevailed on operating subsidiaries: the bill allows banks to choose whether to conduct new activities in either a financial subsidiary or an affiliate. They can choose whatever form best suits their customers' needs. 
   Our position prevailed on consumer protections: the SEC retains the ability to protect consumers when banks sell securities products, which was a major concern of SEC Chairman Levitt. The agreement also preserves important state consumer protection laws governing insurance sales, and prohibits coercive sales practices. 
   Our position prevailed on the Community Reinvestment Act: CRA is preserved under this bill. The agreement addresses our greatest concern by requiring that banks have a good track record on lending within their own communities before they can expand into newly authorized businesses. 
   We can be proud of these achievements, and proud to support this bill. 
   At the same time, we can be disappointed the bill does not go further to protect consumers' financial privacy. The bill does contains some important provisions requiring financial institutions to give customers notice about their privacy policies. But these companies retain extraordinary latitude in sharing a customer's most sensitive, personal information without the customer's consent and without even giving the customer the right to object. We have to do better. This issue is far from over, and we will have to revisit it next year. 
   Despite these shortcomings, which also exist in current law, this legislation will benefit consumers, businesses and the economy, and deserves our support. Through this bill, Congress is finally reforming our outdated financial services laws to recognize new realities in the marketplace. 
   I would like to commend our many colleagues, administration officials, and outside institutions that have worked so long and so hard to bring us to this point. We must especially recognize the leadership of the ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator SARBANES, for his dogged determination to ensure that this final  product upheld the public's best interests. The Secretary of the Treasury, Larry Summers, and his predecessor, former Secretary Rubin, also played key roles in ensuring that this legislation protected the interests of American consumers. 
   I must also commend the Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM, for his recognition of the need for compromise and bipartisanship in producing a bill that deserves the signature of the President of the United States. 
   Mr. President, this legislation deserves the support of an overwhelming bipartisan majority of our colleagues, and I urge them to vote for it today.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more with the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. This is an important issue. While we need to stay focused on the appropriations bill  and on bankruptcy, she has been working on this matter for a long, long time and has made great progress. 
   I share the view expressed by the majority leader that this is an issue that has great impact not only in her region of the country but in regions throughout the country. I hope we can resolve this satisfactorily and she can be satisfied with the final product. I will do all I can to work with the majority leader to see that happens in the remaining days of this session. 
   I commend the majority leader for getting the Senate to this point. I think we are very close to reaching an agreement. As I understand, we have not yet had the opportunity to exchange amendments, but we will be doing that shortly. He and I have both worked with our colleagues to ensure we can work through this agreement. I think this is a win-win. I think it is an opportunity to finish an important piece of legislation, an opportunity to deal with some issues that both sides think are important. I think it is a very appropriate vehicle with which to get our work done. I am hopeful we will get total cooperation procedurally to allow the Senate the opportunity to finish this work. 
   I am fully expecting before the end of the day we will have an agreement that will allow the Senate to go through the next couple of days in expectation of finishing this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank all of the Senators involved in this. We have consulted with virtually every Member. While no one is ever completely satisfied with a complex agreement such as this, I think it gives us the best opportunity to address an important issue, bankruptcy, and to address some other issues about which both caucuses care a good deal. So I think this is a good agreement. I appreciate the work of the majority leader to get us to this point.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leader time to say a few words about this bill and where we are. 
   Mr. President, there is no one for whom I have greater respect for than the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska. But I must say, I question why we are here today voting on a bill that we know will be vetoed. If we are going to try to retain the positive environment to which the senior Senator has just alluded, I do not understand how it is positive to send a bill down to the President that we know will be vetoed, which will then require us to go right back to the negotiating table where we were yesterday. I do not understand that. 
   I think a far better course is to defeat this bill, go back downstairs, negotiate seriously with the White House, and come together with Democrats to assure that we can pass a bill overwhelmingly. 
   I do not recall whether I have ever voted against an Education appropriations bill. This may be unprecedented for many of us on this side of the aisle. As I understand it, the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on Health and Human Services is going to vote against this bill. I am going to join him, and I am going to join with most Democrats, if not all Democrats, in our unanimous opposition to what the bill represents. That is unprecedented. 
   We should not have to be here doing this today. If we are serious about doing something positive and bringing this whole effort to closure, I cannot imagine we could be doing anything more counterproductive than to send a bill down that we know is going to be vetoed. 
   Why is it going to be vetoed? It is going to be vetoed because we violate the very contract that we all signed 1 year ago, a contract that Republicans and Democrats hailed at the time as a major departure when it comes to education. We recognized that, in as consequential a way as we know how to make at the Federal level, we are going to reduce class size, just as we said we were going to hire more policemen with the COPS Program a couple years before. We committed to hiring 100,000 new teachers and ensuring that across this country the message is: We hear you. We are going to reduce class size and make quality education the priority on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. 
   I think both parties took out ads right afterward saying what a major achievement it was. We were all excited about the fact that we did this for our kids, for education, and what a departure it represented from past practice. We did that 1 year ago. 
   Here we are now with the very question: Should we extend what we hailed last year to be the kind of achievement that it was? A couple of days ago, a report came out which indicated that in those school districts where additional teachers had been hired, there was a clear and very extraordinary development: Class sizes were smaller, quality education was up, teachers were being hired, and this program was working. We had it in black and white--given to every Senator--it is working. 
   So why now, with that clear evidence, with the bipartisan understanding that we had just a year ago that we were going to make this commitment all the way through to the end, hiring 100,000 new teachers, why now that would even be on the table is something I do not understand. Twenty-nine thousand teachers could be fired. 
   But it is as a result of the fact that our Republican colleagues continue to refuse to extend and maintain the kind of program we all hailed last year that we are here with a threat of a veto. 
   I do not care whether it is this week, next week, if we are into December, if it is the day before Christmas, if that issue has not been resolved satisfactorily, we are not going to leave. We can talk all we want to about a positive environment, but we are 
    not going to have a positive environment conducive to resolving this matter until that issue is resolved satisfactorily. 
   So there isn't much positive one can say about our dilemma on that issue. 
   Another big dilemma is the extraordinary impact delaying funding will have on the NIH. Sixty percent of the research grant portfolio will be delayed until the last 2 days of this fiscal year--60 percent. Eight thousand new research grants will be delayed and grantees will be denied the opportunity to compete--8,000 grantees. This is  probably going to have as Earth shaking an impact on NIH as anything since NIH was created. 
   I do not know of anything that could have a more chilling effect on the way we provide funding for grants through NIH than what this budget proposes. We have heard from the institutions that conduct life-saving research. They say you can't stop and start research programs without irretrievable loss. 
   I will bet you every Senator has been contacted by NIH expressing their concern and the concern of these researchers about the devastating impact this is going to have. 
   But it is not just the NIH. The cut across the board alone will have a major impact. Five thousand fewer children are going to receive Head Start services; and 2,800 fewer children are going to receive child care assistance; 120,000 kids will be denied educational services. 
   This cut across the board has nothing to do with ridding ourselves of waste. This goes to the muscle and the bone of programs that are very profoundly affecting our research, our education, our opportunities for safe neighborhoods, and the COPS Program. The array of things that will happen if this cut is enacted will be devastating. 
   So I am hopeful that we will get serious and get real about creating the positive environment that will allow us to resolve these matters. We have to resolve the class size issue. We have to resolve the matter of offsets in a way that we can feel good about. 
   I am hoping we are going to do it sooner rather than later--but we are going to do it. It is the choice of our colleagues. We will do it later, but we will all have to wait until those who continue to insist on this approach understand that it will never happen; the vetoes will keep coming; the opposition will be as strong and as united a week or 2 weeks from now as it is today. That is why I feel so strongly about the need to oppose this conference report. Let's go back downstairs and do it right. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first, while I fully recognize the ability of the Senator from South Carolina to object to this amendment, it is certainly his right. I am disappointed. The majority leader has made, in my view, a major step forward in trying to resolve the impasse. I commend him and appreciate the direction he has now indicated he is prepared to go in an attempt to bring this matter to a close. 
   The amendment, as the majority leader indicated, is one that includes amendments on both sides. We expressed last week our concern for two things: First, the array of relevant amendments that may not be germane. The majority leader's amendment includes all relevant amendments that, in many cases, if not all of them, are not germane. So unless we get an agreement to add these relevant amendments, we are precluded from doing so. 
   There are some relevant amendments that still need to be offered that are not included in this package. By taking the tree down, those relevant amendments about which we have been very concerned are still pending and would not be offered if there were objections to offering them or if we were not able to bring them to closure. 
   The second problem we had, of course, was with nonrelevant, nongermane amendments. In our discussions and negotiations, we have been able to accommodate that concern by working out an agreement on bankruptcy that I find to be very satisfactory that will allow us to take up nonrelevant, nongermane amendments. 
   I intend to support cloture tomorrow, if that is the only way we can move this forward. I hope our colleagues will do so. It is no longer now a matter of protecting colleagues' rights. We are denied that right, not by the majority leader or by the parliamentary situation, but by individual Senators who are within their rights, of course, to object to proceeding on this bill. 
   I want to get this legislation finished. I want to do all I can to protect Senators and their rights to offer amendments. Obviously, we will have to find other ways with which to do that. One way or the other, we are going to continue to work to see if we can resolve these difficulties. I appreciate very much the majority leader's effort to get us to this point.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have spoken many times to my colleagues in this body about the importance of agriculture in America. It is certainly one of the most valuable industries in my home state of South Dakota and is clearly essential to the economy and well-being of the entire United States. 
   Undoubtedly, farming has always been a difficult job. But, consistent with the industrious spirit of America, there have always been dedicated young men and women who have been willing to face the challenge of growing the food for this country. And even during tough times, there have been young Americans who are willing to answer the call to one of the most noble vocations in our country--they want to be farmers. 
   Last week, the Future Farmers of America hosted their seventy-second annual national convention in Lexington, Kentucky. Nearly 50,000 future farmers and their guests, including a number of young South Dakotans, gathered to exchange ideas, develop leadership skills and to have a frank discussion about the future of family farming. 
   Mr. President, I'm proud to report that, of the hundreds of local FFA chapters from across the country, and of the thousands of participants nationwide, the Future Farmers of America chapter from Garretson, South Dakota was named National FFA Chapter of the Year. Chapter members Brian Cooper, Gary Kringen, Mitch Coburn, Amanda Dorman, and their adviser Ed Mueller have spent countless hours working on projects ranging from promoting economic development in rural communities to providing lessons in farm safety to elementary students. Their hard work and dedication to the future of agriculture is a heartening sign that there will be a future generation of farmers to work the land and raise the food for this great country. 
   I want to offer my most sincere congratulations to the members of the Garretson chapter of the Future Farmers of America on receiving this great honor. These young people have earned the admiration and respect of their community and the entire state of South Dakota. Brian, Gary, Mitch, and Amanda remind us that outstanding young people are willing to commit themselves to farming--one of the most challenging, rewarding, and important careers they could choose.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation we have had on both sides of the aisle to get to this point. A number of Senators have expressed a desire to offer amendments and to change, in some way, the package as it has been presented and passed this morning. We will work with our colleagues to find ways in which to address many of these issues, whether it is in conference or on other vehicles. 
   There are a number of issues I care about as well, and I share the concerns expressed to me by some of our colleagues. It is very important that before the end of the session we pass this legislation out and get to conference within a time where we might be able to move it further along. 
   I strongly support the action the Senate has just taken. My only regret is that these matters aren't permanent law and that they require extension at all. There should come a time when we pass them permanently so we aren't required to come back year after year. Having said that, again, I appreciate the work of the majority leader. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the President's new proposal entitled the Strengthen Social Security and Medicare Act of 1999. 
   I send it to the desk. 
   It lays out steps we need to take to protect Social Security and Medicare for future generations. It has a number of key provisions that I will enumerate. 
   I look forward to the time in the not too distant future when I will come back with a number of our colleagues to talk at greater length about the importance of this bill and what it includes. It devotes the entire Social Security surplus to debt reduction. That is one of the most important features of the bill. 
   We recognize how critical it is that we ensure the viability of the trust fund for as long as we can. We also recognize it isn't mutually exclusive to want to extend the viability of the trust fund and pay off the public debt at the same time. 
   Therefore, what this legislation will do is first pay off all of the public debt. It will eliminate the publicly held debt by the year 2015, reducing the debt by $3.1 trillion over the next 15 years. 
   It then devotes the entire savings, which otherwise would have been spent on the interest on that debt, to the Social Security trust funds. The real savings generated in the year 2011 alone, according to the Office of Management and Budget, will be $107 billion. 
   This is a remarkable bill and one of which I am very excited to introduce. First, we pay off the debt; second, we dedicate to Social Security the interest that would otherwise have been going to pay interest on the debt. We not only have eliminated the public debt, we have lengthened the viability of the trust fund. 
   The President's plan extends the life of the trust fund in this manner by almost 20 additional years, to the year 2050. This extension of solvency is not conjecture. It is not something we wish will happen under this plan. Independent Social Security actuaries have confirmed this plan extends the solvency of the Social Security trust fund until the year 2050. 
   What a remarkable accomplishment. First, we will have paid off the publicly held debt; second, we will have extended solvency by 16 years. 
   We also do something else with this legislation. Obviously, it is important to extend solvency. But if the program is not reformed, we have not done enough. There are things we can do to strengthen and modernize another aspect of the entire retirement infrastructure we have in place today. That infrastructure has three legs: Social Security, Medicare, and private insurance, or retirement plans. 
   We will address private retirement issues in other legislation. 
   This bill addresses the two main governmental pillars of Social Security retirement: Social Security and Medicare. 
   It creates a real lockbox to further protect the trust funds both for Social Security and Medicare by extending the budget enforcement rules, including pay-as-you-go budget requirements from here on out. 
   There have been a number of debates on the Senate floor, and we talked in recent weeks about whether or not we are ever going to enact a lockbox. Unfortunately, the majority leader has chosen to fill the amendment tree--that is to preclude Democratic amendments in the debate on the lockbox; that has precluded our ability entirely to offer an amendment which says we ought not only lock up the Social Security trust fund, we ought to lock up the Medicare trust fund, too, because it, too, is a trust fund upon which our seniors depend. 
   This legislation includes a long-supported lockbox, but it also contains no trap door. The Republican version contained a trap door that allowed Social Security surpluses to be used for any purpose, including tax cuts, that could be labeled as Social Security reform. 
   There it is. In addition to ensuring we pay down the debt, in addition to ensuring we provide for 16 additional years of solvency, this bill provides a real lockbox without a trap door for Social Security and for Medicare. 
   I think it is important we set the record straight when it comes to this proposal. This has been the product of an extraordinary amount of work within the White House, within the administration, working with Democrats in Congress. 
   Republicans claim they have found religion when it comes to Social Security. The CBO clarified what is happening right now on Social Security with the letter provided yesterday. They said if the budget and the appropriations bills pass as are now contemplated and as are now drafted, we  will be using $17.1 billion of Social Security trust funds. Those aren't our words; those are the words of the Congressional Budget Office. They said if we were going to offset the need to use Social Security trust funds, we would have to cut across the board 4.8 percent to accommodate the increases in investments and spending across the board in the 13 appropriations bills. 
   There shouldn't be any doubt about who it is that is drawing down the Social Security trust fund this year before we even have a lockbox, before we even have real Social Security and Medicare reform. That is why this legislation is necessary. We have a rare opportunity to extend the life and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, to pay off the publicly held debt in 15 years, and to provide meaningful reform to both Social Security and Medicare in a way that will absolutely guarantee that baby boomers, when they retire, will be able to count on Social Security and on Medicare in a debt-free country. 
   It doesn't get much better than that as a goal, as a set of proposals. I am hopeful in this Congress before the adjournment date next session this legislation will become the focus of a good debate. This legislation will be not only considered but given an opportunity for a good vote, an opportunity for careful consideration. Let it be amended if it be the will of the Senate, but let's debate it. Let's get on with it. Let's commit it to law. Let's send a clear message to the American people, we as Republicans and Democrats, and support eliminating the public debt. We support extending the solvency and the viability of both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. 
   We can do that with the bill we are introducing today, and I hope it is done.

   Mr. DASCHLE. That is exactly what I am saying. I think it is important for us to depoliticize the issue to ensure we find ways to address meaningful reform that will pass and will be signed into law. 
   I am concerned. The Senator from Nevada mentioned ``getting religion.'' I am concerned that, while it is important to have religion, it is important to follow the practices of religion--if this is how we are going to characterize this new-found sensitivity to Social Security and Medicare--the facts do not comport with the current expressions of devotion to Social Security. The facts are, the Republican budget raids the Social Security trust fund by $17 billion, as was indicated, again, yesterday in the letter from the Congressional Budget Office. 
   The facts indicate that there is a trap door in the lockbox proposed by Republicans that would actually allow any proposal to draw on the Social Security surplus, so long as you call it Social 
   Security reform. You could call a tax cut Social Security reform, and it would qualify under the lockbox proposal made by our Republican colleagues. Call it reform and it opens the lockbox. That is the key. 
   We used to have skeleton keys when I was young. The Republican lockbox has a skeleton key that would fit in any door. We need to get rid of these skeleton keys. We need to get on with real lockbox reform. We need to lock up Medicare as well; we need to make sure we are not going to use the $17 billion of trust fund money currently included in this budget. We need to do that and that is what this proposal will do today.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator makes a very important point for the record, and we ought to make it daily. They are turning facts on their head. The accusation is the Democrats won't allow a vote on the lockbox. What is really true is we are not allowed a vote on our own amendment when it comes to the lockbox. Our view is, it is important if we are going to have a debate on the lockbox that we all have the opportunity to offer amendments. You cannot have a meaningful debate without a meaningful opportunity to offer amendments. That is all we are protesting. Certainly, the Republican majority can understand that.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last 2 years I have been working closely with a number of my colleagues to develop a package of tax incentives to foster domestic energy alternatives and thus help reduce our growing dependence on imported oil. Along with those colleagues, I am pleased today to introduce the Energy Security Tax Act of 1999, and I am hopeful that Congress will enact this legislation in the near future. 
   Despite periodic efforts by Congress to address this problem, since the oil price shocks of the 1970s, we have seen our dependence on foreign oil continue to grow. Today, our Nation's energy supply is more vulnerable than ever to events taking place in countries far from our shores. Solving this problem will require the collective efforts of all our Nation's energy producers. 
   The legislation we have developed is correspondingly ambitious in its scope.  It encompasses a broad range of technologies, representing the diverse regions and resources of the country. Farmers will benefit from the provisions modifying the existing tax incentive for small ethanol producers, so that farmer-owned cooperatives can utilize it, and by the establishment of tax credits for efficient irrigation equipment, conservation tillage expenses, and anaerobic digesters that convert manure and crop waste into useful gas. The legislation will encourage the development of biomass-based electric power industries, which will provide a market for wide range of biomass, including switchgrass, crops and crop residues, and wood waste. 
   We are proposing to extend the wind energy tax credit, so that we can more fully develop the wind power potential of States from California to the Dakotas to New England. Coal miners from West Virginia to Montana will benefit as a result of the tax incentives for repowering or replacing older coal-fired power plants with more efficient technology. Steelmakers will become more competitive through the use of tax incentives for more energy-efficient processes and for the production of energy from cogeneration. Hawaiian ethanol producers will be encouraged to utilize bagasse--a sugar cane residue--thereby converting a potential waste into a useful fuel. 
   Oil and gas producers in States like New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma will benefit from incentives for greater domestic production. Business owners will be able to use the new incentives to make investments in energy-efficient property, thereby reducing energy costs and improving competitiveness. Homeowners throughout the country will benefit from new incentives designed to encourage the installation of renewable and more efficient energy technologies, and by the construction of energy-efficient homes. Americans from all parts of the nation will be encouraged to use environmentally friendly electric and hybrid vehicles. 
   There is an old saying: The time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining. While we are fortunate now to have adequate supplies of oil, our dependence on foreign nations continues to grow. It is incumbent on U.S. policymakers today to recognize the risks associated with this trend and to prepare the nation for a more secure future. As part of that effort, we should take the first opportunity that presents itself to enact the tax policies necessary to encourage the development of a more diverse and robust domestic energy portfolio, one that will reduce our vulnerability to future oil price shocks and supply shortages. This effort not only will result in greater energy security, it will reduce our balance-of-trade deficit, create domestic jobs, improve air quality, and help limit the emission of greenhouse gases. 
   I hope that all of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this important legislation and will support its timely enactment.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his eloquence and his statement and for his willingness to take the leadership and to provide his name on this legislation. I can think of no one I would rather have in support of legislation of this kind than the senior Senator from West Virginia. 
   As has been noted, he is ``the'' leader, not just ``a'' leader, on coal and on clean coal technology. No one has committed more time, effort, and leadership to the issue than he has. So it was with that appreciation that I asked the distinguished Senator from West Virginia about his willingness to honor me as he did this afternoon. 
   It troubles me, as I know it does him, that this country continues to depend on foreign sources for energy to a far greater degree than it is in our Nation's best interest. If we are ever going to deal with that real dilemma, it seems to me we have to continue to find ways in which to utilize more effectively our own resources. That has been the argument made so passionately and so ably by the Senator from West Virginia now for so long. 
   This legislation would allow us to move closer to the goal that one day we can be more energy self-sufficient, and that we can do so with the recognition of the importance of the environment. It combines two national goals: a clean environment and energy independent. I am hopeful we can see careful consideration of this legislation, and other ideas that we offer in good faith with the expectation that the Senate recognize the importance of these goals and this contribution to those goals. 
   Again, let me thank the distinguished Senator for his kindness, for his leadership, and for the commitment he has made with this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his very important additional comments. 
   We talk a lot about globalization, a globalized economy. We have a globalized diplomatic infrastructure today due to the fact the cold war ended. We have had a globalized environment from the very first day of creation. A globalized environment means that what happens in China, what happens in Asia, what happens in Europe, or Africa, or Latin America, has an effect on what happens here, and vice versa. 
   The Senator from West Virginia makes a very important point. If we are, indeed, globalized, then it seems to me that we ought to share our technology with those countries that may be contributing both favorably and unfavorably to that globalized environment. We ought to provide leadership. They ought to recognize the importance of involvement. He has made that point for some time. I have heard some of his excellent speeches to that effect on the Senate floor. 
   Let us hope we can continue to make progress, and let us hope that maybe this legislation will help us do so even more successfully. 
   Again, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the indulgence of the majority leader and his answers to my questions. I have one other question relating to the trade bills. 
   Obviously, we have attempted to discuss how to proceed for some time. I have made an offer to the majority leader that he has been kind enough to consider; that is, he and I would table amendments that were not relevant to trade but certainly allow for at least a period of time so Senators can offer these amendments, with the idea that they will be debated and tabled shortly after the time they are offered, I am certainly prepared to renew that offer to the majority leader. 
   As he knows, he has made the situation, again, one which would require a procedural vote on cloture rather than a substantive vote on cloture, thereby, again, undermining our ability to finish the bill. 
   I wonder if the majority leader has given any more thought to this suggestion that he and I table these amendments and then move to final passage on trade, as I think we could have done even this week.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just in further clarification, I am wondering--there are really two issues. The majority leader has appropriately articulated one of the concerns he has with regard to finishing the bill. Cloture will do that, if cloture is invoked. 
   I am wondering if the majority leader would entertain tearing the tree down to allow Senators to offer amendments during the time the legislation is pending, thereby at least giving Senators the right to offer amendments, because he would still have the assurance, of course, that the bill--if cloture is invoked--would ripen and would ultimately terminate debate, but he then would cease to make the issue a procedural one. Then it would be one upon substance, which I think would be advantageous for both the majority leader and many of us who work with the administration to see this legislation pass.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader points out a very important problem. If we invoke cloture, there are many important relevant amendments, that I think he and I would probably both support, that are not going to be in order on this legislation. I do not know how we are going to deal with that. I doubt he would be able to get unanimous consent to be able to offer it. I know amendments having to do with Africa, in particular, are in peril if cloture is invoked. So we have compounded the problem both from a relevancy point of view as well as from this procedural problem that we are attempting to work through. 
   You asked the question, When would this occur? I guess I am thinking, under the current circumstances, there would not be any time for it to occur because the vote on cloture would occur as early as Tuesday because that is when the cloture motion ripens. I would be willing to work with the majority leader on an acceptable schedule for such amendments and the filing of cloture were he willing to work to accommodate at least some amendments and the opportunity to deal with this relevancy question that I think, regardless of the circumstances, he would deal with.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Medicaid Eligibility Restoration Act of 1999, which fixes a major problem recently created in the health care safety net. 
   My bill addresses a Medicaid eligibility problem--lack of access to health insurance during the first, and often costliest, month of disability--that was inadvertently caused by a change to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) policy in the 1996 welfare reform law. 
   Let me explain how this Medicaid ``gap month'' problem was created. 
   In 1996, the effective date of application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) was changed to the month following the date when an individual applies for SSI. 
   Before the 1996 change, pro-rated payments began immediately. Since 1996, payments do not begin until the month following original application. 
   This SSI payment change generated a small cost savings for the SSI program and ended the administrative burden of calculating partial month payments, but it also created a problem--a gap month--for Medicaid eligibility that is linked to SSI. 
   For most SSI and Medicaid recipients, this change has resulted in one lost month of Medicaid eligibility, which is a hardship in itself. 
   But those who suddenly become disabled or who are born with a disability face more dire consequences. 
   Because of the 1996 change, they now lose health insurance coverage for what is often their costliest month--their first month of disability. This policy shift has left families with enormous medical bills and hospitals with uncompensated care. 
   The Medicaid Eligibility Restoration Act would end this gap month in Medicaid coverage and would restore the pre-1996 Medicaid eligibility criteria. 
   This issue first came to my attention when I received a letter from Randall Connelly of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 
   His wife, Susan, had recently given birth to premature twins. Tragically, the twins died a few days later. 
   Despite the fact that Randy had a good job, with good health insurance, he still faced unaffordable out-of-pocket medical expenses. Because of the twins' low birth weight, both children were automatically eligible for SSI and Medicaid--or they would have been, if the twins had been born before enactment of the welfare reform law of 1996. 
   In fact, the Connellys were ineligible for any help with their medical bills because of the small 1996 technical change in SSI payment policy. 
   The unfortunate result was that the Connellys were left to cope not only with the loss of their newborn twins, but also with unaffordable hospital bills. 
   Since my communication with the Connellys, I have heard from hospital administrators who have expressed concern on behalf of patients and families who have suddenly found themselves with nowhere to turn during their first weeks of extreme financial hardship and emotional trauma due to disability. 
   Sioux Valley Hospital in Sioux Falls, SD, has reported that 28 newborns were affected during the past year in that one hospital alone. Hospital administrators report that:  
   Delay in Medicaid coverage results in severe hardship for many families........The normal stresses of dealing with a newborn with a serious disability are compounded by the extensive financial demands attendant to medical services provided for that child.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. I have also heard from public health officials who are concerned that public health funds may need to be diverted to address the needs of those who should have been covered by Medicaid--as they were in the past. 
   Some states are able to cover the gap month through other Medicaid categories, such as the ``medically needy'' category and a category for those who meet all the SSI criteria but are not receiving benefits. 
   There are several states, however, that still face the gap month problem. 
   It is difficult for many of these states to address this problem, because, while covering only the gap month may be affordable, adding a whole new Medicaid category is seen as too expensive. 
   There is a simpler, and less expensive way to address the problem: restore the pre-1996 Medicaid eligibility. 
   We must restore health care benefits to those with disabilities who need them and should be eligible for them. 
   The gap month is not a difficult problem to fix. 
   A solution only requires our attention and our commitment to protecting the health care safety net. My bill does that by ensuring Medicaid helps cover those facing unexpected disability. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the assistant Democratic leader, for his willingness to allow me the opportunity to talk a little bit more about why we are here. 
   We are stalled for one reason: The majority leader has again, for the seventh time now, filled the tree, precluding 45 Democrats from offering amendments. That is why we are here. And on two other occasions this year, the majority leader preemptively filed cloture on measures immediately after calling them up--and then proceeded to other business in order to prevent amendments or debate. So nine times so far this year, the majority leader has said, well, we are going to decide which amendments are offered, we are going to decide which amendments are passed, we are going to decide what kind of role you as Senators ought to have, and we will tell you that you are not going to be able to offer amendments. We are going to decide, in other words, whether to gag you and to lock you out of the legislative process to which you were elected as a representative of the people. 
   It began on March 8, 1999, on the so-called Education Flexibility Act. The bill was offered, the majority leader was recognized, and the tree was filled, locking out every single Democrat from their right to offer amendments to the Education Flexibility Act. 
   He chose to do it again on April 22 on the Social Security lockbox. He said: We are going to have an up-or-down vote, and it is going to be our lockbox or none at all. We said: What about Medicare? What about locking up the Medicare trust fund? They said: No, you can't offer that amendment; we are going to fill the tree and preclude you from offering amendments on the Social Security lockbox. And, again, the issue was shelved. 
   On April 27, 1999, the Y2K Act, an extremely complex and very difficult issue, the majority leader came to the floor and filled the tree, precluded Democratic amendments, and said it is take it or leave it. 
   April 30, again he apparently tries to make the point that Social Security lockbox is important to Republicans--as long as Democrats don't have the opportunity to offer an amendment. Again, we said: We would like to offer an amendment on Medicare. Again, our Republican colleagues said: It is our bill or no bill. At that point, it went from becoming the Republican lockbox to, as our colleague from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, said this morning, the Republican ``squawk box.'' 
   On June 15, 1999, the ``squawk box'' was debated again. Again, the majority leader offered the bill, filled the tree, precluded Democratic amendments, and the lockbox was shelved. 
   On July 16, Republicans used the ``squawk box'' approach again, claiming to be interested in getting the bill passed, precluding Democratic amendments on Medicare. 
   On June 16, in a similar situation, they did it again. They called up a House bill, the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Act, filed cloture, and went off the bill to other business. And then, on September 21, the most recent effort by the majority leader and the majority to lock out Democratic amendments, they brought up the bankruptcy reform bill, filed cloture, and moved on to another bill, precluding Democratic amendments. 
   I only recite the litany of occasions when the majority leader filled the tree in order to make clear how objectionable this coercive tactic really is. For those who are not familiar with 
   parliamentary jargon, ``filling the tree'' is a procedure that the leader can use to offer multiple amendments and thereby fill all of the available amendment slots that a bill has under the Senate rules, precluding any Senator from offering an amendment. That is what filling the tree is all about. Together with the practice of preemptively filing cloture, which has the same effect, it has been done now on nine separate occasions. The sad thing about it being done on this bill is that it plays right into the hands of the opponents of the legislation. 
   The opponents are very grateful to Senator LOTT and the majority for filling the tree because it certainly makes  it easy. It turns the issue away from whether or not one supports CBI to whether or not one supports a Senator's right to be a full participant in this Senate Chamber on this or any other bill. It ceases to become substantive and becomes a matter of individual Senator's rights. 
   Well, because I want this bill passed so badly and because I know it is one of the highest priorities for the administration, because I think this legislation has languished too long, because I think there is a real chance we can get this legislation passed and signed into law, going into conference with our House colleagues, I made an offer yesterday that was unprecedented since I have been leader. I said to the majority leader that if he would agree to allow us to offer on other legislation some of the amendments contemplated on this legislation, I would be prepared to work with him to table amendments on this bill. That is remarkable. It wasn't without a great deal of concern for protecting Senators' rights that I offered this latest proposal. 
   I draw a distinction between protecting a Senator's right to offer an amendment and supporting whatever amendment a Senator chooses to offer. I might not support an amendment on this particular bill, as important as some of these issues might be, but I will fight to protect every Senator's right to offer it. But there is a very important caveat here, and I think it needs to be emphasized. I insisted that we must have the opportunity to at least offer these amendments on another bill. 
   We have to have an opportunity, for example, to offer minimum wage on the bankruptcy bill when it comes up. The majority leader again said no. The problem, as we have said on so many occasions, is that there are those on the majority side who want this Senate to be a second House of Representatives. They want this body to act and to proceed as if it were the House of Representatives. That is the problem. 
   The amazing irony is that our Republican colleagues never dreamed of asking for this kind of procedural constraint, this kind of enslaved approach to legislation, when they were in the minority. They had no trouble offering extraneous amendments that were not necessarily relevant to a particular bill when they were in the minority. Of course not. The amazing thing is Democrats did not insist on a procedural constraint of the magnitude our Republican colleagues are now demanding. 
   Why? Because we had the confidence when a bill came to the floor that we would have a good debate, we would take all comers, we would table amendments that we didn't support, and we would offer second-degree amendments that we thought would be approved. We used all of the tools available to us. And this Senate acted like a Senate. 
   This Senate isn't acting like a Senate today. This is a sham. This is a terrible excuse for this body. This should not happen. We should not have to come pleading for the right to do what we were elected to do. And it happens over and over--almost once a month this year. 
   I am telling you, we are losing some of the institutional tradition here. We are seeing the erosion of an extraordinarily important body and the rights incorporated within that body. Who today could, without smiling, argue that this is the most deliberative body? Who could say with a straight face, yes, this is still the world's most deliberative body? I daresay no one could say that. There is nothing deliberative about the Senate today. They want to make this a legislative assembly line. You take something up, you vote it up or down, and you move it along. 
   I am surprised we don't have a conveyor belt somewhere on the lower part of the floor where we just kind of say yes and no, yes and no, as bills on the conveyor belt come through--no debate, no deliberation; let's move them out. 
   This isn't what our Founding Fathers expected of us. They expected more. They put the rights in the hands of Senators to say: No, let's slow down on the legislation; or, I want to be able to offer an amendment. And I don't care whether it is a farm bill to a peace treaty. We want to have the opportunity to deliberate in the most deliberative body. Rubber stamping doesn't work around here. We have only had a handful of amendable vehicles--just a handful. 
   The response from the majority leader to my offer suggests that there may never be another amendable vehicle in this session of Congress--with no amendments on this bill, no amendments on any other bill. That is what the Republicans want. The results of doing business this way is remarkable. 
   We talk about a legislative landfill. I am telling you, I have never seen a legislative landfill of the magnitude we have today. We keep throwing bills into the legislative landfill, and that landfill keeps getting larger. 
   This has been the biggest legislative graveyard I have seen since coming to Congress. Republicans get elected to prove 
   government doesn't work, and they prove it every day. When they are in control, they prove that government doesn't work because they don't want it to work. They don't want minimum wage. They don't want a Patients' Bill of Rights. They don't want good gun legislation. They don't want a Medicare prescription drug bill. They don't want legislation that moves this country forward. They don't want it. They don't want to admit it. They ought to admit it. 
   We are not going to be a part of this. We are going to stick up for our rights. We are going to amend legislation when it comes to the floor. We are going to go back into that legislative landfill and one by one we are going to recycle, because I am telling you that is what this Senate and this country needs. We are going to recycle the Patients' Bill of Rights until it is done right. We are going to recycle minimum wage. We are going to recycle the gun legislation. We are going to recycle farm legislation. We are going to recycle every single bill the Republicans insist on burying, and we are going to keep coming back because that is what we were elected to do. That is what we are going to do. That is what we believe in doing. 
   I have to say I am disappointed. I am about as patient a person as I think I can be, but I lose my patience, and I get angry and frustrated at the level of duplicity and the extraordinary encumbrances that the majority demands of this body each and every day we legislate. This is wrong. 
   I am not proud to be in the Senate when I can't legislate as a Senator. I am not proud when we tear away the pillars of the Senate institution. I am not proud when I can't go to the public and say, yes, I am one of the 100 Members of the greatest deliberative body in the world. I am not proud about that. For however long I am here, I would like to be proud of the fact that, as a Senator, I lived up to the traditions and the practices and the extraordinary honor that comes with being a Senator. But that isn't happening today. 
   I left the House of Representatives 12 years ago for a good reason. I thought I could do more here. I thought I could play a bigger role here. I thought the Senate was where a Senator could really legislate. It was true in 1987. It was true in 1992. It was true all the way up until recently when slowly but most assuredly date by date, bill by bill, in filling the tree and using other devices, this majority leader said no. No. We are going to be a House of Representatives. Forget regular order. Regular order says you can offer amendments. We are not going to have regular order in the Senate. We are going to have narrow order, or no order at all, as the case may be. 
   What order is there when Senators can't offer amendments and we are stymied for 2 days? Do you realize how many bills we could have finished, or how many amendments we could have finished in just the last couple of days? We probably could go to final passage with the number of Senators who support this legislation by the end of the week. But here we are stymied once again. 
   We haven't passed the Social Security lockbox. That is part of the legislative landfill because we have filled the tree. 
   We haven't been able to pass anything where the majority leader has filled the tree until he has torn the tree down. That is the case here as well. 
   We will never let this legislation pass if we can't offer an amendment, not because we don't support it--I strongly support it--but because I also even  more strongly support the right of every single Senator to be partners in the legislative process.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California puts her finger right on the issues I omitted, and rightfully so. One year ago, we all had a bipartisan agreement and celebrated the fact we were going to reduce class size. How ironic it is now, after all the celebration, that in just 12 months Republicans have had a change of heart. Now, apparently, class size is no longer an issue. Now, apparently, it is OK to have kids in classrooms with 35, 40, 50 children. It doesn't matter. The Senator is right about that. 
   The Senator is also right about judges. I don't know how anyone can look Judge Paez in the eye and say he got a fair deal. I don't know how Members tell anybody who has had to wait for more than 3 years that this system is fair. I don't know how Members tell the Hispanic community we are being equally as fair with them as we are with all non-Hispanic judges when that simply is not true. If one is in a minority, that person has a bigger contest in getting confirmed. That is a fact. I won't deal with all the perceptions that creates, but it is wrong. Hispanic or non-Hispanic, African American or non-African American, woman or man, it is wrong not to have a vote on the Senate floor. 
   What are they afraid of? What are they afraid of? What is wrong with a vote? There is something wrong in our system when somebody has the right to tell somebody who is willing to commit him or herself to public service that we are going to make that person wait 3 1/2 years just to get a vote. We are not going to tell them what is wrong. We are not going to say if there is something wrong in their background. We are not going to debate whether they have qualifications or not. We are going to make them wait, and hopefully they will go away. Hopefully, they will go away. 
   What does that say? What does that say about the intentions of people on the other side? Go away. Don't make any noise. 
   That is wrong. That is worse than a legislative landfill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. He gave a perfect illustration of how they are being hurt on health care. I think he is also right that it is important to try to put this in terms the American people understand. This has to do with more than just procedure. We are talking procedure, and sometimes I may get too engrossed in my own procedural frustration to try to ensure that we talk about this in ways the American people fully understand. 
   If anyone out there today has been ripped off by an insurance company or has been denied care by a hospital or doctor because they are being told by the insurance company they cannot do it, those people are affected by what is happening this afternoon on the floor, one of the thousands of people who have been adversely affected by our inability to have a good debate. Anyone out there who has a child in a classroom with 35 or 40 kids is affected by what is going on right now. 
   If anyone out there has been affected by some crime in the neighborhood because we haven't fully funded the COPS Program, then, by golly, those Americans are affected dramatically by what has happened right now. If anyone is out there working at lousy minimum wage and can't make ends meet, they are affected by what is happening right now because the other side doesn't want a minimum wage increase--not this year, not ever. If they did, they would have supported it a long time ago. If anyone out there wonders why this is all going on, turn the pages of the calendar back 2 weeks and find out it was their side that defeated campaign finance reform and we are affected by what is happening right now. 
   Don't let anybody out there, I don't care what issue, think this is not relevant. 
   The assistant Democratic leader probably made the best illustration. I think our people are in greater danger today than they have ever been before to the exposure of greater nuclear proliferation because of what the Senate did 3 weeks ago. You are affected by it. You are affected by it. 
   This is more than procedure. This is what is going on here and how affected we are by it. This has everything to do with why we got elected in the first place, because we wanted to come down and fight for these issues. It is more than whether we can offer an amendment, it is whether we pass the amendment. It is whether we do something good for this country, for whatever limited time we are here. That is what this is about. 
   We came to fight. We came to fight for the things in which we believe: A better minimum wage, more teachers, a good health care system, an end to nuclear proliferation, a safer neighborhood, a better minimum wage--things  about which people today can only dream. That is what we came to fight for. There are opportunities for debates about things; there ought to be. 
   We have to decide what kind of body this is going to be. Those who wish for the rules of the House ought to go to the House. To understand the 200-year tradition of the Senate, pull open this drawer. I see some wonderful names, names in some cases that have been there for generations. These people, the people in my drawer, fought for the same things I am fighting for right now. These people fought for health care, these people fought for better working conditions for families, these people fought for a safer neighborhood, these people fought for the arms control agreements of their day. They fought. They were not handcuffed. They were not gagged. They were not confined to a legislative straitjacket. They fought valiantly, and today we sing their praises as the legislative leaders and giants of old. 
   We want to fight. We want to be part of this process. We want to be able to pass this institution onto the next generation of Senators and say: Welcome to the greatest deliberative body in the world.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois has raised an important question. On the issue of bankruptcy, the answer is absolutely yes. 
   My initial position on bankruptcy was, we ought to have the opportunity to offer amendments, relevant or nonrelevant. We ought to use regular order--I should say that. We ought to use the regular order of the Senate in taking up a bill. That is what my suggestion was. 
   The majority leader said: No, we cannot do that. 
   So I said: What about offering at least five amendments that may not be directly related to bankruptcy but are important to Democrats? 
   He said: No, we can't do that. 
   I said: What about offering three amendments that are important to Democrats that may not be directly related to bankruptcy, requiring that all Senators file all relevant amendments prior to a certain time? 
   I am told now the majority leader cannot do that. 
   So, inch by inch, step by step, the majority wants to rob you and rob every single Member on this side of the aisle of your right to be a full partner in the Senate. 
   We all want to be able to move legislation. I will agree with some, disagree with others. Ultimately, if the Senator from Illinois is right and we are able to close the gap on bankruptcy with some good amendments, I will be supportive of that legislation. I expect to be. But I also expect you will have a right to offer an amendment.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois recalls and I recall our wonderful colleague very well. No one was sharper, more energetic, brighter, better liked in our caucus in the House than Mike Synar. He said that and a lot of other truthful things. He was right. 
   It makes me wonder what people are afraid of. What in the world are Senators afraid of, bringing up and debating an amendment? We used to do that all the time. I can recall so many occasions when we had to come down to the floor and table an amendment that might have had immediate popularity but was not good for the country. We did that. We tabled amendments. We second-degreed them. 
   Again, I am getting into ``beltway speak'' here, but the bottom line is, we respected Senators' rights to fight for the things they cared about, to fight for the things for which the people sent them to fight. 
   The Senator from Illinois has done that on an array of issues. Every Senator on this floor has come with a certain agenda and a belief they could make a difference. But how do you make a difference if you do not have a voice? How do you make a difference when you do not have an opportunity to legislate? How do you make a difference when you are really shoved back into the mentality and the constraints of the House of Representatives when you are a Senator? That is not what the people of our States and this country sent us to do.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the majority leader's desire to finish this legislation. I have indicated publicly I want to work with him to find a way to resolve the matters that are outstanding so we can get to final passage. It is regrettable that the tree was filled before a single amendment could be debated and disposed. The majority  leader and I have had conversations in the past, and he is, I am sure, sensitive to the knowledge that this tactic compels Democrats to oppose cloture in order to protect the right of Members to offer an amendment. 
   Filling the tree actually frustrates the majority leader's stated intention of speedy passage. We could have had a number of amendments today. That has been precluded now because we are in this situation where Senators are prohibited from offering amendments. It is pointless to fill the tree now. We could have allowed amendments for at least 2 days while cloture ripened. If amendments and a good debate and votes were allowed, I think we could have built support for cloture. Under the circumstances, however, there will continue to be a pent-up frustration due to the inability on the part of Senators on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. 
   In a sense, filling the tree plays into the hands of the opponents of the legislation. Democrats can never support preemptive filling of the tree or preemptive filing of cloture because I think, in large measure, it is a real affront to the rights of every Senator who wishes to play a part in any debate in this body. While I oppose many of the amendments that could be contemplated and could be offered, I support a Senator's right to offer them. 
   The majority leader said today he believed he only filled the tree once before in 1999. In fact, this is the seventh time this year he has resorted to this approach. There were six previous occasions: March 8, 1999, S. 280, the Education Flexibility Act; April 22, 1999, Social Security lockbox; April 27, 1999, the Y2K Act; April 30, 1999, S. 557, Social Security lockbox; June 15, 1999, Social Security lockbox; and July 16, 1999, Social Security lockbox. 
   In addition, of course, the majority leader has twice preemptively filed cloture on measures immediately after calling them up and then moved to other business in order to prevent amendments or debate. That occurred on June 16, 1999, on H.R. 1259, the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Act, and on September 21, 1999, on S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act. 
   After using these coercive tactics on all of these occasions, I would hope we might learn that they do not work. We do not operate under the rules of the House. We must insist on Senators' rights to offer amendments, even if we ultimately will reject those amendments. 
   That is not to say that dilatory tactics that go on and on are something that I will support. I will support cloture at some point. But I also support strongly the right of a Senator on the other side of the aisle or a Senator on this side of the aisle to offer an amendment, relevant or not relevant, at least initially. 
   I respect the Senator's decisions as I always do. I just differ with him in this case. It seems to me if we want to kill this bill, this is the way to do it. If we want to pass the bill, then it seems to me the majority of Democrats will join with the majority of Republicans in finding a way with which to deal with these amendments and ultimately pass this legislation. We can do it, but if we are going to do it, we have to take down this tree. It has to happen sooner rather than later so we do not waste any more time than we have already. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Let me make the majority leader an offer. 
   He says, if there is a way to work this out, we can do it. I think he could get 30 Democratic votes, maybe even 40, on cloture on Friday if we tear down the tree and allow amendments to be offered. 
   We are talking about two things. We are talking about a Member's right to offer amendments, but we are also talking about the worthiness of the amendment on this particular issue, as the majority leader has stated now on several occasions, rightfully so. 
   I would be willing to join with the majority leader in doing one of two things. Our predecessors came up with some ingenious ways with which leadership can deal with amendments they don't want to see added--tabling motions and second degree amendments. 
   I would be willing to work with the majority leader on tabling motions and on second degrees in order to deal with amendments that he and I do not believe are meritorious. And I can already see the wheels turning. He is thinking: Well, there's going to be a difference between what he thinks and I think. But I believe we can work that out. I think we could have an understanding, even ahead of time, about what that means. But it would give Senator HOLLINGS, it would give Senator WELLSTONE, it would give Senator ASHCROFT, it would give everyone who has an amendment the opportunity to offer amendments. The relevant ones, the pertinent ones, we ought to support. The ones that are not in keeping with the spirit of this legislation, we might choose to oppose. 
   I am prepared to work with the majority leader to see if we might find a way to accommodate that. I want to see this bill pass. The President has insisted that we do all that we can to pass it. Our ranking member and the chairman have done all that they can to get us to this point. It passed by voice vote out of the Finance Committee. There ought to be a way we can get this done, if not in the timeframe that the majority leader has suggested, certainly in not too long a period after that. 
   But I have to oppose cloture under these circumstances. And there will not be, I would hope, a Democratic defection on cloture because we are not talking now about CBI; we are talking about a Member's right to offer an amendment. And I hope there isn't a Democrat who will say that that right isn't worth protecting under any circumstances. 
   So that is my offer. I am prepared to sit down this afternoon. We can find a way to do this. This isn't it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today has been designated by the Senate as a ``Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' Sadly, thus far, the Senate seems indifferent to that fact. 
   Despite repeated acts of gun violence, the conference on the juvenile justice bill, which was convened 77 days ago, has yet to complete its business. While the conference is stalled, more and more children are losing their lives. 
   Every day in the United States, 12 children under the age of 19 are killed with guns--1 child every 2 hours. Every day, three children commit suicide using a firearm. Every day, approximately six children are murdered by gunfire. Between 1979 and 1997, gunfire killed nearly 80,000 children and teens in America, more than the total number of soldiers lost in the Vietnam war. In fact, homicide is the third leading cause of death among children ages 5 to 14. 
   That is why Senator MURRAY and others worked so hard to pass the resolution that declared today, this day, the ``Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' 
   The good news is that the number of children dying from gunfire has declined. Moreover, children across the country are engaged in positive endeavors to rid their communities of violence and to encourage their friends to find peaceful ways to settle disputes. 
   This week, the Democrats in the House of Representatives hosted 300 teenagers from across the country for a conference entitled ``Voices Against Violence.'' At this conference, teens discussed their concerns about violence and explored ideas for addressing this pressing problem. 
   Senate Democrats believe we, in the Senate, must join America's children and do our part to stem that violence. That is why we fought so hard to pass a comprehensive juvenile justice bill that included common sense gun safety provisions, money for programs designed to prevent violence before it occurs, and measures to ensure that those few kids who are truly dangerous are punished appropriately. 
   On May 20th the Senate passed the juvenile justice bill, and on June 17th the House passed their juvenile justice bill. After waiting weeks, on August 5th--77 days ago--the juvenile justice conference had its first and only meeting. Yesterday marked the 6-month anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, and it is time for the stalling to stop. 
   The Y2K legislation conference report was produced 14 days after the Senate passed the bill, and the Republican tax cut conference report was produced only 5 days after the Senate voted on that package. Why don't we have the same commitment to producing legislation to combat youth violence? 
   The conference should be working around the clock to produce a bill the  President can sign before the end of this session. We ought to use this day and every day to ensure that this juvenile justice bill is passed and to ensure that we live up to the expectations of all who said on the day when we passed the ``Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence" legislation that it was more than just words, it was more than just a rhetorical commitment, it meant sincerely that the Senate was serious about addressing this issue. Indeed, we remind our colleagues that thus far, our children have waited too long. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. There are two parts to the majority leader's request. The first is that he move to proceed to Calendar No. 300, S..1692, which is the partial-birth abortion bill. The second is the unanimous-consent agreement involving the request by a number of Senators to be heard. I have no objection to Senators being heard. I question why we need to move to proceed to Calendar No. 300, when we simply could do so by a unanimous-consent request, thereby not taking off the table and off of consideration the campaign finance reform bill. I will, therefore, ask unanimous consent that we simply allow the partial-birth abortion bill to be taken up, thereby precluding the need to vote on the motion to proceed and thereby protecting the current position of the campaign finance reform bill. 
   I personally would love to have the full debate that we were promised on campaign finance reform. The amendments are pending. There ought to be a vote on the Reid amendment. I would like to have a vote on my amendment. Even though we did not get cloture, we ought to have that debate. 
   There are other Senators who have yet to be heard on this issue. We have not had the 5 days committed. We have not had the opportunity to vote on these issues. 
   I ask unanimous consent that we simply take up partial-birth abortion so we can return to this issue once that issue has been resolved.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very troubled by the majority leader's decision. There is no reason why we have to move to proceed to the partial-birth abortion bill. It is a bill that I will probably end up supporting. So this decision about whether or not we support or oppose partial-birth abortion, we will have a good debate about that and amendments will be offered. This is a question of whether or not we are going to keep our word, whether or not we are going to have the opportunity to finish the debate on campaign finance reform, whether or not we are going to have the opportunity to offer amendments. That is what this is about. 
   So nobody ought to be misled. Do we finish our business? Do we follow through with commitments? Do we have a good debate or not? The majority leader said no. No, we won't have a debate on campaign finance reform. No, we won't keep the commitments made with regard to how long this bill will be debated. That is wrong. A number of us--unanimously on this side and some on that side--want to make sure the RECORD clearly indicates our anger, our disappointment, and our determination to come back to this issue.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Michigan is exactly right. If we would proceed to the partial-birth abortion bill by unanimous consent, the pending issue would continue to be campaign finance reform. By moving to proceed to the partial-birth abortion bill, we then relegate the campaign finance reform bill back to the calendar. That is what we want to avoid. That is unnecessary. 
   I think the American people are trying to sort this out and figure why we are doing this. The reason we are doing this is not because they want to take up partial-birth abortion alone; it is because they don't want to continue the debate on campaign finance reform. That is what this action actually telegraphs to the American people.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Michigan is exactly right. We are not passing judgment on the issue of partial-birth abortion; there will be people on either side of it. But what we are united about, regardless of how one feels on partial-birth abortion--at least on this side of the aisle--is that every single Democrat believes we ought to stay on this bill. Every single Democrat wants to assure that we don't violate the understanding that the Senate had about how long we would be on this legislation, and whether or not we would be able to proceed with amendments and have a good debate. So you are absolutely right. There is no question, by going to unanimous consent,  we preclude the need to move off of this bill and put the bill back on the calendar. We don't want that to happen.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Thomas Paine, the famed orator of the American Revolution, once offered an explanation for why corrupt systems last so long. He said:  
   A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises, at first, a formidable cry in defense of custom.  
   That is certainly true of the way we pay for campaigns in this country. Our reliance on special interest money to run political campaigns is such an old habit that for a long time it had the superficial appearance of being right but not anymore. 
   While there is still a vocal minority who deny it, a clear majority in this Congress, and an overwhelming majority of the American people, know that our current campaign finance system is broken. 
   The American people understand that special-interest money too often determines who runs, who wins, and how they govern. 
   Opponents of change tell us that no one cares much about campaign finance reform. 
   I believe they're mistaken. 
   I believe the tide has turned. 
   Instead of hearing a ``formidable cry in defense of custom,'' to use Tom Paine's expression, what we are hearing now is a growing demand for change. 
   One of the newest voices demanding change belongs to a group of more than 200 CEOs of major corporations. They call themselves the Committee for Economic Development, and many of them are Republican. They're pushing for a ban on soft money because, they say, they're ``tired of being shaken down'' by politicians looking for campaign contributions. 
   They, like the rest of America, will be watching this debate, Mr. President. 
   Another reason I believe the tide has turned is because this election cycle has gotten off to such an ominous start. 
   At both the Presidential and congressional level, we are on pace to shatter all previous records. 
   During the first six months of this year, soft money donations--the unlimited, unregulated contributions to political parties--were already 80 percent above where they were at this point in the last Presidential election cycle, in 1995. 
   There really are no limits any more, Mr. President. We all know that. 
   The current system is more loophole than law. 
   Opponents argue that our Constitution forbids us from correcting the worst abuses in the system. I disagree with their pinched interpretation of our Constitution. In any case, I believe our conscience demands that we at least try to fix the system. 
   And so during this debate, Senator TORRICELLI and I, and others, will offer the Shays-Meehan plan. 
   As I said, I have great admiration and respect for what Senator FEINGOLD and Senator MCCAIN have attempted to achieve. But I believe we can--and must--go further than their bill now allows. 
   Shays-Meehan is fair. It does not place one party or another at an advantage. It treats incumbents and challengers in both parties fairly. 
   Shays-Meehan is bipartisan. 
   Shays-Meehan is passable. It has already passed the House. It is signable. The President will sign it into law. 
   Most importantly, Shays-Meehan is comprehensive. Not only does it ban unregulated ``soft money'' to political parties--the biggest loophole in the current system--it also prevents soft money from being re-channeled to outside groups for phony ``issue ads.'' 
   This is critically important, Mr. President. 
   Spending on sham ``issue ads'' by advocacy groups and special interests more than doubled between the '96 and '98 election cycles--to somewhere between $275 million and $340 million. 
   A 1997 study by the respected Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania found that phony ``issue ads'' are nearly identical to campaign ads--with two exceptions. The ``issue ads'' are more attack-oriented and personal. And, it is harder to identify the sponsor. These ads epitomize the negative campaigning--without any accountability--the public so dislikes. 
   Shays-Meehan closes the ``issue ad'' loophole. It does so by applying existing rules to ads targeting specific candidates that are run by advocacy groups within 60 days of an election. 
   It does not silence anyone. It merely says, if you want to participate in the election process, you have to follow the rules. 
   In addition to closing the ``soft money'' and ``issue ad'' loopholes, Shays-Meehan makes two other important changes. 
   First, it provides for expanded and speedier disclosure of both campaign contributions and expenditures--plus, stiffer penalties for anyone who violates the requirements. 
   Second, it bans direct and indirect foreign contributions to political campaigns. 
   Shays-Meehan won a bipartisan majority in the other body, Mr. President. It deserves the same in this Senate. 
   When a person gives money to a judge who is deciding his case, we call that bribery. But when special interests give money to politicians who vote on bills that help or hurt them, we call that ``business as usual.'' 
   Some mistakenly call it ``free speech.'' 
   Let's be very clear: Shays-Meehan is not an attack on free speech. It advances free speech by ensuring that those with the biggest checkbooks are not the only voices that are heard. 
   Shays-Meehan represents extraordinarily modest reforms. 
   It doesn't fix every problem with our current system. But it bans the worst excesses. 
   It is not a panacea. But it is a credible and necessary first step in rebuilding people's trust in government. 
   I have no doubt we will hear a great deal over the next few days about abuses of the current system.  
   There are abuses--on both sides of the aisle. That's why we're having this debate. 
   But it's not enough just to decry the abuses. If you're really outraged by the abuses, fix the system that invites them. 
   Defenders of the status quo have tried to dissuade some of us from supporting real reform by warning how much it might cost us in lost campaign contributions. 
   What about how much the current system costs us in lost credibility? 
   Listen to this quote:  
   Senators and Representatives, faced incessantly with the need to raise ever more funds to fuel their campaigns, can scarcely avoid weighing every decision against the question ``How will this affect my fundraising prospects.'' rather than ``How will this affect the national interest?''  
   Do you know who said that? 
   It wasn't some Pollyanna progressive. 
   That was Barry Goldwater, in 1995. 
   And even if we don't make those kinds of calculations, it doesn't matter. No one has to prove that money influences our votes. It's damaging enough that people believe money influences our votes. 
   There are other ways the current system costs us as well. Like the cost of endless fundraising. The demeaning, demanding money chase. 
   In 1998, it cost an average of $4.9 million to run a successful Senate campaign. 
   To raise that kind of money, you have to bring nearly $16,000 a week, every week, for 6 years. That is the minimum it takes. Some people have to raise twice that much. 
   And we all know what that means. It means we spend hours and hours in campaign offices, dialing for dollars, instead of doing what people sent us here to do. 
   It means running to fundraisers every night--sometimes two and three a night--instead of working on problems that affect families--or maybe just having dinner every once in a while with our own families. 
   But the biggest cost of the current system is the cynicism it produces in people. 
   The American people are disgusted, and they feel disenfranchised, by the current system. 
   Every election cycle, the amount of money goes up, and voting goes down. 
   Defenders of the status quo say we need soft money for ``party building'' activities--like ``get out the vote'' drives. 
   If you really want to get out the vote, get the money out of politics! 
   Pass Shays-Meehan. 
   We expect opponents will use every procedural trick and advantage they can think of to try to block any real reform. They will offer amendments not to strengthen our proposal, but to sink it. 
   They should know: The American people understand that game. They can tell the differences between protecting principles, and protecting partisan advantage. 
   We make this pledge at the beginning of this debate: If Shays-Meehan does not pass, we will do everything we can to build a coalition for real reform. 
   We will work with Senator FEINGOLD and Senator MCCAIN to strengthen their proposal and make it, once again, a comprehensive plan. 
   When you read the history of campaign finance, one of the names that stands out is Mark Hanna. U.S. Senator. Wealthy businessman. Ohio political boss. And head, at the turn of the last century, of his national political party. 
   Mark Hanna is widely credited with being the father of systemic campaign fundraising techniques. 
   He introduced the concept, for instance, of regularly assessing businesses for contributions to his party, based on their ``share in the general prosperity.'' 
   He also introduced the first modern political advertising operation. 
   In 1895, Mark Hanna remarked that ``there are two things that are important in politics. The first is money--and I can't remember what the second one is.'' 
   Mr. President, I believe Senator Hanna got it wrong. Money isn't the most important thing in politics. Integrity is. 
   Integrity is essential to democracy. Without integrity we lose public confidence. And without public confidence, a democratic government loses its ability to function. 
   We all know--whether we will admit it or not--that the current system is broken. 
   I hope we can work together. I hope we can come up with a comprehensive, workable plan to fix it. 
   The currency of politics should be ideas--not cash.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the 2 days since this Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I've heard some of our colleagues insist they are proud of that vote. Frankly, I cannot understand how anyone could say that. 
   I was deeply saddened and troubled when I opened my newspaper yesterday morning. The top headline in the Washington Post read: ``Senate Rejects Test Ban Treaty.'' The headline just below that read: ``For US, Fallout will be Fading Influence.'' 
   How can anyone take pride in actions that increase the threat of nuclear weapons? How can anyone be proud of diminishing America's leadership in the world? How can anyone be proud that they have made the world a more dangerous place for ourselves and our children? 
   For the life of me, I cannot understand that. 
   We knew before we voted that, if we rejected the CTBT, we would almost certainly damage our national security and our standing in the world. We knew both of those things. Our senior military leaders warned us. Outside experts tried to warn us. Our allies tried to warn us. In fact, three world leaders--representing our three oldest and strongest allies--took the unprecedented step of writing an open letter to us. 
   In that letter, published this week in the New York times, Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder implored us: ``As we look to the next century, our greatest concern is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ..... Failure to ratify the CTBT, will be a failure in our struggle against proliferation ..... For the security of the world we will leave to our children, we urge the United States Senate to ratify the treaty.'' 
   Unfortunately, a majority of Senators chose to ignore these warnings. they chose to ignore the serious implications that rejecting the CTBT would have on U.S. security and international standing, and on the safety of the entire world. If there was any doubt, before the vote, that rejecting the CTBT would be a serious mistake, there can be no doubt now. Look at the headlines.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to express my regret at the loss of Ambassador E. William Crotty, U.S. Ambassador to Barbados. Bill assumed his position as ambassador in November 1998, so he had only begun his fine work representing the United States in Barbados and six other eastern Caribbean island nations. I am confident, however, that his contributions in service to his country would have continued and multiplied.  
   I had the great fortune of knowing Bill over the years, and I saw firsthand his deep affection for his family and friends, and his fine work for his community, his party and his country. I am very sorry he will no longer be with us, and I send my condolences to his wife, Valerie, seven children and 14 grandchildren. 
   Bill Crotty was an American success story. He was born in a small town during the Great Depression to a loving family. This set of experiences instilled in him a work ethic and a love of family and community that guided his life. Bill graduated from college and law school, succeeded in the business world and spent years giving back to his community and country. 
   I would like to take a moment to cite some examples of Bill Crotty's work in his community that demonstrate the value of his contributions. He was chair of the Capital Fund Drive for Bethune-Cookman College. He was a member of the Board of Counselors of Bethune-Cookman College. He was chair of the membership drive for the Volusia County Society for Mentally Retarded Children. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the United Fund of Volusia County and of the Richard Moore Community Center, Inc. He was a charter member of W.O.R.C., an organization dedicated to the rehabilitation of the disabled. 
   I could cite more examples, but these help provide a flavor of the kind of person Bill Crotty was. I feel privileged to have known him over the years. As a husband, father and grandfather, as a friend and as a public servant, Bill Crotty will be sorely missed.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am going to use my leader time. I understand I don't have to use a unanimous consent request to obtain the 20 minutes available to me. I will not use the full 20 minutes. 
   My colleagues are going to rise to speak to the treaty itself. Up until now, I have refrained from talking about the deliberations themselves, but I think for the RECORD it is important for us to state how it is we got here. 
   We just cast a vote of profound consequence. The choice that vote presented the Senate this afternoon was quite simple. It was a choice between statesmanship or partisanship. 
   This was not just a procedural motion. Let's begin with that understanding. The motion that just passed on a party line vote was a vote to kill the test ban treaty. What is all the more important--and people should understand--was that there was no requirement that we cast this vote. This vote was not necessary. We did not have to go to executive session. We could have precluded that vote. Nothing on the Executive Calendar would have been affected adversely by allowing the treaty to stay on the Executive Calendar. 
   So everyone ought to understand that. This was a voluntary choice made by the majority leader. 
   That is the first point. 
   The second point relates to how it is we got here. 
   This treaty was submitted, as has been repeatedly stated in the RECORD, on September 22, 1997. Ever since that time, my colleagues on this side of the aisle have requested that there be hearings, that there be some thorough consideration of this very important matter. 
   A number of other countries have already made the decision we were asking this body to make. One-hundred and fifty have signed it. Fifty-one countries have voted already to ratify it. 
   We were asking that there be hearings.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, what Democrats sought, very simply, was complete consideration in all the committees for whatever time it may have taken to ensure we have established the kind of record we established on all the other treaties before we voted on them. That is what we asked. That is what we sought in our letter to the Majority Leader. 
   The Republicans' response was cynical. They proposed we limit debate to 14 hours, that there be one amendment on a side, and that no time be given to  proper hearings. They left us as Democrats the choice: Filibuster the treaty on which we have called for consideration, or accept a unanimous consent agreement. 
   There was one reason that Republicans forced this choice--one reason, and one reason only. It was a partisan attempt to embarrass the President and embarrass Democrats. That was the reason. 
   So it is now clear, based upon a letter being circulated by Senator WARNER and others, that the President should delay consideration of this treaty. Over 51 Senators have now signed a letter circulated by Senators MOYNIHAN and WARNER. Nearly 60 Senators--a majority--have now said we ought to postpone consideration of this treaty. 
   In fact, based upon this clear belief on the part of a majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I encouraged the President to submit a statement asking the Senate to delay the vote. He did. A couple of days ago, he made a formal request that the Senate delay consideration of this treaty until a later date to allow ample consideration of all the questions raised and the tremendous opportunities presented by this treaty. 
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff have made similar requests. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, former Secretaries of Defense, former Chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have all recommended publicly and privately that this treaty consideration be delayed. 
   I added to the voice yesterday. I submitted a letter to the majority leader wherein I was willing personally to commit to hold over on a final vote for the rest of this Congress, barring any unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances as defined by myself and the Majority Leader. We may have seen an example just yesterday of just such a circumstance. What happens in Pakistan, what happens in India, what happens in North Korea, what happens in the Middle East, what happens in Iraq and Iran, what happens in an awful lot of those countries could have a profound effect on the decisions made in the Senate over the course of the next 14 months. 
   Yet it was the view expressed by some in the majority, and now apparently all in the majority, that even in the most extraordinary circumstances, the Senate will not take up this treaty. Now we are left with nothing more than an up-or-down vote on the treaty itself. 
   Now I have heard the latest rumor. In the last couple of hours, we are told that it is article 18 of the Vienna Convention that requires us to act. Mr. President, nothing could be farther from the truth--nothing. Nothing in article 18 requires us to vote. The obligations of a signatory have already attached to the United States and will continue to do so until the President, only the President, makes clear the United States' intent not to become a party. 
   The Senate will not change this by voting the treaty down or suspending its consideration today. So don't let anyone mislead this body about the ramifications of article 18. 
   We find ourselves now at the end of this debate with the recognition on the part of Members in our caucus that, of all of our solemn constitutional responsibilities, there cannot be one of greater import than the consideration of a treaty. And, remarkably, incredibly, no constitutional obligation has been treated so cavalierly, so casually, as this treaty on this day. This is a terrible, terrible mistake. If it's true that politics should stop at the water's edge, it is also true that politics should stop at the door to this chamber when we are considering matters of such grave import. 
   I urge those colleagues who have yet to make up their minds about this treaty to do the right thing; to support it, to recognize the profound ramifications of failure, to pass it today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are close to running out of time. I will use my leader time to make a few comments on the pending conference report. 
   I come to the same conclusion as the distinguished Senator from Iowa, and I would like to elaborate, if I could, briefly on why I have come to that conclusion. 
   I believe we ought to be supportive of this conference report, but I must say I am deeply disappointed that we have to be in this position in the first place. This is a badly flawed bill from many perspectives. I strongly disagree with using the AMTA mechanism as the only mechanism by which we provide resources to those in need. As a result of our reliance on AMTA, there will be thousands of people no longer directly involved in agriculture who are going to get payments of over five and a half billion dollars. Our view is that that is a tragedy, given the limited resources we have available to us and the extraordinary need to ensure that resources are spent in the most prudent fashion. 
   They will not be, in large measure, because of the formula incorporated in this language. 
   I also am very deeply concerned about the fact that there is no loan availability in this bill. There are going to be farmers who are going to be turned away from banks throughout the country. When they are turned away, as is happening on many occasions, farmers go to the Farm Service Agency to ensure they can get the resources they need. 
   Let us be clear. There is no recourse as a result of this legislation. Farmers have no opportunity to get alternative loan availability because there is no money in this bill for loans. For that reason, too, I am very concerned about the deficiencies in this legislation. 
   As most of us know, we have lost a substantial number of our pork producers. The number of pork producers in South Dakota has diminished substantially in recent years. In fact, we have lost a large portion of the percentage of our hog producers in the last year in large measure because of the disastrous crisis they are now facing. There is not $1 in here for livestock producers involved in pork production. As a result, our pork producers have no hope of obtaining any kind of assistance as a result of this legislation. 
   I must say we also are deeply concerned about the impact this legislation could have, if this is the last word on the circumstances those in the Northeast currently are facing. They have experienced serious drought. Other parts of the country have faced other serious farm disasters. The disaster assistance in this package is absolutely unacceptable. The $1.2 billion is a fraction of what will be required if we are going to meet all of the obligations this country should and must meet to address disaster needs, especially in the Northeast, in the coming 12 months. We have an extraordinary deficiency with regard to disaster assistance. 
   As a result of that as well, I am deeply troubled that we are faced with a very untenable choice: vote for this, and get some assistance out to those who will receive it, in time for it to do some good, or do nothing and hope that somehow in some way at some time we can resolve this matter before the end of the session. 
   I sadly come to the conclusion that what we have to do is take what we can get now, to take what we have been able to put in the bank now, and keep fighting to address all of these deficiencies before the end of this session. I have said just now to my colleagues in the Northeast that we will not rest, we will not be satisfied until we have adequately addressed their needs in disaster assistance before the end of this session. We will make that point with whatever vehicles we have available to us, appropriations or otherwise. It is absolutely essential that we provide that assistance before the end of this year and send a clear message that we understand the gravity of their circumstances and are prepared to address it. 
   I might also say that we have to look also at an array of policy considerations. My view is that we are in this box in large measure because we created it ourselves. Those who voted for Freedom to Farm are coming to the realization that clearly this is a situation that has to be resolved through public policy, in new farm policy, with the creation of a safety net, with the creation of market incentives to create more of a balance between supply and demand than what we have right now. 
   That is a debate for another day. We are left with a choice about whether or not we provide $8.7 billion in aid now, as poor as the vehicle may be, to people who need it so badly. I will vote yes, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate formally begins consideration of whether to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, CTBT. Each party to this treaty pledges not to carry out any nuclear weapons tests and to refrain from helping others to carry out such tests. CTBT has been signed by over 150 nations, 51 of which have already ratified the treaty. The question before the Senate now is whether we should join this group in an international effort to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   Although I will have more extensive remarks on the substance of the treaty shortly before the Senate votes, I would like to say a few words now about why I believe the Senate should ratify this important treaty. As in the case of previous arms control agreements, each Senator must ask himself or herself the following series of questions: Is U.S. national security enhanced by Senate ratification of the CTBT? Is this nation better off with the CTBT? Will Senate ratification of CTBT lead to a safer world for our children? 
   In my view Mr. President, the answer to each of these questions is an unequivocal, unqualified yes for one simple, straightforward reason: a world with fewer countries possessing nuclear weapons is a safer, more secure world for our national security interests, our nation and our children. Senate ratification of CTBT will help us achieve just such a world. 
   Opponents of the treaty raise two issues: can we verify that other nations are complying with the treaty and would U.S. compliance with the treaty permit this nation to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent? On the first issue, opponents assert that it is impossible to verify a prohibition of all nuclear tests. Mr. President, let me state now that they are absolutely correct on that point. The intelligence community has confirmed that neither the United States nor the International Monitoring System that would be established under CTBT would ensure the detection of every single nuclear explosion, regardless of size and location. 
   However, this feature is not unique to CTBT. No arms control treaty is 100 percent verifiable. In just the last two decades, the Senate has ratified numerous treaties knowing full well at the time that it would be possible for a country to successfully skirt one provision or another for some period of time or another. The standard for the Senate on previous treaties and the standard we should apply to this treaty is ``effective'' verification. In the case of CTBT, effective verification means we will be able to detect, with a high degree of confidence, any tests that could undermine our nuclear deterrent. After examining the information and analysis provided by our intelligence community, our senior military leaders have testified that we can effectively verify this treaty. 
   Furthermore, with or without CTBT, we need to monitor the nuclear testing activities of other countries and will face the exact same problems people are assigning exclusively to CTBT --with one major difference. In a world of CTBT, the United States would have additional tools at its disposal to determine what has happened. The treaty would permit us to have access to data collected at any of the 321 monitoring sites established as part of the CTBT's International Monitoring System. Under the treaty, we will also be able to conduct on-site inspections of facilities when we suspect questionable activity has occurred. These are resources available to us only if we ratify CTBT. 
   As for the safety and reliability of our existing nuclear weapons, I am convinced that the science-based stockpile stewardship program will permit us to preserve our nuclear deterrent without testing. I acknowledge up front that this program, for which we are spending $4.5 billion annually, is still evolving and it will be a few more years before we will know for certain its effectiveness. However, critics must also acknowledge three other facts. First, our nuclear weapons are safe and reliable today and are likely to remain so for another decade--with or without a stockpile program. Second, although not fully up and running, the stockpile stewardship program has already demonstrated its viability. Although we stopped testing nuclear weapons seven years ago, for the past four years the Department of Energy has been able to certify that our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. In order to make this certification, the Department has relied in part on data generated by the early phases of the stockpile stewardship program. Third, the President submitted, and I strongly support, a condition to the treaty that would permit the United States to withdraw from the treaty and resume nuclear testing if we have anything other than the highest confidence in the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. 
   Having said all of this, I would like to raise another important issue today. Regardless of where members stand on the merits of the CTBT, I think there are two things every member of this body should agree upon. The process of treaty ratification is one of the most important responsibilities our founding fathers vested in the United States Senate. In the course of this nation's history, the Senate has never taken this responsibility lightly. It would be a mistake to do so now. Second, it is hard to imagine a treaty with more significant ramifications for our national security for decades to come than the treaty before the Senate today. In the few brief days that this issue has been before us, I have heard senior Senators, members who have cast thousands of votes, state that their vote on CTBT could well be one of the most consequential of their Senate careers. I agree with that assessment. 
   Unfortunately, we are on the verge of ignoring these two truths. For some unknown reason, the CTBT has become a political football in a high stakes, highly partisan debate. It appears that some are seeking to score political points instead of carefully weighing this nation's national security interests and our role and responsibilities in the world. If politics should stop at the waters' edge, so too should it stop at the door to this chamber when we are deliberating treaties with such tremendous national and international ramifications. 
   Instead, after over 2 years of inaction, the Senate now finds itself locked in a sprint to a vote that is equally unfair to both the opponents and proponents of this treaty. No member of this body can truly believe he or she has all the information needed to render such a momentous decision. No member can truly state that the Senate has lived up to the founding fathers' expectations of how this chamber should conduct itself when giving its advice and consent on treaties. No member can really assert with a clear conscience that this was a fair and thorough process for dealing with any issue, let alone one of this magnitude.  
   Proceeding before we have given full airing to the numerous and complex issues surrounding the CTBT is unfair to the Senate, unfair to our national security and unfair to the American people. Before we begin the calling of the roll asking where we stand on this treaty, we should all take a step back and give ourselves time to study these issues. For the good of our nation's security and Americans for generations to come, I ask members on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have worked closely with my colleagues Senator STEVENS, Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN to make treatment and prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effect (FAE) more of a federal priority and to place language in the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill to underscore this commitment. I appreciate their efforts to support programs that will prevent and address this important public health problem and their commitment to continuing those efforts as they serve on the conference committee. 
   There is a dramatic need for an additional infusion of resources to address alcohol-related birth defects, which are the leading known cause of mental retardation. These funds are needed for the development of public awareness and education programs, health and human service provider training, standardized diagnostic criteria and other strategies called for in the competitive grant program authorized under the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act. These resources will complement the excellent work that has been started by grass-roots organizations like the National Organization for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and the Family Resource Institute. 
   I look forward to working with Senator STEVENS, Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN to promote treatment and prevention of FAS and FAE. It should be a priority for the Fiscal Year 2000 conference committee to fund these much-needed programs, and I am hopeful that the conferees will be able to find additional resources for this purpose. I believe it is critical that we provide line item funding for the competitive program that this Congress authorized last year. I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in the Senate toward that end as they begin to draft the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I agree with my colleagues that this program is of tremendous benefit to rural states and to our nation's ability to produce top quality research. In recent years, five states have received 48 percent of the NIH research money. We need to broaden this distribution. In my state of South Dakota, universities have benefitted from this program in the past, but we need to continue this investment so that they may compete for research monies on an equal footing. Increasing IDeA funding would help to meet this goal.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time. I know if we are not out of time, we are just about out of time. I will take a few minutes of my leader time to talk about this amendment. 
   I rise in strong support of the amendment. I do so in large measure because I believe it reflects the approach that represents the only way we are ever going to bring about a consensus on spending and the budget before the end of this year. 
   I don't have it at this moment--I have asked my staff to bring it--but the chairman of the appropriations committees in both the House and the Senate have expressed themselves publicly about the impropriety of across-the-board cuts. They have said it is the easy way; it is not the most appropriate way. 
   Indiscriminate cuts have never been the right way to approach deficit reduction, but these indiscriminate cuts are not the only way our Republican colleagues have suggested we go about meeting our budget objectives in the past. They have used a number of devices. Some of them have been the subject of a good deal of discussion in recent days. 
   George W. Bush has noted how inappropriate it is to use the EITC, and they appear to have backed away from using the tax credit available to working families. They have suggested accelerating the timing of the spectrum auction by $2.6 billion. They have suggested using two sets of books, one by and for congressional Republicans and one by the CBO. They have suggested declaring LIHEAP an emergency, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. They have suggested declaring the year 2000 census as an emergency. They have suggested that we raid the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. None of these have worked. Now we find our Republican colleagues suggesting maybe just an across-the-board, indiscriminate cut. 
   We made some very difficult decisions with regard to defense earlier this year. We made the decision to provide them a pay raise for the first time in some time. Yet it appears our Republican colleagues are now prepared to go back and cut that pay raise and cut the other portions of the defense budget as well. We estimate that if you are going to pay for everything Republicans suggest with across-the-board cuts, a 3 percent cut won't do; the cut required is closer to 10 percent. That is what the Office of Management and Budget says. 
   So if we cut defense by 10 percent, if we cut all the programs associated with disaster and agriculture by 10 percent, if we cut education by 10 percent, I wonder whether our colleagues want to do that. Yet that seems to be where they have relegated themselves, given the fact that none of their other budget gimmicks have worked. You can't accelerate spending. You can't turn the EITC program into an ATM machine. 
   You can't use many of the approaches that have been previously proposed by our Republican colleagues. They now know that. However, as I said, congressional Republicans didn't figure this out until after we witnessed the unusual occurrence where they were criticized by one of their Presidential candidates. They will soon find out that across-the-board spending cuts will not work either.  
   What works is what the senior Senator from New Jersey is now suggesting. What works is that we demonstrate some real leadership and find the offsets necessary to pay for these programs, or find the cuts that may be required to pay for these spending bills--not indiscriminately, but by making some tough choices. That is what we are suggesting. We are going to have to make tough choices in cuts or in offsets, but we have to make the tough choices together--Republicans and Democrats negotiating how to resolve this. We resolved it last year. That is how we should do it this year. In many cases, we have been locked out of the deliberations. Up until now, we haven't been involved in some of the conference committee deliberations. 
   So I hope everybody realizes that in the end, if we are going to solve this problem, we have to do it in the way the senior Senator from New Jersey is suggesting. Let's solve it by showing some leadership, let's solve it by working together, let's solve it in the age-old traditional way of sitting down and finding the cuts and the offsets required to pay for the commitments we are making in the budget this year. 
   I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota makes a very interesting point. We had that debate and we had some votes back then. I think the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada were the prime sponsors of the amendment that said you cannot use Social Security trust funds for the purposes of general revenues in calculating a balanced budget. I think we lost that amendment fight on a party-line vote. And now, in the last couple weeks, the CBO has already said: Look, Republicans are now acting in a manner consistent with their votes on this constitutional amendment. We now know that, according to CBO, they have already used $18 billion. Those aren't our numbers, those are CBO numbers. They have already done that. But that is the way they voted 3 or 4 years ago when we had that constitutional amendment debate--to use Social Security trust funds for the purposes of general revenues, for the purposes of meeting whatever obligations there may be. So they are consistent. 
   But I don't think anybody ought to be misled. Now there is some talk about, well, we ought to use across-the-board cuts. They know across-the-board cuts involve deep cuts in defense, in education, in commitments to the environment, and in disaster and emergency assistance. They know that isn't going to happen. The only way it is going to happen is to do what is now on the table. This ought to be a 100-0 vote. Every Republican and Democrat ought to be supporting this amendment because it is the only way we are going to resolve this impasse. The sooner we recognize that, the 
   better.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts makes a very important point. Not $1 of tax expenditures are on the table in their proposal. What they are suggesting is that we cut education first, that we cut disaster assistance first, that we cut LIHEAP first, that we cut defense first; and only after we have done all of that, I suppose they would assume we might look at tax expenditures. But there is not a word about looking at the $4 trillion of possibilities in the tax expenditure category before we look at cutting education for children, before we look at cutting Head Start, before we look at cutting afterschool programs, before we look at cutting title I and funding for disadvantaged children. All of those cuts are on the table but not $1 in tax expenditures. So the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct.

   Mr. DASCHLE. If I may respond, the irony is that the only tax matter that has been on the table for our Republican colleagues has been the earned-income tax credit, the tax credit affecting working families who are trying to get off welfare, who are trying to ensure that they pay their bills on time, who appreciate the importance of having that little help in April of every year. In fact, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and on the other side of the Capitol, made the point last week that these families need some help in managing. 
   Well, I have heard, ``I am from the Government and I am here to help you'' in a lot of different ways, but this is a new chapter. There is no way we are going to help working families manage their money better by taking away the one financial tool they have in the Tax Code. That doesn't help them. It is a charade that even George W. Bush fully understood and appreciated and spoke out on. 
   I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. That ought to be a consideration as well. We ought to be looking at $4 trillion in possibilities there, at least prior to the time we commit to cut the first dollar of education, the first dollar of health care for children, or the first dollar of Armed Forces personnel stationed abroad. That, it seems to me, would be the prudent approach.

   Mr. DASCHLE. That is what I am talking about. Obviously, when we talk about tax expenditures, people sometimes wonder what reference that is. In many cases, we are talking about loopholes. In fact, it is interesting that our Republican colleagues, in order to pay for the huge tax cut they had proposed  earlier this year--which ended up going nowhere--used corporate loophole closures as a way to pay for part of it. So even they have acknowledged on occasion that these corporate loophole closures are something we should be looking at; not in this case, however. In this case, they are proposing that we cut education first, that we cut health care first, and then we look at other things, perhaps--although it isn't addressed in this proposal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. We recognize and applaud the desire of a number of groups and organizations in this country to take the proceeds from this non-renewable resource and reinvest a portion of these outer continental shelf revenues in the conservation and enhancement of our renewable resources. 
   When the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created more than thirty years ago, the intention was for revenues from off-shore oil and gas drilling to be deposited into the fund, allowing federal and state governments to protect green space, improve wildlife habitat and purchase lands for conservation purposes. 
   In my state of South Dakota this program has been particularly beneficial, helping local and state governments to purchase park lands and develop facilities in municipal and state parks throughout the state. 
   Unfortunately, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has rarely received adequate funding. 
   Congress has the opportunity this year to pass legislation that would finally ensure consistent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and provide a permanent stream of revenue for conservation. 
   We applaud the efforts of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as well as the House Committee on Natural Resources for conducting the process thus far in a fair and bi-partisan manner. 
   We encourage these committees to continue their progress so that Congress as a whole can debate and pass what may well be the most significant conservation effort of the century.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to express how saddened I am by the party-line vote against Judge Ronnie White today. I had sincerely hoped that today would mark the beginning of a bipartisan attempt to clear the backlog of federal judicial nominees and begin to fill the vacancies that are rampant throughout the federal judiciary. I was mistaken. Instead, we got a party-line vote against a qualified minority judge coupled with a continued refusal to schedule votes on other qualified minority and women nominees. 
   Judge White is eminently qualified to sit on the federal bench. He is a distinguished jurist and the first African-American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. Prior to his service on Missouri's Supreme Court, Judge White served as a State Representative to the Missouri Legislature, where he chaired the Judiciary Committee. In his law practice, which he continued during his service as a legislator, White handled a variety of civil and criminal matters for mostly low income individuals. His nomination received the support of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, the Saint Louis Post Dispatch, and the National Bar Association. He is a fine man who has given his life to public service and he deserved better than what he got from this Senate. He deserved better than to be kept waiting 27 months for a vote, and then to be used as a political pawn. 
   This vote wasn't about the death penalty. This vote wasn't about law and order. This vote was about the unfair treatment of minority judicial nominees. This vote tells minority judicial candidates ``do not apply.'' And if you do, you will wait and wait, with no guarantee of fairness. 
   Judge Marsha Berzon, for instance, has been kept waiting more than 20 months for a vote. Judge Richard Paez has been waiting more than 44 months. These nominees deserve a vote. While I am totally dismayed by what happened here today with respect to Judge White's nomination, the Senate today functioned, albeit in a partisan, political manner. 
   As Chief Justice Rehnquist has recognized: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' An up-or-down vote, that is all we ask for Berzon and Paez. And, after years of waiting, they deserve at least that much. The Republican majority should not be allowed to cherry-pick among nominees, allowing some to be confirmed in weeks, while letting other nominations languish for years. Accordingly, I vow today, that we Democrats just will not allow Paez and Berzon to be forgotten. 
   As I have in the past, I will again move to proceed to the nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon, and I intend to take this action again and again should unnamed Senators continue to block a vote. Particularly after today's vote, I must say, I find it simply baffling that a Senator would vote against even voting on a judicial nomination. Today's actions prove that we all understand that we have a constitutional outlet for antipathy against a judicial nominee--a vote against that nominee. What the Constitution does not contemplate is for one or two Senators to grind a nomination to a halt on the basis of a ``secret'' hold. This cowardly, obstructionist tactic is an anathema to the traditions of the Senate. Thus, today, I implore, one more time, every Senator to follow Senator LEAHY's advice, and treat every nominee ``with dignity and dispatch.'' Lift your holds, and let the Senate vote on every nomination. 
   The business of judges is the simple but overwhelmingly important business of providing equal justice to the poor and to the rich. Accordingly, the consequences of this confirmation process are awesome. It is time that we all take it more seriously and it is time that we schedule votes on every nominee on the Calendar--including Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. All we are asking of our Republican colleagues is to give these nominees the vote--and hopefully the fair consideration--they deserve. We will press this issue every day and at every opportunity until they get that vote. 
   Today is a dark day for the Senate. We have voted down a fully-qualified nominee but I hope we can do better in the future and that we can move forward on the Paez and Berzon nominations in a fair and non-partisan manner.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Senator MCCAIN, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator HOLLINGS, the Ranking Member of that committee, for their leadership and their willingness to accommodate many of our colleagues who raised concerns about various provisions in the bill. 
   I would also like to thank Senator GORTON, the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, and Senator ROCKEFELLER, the Ranking Member of that committee. They truly have been tireless advocates for improving aviation safety, security and system capacity. I would also like to thank the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, for the cooperation he has shown on this bill and for recently leading the way on another aviation bill that allowed the FAA to release FY99 funds for airport construction projects. Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their willingness to allow timely Senate consideration of this must-pass legislation. 
   If it seems like the Senate has already considered legislation bill to authorize programs at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), that is because it has. More than a year ago, the Senate passed S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. Although there was overwhelming support for this legislation in the Senate last year, House and Senate negotiators could not agree on a multi-year FAA authorization bill. In October of last year, Congress passed a six-month authorization of the FAA instead. The FAA has been operating under short-term extensions ever since. 
   Mr. President, this is no way to fund the FAA. Short-term extension after short-term extension disrupts long-term planning at the FAA and at airports around the country that rely on federal funds to improve their facilities and enhance aviation safety. Perhaps the only thing worse than passing a short-term extension is allowing the AIP program to lapse all together. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Congress did before the August recess when the House failed to pass a 60-day extension previously approved by the Senate. Almost two months later, Congress passed a bill authorizing the FAA to release $290 million for airport construction projects just before the funds were set to expire at end of the fiscal year. 
   Airports around the country came within one day of losing federal funds they need for construction projects. The numerous short-term extensions could have been avoided if Congress would have simply passed a multi-year FAA preauthorization bill. We had our chance last year, and we have had more than enough time to carry out that responsibility this year. The Senate Commerce Committee approved S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1999 on February 11--almost eight months ago. As my colleagues know, this legislation is almost identical to S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. 
   With the amendment offered by the managers of the bill, S. 82 would authorize programs at the FAA including the AIP program through FY02. Specifically, it would provide more than $2.4 billion a year for airport construction projects and more than $2 billion a year for facilities and equipment upgrades. It would also provide between $5.8 billion and $6.3 billion for the FAA's operations in FY00 through FY02.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with the characterization made just now by the majority leader. I think all we can do is continue to discuss the matter to see if we might proceed in a way that would accommodate the concerns and needs of both caucuses. I think what the majority leader said, especially about rumors, and how all this began is irrelevant. In fact, the more rumors, the more this matter is exacerbated. If we really want to try to proceed successfully, we need to quell the rumors and get on with trying to talk with dispassionate voices and make sure we make the right decisions. We are prepared to do that, and I know the majority leader is prepared to do that. That is all that needs to be said at this time.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 2 years ago, we passed the Balanced Budget Act. It was a monumental example of what Congress can achieve when we work together. 
   Not only did we end 30 years of deficit spending with the Balanced Budget Act, we also extended the life of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund by 13 years. And we added important new preventive benefits, including mammograms and Pap smears, for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   We made many changes that achieved a lot of good. 
   We also know now that we made some miscalculations. 
   Frankly, that is to be expected. Very often, when you make a lot of changes, you don't get everything right the first time. 
   But the miscalculations we made about Medicare in the Balanced Budget Act are causing real hardships for some of our most vulnerable citizens--hardships that cannot be justified on either financial or medical grounds. We did not anticipate these consequences when we passed the Balanced Budget Act. But now that we know about them, we have a responsibility to address them. 
   Today I am introducing the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 1999. 
   This bill is not a comprehensive Medicare reform plan. Nor is it a wholesale revision of the Balanced Budget Act. Instead, it is a reasonable, targeted solution to certain specific problems with Medicare that Congress created inadvertently as part of the Balanced Budget Act. 
   Before I outline the specific remedies in my bill, I want to tell you about the real-life consequences of one of the changes we made to Medicare under the Balanced Budget Act. 
   Two years ago, Congress decided to limit how much Medicare would pay for rehabilitation therapy. The new limits are $1,500 a year per patient for physical and speech therapy combined, and another $1,500 for occupational therapy. 
   For some Medicare patients who need rehabilitation therapy, the new limits on payments are not a problem. But for Ruth Irwin, they are a nightmare. 
   A while back, Mrs. Irwin had to have one of her legs amputated because of complications of diabetes. With an incredible amount of effort and the help of regular physical therapy, Mrs. Irwin was learning how to walk with a prosthetic leg and two canes. 
   Her goal was to learn to walk with one cane, so she would have one hand free. She was on the verge of reaching that goal--when she hit the $1,500 physical-therapy limit. She couldn't afford to pay out-of-pocket, so she stopped seeing her physical therapist. Her condition deteriorated. A few months later, she tripped on a curb and broke three ribs. Ruth Irwin is not alone. 
   It is estimated that 1 in 7 Medicare recipients who need physical therapy--about 200,000 Americans--will hit the caps this year. These are mostly patients who are recuperating from amputations, strokes, and head trauma, and people who suffer from serious degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. 
   Mr. President, between 1990 and 1996, Medicare spending on rehabilitation therapy grew 18 percent a year, to $1 billion. We had good reason to try to curb that growth. But we now know, we chose the wrong way to accomplish our goal. It's wrong to force stroke victims in nursing homes to decide whether they want to learn how to walk or talk. The Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act repeals the current, arbitrary caps rehabilitation therapy and replaces it with limits based on individual patients' specific needs. 
   It also makes a number of other, targeted adjustments. 
   First: It adjusts the new payment system for nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities to better reflect the increased costs of caring for very sick patients. 
   Second: It postpones additional cuts in home health care payments for two years and addresses the more serious problems that have come to light while the current ``interim payment system'' has been in place. 
   Third: It protects hospitals from crippling losses they might otherwise suffer as the result of a new Medicare payment system for outpatient medical services. 
   This protection is especially important for people who depend on rural hospitals--like Mobridge Hospital, in Mobridge, South Dakota. Mobridge Hospital is the only source of inpatient hospital care for 100 miles. If it were forced to drastically reduce its services, or close, that would have a devastating impact on scores of communities. Because they serve a population that is generally older and less wealthy than average, America's rural hospitals operate on lower profit margins, and they have virtually no margin for error. They need the relief that is in this bill. 
   A fourth area addressed by the bill are the deep cuts made by the BBA in payments to teaching hospitals. Major teaching hospitals represent only 6% of all hospitals. But they account for 70% of the burn units in America, more than half of the pediatric intensive care units, and they provide 44% of the indigent care in this country. The bill moderates these cuts. 
   When you combine other BBA cuts in payments with reductions in payments for indirect medical education, nearly half of America's major teaching hospitals are projected to lose money during the next few years. We cannot sacrifice the high-quality care, teaching, and research activities these hospitals provide. We must make this fix, and keep these hospitals whole. This bill does it. 
   Fifth, Mr. President, the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act provides new protections for seniors enrolled in Medicare+Choice, when their plan pulls out of their community. 
   Finally, the bill includes additional provisions to protect access to rural hospitals, hospice care, community health centers, and rural health clinics. 
   As I said, this is not a comprehensive solution to Medicare. There are still many questions we must work together to answer. How can we add the prescription drug plan both our parties--and the vast majority of Americans--say we support? How can we make sure Medicare remains solvent when the Baby Boomers retire--and beyond? 
   These are questions that must be answered. They are important and must be addressed in legislation that falls outside the purview of the bill we introduce today. But make no mistake,  they are high priorities, and ones which will not go away, and will be addressed in future bills. 
   For now, though, there is no question that we made some miscalculations in 1997, when we changed the way Medicare pays for certain services. There is no question that those miscalculations are causing real hardships today for some of America's sickest and frailest citizens, and for the institutions that care for them. And there should be no delay in correcting those miscalculations. 
   We should make these changes not just because of the human suffering they are causing. There are compelling economic reasons to make them as well. That is the other part of Ruth Irwin's story. As a result of her three broken ribs, Mrs. Irwin received regular visits by a registered nurse and a home health aide--all paid for by Medicare. She also received physical therapy three times a week. 
   The bottom line: Her recovery was far longer, more painful--and more costly--than it needed to be. We did a lot of good in 1997. We made some tough decisions that added years of solvency to Medicare, and enabled us to add life-saving new preventive benefits. But we also made some miscalculations. 
   We didn't know at the time the harsh consequences some of these miscalculations would have. 
   Now that we do, we need to correct them--the sooner, the better. So I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and to work with us to ensure its prompt consideration and passage. 
   This legislation was the result of a tremendous amount of work by a number of our colleagues. This is clearly a team effort. I thank in particular Senator MOYNIHAN for his extensive efforts to help us draft and craft this legislation. His expertise was invaluable in making very important decisions. I thank Senators MIKULSKI and DURBIN and KERREY for their commitment to solving the problem. I thank Senator JACK REED for his help on home health and Senators BAUCUS and CONRAD for their efforts on rural health. I thank especially Senator ROCKEFELLER and the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts for their commitment to access to health care, to education, and to the array of issues they have raised throughout the work we have done on this bill to this date. 
   Mr. President, I now yield the floor and again thank Senator KENNEDY and others for their efforts on the floor this morning.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his remarks and for his extraordinary commitment to this effort. He has been at every meeting. He has been engaged from the very beginning, and we are grateful, as on so many of the issues our caucus cares deeply about, for the leadership he has provided. 
   I am proud of the fact we have had the participation of well over 20 Members, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts has been the leader of the pack, as he is on so many other issues. 
   I also thank Senator ROCKEFELLER for the extraordinary effort he has put forth. As a member of the Finance Committee, no one has worked harder on many of these issues than has he. I am grateful for the participation and leadership he has provided to get us to this point. 
   Before I yield the floor, let me say how urgent this matter is. My colleagues yesterday discussed the urgency of this legislation again and again. I am disappointed and deeply concerned about the fact that, at least to date, there is no date yet set for consideration and markup of a bill to repair the damage done in the 1997 act. We have to address and consider and ultimately pass such a bill prior to the time we leave the Senate this year. We will do anything, and everything we know how, to ensure this becomes one of the highest legislative priorities left prior to the end of this session of Congress. It must be addressed. It must be passed. We must take this legislation up soon in order for us to accomplish what I know is a bipartisan recognition of the shortcomings and the miscalculations made in the 1997 act. 
   I will say again, the fact that we have over half of our caucus already, and will probably have two-thirds of our caucus as cosponsors in the not-too-distant future, is a clear recognition of the depth of feeling our Members have on this bill and the importance we place on getting something done this year. We must do it. We will do it, and we will work with our Republican colleagues to make that happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the majority leader's effort to try to move these nominations along. Before I make some comment, let me ask the majority leader what his intentions are with regard to Marsha Berzon, the nominee to be the United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, as  well as Richard Paez, a similar nominee for the Ninth Circuit. Can the majority leader give me his current intentions with regard to those two nominations?

   Mr. DASCHLE. That is helpful. With that assurance, I will certainly not object to the request propounded by the majority leader. He has made it to me privately. It is my hope we will continue to work. These are important matters. As the majority leader has heard me say, and others say, now for some time, in some cases they have been pending not for months but for years. For anyone to be held that long is just an extraordinary unfairness, not only to the nominees but to the system itself. 
   The majority leader has also noted that a cloture vote is an unfortunate matter. Actually, a cloture vote is a recognition of the difficulty to move judges. A cloture vote is probably no more unfortunate than a hold. We have people who are maintaining holds on judges, which is also very unfortunate. A hold is nothing more than an intent to filibuster. 
   So I hope our colleagues will drop their holds and will recognize that taking hostages in this form is not the right way to proceed and does not live up to the traditions of the Senate when it comes to the expeditious consideration of individuals who want to serve in public life. 
   The majority leader also mentioned--I will mention this just briefly because it is another important factor in our decision to want to cooperate with the majority--the decision and the commitment made by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that he will hold hearings and he will move other nominees forward. It is important that all of the nominees who are pending before the Judiciary Committee be considered. He has indicated he will do his best to ensure they are considered. 
   Our ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, has been extremely persistent and dedicated to that effort. I appreciate his contributions as well. 
   So, Mr. President, I will not object.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Alaska in remembering Mary Mikami Rouse. Mary Rouse recently passed away, at the age of 87, leaving behind an accomplished family and a legacy of academic achievement. 
   She was born in the United States in 1912, the daughter of Japanese immigrants who had come to the United States to seek their fortune. Growing up in Alaska, Mary Mikami excelled academically and graduated with the highest honors from Alaska Agricultural College and the School of Mines, which later became the University of Alaska. 
   After completing her college work in Alaska, she traveled to New Haven, CT, where she attended Yale University, where she met and married Irving Rouse and earned her Ph.D. Throughout her life she continued living in New Haven, working as lecturer, translator, and instructor at Yale's Institute for Oriental Languages. 
   With her husband Irving, Mary had two sons, David Rouse, an urban landscape architect in Philadelphia, and Peter Rouse, my chief of staff and a man who has been my friend and closest adviser for now more than 15 years. 
   All of us who know and work with Pete are aware of the enormous influence his mother Mary had on him. His success in life stems from the legacy of his mother--a keen intelligence, unparalleled integrity and judgment, and basic human kindness. 
   The values he brings to this institution each day are, no doubt, the product of his upbringing and his mother's influence. In fact, it is her character we have the privilege of seeing reflected in her son each and every day. 
   For those of us who have the good fortune to work with Pete Rouse, there is no way we can thank his mother Mary for all that she has done to influence his life, for all that she did to ensure we have the good fortune to call Pete Rouse our friend, to call him, now, our coworker, and for me to rely upon him each and every moment of every day to the extent that I do. 
   I, and all who know Pete, share his loss now. We are grateful that she has had the good life, the successful life, the extraordinary life that she has had, and we all wish Pete and his family well under these circumstances.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I think this unanimous consent request represents progress from the first request made by the majority leader. But I still believe this procedure is unfair, and I would even say dangerous. 
   This is the most significant treaty with which we will deal on nuclear proliferation maybe in the time that the majority leader and I will be leaders. We are going to be taking this up on the Senate floor without one hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have looked back. We do not know when that has ever happened before, when the Foreign Relations Committee has not acted upon a treaty, even though it has been pending for 2 years. 
   We are hoping that the Committee on Armed Services will take up the treaty next week, but I believe that alone is irresponsible. But we believe we have no choice. Our choice is to send the message as an institution that this treaty is not important, it does not even deserve a hearing, or to send the message, God forbid, that the Senate would reject this treaty and say it was not the U.S. intention to send the message around the world that we will ban nuclear weapons testing. Those are the options on the negative side. 
   On the positive side, the option might be between now and October 12, we can convince the necessary two-thirds of the Senate to support this treaty. We still hope, we believe, that might be within our reach. But I know what some of the debate will be, and the Presiding Officer or the majority leader will mark my words. We will hear somebody say this treaty is not verifiable, in spite of the fact that expert after expert has noted that it is verifiable, but there will have been no hearings to verify the fact that, indeed, this treaty is subject to all the verification elements required of a treaty of this kind. 
   We are going to hear all kinds of complaints and all kinds of allegations and rumors about what this treaty does or does not do, and when you do not have hearings, that is what is going to happen. 
   So we are extremely disappointed with the way this has been handled. As I said, I believe it is irresponsible and dangerous. But we also note this may be the best we can get, and if it is the best we can get, as troubled as we are, we will take it. We will have our day in court. We will make our best arguments. We will let the judgment of this Senate prevail. 
   I am very hopeful the administration will be engaged. I am very hopeful those who care as deeply as we care about this issue will join us in making the arguments and in dealing with the issue. I also say it is my intention, as Democratic leader, to conduct hearings of my own as part of the Democratic Policy Committee to ensure that we do have experts in Washington to express themselves. We will do that at the appropriate moment. 
   I do not object, but I must express very grave reservations.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not. I appreciate the majority leader yielding. 
   The majority leader made reference to meetings where the CTBT has been discussed. Certainly we were not in any way acknowledging that this issue has never come up. But I think it is important for the record, once again, to say that in the time that this treaty has been before the Senate, not one hearing has been held. 
   I am grateful for the chair of the Armed Services Committee at least taking this initiative, as late as the date may be. It sounds to be a very comprehensive set of hearings. That will be helpful. 
   But I must say, it is equally irresponsible for us to be here at this moment without 1 day where the committee of jurisdiction has held hearings on an issue of this import and then ask our colleagues--the Senate--to pass judgment. 
   The majority leader knows we have attempted to bring the Senate to this point now for some time. We are pleased that we have made this progress. But, frankly, this isn't the way to do it. We should have had hearings in the committee. We are glad we are having hearings in the Armed Services Committee. But to rush to judgment on an issue of this importance is not the way to do business. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond quickly. 
   I acknowledge that. But I believe there is a huge difference between looking at the issue of stockpile and looking at the importance of the treaty per se, at the language of the treaty, and whether or not we ought to ratify a treaty, whether or not we ought to send the message to the rest of the world that we want them to ratify the treaty, whether the treaty is in our long-term interests, and what the ramifications of the treaty are. That is what I am suggesting ought to be the subject of these hearings. 
   We ought to be looking at stockpiles, and we ought to be looking at the ramifications of our current nuclear weaponry. And certainly the chairman has done an admirable job of that, as has the committee as a whole, but we have not held hearings until now. I think they are long overdue. I think we as a Senate have made a very big mistake in calling this treaty to the floor prior to the time we have had that kind of consideration in the Foreign Relations Committee or, for that matter, in the Armed Services Committee.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will object at this point. I do so only because it is my understanding that the junior Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, is still awaiting an answer from the manager of the bill, Senator MCCAIN. They have been negotiating now for several days. The Senator from New York indicated he hopes that in a matter of hours he will hear from Senator MCCAIN's office. As soon as he gets that clarification from Senator MCCAIN, I think he will be more than happy to agree to this unanimous consent request. I will certainly notify the majority leader when that happens. Then it would be my expectation we could agree to this unanimous consent request. We have worked through a number of other problems and issues Senators have raised. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators, especially those on my side of the aisle who have worked with us to get to this point. This is an important bill. It needs to be done. I hope it will be done next Monday.

   Mr. DASCHLE. First, 10 hours of debate is totally insufficient for a treaty as important as this. I appreciate very much the majority leader's willingness to respond to the continued requests we have made for consideration of this treaty. He and I hold a different view about the importance of it, but we are certainly willing to have a debate and have the vote. 
   I appreciate as well his willingness to respond as quickly as he has. In this case, we have been attempting to get to this point for a long period of time. But October 6 is a time that I don't think allows for adequate preparation for a debate of this magnitude. 
   Keep in mind, no hearings have been held yet on this issue. Unfortunately, as a result of that, I don't think people are fully cognizant of the ramifications of this treaty and the importance of it. I will certainly agree to a time certain if we can extend the length of debate. 
   I would also be concerned about the language in the unanimous-consent request that assumes this treaty will be defeated. The last paragraph makes an assumption that we are not prepared to make at this point. We don't think it necessarily will be defeated. 
   We look forward to working with the leader and coming up with a time we can debate it and give it the time it deserves. I hope it will be done sometime this coming month. I look forward to working with the majority leader to make that happen.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield? He made reference to a couple of matters which ought to be addressed briefly. 
   First, with regard to nuclear waste, I know of nobody on this side of the aisle who wishes to filibuster the bill, and I will be happy to clarify that with the majority leader. I think there is an interest, however, in amending the bill. We would love to have the bill come to the Senate floor under normal Senate order, regular order, and if the bill were brought up under regular order, we would be in support of moving the bill and voting in favor of the motion to proceed. I will be happy to work with the majority leader to schedule that, if we could accommodate Senators who wish to offer amendments. 
   With regard to the FAA debate, this was one of the more difficult agreements. I appreciate the ability of many of our colleagues to allow us the opportunity to have this debate on Monday. But I must say that, once again, this is a unanimous consent request to limit debate and limit amendments. We are agreeing to this only because we believe the FAA bill is a matter of great national security and of import not only for safety and health of aviation but because we believe we have already taken too long to reauthorize this legislation. 
   So because of the expiration of the authorizing legislation, because of the safety and health matters, we share the view that this legislation ought to come up and be debated and that we ought to limit ourselves to relevant amendments. 
   But again I say that we have not had a bill before the Senate under regular Senate order since last May. We have gone through June, July, August, and now September--4 months--and we are simply saying: Let's bring bills to the floor under regular order. Let's have a good debate, and let's have amendments offered. I am hopeful that we can work through the rest of the agenda with that in mind. 
   So we are not going to object to this bill being brought up, again, under abnormal Senate order and rule. But I think there is a growing concern that too many bills are coming to the floor without the opportunity for a full debate. 
   So whether it is nuclear waste or whether it is an array of other bills that could come to the floor, we are ready to debate them. We are ready to have a good amount of time dedicated to whatever piece of legislation ought to be considered. But we want the right to offer amendments. We will forego that right under FAA, but there are not many bills that fit into that category, if any, for the rest of the year. 
   I thank the majority leader for yielding. 
   Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at the request of tribal leaders throughout my state, today I am introducing legislation to establish the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place in Ft. Pierre, South Dakota. 
   This history of South Dakota is carved with the rich cultural traditions of numerous Sioux tribes who lived on the plains for centuries and inlaid with the stories of immigrants who came during the last two hundred years to settle the towns, plow the earth, shepherd livestock and mine gold. The story of that settlement, and the mingling of Indian and non-Indian people, has not always been a peaceful one, and today in South Dakota we continue to face the challenges of disparate communities of Indians and non-Indians living side-by-side, often imbued with misunderstanding and mistrust. As a result, there is a growing recognition of the need for reconciliation between Indian and non-Indians. 
   It is my hope that through the establishment of a Reconciliation Place, we can promote a better understanding of the history and culture of the Sioux people and by doing so, achieve better relations between Indian and non-Indian peoples. The Reconciliation Place will provide a home for a center of Sioux law, history, culture, and economic development for the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes of the upper Midwest, and thus will help preserve the strong and unique cultural heritage of the Sioux. 
   The Reconciliation Place will enhance the knowledge and understanding of the history of the Sioux by displaying and interpreting the history, art, and culture of the tribes of this region. It will also provide an important repository for the Sioux Nation history and the family histories for individual members of the tribes, and other important historical documents. The majority of the historic documents and archives of this region are kept in government facilities that are scattered across the West and are almost inaccessible to the people of this area. The Reconciliation Place will provide a central repository for these important elements of Sioux history, allowing easy access to tribal members interested in exploring their past. 
   By empowering the Sioux tribes to establish their own Sioux Nation Supreme Court, the bill will help achieve greater social and economic stability in Indian Country. Moreover, the court will bring the legal certainty and predictability to the reservations necessary for businesspeople to have the confidence to make investments in tribal enterprises. This, in turn, will generate the economic infrastructure needed to create more jobs on reservations. 
   Finally, the legislation establishes a Native American Economic Development Council to assist the Sioux tribes by providing opportunities for economic development and job creation. Specifically, the council will provide expertise and technical support to Indians to help gain access to existing sources of federal assistance, while raising funds from private entities to match federal contributions. Funding obtained by the Council will be used to provide grants, loans, scholarships, and technical assistance to tribes and their members, for business education and job creation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to address the pending issue for a couple of minutes. 
   It is with some reluctance that we find ourselves in a situation of having to support a continuing resolution for the next 3 weeks. Although most Democrats will support this resolution, I don't know that our caucus will be united in its support. And on behalf of those of us who are supportive, I think it has to be said--and I haven't had the good fortune to hear any of the debate--we do so with great reluctance and great disappointment. We hope this will be the only CR that will be voted on and addressed this year. 
   Our Republican colleagues made three promises last spring. The first promise was, they would not use Social Security trust funds to pay for other government programs; the second promise was, there would be no lifting of the discretionary spending caps, that we could live within the caps we all agreed to in 1997; the third promise or commitment was, we would meet the deadlines. 
   We all understand the new fiscal year begins October 1, and we strive to complete our work by the first day of the new fiscal year. Here we are, a couple of days away from the new fiscal year, and what has happened? Our Republican colleagues told Members during the budget debate: No, we really don't want any Democratic amendments. We will do this on our own. We will pass a Republican budget--not a bipartisan budget but a Republican budget. That Republican budget passed without Democratic support and without Democratic involvement. 
   We then had a Finance Committee markup, and our Republican colleagues again said: No, we really don't want any Democratic input. We will pass a tax cut of a magnitude that goes way beyond anything the Democrats could support--recognizing it cuts into the very investments we have expressed so much concern about today, recognizing it cuts into Social Security as they promised they would not do. 
   Then we had the appropriations process. With the exceptions of the VA/HUD and defense bills, Democratic Members were largely shut out of the appropriations subcommittee markups, the full committee markups, and the conferences with the House 
   We hate to say we told you so, but that is exactly where we are today: We told you so. We knew they could not do what they said they were going to do earlier this spring and this summer. We knew ultimately they would have to cut Social Security to get to this point, and they have. We knew they would probably be forced to increase the caps, and now they have admitted that is most likely what they will do. We knew they wouldn't make the deadline, and, unfortunately, that too has come to pass. 
   Our Republican colleagues are coming to the floor now asking we join with them in passing a continuing resolution to give them 3 more weeks in spite of the fact we were told they really didn't need our help this spring, they didn't need it this summer. In fact, one of the leadership in the House, Congressman DELAY, was quoted as saying: We are going to trap the Democrats. We are going to trap them into recognizing they have to use Social Security. They have to break the caps. 
   I have to say, this is no way to legislate. The word I use to describe our current appropriations and budget circumstances is ``chaos.'' In all the years I have been here, I don't recall a time when there has been greater appropriations disarray than there is right now. I frankly don't know whether we can put it back together in 3 weeks. But we ought to try. We know we cannot go home until this is done. We are hopeful. 
   I was a little concerned when the Speaker was asked, Will you shut the Government down? He said, I hope that won't be necessary, or something to that effect. I would have hoped there could have 
   been a more definitive statement--that under no circumstances would the Government be shut down. 
   Our Republican colleagues are in a box. They violated their promises on Social Security and raising the caps and not meeting the deadlines. They can't mask it over now with some charade of bipartisanship when, up until this point, there has not been any. 
   Democrats have voted in good faith on many occasions, opting to move this process along with an expectation and hope that somehow in conference or at some point prior to the end of the fiscal year we could come together. That hasn't happened yet. As a result of our inability to come together, the President is now threatening to veto up to six of the thirteen appropriations bills.  And after he vetoes them, then where are we? 
   This is a disappointing day. Republican responsibility day is October 1. Republican responsibility day is the day when we should all ask the question, Have the promises been kept? On Social Security, the answer is no. On keeping the caps, the answer is no. On meeting the deadline, the answer is no. 
   Now we are faced with an appropriations dilemma on education. They have cut education budgets by 17 percent. They are using a new, extraordinarily innovative approach to offsetting the shortfall in education by moving money we have already appropriated out of defense into education. They will then make defense whole again by declaring billions of defense spending an emergency. If that isn't the most extraordinary demonstration of flimflam budgeting, I don't know what is. 
   This is quite a moment. We have not yet talked about education. We will save that for tomorrow. I am disappointed we have to be here today with the recognition that those promises have not been kept, that we do need a 3-week CR, that we are facing up to six vetoes, and that we haven't been able to come together as Democrats and Republicans in a bipartisan way to resolve these problems before it is too late. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use leader time so as not to take what limited time may be left. 
   I want to speak for a moment and commend the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his remarks and for the incredible message I think that chart alone points out. 
   We heard our Republican colleagues say over and over that they are the ones who have supported education; they are the ones who can take credit for the fact that we have actually improved funding over the course of the last several years. As Senator KENNEDY has pointed out so ably, it is only because we have forced our Republican colleagues to increase this investment that we see any real improvement whatsoever. 
   That is the reason I am hoping our colleagues will be very wary of the resolution posed by our Republican colleagues this afternoon. 
   Obviously, if you look at some of the stated priorities, there is very little for which there can be disagreement. We should have 
   well-trained, high-quality teachers. Parents need to be involved in education of their children. There have to be safe schools, and we need to have orderly places for children to learn. 
   But the problem is the rhetoric and the record are totally opposite. Rhetoric is what we just heard. The record is deep cuts in education every single year. The Republican agenda will not achieve the rhetoric that the resolution the Republicans are proposing today calls for. 
   Look again at what the House Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee did last week. How does killing class size reduction match the rhetoric in the resolution? How does it match the rhetoric in the resolution to provide only half of the money the President has requested for afterschool programs? How can you ensure that we have orderly places for children to learn when you cut funds from the Safe and Drug Free School program? How do we help make sure children are ready to school when you provide $500 million less for the Head Start Program than the President has requested? How can you do the things the Republicans propose in their resolution and then eliminate the Class Size Reduction Program, making it even more difficult to make sure that every classroom has a qualified teacher. Giving families a $5 annual tax break isn't going to make schools safer or provide afterschool programs. Vouchers do nothing for these kids left behind in low-performing schools. 
   I urge our colleagues to look very carefully at this resolution, and look at the statement at the end of the resolution which says this Congress is now in a position to be congratulated for its strong education performance. 
   How do you congratulate a Congress that cuts as deeply as the House did last week? How do you congratulate a Congress that has nothing to show for the record in education except for an Ed-Flex bill we passed last spring that is of very little value in reaching the goals and the stated objectives in the Republican resolution? 
   That is why we have offered our resolution. Our resolution addresses the priorities stated by our Republican colleagues. We put our money where our mouth is. We do what we need to do--fund the priorities within this budget to ensure that we are able to achieve those goals, not just talk about them. 
   We provide $1.4 billion to reduce class size. We triple the funding for afterschool programs. We increase college access and affordability. We expand opportunities to incorporate education technology. We advance school literacy and readiness. 
   Those are the kinds of things you need to do if you are serious about these stated goals which are found in both resolutions. 
   You have to look at what happens once the resolution passes. From where does the money come, and how big a commitment is there on the part of colleagues on either side of the aisle to achieve what we say we want to achieve? Only one resolution pending does that. 
   I hope everyone will understand that before they cast their vote. 
   Let me also make a couple of comments. The Senator from Massachusetts did such a good job that very little else needs to be said with regard to some of the remarks made by our Republican colleagues. But the majority leader on Friday made a couple of statements to which I think there must be a response. He pointed out that spending on education has risen every year since the Republicans took the majority. 
   It has risen, all right. But it has risen over the objections of many of our colleagues on the other side. It has risen only because this caucus and the administration have pressed the Republican leadership and the Republican Members of the Senate to do what we have advocated again this year--to provide the kind of commitment and resources necessary. 
   One of the Republicans' first action was to rescind $1.7 billion in education funding. One of their most famous actions over the years has been to propose abolishing the Department of Education altogether. Of course, they shut the Government down in an effort to enact the Draconian cuts in education and all other programs. It was only because Democrats refused to make education such a low priority that these investments are made. 
   So how ironic now that we have prevailed, they attempt to take credit. I think most people understand that. 
   Democrats have supported real options to involve parents in our education system as well. 
   Our majority leader asserted last week the Democrats oppose giving parents options. Nothing could be further from the truth. I cannot imagine anybody could actually say that and be serious. We have supported providing choices through open enrollment in public charter schools. More importantly, we believe communities and parents should have the tools--including the resources--to make sure each local neighborhood school provides every single child a high quality education, not just some. 
   Despite suggestions to the contrary, we support increasing resources for special education. We believe we need to do that in addition to, not instead of, addressing other problems. Helping all children is what we want to do with our educational agenda. 
   We offered an amendment earlier this year to fully fund the special education program by reducing the Republican tax cut. Guess what. The majority rejected it. I think almost to a person, if not to a person, they rejected it. When it came down to a tax cut or fully funding special education, our Republican colleagues did what we could almost predict they will do every single time: They voted for the tax cut. 
   I think it is important to note the Republican resolution doesn't give the whole picture about the state of public education. There are problems, but some good things are happening. There is not a word in the resolution they offer today about the good things that have been effective. 
   I think it was Senator MURRAY who said last week, and it ought to be repeated over and over: Public education isn't failing us; we are failing public education. When we look at the shortfalls in this budget, once again, and the failure to fund the commitment to public education, I think she was right on the mark when she said that. 
   With the help of incentives from Goals 2000 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, school districts are now setting higher academic standards; many school districts are taking strong steps to reform schools using proven, research-based methodologies. Student performance is rising in math, science, and reading. SAT scores are increasing. Students are taking more rigorous, tougher courses they are doing better. A higher percentage of students are receiving passing grades on advanced placement exams, and fewer students are dropping out. I think it is important to note that the gap between whites and blacks in completing high school is closing in many communities. 
   I hope our Republican colleagues will join in our agenda to help communities achieve all these goals and more. The bottom line is, they have made education their last--not their first, their  last--priority. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, we are less than 1 week away from the end of the fiscal year and we have yet to act on education, yet to act to provide the resources necessary to ensure education is funded. 
   We have a real opportunity this afternoon to voice our concern, to express our support, to commit the resources. There is no question, a strong public education system is critical for our Nation's future. That is exactly what the Democratic agenda provides. 
   I urge our colleagues who support the resolution we propose to oppose the Lott-Gregg-Coverdell resolution. I urge my colleagues to make the Federal Government a constructive partner in improving our public schools and to work to enact a strong education agenda with more than rhetoric and with a commitment to the resources and the investments that are required to ensure our actions meet our rhetoric.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator asks a very good question. I respond by asking three questions of my own. 
   If that is the case, why did the House Republican caucus choose to make the deep cuts they did? And, second, why was there not an outcry on that side of the aisle in this Chamber against those cuts? Where was the outcry when those deep cuts were made? If that is the case, my third question is, why today are we continuing to use the Health and Human Services subcommittee's budget, their allocation, as an ATM machine to fund everything else? Why the outcry on our side? Look at the record. Why the practice of using this budget as an ATM machine for everything else? If they support education, why doesn't the record show it? 
   I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts asks a very good question. Frankly, I am interested in their response to that question.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. 
   Ask people in South Dakota, and I am sure in Massachusetts: What do you want us to put our time, effort, and resources into? Without question, time and time and time again they say: We want to make sure that one thing happens--our young people are educated. We want to make absolutely certain if you do anything, ensure we have an educated workforce. 
   I was with a number of businesspeople over the weekend. Again, I was reminded this is not just an education issue; this is a business issue, an economic issue. This is an American strength issue. This could be called a national security issue. That is what this is. It isn't just about education. Our country is at stake. Whether or not we educate our young people adequately determines in large measure what kind of economy we will have, what kind of society we have, and certainly what kind of strength we will have in the long term.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are 7 calendar days away from the beginning of the new fiscal year. We have yet to schedule a markup on spending for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education here in the Senate. It is becoming increasingly disconcerting to many Members that over the course of the last several months, it has been the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill in particular, that has become the ATM machine for the entire Federal budget. 
   Given the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year, given the fact that just yesterday we saw the intentions of our Republican colleagues on the House side as they made spending decisions with regard to education, given the fact it may be we will not have an opportunity to debate a Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill on the Senate floor at least before the first of October, many Members thought it was important to raise the issue now, to at least have some discussion about where we are and where we need to go on this critical issue prior to the time we have cemented in all the other commitments and all the other decisions with regard to the budget and appropriations for the next fiscal year. 
   On January 6, the majority leader made a very strong statement about education. He said, ``Education is going to be a central issue this year. The Democrats say it is important and should be a high priority; Republicans say it is a high priority.'' 
   On April 14, the distinguished chair of the Budget Committee made a similar statement, very strong in its nature. He claimed that the budget resolution increased education funding by $3.3 billion for fiscal year 2000, and on March 1 he said, ``We are going to put real money where our rhetoric has been.'' The reality is, so far our colleagues have not kept their promise. Instead, as I said, we are using education as an ATM machine for everything else. 
   Senate funding for Labor-HHS-Education today is $15 billion below last year's levels, a 17-percent cut from a hard freeze of last year. Just last week, the Appropriations Committee took $7 billion away from the education budget. The Republican tax bill which was vetoed yesterday would have cut education by 50 percent in the 10th year. Yesterday, the House Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee finally brought up a bill, and that bill provides less for education than we provided last year. It kills the class-size reduction program, it provides only half of the President's request for afterschool programs, it provides a half a billion less for Head Start than the President requested, it underfunds title I for disadvantaged children, it underfunds safe and drug-free schools, and it underfunds education technology and youth employment programs. Clearly, education is the lowest--not the highest--priority for our Republican colleagues. 
   In the Senate, we still have a 17-percent cut, which would be devastating. Make no mistake about it, the ramifications of that kind of cut on education in one fiscal year would absolutely devastate educational programs: 175,000 fewer young children would attend Head Start; 2.1 million kids from high poverty areas would not receive the help they need to succeed; 85,000 fewer students would have access to afterschool programs and summer school programs than the year before; Federal funding for special education would be destroyed; virtually all schools would lose funding for drug abuse and violence prevention programs; 166,000 college students would not get work-study that makes college more affordable; 120,000 disadvantaged college students would lose the TRIO services that help them complete college. 
   Americans certainly know strong public schools are vital to our future. They say it over and over when we ask them in the 
   polling data. Mr. President, 79 percent of Americans in a poll just taken say improving education and schools is one of the most important factors they will use in choosing the next President. A strong majority supports increasing our investment in education, not slashing it. Some say public schools are broken and can't be fixed. That evidence is just not there. It doesn't support claims as erratic and as irrational as that. 
   In 1994, the Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We put policies in place to encourage schools to set high standards for disadvantaged children and assess students' performance. The standards are just now going into effect. Setting standards for low-achieving students helps all students. Eighty percent of poor school districts and almost half of all districts report title I has actually encouraged schools to put standards in place for all. We are starting now to see real results. Student performance is rising in reading, math, and science. U.S. students scored near the top on the latest international assessment of reading. American fourth graders outperform students from all other nations but one. The combined verbal and math scores on SAT increased 15 points between 1992 and 1997. The average math score is at its highest level in 26 years. 
   There are other signs of improvement. More students are taking rigorous courses and doing better. The percentage of students taking biology, chemistry, and physics has doubled. The number of AP exams where students scored a passing grade has risen nearly fivefold since 1992. Fewer students are dropping out. From 1982 to 1996, the dropout rate for students between 16 and 24 fell from 14 to 11. The gap between whites and blacks in completing high school has closed. In 1995, for the first time, blacks and whites completed high school at the same rate, 87 percent. 
   However, not all schools, not all students, reach their potential. We know we have to do better. Schools face many challenges they didn't face even when I was going to school. Enrollments are at record levels. A large part of the teaching corps is getting ready to retire. Diversity is increasingly bringing new languages and cultures into the classroom. Family structures are changing. More women are in the workplace. That increases the need for instructive afterschool and summer school activities. We are learning more about how children learn during early childhood, how important stimulating activities are for later success in school. The importance of a higher education and lifelong learning has never been greater, requiring even better preparation of all students. 
   These are national challenges. The Federal Government has to be a partner in addressing them. Now cannot be the time to cut education. Our Republican colleagues have proposed an education plan that falls short, not just in funding. Their other actions show they don't have a constructive agenda for public schools. They are blocking efforts to keep guns out of the hands of kids. Education block grants shift help away from disadvantaged children and reduce accountability, yet they continue to create even more block grants, and then slash the funding. They think giving a $5-per-year tax break to families with children in public schools will somehow improve student learning. They think diverting Federal resources to provide vouchers for a few children to go to private school rather than strengthening public schools that serve 90 percent of all children is somehow going to improve education in this country. 
   I think, with all due respect, our colleagues on the other side need to think a little harder. We have a comprehensive, constructive, and realistic educational agenda for the rest of this session. We help communities by serving all students, providing $1.4 billion to reduce class size and improve teacher quality, by tripling funding for afterschool programs and improving school safety, by increasing college access and affordability, by expanding opportunities to incorporate education and technology into the classroom and training teachers and principals in using it effectively, by advancing school readiness and literacy, and by helping communities leverage funds to modernize school buildings.  
   Further, as the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee works to update the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will push for higher standards for student achievement and get those standards into the classroom. We are going to fight for strong accountability provisions, including providing school report cards to parents, increasing public school choice through open enrollment, expansion of charter schools, and strengthening reforms to turn around failing schools. 
   We are going to focus on attracting talented individuals into teaching and make sure that new and veteran teachers and principals have access to opportunities to learn more about effective teaching and management strategies. We want to continue support for efforts to streamline Federal regulations and increase flexibility for local school districts while holding them accountable for student achievement. 
   However, funding is critical. While money is not the only answer, it has to be part of the solution. 
   Mr. President, 17-percent cuts in programs such as title I and Head Start will only make matters worse. A freeze at last year's levels is also unacceptable. The current fiscal year ends in 5 business days. Time is clearly running out. 
   We are simply offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to lay out why a 17-percent cut in education is unacceptable, and to lay out our priorities. The Democratic record on education could not be stronger. We voted for increases in funding for education without exceeding the spending caps or spending Social Security trust funds. We have a constructive agenda to improve public schools and increase achievement. Strong public education is critical to our future. Public schools have increased opportunities for people from all walks of life throughout our Nation's history. We have to continue to make sure all students have access to public schools so all students have the opportunity to develop their skills and learn to their highest abilities.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for a powerful statement and for his analysis of the current education budget and our circumstances here. 
   He has laid out what the ramifications are. People ought to know that rhetoric and reality could not be further apart as we listen to our Republican colleagues talk about education. The rhetoric all year long has been: Education is important; education is going to get the priority it deserves. The reality is, we are now 1 week away from the end of the fiscal year and we have yet to pass an education bill. We have yet to make decisions about what we are going to do on education next year. The decisions we are making--they are making, let me clarify that--that they are making on education are devastating, absolutely devastating. 
   I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, what is his analysis of a $1.5 to $2 billion cut in the President's budget this year? I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, what would his advice be to the President of the United States if he were to get an education budget $2 billion below his request?

   Mr. DASCHLE. I will ask the Senator from Massachusetts another question, if I may. He mentioned that one of the most important issues we are facing is the fact that we are dealing with 400,000 new students. We are dealing with the fact that we will have a shortfall, perhaps, in the next few years of 2 million teachers. Yet we see a Republican budget that eliminates the ability for us to help schools deal with class size by absolutely cutting the very programs that allow us to reduce class size and improve the student-teacher ratio. I ask the Senator, what do we do with a budget, or what will be the ramifications of a budget, that fails to recognize the demand for new teachers, the extraordinary explosion of new students, and the overcrowding of schools from South Dakota to Massachusetts? What is the message this Congress is sending with those facts?

   Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator asks an excellent question. The answer is they are not listening. They are not listening. When you propose a tax cut of the magnitude they proposed, gutting education by 50 percent--a tax cut the American people have said they don't want, they don't care about--and then take money they do care about and pay for that tax cut, it is an amazing thing to me. That is the most startling aspect of all of this. 
   What they care about is how educated their children are going to be, they care about what kind of a classroom they are going to have, they care about what kind of a school the children are going to walk into, they care about whether there is an afterschool program, they care about whether schools are safe, they care about whether or not they are going to have good teachers, and they care about whether or not they are going to be able to go to college. That is what they care about, and they tell us that in the polls. 
   So it is baffling to many of us why what we care about doesn't 
   seem to be reflected in the laundry list of deep cuts, if not eliminations, of the very programs that do exactly what the American people care about.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is exactly the question millions of Americans have to be asking once they analyze their budget. I can't tell you the number of times that law enforcement officials, teachers, and parents have come to me and said: Look. We all know the most vulnerable time for students is when they leave school. The most vulnerable time statistically--the time when most damage may be done and when most violations of law occur--is that period between 2 and 8 in the evening. 
   Obviously, we need as a society to come up with ways to effectively engage students and young people during that time when both parents may be working, during that time when the schools are closed. 
   What do our Republican colleagues do? Under the current framework, they would have to reduce the availability of programs for exactly that purpose. Again, it shows rhetoric and reality are so far apart. 
   The real sad tragedy is that the students are going to feel the brunt of this. Once we lose a student, it is hard to get him or her back. I don't know who but someone once said, ``It is much easier to build a child than to repair an adult.'' 
   We are going to be doing a lot of reparation and very little building with this kind of a budget. We need to be building kids and not repairing adults. This is not a budget to build children. 
   That is why we are fighting as hard as we are, and that is why we will continue to fight until we get those numbers turned around. 
   I know that our colleagues are prepared to offer an amendment, the Senators from Virginia. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, two years ago today, on September 23, 1997, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was read for the first time and referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Unfortunately, instead of coming to the Senate floor to commend the Senate for ratifying the CTBT or for taking steps toward that end, I must come to point out the Senate has done absolutely nothing on CTBT. Not a hearing, not a vote. And I must confess up front, I do this with a sense of confusion, disappointment, and profound regret over the Republican majority's inaction on this important treaty since its submission to the Senate. 
   The Republican majority's unwillingness to permit the Senate to take even a single step forward on a treaty to ban all nuclear testing has me and many observers confused for a variety of reasons. First, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been enthusiastically and unequivocally endorsed by our senior military leaders, both current and former. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated ``the Joint Chiefs of Staff support ratification of this treaty.'' The current chairman and fellow service chiefs are not alone in their support for CTBT. In fact, the four previous occupants of the chairman's seat have endorsed this treaty. Former Chairmen General John Shalikashvili, General Colin Powell, Admiral William Crowe, and General David Jones issued a statement on the treaty and the additional safeguards proposed by the President. Their statement concluded ``with these safeguards, we support Senate approval of the CTB treaty.'' 
   Second, several Presidents, both Republican and Democratic, have supported a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In fact, Presidents as far back as President Eisenhower have worked to make this prohibition a reality. On May 29, 1961, President Eisenhower said the failure to achieve a test ban ``would have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any party.'' Similar statements have been made by Presidents in every subsequent decade. And if this Congress fails to act, Presidents in the next millennium unfortunately will be uttering comparable remarks. 
   Third, the overwhelming majority of the American people, approximately 82 percent, have indicated they endorse immediate Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although opponents of the treaty argue support is limited to just Democrats or liberals, opinion polls point to a different conclusion. CTBT support spans the entire political spectrum. For example, among those who identify themselves as Republicans, 80 percent support the treaty and 79 percent of those who characterize themselves as ``conservative Republicans'' believe the Senate should ratify the CTBT. As far as geographic limitations, the polls show CTBT support knows no boundaries. From coast to coast and all points in between, the vast majority of Americans support this treaty. Let me provide the Senate with a few examples that back up this statement. In Tennessee, 78 percent support the treaty. In Kansas, 79 percent. In Washington, 82 percent. In Oregon, 83 percent. The story is similar in every other state in the Union. 
   With these facts as a backdrop, I think it is easy to understand why I and many others are confused that, in the two years since the President submitted the CTBT treaty, the Republicans have chosen to do nothing. CTBT is vigorously endorsed by our most senior military leaders, past and present. Senate Republicans are unmoved. Republican and Democratic Presidents since Eisenhower have strongly backed the CTBT. Yet, Senate Republicans choose to do nothing. Finally, over 80 percent of our constituents, from all parts of the political spectrum and all regions of the country, have asked us to ratify the CTBT.  And the response of Senate Republicans? Not a hearing, not a vote. Nothing but silence and inaction. 
   I mentioned at the outset that I am also disappointed by the course Senate Republicans have pursued. The reason for my disappointment is that Senate Republicans have permitted a small number of members from within their ranks to manipulate Senate rules and procedures to prevent the Senate from acting on the CTBT. I recognize these few members are well within their rights as Senators to use the rules in this manner. Under Senate rules, a small group can thwart or delay action on even the most vital pieces of legislation. This has been proven time and again since the Senate's founding. In more recent times, we have seen the same handful of Senators on the far right of the political spectrum repeatedly resort to these tactics to prevent the Senate from acting expeditiously on arms control treaties. 
   However, in many of these previous instances, a number of Republicans eventually decided to call an end to the political gamesmanship of their more conservative colleagues. They decided that this nation's national interests superseded the political interests of a few Senators at the far end of the political spectrum. They decided that the full Senate should be allowed to work its will on matters of national security. In short, they decided that politics stopped at the water's edge. I am disappointed that in this particular instance, two years have elapsed and I see no such movement within the Republican caucus. Two years is too long. I would hope we would soon see some leadership on the Republican side of the aisle to break the current impasse and allow the full Senate to act on the CTBT. 
   Finally, I also indicated I deeply regret the Senate's failure to act. While waiting for the United States Senate to ratify the CTBT, we have seen nearly 40 other nations do so. We have witnessed two additional countries test nuclear weapons while the intelligence community tells us several others continue developing such weapons. And in a few short weeks, we will observe the nations that have ratified the treaty convene a conference to discuss how to facilitate the treaty's entry into force --a conference that limits participation only to those nations that have ratified the treaty. If the United States is to play a leadership role on nuclear testing, convince others to forgo nuclear testing, and actively participate in efforts to implement the treaty, the United States Senate must exercise some leadership itself and give the CTBT a fair hearing and a vote. That effort must begin today.

   This has not been easy, especially this year, but they have demonstrated once again what happens when two people of intelligence and determination can work together to achieve the product that we have before us. I certainly hope that our colleagues will recognize that work and will be as supportive as I hope we can be on a bipartisan basis. 
   If there is one area where I hope we can take another look in conference it is section 8 and the question of public housing. The affordable housing crisis, as many know, is now at record levels. But we are in a situation where very little is available in the form of new vouchers to deal with millions of children and senior citizens who are currently at risk, not because we don't have the desire but because we haven't had the resources. 
   We have considered the demand for section 8 housing. We have looked at public housing in many ways but have not funded it adequately because we have felt the need to fund other priorities. In fact, we have used section 8 as an offset to fund other programs. That offset has now been completely depleted. 
   But 5.3 million American households suffer from the worst-case housing situations--defined as paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent or living in substandard conditions. I believe Senator SARBANES mentioned that. 
   In my home State of South Dakota, the average waiting list for public housing is now 9 months for section 8. It is a very serious problem even in a rural State such as ours where one wouldn't think that the availability of public housing is nearly as much of a problem as it might be in some of the larger cities. 
   But we have seen a half decade of a budget freeze on housing assistance. From 1977 to 1994, the number of HUD-assisted households grew by 2.6 million--an average of 204,000 additional households each year from 1977 through 1983, and an additional 107,000 households per year from 1984 to 1994. But in 1995 we saw a reversal of that policy--a freeze on new housing vouchers despite the growing need. 
   In 1999, we saw the first new vouchers in 5 years. The President has made a modest request for fiscal year 2000 of 100,000 for this year. Last year we made available 50,000 new section 8 vouchers, the first in 5 years. In my own State, again, 321 families would receive section 8 assistance with appropriations of 100,000 new vouchers. To provide no new vouchers is, frankly, a flaw in what is otherwise a very important bill. I hope we can begin to work on it much more constructively. 
   In some areas, housing costs have risen faster than incomes of low-income working families. In addition, due to the aging and gentrification of older housing, the number of affordable rental units has actually declined. 
   The section 8 housing voucher program clearly provides one of the only means--if not the only means--to subsidize the rents of apartments that families locate on the private rental markets. They don't give families a free ride. I think everyone hopefully understands that. There is no free ride for families. They still must find the resources to pay between 30 and 40 percent of their incomes for rent. They have to take some responsibility in their own right. Without vouchers, many low-income working families simply are unable to secure affordable housing. 
   Another problem, of course, related to public housing and section 8 housing is the Community Builder Program. The bill currently would require the firing of 410 HUD employees, which would eliminate local service in almost two dozen communities, including South Dakota. That also would be a problem. 
   I realize our distinguished colleagues had to make some very tough choices. I applaud them for making many of the choices they did and coming up with as fair and comprehensive a bill as we have before the Senate. I intend to support it strongly and enthusiastically. I do hope, though, when we get to conference, we can address the section 8 and public housing programs. I believe that is the one area where, as good as this bill is, we still can demonstrate real progress. 
   Failing that, I am very concerned about the implication for housing for low-income people across this country, in South Dakota, in rural areas, as well as in urban areas that I know are commonly associated with public housing programs. This is not just an urban problem; it is a rural problem as well. I know the distinguished ranking member understands that and is very knowledgeable and cognizant of that issue and problem. I hope we can do better in resolving it once we get to conference. 
   I congratulate my colleagues and yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to have the opportunity to talk about the next four votes because it is critical that everyone understand what really is at stake tonight. Many Democratic Senators are in favor of the bankruptcy bill. Many of us have indicated publicly we support a bankruptcy bill. But we also support debate on a bankruptcy bill. 
   We support the opportunity to take up a bill under the regular rules of the Senate, regular order, have a good debate, have amendments offered, do what we should do in the Senate tradition, and have the kind of full and open debate we have not had on a bill since last May. 
   We have not brought a nonappropriations bill to the Senate floor since last May under the normal Senate rules. 
   Every single bill that has come before us since May has been under unanimous-consent agreements that circumvent, if not completely eliminate, the use of the normal Senate rules. 
   I had a clear understanding, as early as last summer, that when we brought the bankruptcy bill up, it would come up under normal Senate rules. I understand times change and circumstances  change, but it is regrettable--although not surprising--that once again cloture was filed preemptively and without good cause. 
   Keep in mind, when one files cloture, it calls for the end of all debate. It is amazing to me that tonight we are voting on a motion to end all debate before we have even had any debate. Not a word of debate has been uttered on the bankruptcy bill. 
   We find ourselves in an amazing Orwellian circumstance in which we are ending debate before it begins, calling it a debate, filing cloture, and calling it quits. We cannot do that. 
   Time after time, I have indicated that many of us have opportunities to stop legislation, and we will be inclined to do that if we have no opportunity to bring up amendments, as regular order would allow. Again, many of us support bankruptcy reform and want to see a bankruptcy bill, but we also want to be able to offer amendments. 
   If cloture is invoked tonight, many of the amendments we had agreed to prior to bringing the bill to the floor will fall--amendments that both sides agree will improve the bill. Cloture will actually prevent those relevant amendments from being considered. 
   I do not know why any colleague would vote to eliminate even relevant amendments, amendments for which there is agreement. We have a managers' amendment to make improvements to the bill, but under cloture it would be subject to a point of order. 
   We want to go to bankruptcy. I want to see if we can reach some agreement on going to bankruptcy, but we cannot continue to gag Senators and prevent them from using the normal rules of the Senate in offering amendments. 
   Second issue: Cloture on Mr. Stewart. I have indicated publicly that even though I have some misgivings about Mr. Stewart, I will support him. This issue is not about Mr. Stewart. This issue is about the 45 nominations that are still pending, awaiting Senate action a few weeks before the end of the session. This issue has to do with 38 nominations in committee, 24 district, 13 circuit, and 1 International Trade Court judge. This issue has to do with nominees who have been waiting for the Senate to act now since January of 1996. 
   Judge Richard Paez, who is currently a U.S. district court judge, was first nominated in January of 1996. Judge Paez has been waiting 3 1/2 years for a Senate vote--3 1/2 years. That is half a Senate term. He has been waiting half a Senate term for the Senate to act. He has been waiting for more than 1,300 days for the Senate to vote, or 25 times longer than Mr. Stewart. Mr. President, 1,300 days is a long time to wait for the Senate to act. Judge Paez is a patient man, but I do not think it is too much to ask that, up or down, we let him get on with his life, up or down he have the opportunity to have a vote, up or down we say yes or no, you will be a circuit judge. 
   Justice Ronnie White, the first African American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court, was originally nominated on June 26 of 1997. He was actually put on the calendar in this Congress on July 22 of 1999, but he has waited for a total of over 7 months on the calendar in this and in previous Congresses. 
   Marsha Berzon was first nominated in January of 1998. Her nomination has been pending over 10 times longer than Ted Stewart's nomination. 
   There are 64 vacancies in the Federal judiciary today. Chief Justice Rehnquist has noted that and has urged the Senate to act. We have 45 nominations pending in the Senate right now awaiting 
   action either in the committee or on the floor. There are seven nominations on the Executive Calendar. Only 17 judges have been confirmed to date. 
   Some might claim: We have seen that happen before. I hate to say ``when we were in the majority,'' but when we were in the majority, during the first session in 1991, the last year we were in the majority in a nonelection year, we confirmed 57 judges; in 1992, an election year, we confirmed 66 judges. In the election year 1994, the last election year where we were in the majority, we had 101 judges confirmed. 
   All one has to do is look back at past precedent. All one has to do is look at the terrible unfairness of someone having to wait 1,300 days, 25 times longer than Ted Stewart, months and months--10 times longer than Ted Stewart in the case of Marsha Berzon--to see how unfair this system is. 
   I want to find a way to work through this. I know Senator HATCH, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wants to find a way through it. I am hopeful we can find a way through it within the next few days. Tonight I will move to proceed to the nominations of Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon, and we will have an opportunity to express ourselves on the importance of these judges. We will vote. I hope the majority will not oppose moving to proceed to those two judges: Ms. Berzon, an exceptional nominee for the ninth circuit; and Judge Paez, a sitting district court judge, a Hispanic American, also fully qualified, a nominee for the Ninth Circuit. I hope we can find a way to resolve our differences and move forward. 
   I felt strongly about the importance of having these votes. I feel equally strongly about the importance of trying to resolve this impasse. We will make every effort to do so. I believe my colleagues will support an effort to break this impasse, recognizing that, as important as this is, we cannot go home leaving all of this work undone. 
   I hope we can do so this week. I know the majority leader has indicated a willingness to perhaps even hotline Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon. I hope that will happen this week. If that happens, we will be in a better position to know just how much opposition there is. We have to move on. We have to have these votes. We have to confirm these nominations. We have to ensure we can pass a good bankruptcy bill. There is so much more we can and ought to do. That will take working together, and I stand ready to do so.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize the Black Hills National Forest to sell or exchange property it owns in order to acquire new property for the purpose of constructing two new district offices for the forest. The legislation is cosponsored by my colleague from South Dakota, Senator JOHNSON. 
   On February 27, 1998, the Forest Service approved the consolidation of the Black Hills National Forest's seven Ranger Districts into four districts. As a result, the Pactola/Harney and Spearfish/Nemo Ranger Districts are each currently managed by one District Ranger, but utilize two offices each. Combining these four separate offices into two district offices would save money in the long-term, be more efficient, and ensure good customer service for users of the forest. 
   One of the new district offices would be located on federally-owned property in Spearfish Canyon and house the Spearfish/Nemo Ranger District employees. The other new district office would be located on property to be procured near Rapid City, and would house the Pactola/Harney Ranger District and the Rapid City Research Station employees. 
   It is important to note that this legislation is particularly necessary given the extraordinarily poor working conditions experienced by the employees of the Rapid City Research Station. Their building is literally falling apart and fails to meet basic safety standards. In fact, due to a lack of proper ventilation and a failure to meet fire codes, the fire marshal has prohibited the research station from carrying out any of the chemical analysis critical to its mission. As a result, that work must be contracted out, using funds that could more appropriately be spent elsewhere. 
   Much of the resources necessary for the implementation of this legislation can be gained by selling property that will be made unnecessary by the construction of the new offices. However, the legislation does authorize any additional funds that may be necessary to complete this important project. 
   I have worked carefully with the Forest Service to develop this legislation. I believe it is a sensible and efficient way to ensure that the agency can meet the needs of the public. I urge my colleagues to give it their support.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday my colleagues, Senator ENZI and Senator GORTON, discussed the importance of a proposed new clean coal initiative that offers the opportunity to create a new type of cleaner-burning coal that will help to meet our nation's energy needs and the requirements of the Clean Air Act. I want to lend my strong support to this initiative, and express my hope that the Department of Energy and Congress can work together to find a way to fund this important project. 
   Under this initiative, the Black Hills Corporation of Rapid City, South Dakota, would work with the Department of Energy to test a new method of processing sub-bituminous coal to remove its moisture content and increase its heat-value. This new technology is much less capital intensive than any other coal enhancement technology known to exist today and has the real potential of becoming the first such process to be commercially feasible. It is my understanding that the upgraded coal which would be produced by this new process would be environmentally superior to current sub-bituminous coal and less expensive to ship, allowing coal users across the country to benefit from it. 
   There are extensive reserves of sub-bituminous coal in the Powder River basin, and particularly on the reservation of the Crow Indian Tribe. By expanding the market for coal from this area, we can help to promote economic development across the west. At the same time, we can provide coal users throughout the United States with cleaner-burning coal, and help to improve our air quality. 
   It is my hope that we can move forward with this project as quickly as possible. I urge my colleagues to give it their strong support.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last year I worked closely with my colleagues Senator BYRD and Senator GORTON to place language in the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Interior appropriations bill directing the Secretary to report to Congress on the need for a uniform federal policy guiding the collection of fossils from public lands. This was an important step that was long overdue. 
   Public lands such as those administered by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and other agencies are some of our nation's finest repositories of fossils. By studying fossils, paleontologists learn information that is vital to understanding the Earth and the history of life on this planet. Unfortunately, the variety of policies used by federal agencies to guide the collection of fossils from these lands are confusing to the public, do not ensure that scientists have a full opportunity to study valuable specimens, and do not ensure that fossils are adequately preserved for the future. I believe it is time that we developed such a policy and implemented measures to maximize access to and preservation of important fossil specimens. 
   I am very pleased that the Department has undertaken a serious review of this issue and is consulting with all stakeholders to ensure that it provides Congress with the best information and recommendations possible. It is my hope that this report will be completed expeditiously so that we can work with the administration on any follow-up measures that may be required. 
   In the meantime, it is my hope that the administration will move forward with one important way that it can immediately make fossils more readily available to the public. New information technology has given us the ability to send vast amounts of data anywhere in the world almost instantaneously. I believe the administration should begin immediately to explore ways to utilize this capability to make data about critical fossils available to scientists worldwide. For example, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has the capability to use CT scans to create high-resolution, three-dimensional images of a fossil and its internal structure that can be accessed by scientists over the next generation Internet. I strongly urge the administration to fund initiatives of this type in its fiscal year 2001 budget, and to move forward as quickly as possible with steps that can improve public access to these fossils.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me say this resolution was introduced last night. It was only put on the calendar today. To my knowledge, very few, if any, people have had the opportunity to read the resolution, much less give much consideration to it. So I ask unanimous consent the majority leader's consent request be modified to conform with the regular order of the Senate and provide for amendments and no limit on debate.

   Mr. DASCHLE. If I can respond to the distinguished majority leader, first, let me say that nothing, as I understand it, in this resolution--again, I have only had a cursory opportunity to look at it--would do anything with regard to the President's actions. The President is going to be able to act with or without this resolution. So the timing of the resolution has no real bearing on the President's decision. 
   We can adopt or reject the amendment and the resolution at any time. That is, I think, what the majority leader's intent would be, to put the Senate on record with regard to the action, not prevent the President from doing so because this resolution does not prevent him; it simply comments on what they view to be the advisability of the resolution. 
   But in answer to the question of the majority leader, let me say, we would want to at least give our colleagues the right to offer amendments. I am not in a position at this moment to come to agreement with regard to what the amendments might or might not be. I simply am asking that in the context of legislation and the Senate rules the regular order be followed. The regular order is that Senators can offer amendments. It does not say the regular order requires germaneness or relevancy. The regular order is Senators have a right to offer amendments. 
   I simply ask in my unanimous consent request that the regular order under Senate rules be allowed in this case as one would expect they would be followed traditionally.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we approach final passage of the reconciliation conference report, I would like to put what we are about to do in proper perspective. Although some have characterized this process as politics as usual or political posturing, I do not see it that way. What the House has done, and the Senate is about to do, is serious business, not a political game. 
   We are about to vote on legislation that affects this nation's economic and fiscal health and well-being. It will affect the live of millions of Americans for decades to come. The stakes could not be higher. 
   And when you boil away all the rhetoric heard during this debate, what you really have is a tale of two paradigms. The Republican plan is an old and familiar one. Republicans would take us back to 1981 and the failed economic policies of that era. These policies can best be characterized as wishful thinking that led to a fiscal disaster. 
   The Democratic position is that we should follow the model Democrats put in place in 1993 and continue to pursue to this day. Our plan turned record deficits into record surpluses and halted the skyrocketing growth of federal debt. At the same time, we have experienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. The Democratic plan is one of fiscal responsibility and economic prosperity. 
   In addition to giving us the strongest economy in a generation, the politically difficult vote cast by Democrats nearly 9 years ago provided something else. It provided this Congress with an historic opportunity--sustained economic health and the possibility of actual budget surpluses. 
   The question facing this Congress at this time is, which road will we take--the fiscally responsible path or the fiscally dangerous one? Will we opt to build on our success or put our nation's fiscal health at risk yet again? 
   As I have listened to many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am struck by how familiar many of their arguments sound. I am hearing some of the same dangerous rhetoric and false rosy scenarios that I heard last decade. 
   And as I look at their bill, I see many of the same special interests disproportionately benefitting from their actions. Make no mistake about it. When it comes to irresponsible tax cuts tilted to the wealthy, the Senate bill was bad, and the conference bill is much worse. Let me cite a few examples. 
   Under the terms of the bill before us, the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would receive an average tax cut of just $138. That's about 25 cents a day, not even enough for a cup of coffee. At the same time, Republicans feel it is appropriate to provide the top 1 percent of taxpayers, people with incomes over $300,000, an average tax cut of over  $46,000. A cup of coffee for most, $46,000 for a few. 
   To further highlight the skewed nature of this cut, people earning over $300,000 would receive more than 40 percent of the $792 billion in tax relief provided by this bill. Meanwhile, people making between $38,000 and $62,000, the heart of this country's middle class, would receive 10 percent of the tax cuts in this bill. Once again, much for a few, and little for many. It's hard to see how anyone could characterize this as fair. 
   While providing these huge tax cuts for a few, the Republicans opt to set aside nothing for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   In order to generate the surpluses necessary to pay for their monstrous tax breaks, Republicans require drastic cuts in education, veterans' health, defense and agriculture. If our military were funded at the level requested by the President, the Republican budget would force across-the-board domestic discretionary cuts of 38 percent below their level today. If defense were fully funded and Republicans followed the plan laid out by Chairman DOMENICI, these cuts would grow to 50 percent. 
   A final consequence of Republican recklessness is that they would force $90 billion in cuts to Medicare, student loans, veterans' benefits and many other programs on top of cuts I just described. The budget rules are clear on this. If tax cuts are not budget-neutral, the law requires across-the-board cuts in many mandatory programs. The Republican plan would require $32 billion in Medicare cuts over the next 5 years. And starting in 2002, the Republican plan would eliminate the Commodity Credit Corporation, crop insurance, child support enforcement, and veterans' education benefits. 
   As I said earlier, we have this historic opportunity, and this is how the majority responds. They fail on at least three counts. First, Republicans would set out on an irresponsible fiscal policy. As history has painfully proven, their tax cuts would inevitably lead to bigger deficits and more debt. 
   Second, they are pursuing an irresponsible national policy. Their tax cuts would explode just as baby boomers retire, eating up scarce resources that will be needed if the government is to keep its commitments on Medicare and Social Security. 
   Third, as Republicans have known from the outset, engaging in this reckless and risky course will only produce one outcome--a Presidential veto. The President has been clear: he will veto this bill. And I am confident that the vote on final passage will show equally clearly that this veto will be sustained. 
   Instead of wasting Congress's and the American people's time with this vainglorious pursuit, we should be working together on a fiscally responsible plan that protects the entire Social Security surplus, strengthens and modernizes Medicare by extending its solvency and providing a prescription drug benefit, pays down the debt, provides targeted tax relief for working Americans, and invests some of the non-Social Security surplus in critical priorities such as defense, education, veterans' health, and agriculture. 
   The size of the projected surpluses are sufficient to permit all of this. Yet, the Republicans insist on pursuing a course that neglects all but the tax cuts and is certain to produce a veto. 
   We have seen this course before. On juvenile justice, on the Patients' Bill of Rights, on gun control, on their overall budget plan, and on this bill. Time and again the Republican Congress has opted to follow a path outlined by ideological extremists. A path that focuses attention on special interests instead of the nation's interests. A path that wastes precious time and fails the American people when it comes to truly addressing their concerns. 
   When we return from the August recess, this Congress will have about 30 working days until our target adjournment date in October. I hope that when we come back in September, we can focus our limited time on the people's business. I ask that my colleagues reject this bill today, and begin that process immediately.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am delighted to join in the introduction of the ``Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 1999.''  For the last year, I have been working to extend the benefits of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to South Dakotans who worked in uranium mines and a uranium mill in western South Dakota. This legislation would accomplish that goal, and I am very grateful to Senator HATCH for his hard work on this issue. 
   In the 9 years since the passage of RECA, we have had time to reflect upon its strengths and its shortcomings. During that time, it has become overwhelmingly clear that we have not fully met our obligation to victims of our nuclear program. Most seriously, we have arbitrarily and unfairly limited compensation for underground miners to those in only five States, despite the fact that underground miners in other states such as South Dakota faced exactly the same risk to their health. This fact alone requires us to amend RECA so that we can right this wrong. 
   However, we have also excluded other groups of workers, and their surviving families, from compensation for serious health problems and, in some cases, deaths, that have resulted from their work to help defend our Nation. Many of those who worked in uranium mills have developed serious respiratory problems as a result of exposure to uranium dusts and silica. Similar concerns have been raised about above-ground miners and uranium transportation workers as well. 
   This legislation would address those shortcomings and ensure that those who have suffered health problems because the government failed to warn them about the hazards of working with uranium are compensated. It is my hope that Congress will act on it this session so that we can provide compensation to these workers as quickly as possible. 
   There is one issue I hope we can address when this bill is considered in committee. Earlier this summer, I hosted a meeting of former uranium workers in Edgemont, SD. The most pressing concern of many of them was their inability to purchase affordable, quality health insurance due to the serious, ongoing health problems many of them have as a result of their work. Even if compensated by the Federal Government, they fear they are only one hospital stay away from bankruptcy. I hope that I can work with my colleagues over the next several months to determine how we can ensure that these workers, who sacrificed their health for their country, have access to affordable health insurance.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Montana for his powerful statement and for the empathy that he again demonstrates for the people in rural America. He has been an extraordinary leader on the agriculture issue, as well as on so many issues relating to the farmer over the years. Again, his eloquence this afternoon clearly illustrates the degree to which he understands their problem and the degree to which he is committed to solving it. 
   There is a silent death in rural America today--a death that is pervasive, a death that increasingly is affecting not only farmers but people who live in rural America, whether it is on the farm or in the town. Thousands upon thousands of family farmers and small businessmen and people who run the schools and run the towns are being forced to change their lives--are being forced to leave their existence in rural America in large measure because it isn't economically viable. 
   The situation we have all called attention to over the course of the last 24 months has worsened. Just in the last 12 months, more than 1,900 family farmers have left the farm in South Dakota alone. 
   So there can be no question, this situation is as grave as anything we will face in rural America at any time in the foreseeable future. The question is, what should we do about it? Our response is the amendment that Senator HARKIN and I have offered. I will have more of an opportunity to discuss that in a moment. 
   Let me say, regardless of what legislation I have offered, and what legislation may have been offered on the Republican side, I think there are five factors that should be included, five factors that ought to be considered as we contemplate what kind of an approach we in the Senate and in the Congress must subscribe to if we are going to respond to the disastrous situation we find in rural America today. 
   The first is that this must be immediate. We cannot wait until September, or October, or November, at least to take the first step. I realize the legislative process is slow and cumbersome, but if we don't start now, we will never be able to respond in time to meet the needs created by the serious circumstances we face today. First and foremost, in an emergency way, this has to be responsive to the situation by allowing the Senate to work its will and do something this week. 
   Second, it has to be sufficient. The situation, as I have noted, is already worse than it was last year. Last year, we were able to pass a $6 billion emergency plan. I believe $6 billion this year is a drop in the bucket, given the circumstances we are facing in rural America today. Our bill recognizes the insufficiency of the level of commitment we made in emergency funding last year. Our bill is sufficient. Our bill recognizes the importance and the magnitude of this problem and commits resources to it: $10.7 billion. Groups from the Farm Bureau to the Farmers Union to virtually every farm organization I know have said we cannot underestimate how serious this situation is. We recognize that, provide the resources, and provide the sufficient level of commitment that will allow Members to address this problem. 
   So, No. 2, it has to be sufficient. 
   No. 3, it has to be fair. Our country is very diverse. I heard Senator SARBANES talk about the disastrous circumstances we are facing right now in Maryland. Maryland is different. We don't have a drought in South Dakota, we have floods. We have low prices. We have commodities that cannot be sold because they cannot be stored. We have agricultural situations, regardless of commodity, that are the worst since the Great Depression in terms of real purchasing power. Southerners have different crop problems. We have to recognize that there are regional differences and there are differences in commodities. Our emergency response has to address them all. 
   We also have to recognize that we must respond to the disaster that is out there. Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have drafted legislation that, at least in its current form, does not respond at all to the disaster. There is no disaster commitment in that legislation. For a lot of reasons--its insufficiency, its lack of fairness to commodities, its lack of appreciation of the problems within regions, the fact that it doesn't respond to the disaster--this side is convinced that if we were to pass the Republican bill today, it would not do the job. 
   I congratulate my colleagues for joining in responding to the situation, but I don't think it is broad enough. I don't think it is sufficient enough. I certainly don't think it is fair enough, given the circumstances we are facing today. 
   The final factor is simply this: As my colleague from Montana said, emergency assistance alone will not do it. We passed 
   emergency assistance last year and here we are, back again, less than a year later, with an urgent plea on the part of all of agriculture to provide them with additional assistance. Why? Because the market isn't working. Why is the market not working? There are a lot of reasons, but I argue first and foremost it is not working because we don't have an agricultural policy framework for it to work. 
   Freedom to Farm is not working. We can debate that on and on and on, but there are more farm organizations, there are more economic experts, there are more people from all walks of life, and there are more policy analysts who are arguing today that we have to change the framework, that we have to reopen the Freedom to Farm bill. That is a debate for another day. 
   Today, this week, the debate must be: can we provide sufficient emergency assistance to bridge the gap to that day when we can achieve better prices, a better marketplace, more stability, and greater economic security? 
   In just a moment I will move to table the Republican plan. This is in keeping with an understanding I have with the majority leader and the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee. It would be my hope, once it is tabled, we can have a debate on the Democratic alternative and have a vote on that at some point in the not-too-distant future, once people have had the chance to be heard. Then, hopefully, we will find some resolution. 
   I think it is important at the end of the day, or no later than the end of the week, for the Senate to have agreed on something. I don't think it is enough to simply have a Republican vote and a Democratic vote and leave it at that. It is my hope that we can work together to resolve the deficiencies in the Republican bill and listen to them as they express themselves on what it is about the Democratic bill with which they are uncomfortable. At the end of the week, we simply cannot close and leave without having acted successfully on this issue. It is too important. It sends the wrong message if we simply walk away without having accomplished anything. 
   I am very hopeful we can accomplish something, that as Republicans and Democrats we can come together to send the right message to farmers that we hear them, to send the right message to rural America that we understand, and that we are prepared to respond. 
   As I noted, we have two versions that have not yet been reconciled. Because I don't believe the Republican plan is sufficient, because I don't think it is fair, because it doesn't respond to all  regions and all commodities, I believe today we can do better than that and we must find a way with which to do better than that. 
   I yield the floor.

   I again compliment the distinguished Senator from Iowa and my other colleagues for their effort to get us to this point. I think for rural America this is one of the most important votes we are going to cast this session. Whether or not we send a clear message about the seriousness of this situation, the breadth and the depth of this situation, whether we really understand the magnitude of the problem will be determined by how this vote turns out. 
   If I had my way, we would do a lot more. But at the very least, we must do this. There are millions of people who are going to be watching to see whether or not the Congress gets it --whether or not the Congress understands the magnitude of the problem, whether or not we can fully appreciate the fact that people are being forced off the farms and ranches today, whether or not that happens, and whether or not we understand how serious this situation is will be determined in the next 20 minutes. 
   I must tell you, Mr. President, that this is a very critical vote. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to table this amendment. Join with us in support. Let's send the right message to American agriculture. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator MCCAIN and Senator INOUYE, an important bill to correct an inequity in the law affecting many Native American children. Every year, for a variety of often tragic reasons, thousands of children across the country are placed in foster care. To assist with the cost of food, shelter, clothing, daily supervision and school supplies, foster parents of children who have come to them through state agency placements receive money through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Additionally, States receive funds for administrative training and data collection to support this program. Unfortunately, because of a legislative oversight, many income-eligible Native American children placed in foster care by tribal agencies do not receive foster care and adoptive services to which all other income-eligible children are entitled. 
   Not only are otherwise eligible Native children denied foster care maintenance payments, but this inequity also extends to children adopted through tribal placements. Currently, the IV-E program offers sporadic assistance for expenses associated with adoption and no assistance for training professional staff or parents involved in the adoption absent a tribal-state agreement. 
   In many instances, these children face insurmountable odds. Many come from abusive homes. Foster parents who open their doors to care for these special children deserve our help. These generous people who are willing to take these children into their homes shouldn't have sleepless nights worrying about whether they have the resources to provide nourishing food or a warm coat, or even adequate shelter for these children. This legislation will go a long way to ease their concerns. 
   Currently, some tribes and states have entered into IV-E agreements, but these arrangements are the exception. They also, by and large, do not include funds to train tribal social workers and other program administrators. This bill would authorize tribes to operate IV-E programs in the same manner as states. Upon approval of a tribal plan by HHS, the tribe would be able to provide services to income-eligible children under its custody. The bill would also allow children in tribal custody to receive foster care payments where a tribe chooses not to operate the entire program if adequate arrangements are made between the tribe and the state for provision of child welfare services and protections required by Title IV-E. 
   The bill we are introducing today would: 
   Authorize reimbursement of Title IV-E entitlement programs for tribal placements in foster and adoptive homes; 
   Authorize tribal governments to receive direct funding from the Department of Health and Human Services for training and administration of IV-E programs (tribes must have HHS-approved programs); 
   Allow the Secretary flexibility to modify the requirements of the IV-E law for tribes if those requirements are not in the best interest of Native children and if the tribal plans include alternative provisions that would achieve the purpose of the requirement that is altered or waived; and 
   Allow continuation of tribal-state IV-E agreements. 
   In a 1994 report, HHS found that the best way to serve this underfunded group is to provide direct assistance to tribal governments and qualified tribal families. This bill would not reduce the entitlement funding for states, as they would continue to be reimbursed for their expenses under the law. I strongly believe Congress should address this oversight and provide equitable benefits to Native American children under the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the New Millennium Classrooms Act, introduced by Senators ABRAHAM and WYDEN, I am very pleased the Senate adopted this provision to encourage computer donations to schools. While I oppose the underlying bill, and believe the magnitude of the Republican tax cut is irresponsible, I do support a more reasonable level of tax relief with provisions targeted to address national needs. This provision, which has strong bipartisan support,  meets that test. I would also like to point out that Senator BAUCUS sponsored a similar provision that was part of the Democratic alternative considered earlier. 
   Technology is playing an increasingly important role in our society, in homes, in businesses, and in many aspects of everyday life. Employers will require increasingly sophisticated levels of technological literacy in the workplace of the 21st Century. Education Secretary Riley has pointed out that we can expect 70 percent growth in computer and technology-related jobs in the next 6 years. 
   Yet, a recent U.S. Department of Commerce report, ``Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide,'' finds there is a growing disparity in terms of who has access to technology. While more Americans are embracing technology, African Americans and Hispanics, particularly from lower-income families and from rural areas, have less access to computers, and that gap is growing. We find ourselves with a new, information-age definition of ``haves'' and ``have-nots.'' These conditions are not good either for those left behind, or for those who will be looking to hire employees in the future. 
   Every child should be able to gain technological skills through his or her classroom. Yet many schools are having difficulty meeting this challenge. Sadly, while some schools have access to the latest in equipment, too many schools, particularly in fiscally strapped urban and rural areas, have an insufficient number of computers, and most of those are outdated. The average computer in the classroom is 7 years old--and many are even older. A large proportion of these computers cannot run current educational software or connect to the Internet. 
   The Department of Education recommends that the optimal ratio of students per computer is five to one. Yet schools where 81 percent or more of the children meet the Title I eligibility standards have only one multimedia computer for every 32 students. Even schools where less than 20 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged have only one multimedia computer for every 22 students. 
   At the same time, research shows that students with the least access to technology can be helped most from effectively integrating technology into the classroom. A study by City University of New York found test scores of disadvantaged children increased dramatically with computer-aided instruction. 
   We have taken several steps at the federal level to increase schools' ability to integrate technology into the classroom. The creation of the E-rate program, for example, is helping schools obtain access to the Internet. Technology Challenge grants are providing resources to schools to upgrade their computer programs. We are also providing more resources to help train teachers on the best ways to use technology effectively in their classes. But many schools have a fundamental problem in obtaining suitable hardware. 
   Current law provides an enhanced deduction for corporate donations to schools until December 31, 2000. Unfortunately, few corporations are taking advantage of the enhanced deduction for two main reasons: the requirement that donated equipment be 2 years old or less does not fit companies' equipment use cycles, and the deduction does not provide a sufficient incentive. Modifying the tax code to address these limitations, as the Abraham-Wyden amendment proposes, will help us achieve the goal of putting a computer in every classroom and create ongoing incentives to make sure the technology is kept reasonably up-to-date. 
   The Rand Institute has estimated the cost of providing our schools with appropriate technology to be about $15 billion. The New Millennium Classrooms Act will help stretch federal funds efficiently and effectively to address this shortfall. 
   Mr. President, we all talk about the importance of encouraging businesses to become more involved in the educational process in their communities. This provision creates a strong incentive to help build those relationships while providing school children with access to updated equipment. I thank my colleagues for supporting it and intend to work to see it enacted as part of a more responsible budget plan.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the debate on the Senate's version of the reconciliation tax bill winds down, I wanted to come to the floor and say a few words about where we are in this process, how we got here, and where I think we ought to go. 
   Let me begin by saying that the discussions we have seen on the Senate floor these past few days should lead all of my colleagues--Democratic and Republican alike--to agree on one thing: the issues affected by this bill--Social Security, Medicare, education, tax relief--are serious and should not fall prey to political gamesmanship. It is not an overstatement to say that the nation's economic and fiscal health are  at stake. What we do on these issues will affect the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come. 
   The discussion has also revealed another truth. The debate on the proper course for this nation and its people as we head into the 21st century is really a tale of two paradigms. 
   The Republican vision for the future is to replay the past. They would have us follow their economic policies of the 1980s, a course that can best be characterized as one of both wishful thinking and fiscal disaster. This is a course of irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthiest among us. This is a course of voodoo economics, where providing huge tax breaks to the wealthiest was to somehow benefit everyone and reduce government deficits. 
   As history demonstrates, this really was a course of rosy scenarios and disastrous results. The benefits of their tax breaks were, not surprisingly, essentially confined to the wealthiest. Small deficits turned into massive ones. Government debt exploded, quadrupling in the 1980s. Unemployment averaged 7.1 percent in the previous decade. Median family income fell $1,825 in just four years. Welfare rolls were up 22 percent. 
   The Democratic vision for the future is to continue along the path we set forth in 1993, a path marked by fiscal responsibility and economic prosperity. Just to remind my colleagues of what we have accomplished since we embarked on this road, let me talk about the state of our economy when President Clinton took office. The deficit in 1992 was $290 billion and projected to grow to over $500 billion by the end of the decade and to continue rising each year thereafter. Again, unemployment was up, and family income was down. Welfare rolls were growing. 
   The Democratic-led Congress enacted a comprehensive economic plan in 1993. This plan was approved without a single Republican vote. And today, the results are clear. Economists have said this is the strongest U.S. economy they have seen in a generation. The record deficits have turned into record surpluses--$120 billion this year and larger every year thereafter for at least a decade. We are experiencing the longest peacetime economic expansion in this nation's history and, if it continues for several additional months, the longest in history, period. Economic growth during this period has averaged 3.5 percent--nearly double that experienced during the Reagan-Bush years. Unemployment is just over four percent--roughly one-half the level during the Reagan-Bush years. Median income for a family of four is up $3,500 since 1993. Welfare rolls are down 35 percent since 1994. 
   These are the two choices presented during this debate--whether we step back into a past filled with record deficits and debt or continue moving forward to sustain the economic and fiscal progress we have achieved since 1993. The question for the Congress and the American people is which road will we take--the dangerous one or the responsible one? Will we build on our success or put our national health at risk? 
   After carefully listening to the debate, it is apparent to me that many on the other side of the aisle would like to do it all over again. I have heard some of the same old, dangerous rhetoric and false rosy scenarios I heard in the early 1980s. Like then, I have heard misleading representations of government spending--both current and future. I have again heard talk of irresponsible tax cuts tilted to the wealthy and special interests. Once again, my Republican colleagues are proposing that we give short shrift to Medicare and, in a new twist, a prescription drug benefit as well. And finally, Republicans are again proposing massive cuts in education, veterans' health, defense and agriculture. These cuts are as unprecedented as they are unrealistic. If one assumes the Republicans simply match the President's defense spending proposals, all remaining discretionary programs would have to be cut by 38 percent below today's levels. If we follow the new, phantom baseline created expressly for the floor debate by Senators DOMENICI and FRIST, and again exempt defense, the cuts to all remaining programs will easily exceed 50 percent. 
   Mr. President, it is all the more disappointing to me that in the face of the historic opportunity afforded this body by our unmatched fiscal strength, the Senate is about to fail on three counts. The Republican majority is about to prevail and pass an irresponsible fiscal policy. Their tax cuts would reverse the progress of the 1990s and lead to us back to huge deficits and more debt. The Republican position also constitutes irresponsible national policy. The cost of the Republican tax cut would explode in the second decade of the 21st century--precisely when the baby boomer generation is retiring and resources are needed if the federal government is to keep its commitments on Social Security and Medicare. Finally, the majority has chosen to pursue this course in the face of a certain Presidential veto, should the bill reach the President's desk in something even close to its current form. 
   Instead of wasting the precious time of this Congress and the American people, it would have been better if Republicans had opted to work together with Democrats to develop a fiscally responsible plan that could get the President's signature. Democrats have offered the major parts of such a plan during the debate. Our plan consists of five components. Democrats protect the entire $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus; every dollar, every year. Democrats strengthen and modernize Medicare by setting aside a portion of the on-budget surplus to extend solvency and provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. Democrats pay down the federal government's publicly held debt, and, if our course is followed, eventually eliminate it. Democrats invest some of the non-Social Security surplus in critical priorities, such as defense, education, veterans' health, agriculture, and NIH. Finally, Democrats believe in a significant, responsible tax cut. 
   It is projected there will be sufficient resources to do all of this. Yet, Republicans refuse to do most of it. Instead, they choose to follow a course that has become all too familiar to Americans. Republicans again choose to pursue ideologically extreme positions that best serve special interests instead of the needs of ordinary, hard-working Americans. The Senate has seen this before, on the overall budget plan, on juvenile justice, and, most recently, on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   This is not a political game. We face serious challenges and historic opportunities. We have wasted precious time. The list of unresolved items that the Senate should address is a long one. And time is short. I hope that when we come back next week and in September, Republicans will discard their agenda written by special interests and pursue the people's agenda. If they do so, we can accomplish much together. If they do not, the American people will be the losers.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a few minutes of my leader time to comment. 
   We intend to support the effort to move this legislation to conference. In fact, I endorse the actions taken by the majority leader in this case in so-called filling the tree. 
   For the purpose of record and drawing a distinction on this bill from other bills where our majority leader has filled the tree prior to the time we have had any debate, this bill, S. 254, has been debated now for 8 days, from May 11 through May 20. We conducted 32 rollcall votes. The Senate considered 38 amendments--18 Democratic amendments, 20 Republican amendments. We had 10 Democratic amendments agreed to, 17 Republican amendments agreed to, and then we had 10 Democratic and Republican amendments that were not agreed to, and 1 Republican amendment was withdrawn. 
   The point I am making is that we have had a very good debate on S. 254. We had that debate. We brought it to conclusion. We had a final vote. Now it is time to move it on to conference. I fully respect the Senator from New Hampshire and his determination to slow this process down because he objects to some of the aspects in this bill, and that is his right. But I will say I support the effort made by the majority leader to move this bill to conference and the method he has employed to do so. 
   Again, this is not the same as laying a bill down for the first time, filling the tree and precluding Democratic amendments. We have had a very good debate on this bill. We have had an opportunity to offer amendments. I cite S. 254 as the model I wish we would follow on all bills, a model that we historically and traditionally have always followed, which is to lay a bill down, allow it to be subject to amendments, have a good debate on amendments, have the votes, have the final vote, and then go to conference. 
   I hope we can do more such of this in the future as we consider other authorizing bills. I urge my Democratic colleagues and my Republican colleagues to support the effort this morning to move this legislation forward to conference so we can resolve what differences there are with the House--and there are many very important differences. I am hopeful we can bring  this bill back from conference in time and that we can be as supportive of it as we were of the bill when it passed on May 20. 
   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to be supportive this morning. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know our side is out of time, so I will use leader time to make a couple of remarks with regard to the vote we are to take. 
   We all are able to use our rhetorical acrobatics from time to time, but I must say, no one is better at it than the distinguished Senator from Texas as we try to define this set of circumstances. 
   This is a lot more than a technicality. The Byrd rule is there for a reason. I am glad he subscribes to the Byrd rule, but I must say, this goes way beyond the debate we had in committee and the understanding the American people and even Senators have with regard to what is in the bill. This will give the conference, the Congress, the Senate, everybody, carte blanche all the way through the legislative process until this bill goes to the President's desk. Is that what we want to do? 
   It would be one thing to waive a point of order and do so on the bill alone. That would be understandable. I might add, in that regard, it wasn't the Democrats who made the point of order; it was the majority leader. The majority leader made his own point of order on this bill. It was the distinguished Chair, the senior Senator from Delaware, who made the motion to waive the point of order. So let's make sure we have our facts straight. No one here made the point of order. They did. 
   But the point of order is not just on the bill. The point of order is on the conference report as well. I want somebody to come up and tell me what is going to be in that conference report. There is a huge difference between the Senate version and the House version, even on the Republican side. There are major differences that have to be ironed out and worked out. 
   Is anyone here today prepared to waive the point of order on a conference agreement for which there has not been one word written, for which there has not been one meeting, for which really there is no understanding or comprehension today? How could we possibly waive a point of order on something we haven't done yet? That is what our Republican colleagues are prepared to do. 
   I hope we would have better sense than that, that we would recognize how ill-founded it would be and what a terrible precedent it would be for us to waive a point of order on actions to be taken at a later date by a conference we haven't even named. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week was one of unimaginable shock and sorrow for the families of John Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette. We prayed as we first heard the news that their plane had disappeared. We hoped against hope as the Coast Guard, the Navy and the National Transportation Safety Board conducted their ``search and rescue'' mission, and we anguished when they shifted to ``search and recovery,'' Now, as John, Carolyn and Lauren are laid to rest in the ocean that claimed their lives, we grieve. 
   Much has been said these past weeks--in this Chamber, across the country, and around the world--about these three exceptional young people. We have heard again and again how John, Carolyn and Lauren loved life. We have heard so many stories of their compassion and grace, their generosity and their considerable talents. We've heard, most heartbreakingly, about their potential. They had, each of them, the capacity for greatness. That is part of what makes their loss so profound. 
   The great poet William Wordsworth wrote: 
 What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now for ever taken from my sight Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what remains behind.  
   Nothing can bring back the splendor of their lives, or their potential. We are left now with only our memories of John Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren. With that in mind, Senator LOTT and I are introducing a resolution to authorize the printing of ``Memorial Tributes to John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr.'' These are our own tributes and condolences offered on this floor, this week, by members of the United States Senate. I ask the Senate to pass a resolution so that we may share our tributes with the families of John Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette. I can only hope the Kennedy, Bessette and Freeman families are able to find some small strength in the memories of their loved ones, and in the words and sympathy of those who grieve with them.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses what we consider to be one of the major procedural problems facing Senators today. It has to do with what is referred to here as the scope of conference. 
   For those who may be watching this debate and are not totally familiar with parliamentary procedure, after a bill is passed in the House and passed in the Senate, the bill goes to conference. Here the House- and Senate-passed bills, two separate pieces of legislation, are melded into one in a way that hopefully will be acceptable to members from both Chambers of Congress. Only one bill can become law. The conference report represents an agreement between the House and the Senate as to what specific proposals ought to be included in a single piece of legislation. 
   It has always been the case that when a bill comes to conference, if there is something in the House bill that is not in the Senate bill, or something in the Senate bill that is not in the House bill, a vote is taken and a decision made about the propriety of including that provision for the final version in the conference agreement. 
   At no time, up until recent years, was there ever consideration given to a situation where if a provision did not appear in either the House or Senate versions, could it even be considered in the conference. 
   However, a decision was made by the majority to allow original legislative provisions to be taken up in the conference, that is language that may not have even been debated in either body let alone received a recorded vote. 
   As a result of this decision made by the majority, we can go into this conference--whose purpose it is to work out the differences between the House and the Senate--and completely bypass the relevant authorizing and appropriations committees. In a sense, this decision set up a ``super'' legislative committee that makes up its mind oftentimes without the benefit of House or Senate hearings, without the benefit of action in any House or Senate committee, and without a vote on either the House or Senate floor. It is an amazing set of circumstances. 
   We have seen that happen over and over again. The most consequential incident occurred at the end of the last session when the White House and a relatively small group of Senate and House conferees made decisions that were not based on any actions taken in either body of Congress. 
   The distinguished Presiding Officer, after it happened on October 20, addressed this issue as eloquently and as succinctly as any Member I have heard. If my colleagues haven't had the opportunity to hear what he said, I think this excerpt states it so well:  
   I don't believe the Founding Fathers of this country ever intended for a few Members and staff to make more than one half of a trillion dollars worth of arbitrary, closed-door decisions for the rest of us, for America--almost one-third of the Federal budget--and then present them to all other Senators and Representatives, men and women, elected by the people of this country, by the taxpayers, and then say take it or leave it, an up-or-down vote.   
   So said the Senator from Nebraska. 
   The Senator from Utah said something similar and equally on point. Senator HATCH, on the same day on the Senate floor, said:  
   We should all be concerned about the perception this backward procedure--one in which we are considering conference reports on bills that have not even passed the Senate yet--will set a precedent for the future. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in a sweeping denunciation of this as anything other than a one-time event.  
   I wish this had been a one-time event. Unfortunately, it happens over and over and over. It is a complete emasculation of the process our Founding Fathers had set up. It has nothing to do with the legislative process. 
   If you were going to write a book on how a bill becomes a law, you would need several volumes. In fact, if the consequences were not so profound, some could say you would need a comic book because it is almost hilarious to look at the lengths we have gone to thwart and undermine and, in an extraordinary way, destroy a process that has worked so well for 220 years. 
   This amendment simply says let's get real. If we mean what we say, and if we truly want to end this amazing process, now is our chance. This is the opportunity. I am very hopeful our colleagues will support our effort to put democracy back into the legislative process, to ensure the committees, authorizing and appropriating, have an opportunity to express themselves and to ensure every single Senator on the  Senate floor has an opportunity to express himself or herself. 
   As I noted earlier, the dictatorial, take-it-or-leave-it approach referred to by the two Republican Senators is, unfortunately, not a one-time event. It has happened over and over. If we are serious about making changes, I cannot think of anything that ought to change more quickly and with broader bipartisanship than this. We will have an opportunity. 
   I appreciate very much the eloquence, leadership, and interest in making changes expressed by our colleagues over the course of many different occasions, occasions just as egregious as the one last October. On each of these occasions, Senators have been denied their basic rights as elected Representatives of the people of their State, and a mockery has been made of our legal and legislative process. 
   This is a very critical amendment. We will have an opportunity to vote on it in 15 minutes. I hope we make the right decision. I hope it is a bipartisan decision. I hope we can do it in a way that will allow us the opportunity, once and for all, to put common sense and some semblance of order into our conference process and the conference reports that we are called to vote on after the process has been completed. 
   Mr. President, I will speak just briefly about the underlying matter; that is rule XVI. I appreciate very much the effort made by the assistant Democratic leader. He has managed our time so exceptionally well. I am grateful to him once more for the extraordinary effort he has made in making sure colleagues have the opportunity to express themselves and to orchestrate our response to arguments made by our colleagues on the other side. I think the record clearly shows what the Democratic position was several years ago when our colleagues overturned the ruling of the Chair. We had said at the time that rule XVI was there for a reason. We believe rule XVI existed because there is an authorizing and an appropriating process. What has happened since that vote is interesting. What has happened is the Senate has become more like the House of Representatives than I believe it has, probably, ever been in our Nation's history. 
   The House of Representatives has a very tight process by which amendments are considered. There has to be a Rules Committee. The Rules Committee decides, on each and every piece of legislation, 
   how many amendments are offered. The majority dominates the Rules Committee, as we know, by a two-thirds to one-third ratio. When Democrats were in the majority, when I was in the House, I thought what an incredible power that is. For the Rules Committee, with its membership ratio tilted so heavily in favor of the majority, to decide means the majority gets its way virtually every single time. Only on rare occasions do a combination of minority and majority Members of the House join forces to thwart the will of the majority. That does not happen very often. 
   The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, saw fit not to have a Rules Committee in the Senate in that same sense of the word. We do have a Rules Committee. It is very important and carries out some functions that are in large measure directly related to how this Senate operates. However the committee does not dictate how the Senate floor operates. There is no gatekeeper when it comes to legislation. The gatekeeper is all of us, 60 votes. 
   Yet, what do we see now all too frequently? On virtually every single piece of legislation that comes to the Senate floor, the bill is filed, the so-called parliamentary tree is filled, and cloture votes are scheduled. Why would we be opposed to that? We are opposed to that because once there is no opportunity for us to offer amendments--whether they are directly germane to the bill or not--we are precluded from being full partners as legislators. We are precluded from the opportunity to express ourselves, to make alterations, to offer suggestions, to have the kind of debate on public policy that I think our Founding Fathers understood. 
   As a result of all of this, we have become increasingly concerned about what is happening to the Senate as an institution, as well as what it is doing to the Democratic Members who want very much to be a part of the legislative process as full-fledged Senators. So our vote is in large measure a protest of the extraordinary ways the legislative process has been altered now for the last several years; a process I do not believe our Founding Fathers ever anticipated; a process that is very much in keeping with the attitude and the mentality created by the Rules Committee in the House of Representatives. That is not what we were supposed to be. 
   People who want those kinds of rules ought to run and get elected to the House of Representatives. They ought not want to serve in the Senate. The Senate is a different body. Who was it who said the Senate is a saucer within which emotions and the rage of the day cool. Legislation oftentimes can be passed directly through the House of Representatives. It is only after they have been deliberative and thoughtful and considerate of a lot of different issues, and a supermajority, sometimes on controversial issues, having been supported, do we ultimately allow a bill to be passed in the Senate. 
   So this vote is about the institution. It is about protecting Senators' rights to be full-fledged Members of this body. It is about whether we, as Senators, want to be more like the House or more like what the Founding Fathers envisioned in the first place--full-fledged U.S. Senators with every expectation we can represent our people, we can represent our ideas and our agenda in whatever opportunity presents itself legislatively. Our Democratic and Republican colleagues certainly should support that notion. 
   Our Republican colleagues used it many times to their advantage when they were in the minority. We simply want the same opportunity to do it now. 
   My colleagues will be voting against this overturning of the ruling of the Chair in large measure because we still are not confident the majority is prepared to open up the legislative process as it was designed to be 
   open up the process to allow amendments, open up and give us the opportunity to work with them to fashion legislation that will create a true consensus on whatever bill may be presented. 
   We will have two votes at 5:30 p.m. The first will be the vote on whether or not legislation that has never been considered in the House or the Senate ought to be included in a conference report. Democrats say no; no, we should not allow that. 
   The second vote will be about whether we permit Members of the Senate to offer legislation, whether it is on appropriations or authorization bills, without the encumbrance of a Rules Committee, a right that, by all description, was anticipated by the Founding Fathers. 
   I hope we can adopt the amendment I have offered. I hope we will reject the overturning of the Chair on rule XVI. I hope we can work together to accomplish more in a bipartisan fashion in a way that will allow all Senators to be heard and to contribute. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his explanation and the discussion we have had this morning. I think it is fair to say there is no question we were misled about the situation we are in today. That is undeniable. I had the opportunity to discuss matters yesterday with regard to the 
   legislative schedule with our majority leader, and this did not come up. We were misled with regard to what the intent of the procedure would be. So, clearly, there is a bitter taste in the mouths of the minority as we find ourselves in this situation this morning. 
   The problem is not legislating on appropriations; the problem is legislating. We are not able to legislate in large measure because on virtually every bill cloture is filed prior to the time amendments are offered. Every bill. And so what has happened is the minority is relegated to a set of circumstances that requires us to use whatever vehicle becomes available. That isn't the way it used to be, but that is the way it has been for the last few years. 
   So I am sympathetic, as I have noted to the majority leader, with this institutional concept of going back to the time when we respected appropriations as appropriations bills and also respected the authorization process. But the Senate virtually has eliminated the authorization process, in part, because we don't have the opportunity to offer amendments once authorization bills come to the floor. So we have been forced to use the appropriations bills as authorizing, appropriating, legislating, the whole gamut, the whole array, the universe of legislative actions that come with our responsibility. So I have indicated to the majority leader that I would like to find a way to overturn the mistake made by Republicans 4 years ago. I am glad they have acknowledged it was a mistake, but I must say, since that mistake was made, we have been driven into a new set of legislative circumstances that make it very difficult to do the people's business. 
   Senator BYRD noted in our caucus that it isn't just this particular issue that is troubling. Frankly, there are a number of other issues. One I will mention is the scope of conferences. The majority overruled the Chair on the scope of conference issue. The majority now has the ability in a conference committee to put anything in a bill, whether or not it was added on the floor of the House or Senate. Anything. It is wide open. That, too, is something we ought to be looking at. There is a huge array of problems, procedurally, I think we ought to address. This is one of them. It seems to me in that context we ought to be looking at whether or not overturning the Chair now is what we need to do. 
   I will say the majority leader has indicated a willingness to work with us in addressing these problems. I am personally concerned about the agriculture appropriations emergency supplemental we have to pass. Once a point of order is reestablished, we are completely locked out. There is no other way to do it. So from both a practical, as well as a procedural, and, frankly, a personal point of view, I am troubled by how we got here this afternoon. 
   I will also note that one of our colleagues who uses the rules as successfully as anybody ever has in all 220 years of our history, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, is not here. How ironic it would be that while he is tending to family matters, we took away his rights. So I suggest to the majority leader that we schedule another time for a good debate about all the things we should do. 
   I will work with my caucus to find the time, and we will need to have the votes. We know how the votes--I am quite sure I know--will turn out. 
   I am prepared to work with the majority leader to schedule a day, but not this afternoon. This is not the moment, for all the reasons I have outlined. I think we deserve an opportunity to debate this and all of its ramifications, and why it is that we find ourselves here in the first place, and how we might work--as the majority leader has noted, cooperatively. Cooperation is a two-way street. I want to cooperate with him. And I will in every way that I can. But I hope the majority will cooperate with the minority in giving us an opportunity to offer amendments and not fill the tree and not play the parliamentary game out to the extreme so that we are forced to do things we would rather not do. 
   I guess that would be my suggestion--that we find the time, perhaps early next week, to vote. We would agree to a timeframe within which this could be debated and a vote set. 
   I would be happy to discuss either on or off the floor a refinement of that recommendation with the majority leader. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would want to consult first with the senior Senator from Massachusetts to be sure he could be back that early. I assume he might be back by then. I would want to consult, as well, with my caucus. But that is in keeping with the recommendation that I made. 
   I am not averse necessarily to doing it on Monday or Tuesday, and to setting, as I noted earlier, a timeframe within which we could debate it and vote. 
   But, again, this is a matter which I think may require a little more consultation than the time we have this afternoon.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the leader can get that commitment in spirit. 
   Let met give the leader three qualifications, and I am sure the leader will accommodate me on all three qualifications. 
   First, if Senator KENNEDY has to be away for family business or personal family matters--the tragedy that he is facing--certainly the majority leader would understand that, and I hope he would accommodate Senator KENNEDY's needs as we schedule. 
   Second, he noted on more than one occasion, privately and publicly, that he is willing to work with us to ensure that, even if the Chair is overturned, we will find a way--and there are no misgivings about finding a way on either side, I hope--to pass an emergency agriculture appropriations measure. Clearly we will be denied that once this vote occurs. So I know--he told me privately and again alluded to it this morning--that he will work with us to do that. 
   Third, it would seem to me we would have to have a period of time--no less, at least, than 5 or 6 hours, 3 hours equally divided--to discuss this matter and then have the vote. 
   If he is willing to accommodate this Senator on those three matters, I would certainly, for the record right now, indicate my willingness to work with him to set a time certain for the vote.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have to respond to a couple of points made by my friend, the distinguished majority leader. 
   First, with regard to the Social Security lockbox, if ever our point was made on a particular bill, it is this one. This is exactly why we are here. I am amused and completely appreciate what it is Senator LOTT has just said once more: Why do we need so many amendments? This is a simple little idea--Social Security lockbox. Why do we need so many amendments? This is just a simple idea. 
   Mr. President, a simple idea can have profound consequences. There may be one or there may be more than one way to enact a simple idea. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG offered on the Senate floor an agreement that said we will limit ourselves--and here we are again, the minority--we will limit ourselves to 12 amendments. Our Republican colleagues objected. That wasn't good enough. Twelve amendments was too many. 
   We find ourselves, time and time and time again, not filibustering a bill. I do not remember the last time the minority filibustered a bill because we didn't want it to pass. The only time I can recall we have filibustered--and fortunately we have never lost--is on our procedural right to offer amendments. That is the only time, that I am aware of, we have fought, because our rights need to be protected. I am compelled to set the record straight, and I am compelled again to respond. This is why we are in this box. 
   Ideally, what will happen is, a bill could get laid down, Democrats and Republicans could offer amendments; if it got out of line, Senator LOTT and I could say: People, we have to get this bill done. We have to get this bill done. Will you limit yourself? Let's develop a finite list of amendments. 
   Often that works. I have some of the best lieutenants I could hope to have, and when I sic them on the caucus, it is amazing how responsive the caucus is. It works. I come back and report to the majority leader, we can do this in 15 amendments, and we can do this tonight, and it works. That is one model. 
   The other model is, we are presented with a confrontation. A bill is filed, the tree is filled, a cloture vote is taken. That is the other model. That model doesn't work, and it will never work. I don't care whether it is an appropriations bill or an authorization bill, we will not allow that to work. 
   We can continue to play that out until we die of old age. It is not going to work, not as long as we are here. If we are going to get cooperation, then I am willing to look at that Social Security lockbox again. Twelve amendments doesn't seem too many to me. Yes, there may be some irrelevant amendments--not irrelevant, but nongermane amendments. They are certainly relevant to us. 
   I think the Republicans demonstrated last week, with the Patients' Bill of Rights, they can deal with it if we offer amendments. They can deal with it. They are in the majority. They have the votes to defeat our proposals. I am not sure I know what they are afraid of. 
   In any case, I have spoken long enough. As the majority leader has noted, the time has come to move on. I am willing to work with him to make the most of the time remaining this week and certainly next week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we take up the next amendment, let me just comment briefly on the amendment already agreed to, offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. BIDEN. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I am very pleased with the action taken this afternoon by the Senate. The amendment certainly signals our continuing strong commitment to this innovative approach to crimefighting; that is, the COPS Program. 
   The crime rate in the United States has gone down for 6 consecutive years--the longest period of decline in 25 years. And we received even more good news recently. This year's National Crime Victimization Survey reports that the number of Americans who were victims of violent crimes dropped 7 percent between 1997 and 1998. 
   That is great news. Of course, no one claims we have won the war against crime, but we are certainly winning some important battles. The 100,000 officers placed on the beat since the COPS Program began in 1994 have been on the front lines of this vital effort. 
   Why would we jeopardize that success? The additional officers put on the beat since 1994 have revolutionized community policing, and the COPS Program has helped foster an unprecedented crime-fighting partnership between communities and Federal, State and local law enforcement. Why should we let something that has proven to be so effective wither on the vine? 
   We should instead build on the success of this program, which has been endorsed time and again by every major law enforcement organization. 
   I have seen firsthand how valuable the COPS Program has been in communities in my home State. South Dakota's law enforcement officials are among the most well-trained and capable public servants in the country. 
   South Dakota's crime rate is low, and its streets are safe, but, just as in more populated States, South Dakota families still worry about the safety of their streets and neighborhoods. 
   In my State, and in rural America in general, the COPS Program can double the size of some police or sheriff's departments by providing funding to hire just one or two additional officers. Many of the small towns and counties in my State are faced with tight budgets, limiting the amount of resources they can devote to law enforcement personnel. By providing those resources, the COPS Program has had a profound impact on these communities. 
   Law enforcement officers in South Dakota have described that impact to me. 
   They have testified about how the COPS Program has helped them. 
   Let me share just one of those stories, because I think that it provides a vivid example of how this program can truly make a difference. 
   In the days immediately following the Littleton, CO, tragedy, parents throughout the Nation were terrified by a rash of bomb threats and a fear of ``copycat'' crimes. In South Dakota, we had to deal with over 30 bomb scares. 
   One of those threats was called into Tri-Valley, a school in a rural community outside of Sioux Falls, SD. Fortunately, Tri-Valley has a police officer, called a ``school resource'' officer. His name is Deputy Preston Evans, and his position is funded by a COPS grant. 
   On the day of the bomb threat, as students were being evacuated from the school, a number of students came up to Deputy Evans and told him they knew who had made the threat. By the end of the day, two suspects had been arrested. 
   Those students were able to confide in Deputy Evans for one reason they trusted him. And they were able to trust him because they knew him--they had a relationship with him. How many acts of violence or mischief are deterred in schools like Tri-Valley because the students can confide in such a person, who might not be there without the COPS Program? 
   In a video conference yesterday, I spoke with some of the law enforcement leaders in South Dakota--Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead and Sioux Falls Police Chief Clark Quiring, and many others. They told me how the COPS Program has provided them the flexibility to increase their presence in schools. 
   They mentioned how important it is for students to feel secure. As Sheriff Milstead so eloquently noted, ``there is not a bigger barrier to learning--than fear.'' 
   For his generation, the greatest fear was going home that afternoon with a bloody nose, he told us. 
   Littleton reminds us that kids today have a lot more to worry about than just a fist-fight with a school-yard bully. 
   But thanks to the COPS Program, children today have someone they can turn to. 
   Dr. Bill Smith, the Instructional Support Services Director for the Sioux Falls School District, joined the law enforcement leaders in yesterday's video conference and told me that we now have evidence that officers in schools are welcome and helpful. 
   When students throughout the Sioux Falls district were asked in a year-end survey whom they would go to if they had a problem, 44 percent said they would confide in their school resource officer before anyone else. 
   That is a remarkable statistic: 
   44 percent of the students said they would go to their school resource officer before they would turn to their teacher or principal. I can think of no more compelling evidence of how this program can make a real difference than that. 
   Today, the Senate will help ensure that the COPS Program, and officers like Deputy Evans, will continue to make a difference--in our schools, on our streets, and in our neighborhoods. 
   The action taken by the Senate just now is a tribute to the men and women across the country who risk their lives every day to make our communities safer. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take a moment to thank the majority leader for his willingness to work with us and cooperate to the point that he has tonight to reach the agreement we have for Monday. I believe this is a fair compromise. We will have an opportunity to debate it, offer an amendment, and have the vote. We will also have the opportunity to have a good discussion about how we might proceed with agriculture disasters. I think this accommodates many of the concerns we have raised. 
   I also must share his hope that we can finish this bill at a reasonable hour. It is 9 o'clock. There is no reason within the next hour we couldn't finish this bill. I appreciate especially the deputy minority leader for all of the work he has done to get us to this point. We are down to a couple of amendments on our side. I am hopeful we can finish. There is no reason we can't do it reasonably soon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to participate in today's discussion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Senator LANDRIEU and Senator MURKOWSKI deserve great credit for their efforts to restore the LWCF's important conservation goals, as does Senator LOTT for his commitment to addressing this issue on a bipartisan basis. 
   Congress originally intended that revenues from off-shore oil and gas drilling be deposited into a Land and Water Conservation Fund to allow the federal and state governments to protect green space, improve wildlife habitat, and purchase lands for conservation purposes. I have come to appreciate this program, as the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been used by local and state governments in South Dakota to purchase park lands and develop many of the facilities that exist in municipal and state parks throughout the state. 
   For the past five years, however, the state side of the LWCF has not been funded, the revenues from off-shore oil and gas drilling have been used to fund other federal programs. As a result, much-needed local and state park improvement projects have been held back, and there has been growing pressure in recent years to divert these funds back to their original purpose. 
   Americans depend increasingly on parks and open spaces for recreation because they allow all of us to deal better with the stress of modern life. Therefore, it is important that states are given the resources they need to improve parks and public lands, and I am prepared to work in a bipartisan fashion to enact legislation this year to ensure greater annual funding of conservation efforts from off-shore oil and gas drilling revenues. 
   A number of proposals, many of which are bipartisan, have been proposed by the administration and members of Congress to ensure that future off-shore oil and gas drilling revenues are dedicated to conservation purposes. A consensus appears to be developing that considerably more resources should be invested to protect and maintain rural and urban parks, preserve farmland and forests, provide incentives for the protection of endangered species on private lands, fully fund payments-in-lieu-of-taxes, and protect coastal resources. 
   I believe that this legislation could have a tremendous positive impact on local, state, and national parks, and greatly enhance outdoor recreation and environmental education projects throughout South Dakota and the nation. It is my strong hope that Congress will produce compromise legislation reflecting many of the basic objectives contained in these proposals and ensure a strong future for our nation's natural resources. I am dedicated to working with Senators LANDRIEU, MURKOWSKI, and LOTT to achieve this goal.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Like so many of us, I listened all weekend long to the news reports, and held onto hope long past the point when it was reasonable to do so. 
   I wanted so much for there to be a different ending--for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren to somehow, miraculously, have survived. So like people all across our Nation, all across the world, I kept a vigil. 
   Then, Sunday night, the Coast Guard announced that the rescue mission had become a recovery mission. 
   Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the Kennedy and Bessette families. We pray that God will comfort them and help them bear this grief that must seem unbearable now. We offer our sympathies, as well, to the many friends of John Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette. They, too, have suffered a great loss. 
   I want my friend, Senator EDWARD KENNEDY, John's uncle, to know, as I have told him personally, we are praying for him. 
   Just last week, Senator KENNEDY stood on this floor and spoke about people who had died too young, and the heartbroken families they had left behind. He urged us to pass real patient protections so other families would not have to experience that same pain. 
   Today, once again, it is Senator KENNEDY's family, along with the Bessette family, who are experiencing the pain of death that comes far too soon. 
   More than a century ago, the great New England poet, Emily Dickinson, sent a letter to a friend who had lost someone very dear. ``When not inconvenient to your heart,'' she wrote, ``please remember us, and let us help you carry [your grief], if you grow tired.'' 
   I know I speak for many of us when I say to Senator KENNEDY: Please--if there is any way--let us help you carry your grief, if you grow tired. You and your family have given our Nation so much. Let us--if we can--give something back to you. 
   All weekend, I watched the news. Over and over again, I saw that heartbreaking image of the little boy saluting his father's coffin. Then came the announcement that the little boy was gone, too. And just when I thought I finally understood the magnitude of the loss, I listened to the news again this morning, and I heard friends of John F. Kennedy, Jr. say they felt certain he would have run for public office one day--probably for a seat in the United States Senate. 
   I don't know if that is true. I do know that John F. Kennedy, Jr. believed deeply in public service. He believed what his father had said: ``to those whom much is given, much is required.'' If he had chosen to run for the Senate, I have no doubt he would have succeeded, and he would have been a great Senator. 
   I suspect we will regret for a long, long time what John Kennedy did not have time to give us. I hope we will also remember, and treasure, what he did have time to give us. Those moments of joy when he was a little boy playing in the Oval Office with his sister and father; his stunning example of courage when he said good-bye to his father. 
   I hope we will remember: 
   His kindness and surprising humility; his inventiveness, and his professional success; the good humor and amazing grace with which he accepted celebrity; the dignity with which he bore his sorrows; 
   and the happiness he found in his life, particularly in his marriage. 
   Some years ago, another young man died too young. Alex Coffin, the son of Reverend William Sloane Coffin, was driving in a terrible storm when his car plunged into Boston Harbor and he drowned. He was 24 years old. Ten days later, William Sloane Coffin spoke about Alex's death to his parishioners  at Riverside Church in New York City. I want to read a short section of his sermon, because I think it bears repeating today. 
   The one thing no one should ever say about Alex's death--or the death of any young person--is that it is God's will. ``No one,'' Reverend Coffin said, ``knows enough to say that ....... God doesn't go around this world with his finger on triggers, his fist around knives, his hands on steering wheels. God is dead set against all unnatural deaths ....... My own consolation lies in knowing that ..... when the waves closed over the sinking car, God's heart was the first of all our hearts to break.'' 
   None of us knows why John Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette were taken from us in the prime of their lives. We don't know why the Kennedy family has had to endure so much sorrow over so many years. Nor do we know why the Bessette family has to suffer such an incomprehensibly huge loss all at once. What we do know is that the hearts of the Kennedys and the Bessettes were not the only hearts that broke when the waves closed over that sinking plane last Friday night. We are all heartbroken by the deaths of three such remarkable young people. 
   Not long ago, I came across a book of poems by another man who also lost a young son. The man's name is David Ray. His son's name was Sam. Sam also died, at 19, also in a car accident. After Sam's death, his father wrote a whole series of poems to him, and about him. I'd like to read a very short one; it's called ``Another Trick of the Mind.'' 
 Out of a book, a little trick-- Instead of the picture and much longing for that lost face, place yourself within the frame. You are back together again, if only in the past, or in the dream, or this gilded picture in mind. But it is no longer a dream, or a picture of loss. And then you go on, down the road you have to go, together.  
   In our memories, we all have a scrapbook full of images of John Kennedy, Jr. Perhaps in the days ahead, when the sadness creeps up on us, we can imagine--just for a moment--that John and Carolyn and Lauren are still with us. And we can go down the road we have to go, together. And maybe when we play that trick on ourselves, and our sadness lifts for that moment, we can remember how fortunate we were to have had them with us as long as we did. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last 2 years, Democrats have worked tirelessly for this moment. We have been guided by a very simple goal. That goal is to protect the rights of 160 million Americans who have private health insurance. Democrats have tried to answer the question: What should motivate that system, money or medicine? What should be the crux of our health care system? Do we put a money screen on decisions, or do we put a medical screen on decisions? We concluded that when it comes to someone's life, someone's health, the answer to that question is very simple. 
   Democrats have outlined six basic principles. The first is that all 160 million Americans ought to be covered by patient protections. We offered an amendment to ensure that all 160 million Americans would be covered, and our Republican colleagues defeated it. 
   The second principle is to ensure we provide access to needed 
   care regardless of circumstances: access to qualified specialists, real access to emergency rooms, access to lifesaving treatments and drugs, access to quality care that is unique to America in some cases. We offered amendments to provide these protections, and our Republican colleagues defeated them. 
   The third principle is simply this: That doctors ought to make medical decisions. Not accountants, not bureaucrats, not people with green eyeshades who make monetary decisions instead of medical ones. Let doctors make those decisions. We offered an amendment, and our Republican colleagues defeated it. 
   The fourth principle is quite simple to understand, but extremely important to millions of Americans. Let us, above everything else, protect the doctor-patient relationship. Let us ensure that all doctors can talk about all medical options with their patients when they are facing critical medical decisions. Let us ensure that we protect doctors from retaliation by managed care companies. And let us ensure that chronically ill patients get to keep their doctors. 
   Mr. President, that is not too much to ask. When we talk about rights, basic rights in this country, what could be more basic than that? We offered an amendment, and our Republican colleagues defeated it. 
   The fifth principle is one we also feel strongly about, and that is accountability. I have heard many of our Republican colleagues say: You should not have to go to court to get your health care; the important thing is getting the care you need. 
   We agree with that, and we provide a strong, independent appeals process. But all too often, HMOs make decisions that are wrong. And all too often, patients are left with absolutely no recourse. We simply believe that when this happens, when an HMO or an insurance company makes the wrong decision, you ought to have some recourse. You ought to be able to hold them accountable. You can with a doctor. You can with a hospital. Why not with an insurance company? 
   Finally, I have never been more proud of our women Senators, and I have never been more convinced that we need more women in the Senate than I am tonight, because they have enlightened us, Mr. President, in our caucus and on the floor. They have sensitized us to women's issues unlike anything I have ever heard before. There isn't a man in the Senate who can tell us what they told us, with the eloquence, with the passion, with the feeling. They told us there are special needs of women that just are not being addressed. If we are going to make this system work better for millions of Americans, we ought to understand that. So we offered an amendment to ensure that women's needs are protected, and our Republican colleagues defeated it. 
   Tonight, I agree with those who have said we missed a golden opportunity to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We have offered clear choices. The majority has opposed us every step of the way. The majority leader said, let's work together, work with us. We have made every effort to work with our colleagues, but the only thing we have gotten back is what I believe the Republican bill truly stands for when it calls itself HMO reform. In my view, HMO stands for ``half measures only.'' That is all we have gotten--half measures. To those who say, isn't this just a little bit better? my answer is no. In all sincerity, I believe we will actually lower the standard when we pass this bill tonight. We have not made progress; we have moved backward. 
   I am always amused, frankly, that our Republican colleagues turn to taxes anytime they want to fix a problem. I am surprised there is not a tax break for observing the speed limit. Tonight, there is another $13 billion bill that we will be voting on, most of which is a tax break. I support meaningful tax reform, targeted especially to working families. But when we talk about a Patients' Bill of Rights, are we really talking about the need for a tax break, or a break from the kind of oppression that many people feel with their insurance and managed care companies? 
   I also regret the fact that we did not have an opportunity to debate the bipartisan bill. I wish we could have had a good debate on the Graham-Chafee bill. I wish we could have at least moved forward with that piece of legislation. I believe there would have been 45 Democratic votes for that bill tonight. The problem is, as I understand it, there are only three on the Republican side. 
   Even if we offered a bipartisan bill, cosponsored by two very prominent Members of our Senate tonight, we would only have the same 48 votes we had on almost every single amendment we offered. 
   The President will veto this bill because he and we know we can do better than this, that we should not lower the standard. We should do far more to ensure that we cover all patients, all 160 million. Ultimately, I believe, as Senator KENNEDY noted, we will pass a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   This afternoon I was reminded again of how critical this is to real people. Throughout this debate, what meant most to me is the experience I have had in talking to real people whose lives have been affected by managed care companies, whose lives have been directly, and in some cases, negatively affected by their decisions.  
   Justin Dart, a full-fledged lifelong Republican was out on the lawn this afternoon. He was there in his wheelchair, surrounded by medical equipment needed to function and maintain his health. He has experienced medical care. He has benefited from it, and, unfortunately, as he related again today, he has been disappointed by it. 
   In the most passionate and most eloquent way he could say it, with his lips quivering, speaking to all of us, as he urged the Senate to do the right thing tonight, he said: ``I'll give my life for my country, but I won't give it to an insurance company.'' 
   Too many people have given their good health, and in some cases their lives, because decisions have been made by insurance companies for the wrong reasons. We are going to fix that. I am hopeful, as others have expressed, we can do better, we can find a way to ensure that all Americans are going to be protected, as we know they should be. We should not give up until we know we have done the job right. 
   Mr. President, over the past three-and-a-half days, we have finally had the opportunity to have a good debate on several critical issues affecting patients' rights. Senate Democrats--and the patients of America--have waited a long time for it. Because of limited time, other critical issues remain to be debated. Still, we are glad the Senate has spent most of this week debating two dramatically different approaches to patients' rights. The American people deserve to understand the differences. They are important. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has indeed missed a golden opportunity to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Instead, the Republican majority is handing the insurance industry its version of HMO reform: Half Measures Only. 
   On critical issues, we gave our colleagues a choice: guaranteed patient access to the closest emergency room versus ambiguous assurances of limited emergency care; access to clinical trials for all life-threatening and disabling diseases versus limited clinical trials only for cancer; medical determinations made by doctors and other health professionals versus decisions made by HMO accountants; the right to hold HMOs accountable for their decisions that harm or kill patients versus the right to live with whatever bad decisions an HMO might make; and, of course, the extension of basic rights to all privately insured Americans versus the exclusion of over 100 million Americans. 
   The list goes on. 
   All that was necessary on the Senate's part was to listen to the doctors and nurses and other health professionals. To listen to the American people. Unfortunately, a majority of the Senate chose to ignore those voices and listen instead to the industry that stands to continue to profit from our failure to provide meaningful patient protections. The industry that opposes even 
   minimal protections and any means of enforcing them. 
   Frankly, we are astounded. Yes, we were told repeatedly by Senator NICKLES and Senator GRAMM and Senator FRIST that this would happen. That their plan was simply to block this legislation from ever coming to the Senate floor, since they did not want to be in a position of having to defend an indefensible position. When that plan failed, they made it clear their strategy was focused on political cover instead of meaningful reforms. (That cynical strategy will ultimately fail, too.) 
   Still, we held out hope--that reason would win out in the end. That the overwhelming public support for our modest reforms --support that knows no partisan boundaries outside of Washington, DC--would influence at least a handful of Senate Republicans. We are astounded that it did not--that there are not five Republican senators willing to challenge their leadership in order to please over 80% of the American people. 
   Maybe some of them just didn't read the two bills. The other day, Senator GRAMM again invoked the name of his ``mama'' and said he wants her to be able to call her doctor instead of a bureaucrat when she gets sick. Well, we agree. But, given his concern, Senator GRAMM and the vast majority of his Republican colleagues are supporting the wrong legislation. 
   It is the Democratic bill that protects patients' rights to communicate directly with their doctor and make medical decisions with their doctor--without inappropriate interference from a nameless, faceless HMO accountant. 
   Senator GRAMM and other opponents argue: ``The Democratic bill is a step toward government-run health care.'' 
   That charge is simply untrue--under our bill, health care professionals, not the government, would make decisions. 
   Ours is not a step toward government-run health care; it's a step away from HMO accountant-run health care. 
   The insurance industry's TV ads opposing the Democratic bill warn that people get hurt ``when politicians play doctor.'' Again, that is the height of irony. 
   Senate Democrats are not playing doctor. Under the current system, and under the Republican bill, it is HMO accountants who are playing doctor, denying the real doctors the ability to implement medically sound decisions. And real people are getting hurt every day. 
   Let's be clear--we're not opposed to managed care. 
   The theory of managed care--that a primary care physician and health network will understand the whole patient and manage his or her care to improve patient health--is a good one. But all too often that theory has been corrupted in practice. 
   Too often, instead of managed care, we have managed costs. 
   The Hippocratic Oath is not about saving money; it's about saving lives. And while we should take reasonable actions to curb health care costs, we cannot do it at the expense of Americans' health. Furthermore, any costs associated with the Democratic bill would be minimal--and nonexistent for HMOs that already provide the medical services they should. 
   The United States has the best health care in the world--the best doctors, nurses, facilities, and equipment. But what good is the best health care in the world if insurance company accountants 
   block your access to it? 
   Over the course of the last several days, my Republican colleagues have rejected every Democratic proposal to improve Americans' access to better health care. In one twist, they rejected our proposal to protect women from being discharged from the hospital too soon after breast cancer surgery, only to turn around the next day and take credit for that proposal at the same time they denied those same breast cancer victims--and other women and men--access to clinical trials for new, life-saving treatments. 
   It has been a pattern all week: reject the real patient protections, and, in the specific cases where there's enough of a public outcry, offer up a half-measure that pretends to solve one problem at the expense of another. We saw the same tactic on the juvenile crime bill, when Republicans bent over backwards to avoid any meaningful gun legislation. Their operating principle: block the real solution and take credit for a false one. 
   Perhaps the most egregious and disheartening example of hypocrisy is the majority's approach to determining which Americans will benefit from the half-measures they are willing to support. Democrats believe all 161 million privately insured Americans should be guaranteed a national floor of patients' rights. We are talking about the basic rights of American patients. Two people living on the same street--possibly insured by the very same company--should not have two different sets of ``basic rights'' simply because they work for different employers. 
   Under the Republican bill, only 48 million Americans--those in self-funded plans--are covered by the vast majority of their protections. They exclude over 100 million Americans from their so-called protections. 
   The majority has argued that this exclusion is necessary to satisfy one of their core principles: that the states should be left to regulate HMOs. In the Nickles amendment striking the Kennedy amendment to cover all privately insured Americans, the majority stated, ``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards..... . One size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate for one State may not be necessary in another.'' That amendment passed Tuesday, by a largely party-line vote. 
   So the majority established that as its core principle, one that overrides  the need to provide all Americans basic health care rights. Yet listen to the core principle laid out in the Snowe amendment I mentioned earlier. (Curiously, the Snowe amendment, which every Republican senator supported, extended its protections to all privately insured women.) 
   In the Snowe amendment, the majority stated a ``core principle'' diametrically opposed to the core principle of the Nickles amendment: ``In order to provide for uniform treatment of health care providers and patients among the States, it is necessary to cover health plans operating in 1 State as well as health plans operating among the several States.'' That amendment passed Wednesday at 1:23 pm. 
   Two-and-a-half hours later, the Republican majority reversed itself once again. They voted against a Democratic amendment to expand coverage to all privately insured Americans, regardless of their condition or disease--not just women with breast cancer. 
   The whole idea behind a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights is that it will cover all people and all diseases, not simply those that get the most media coverage. 
   Some of my colleagues seem to have two contradictory sets of core principles on the same issue on the same day. And, at the end of the day, the result is that, for all but one disease, the majority has chosen to deny more than 100 million Americans any protections at all. 
   It's a cynical, and destructive, philosophy. The American people are sure to reject it, for they understand this issue far better than some politicians seem to think. How could they not understand? Every American knows someone who has been denied timely, necessary treatment by an HMO that put costs above patient care. 
   Our bill is a modest one. It would guarantee American patients a minimum level of protection to ensure timely access to quality health care. That's what Americans expect when they buy health insurance, and that's the least they deserve. 
   I am disappointed that, this week, America's patients were denied that minimal protection. But I can assure them that the fight for their rights is far from over. Senate Democrats--and maybe even a few brave Republicans--are committed to a real Patients' Bill of Rights, and it will pass, whether it's next week, next year, or next Congress. I guarantee it. 
   Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to thank some of the multitudes of people who have fought so hard for a real Patients' Bill of Rights and who are committed to that fight until we succeed. 
   I thank Senator KENNEDY. I must say, I do not know if we have a more passionate, more articulate, more aggressive defender for working people in this country than we have in Ted KENNEDY. He is an inspiration. We all are deeply indebted once more for the leadership he has provided not only in our caucus but in the Senate on this extraordinarily important issue. I am proud to have worked with him to develop S. 6. Also, he, like many others, has been tireless on the floor this week, and I commend him for doing such a good job for our entire caucus. 
   I thank my assistant Democratic leader whose presence on the floor has just been phenomenal. I do not know how I could do what I do were it not for the fact that he is always there--always there. 
   I thank my caucus. I do not know that I have ever been more proud of the caucus than I am tonight for their participation, for their leadership, for their willingness to roll up their sleeves to do their homework, to come to the floor and debate, as they did so aggressively all week. In one way or another, every member of our caucus has contributed to this debate and to the two-year effort to make it possible. More of them than I could name right now have contributed enormously, often selflessly. Our caucus has never been more unified. We believe in patients' rights, and we are committed to fight for them. 
   So, I thank every Democratic senator. I say to each of you, it truly would not have been possible without you. 
   I thank, as well, the majority leader for allowing this debate, and the assistant Republican leader. This debate happened because they agreed to schedule it. It would not have happened were it not for that agreement, and I am grateful for that. 
   I thank Senator FRIST for his involvement because of his unique experience in life. 
   A special thanks goes to the more than 200 organizations representing doctors, nurses, and other health care providers as well as consumer groups, that have supported our bill. They pulled out all the stops they could, with whatever limited resources they had, to ensure that they were part of this American Democratic system. Again, I cannot name them all. But their shared commitment to a comprehensive, meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights has been critical to this process. And I say to each of them, don't be disheartened by today's loss. As I said before, we will ultimately prevail, and patients will ultimately be protected. 
   I should send that same message to Justin Dart and all the men, women, and children who have shared their stories--often painful stories--with us. This debate could not have been held were it not for the fact that they put meaning to this debate in ways that only they can. Their stories remind us that this is not a theoretical debate. It is a real choice affecting real people who have suffered and will continue to suffer in the absence of meaningful reforms. We thank you, and we will continue the fight. 
   Last, I want to thank the people who are too often thanked last, the staff--the staff in every office who have worked in various ways to ensure our long struggle led to a real floor debate. 
   Senator KENNEDY's staff deserves special recognition. I'm sure there were many others, but I want to recognize four of them in particular: Michael Myers, David Nexon, Cybele Bjorklund, and Jim Manley. As always, they are as amazing as their boss. They have been absolutely essential to the effort. 
   Finally, I want to thank my own staff--both those in my own office and those throughout the Leadership Committees. At the risk of leaving someone out, I'm going to try to name most of them. Few people know how hard they work, and their commitment to service and to this cause of patients' rights is unsurpassed. 
   From my staff, I want to thank especially: Jane Loewenson, Elizabeth Hargrave, Shelly Ten Napel, Pete Rouse, Laura Petrou, Bill Corr, Mark Patterson, Ranit Schmelzer, Molly Rowley, Marc Kimball, Chris Bois, and Elizabeth Lietz. 
   From the Floor Staff, I thank Marty Paone, Lula Davis, Gary Myrick, and Paul Brown. We are very lucky, as Republicans and Democrats, to have the floor staff that we do. We owe them a big debt of gratitude, because without them we could not do what we do. 
   From the Leadership Committees, my special thanks to: Bonnie Hogue, Caroline Chambers, Chuck Cooper, Maryam Moezzi, Tim Mitchell, Jodi Grant, Nicole Bennett, Maria Meier, Alexis King, Jamie Houton, Andy Davis, Mary Helen Fuller, Marguerite Beck-Rex, Brian Barrie, Kobye Noel, Katherine Moore, Nate Ackerman, Rick Singer, Clare Flood, Adriana Surfas, Kevin Kelleher, Brian Jones, Russell Gordon, Robyn Altman, Jeremy Dorin, Paige Smith, Chris Casey, Jeff Hecker, and Toby Hayman. 
   So tonight, Mr. President, the fight goes on. I am optimistic that in the end we will have the opportunity to debate, once more, how we can resolve this issue, how we can stick to those six principles, how we can ensure that this American health system, which is so good in so many ways, can be made better. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take a minute off the bill. 
   I do not know how you top that. I was simply going to say that if you believe anything the Senator from Texas just said, you are going to buy a turnip truck from him, too. 
   But I hope everybody can remember what this is all about. This is simply about whether or not patients have the right to a specialist, whether or not the HMO under any circumstances can tell a patient and his or her doctor that, no, you cannot go to a specialist, because in millions of cases around the country today, tomorrow, and for the past several years, that is exactly what has happened. 
   Do we have access to specialists or not? The Democrats are saying yes, we need access to the specialist. That is the essence of health care in America today. But people are being denied that access. We want to change that. This amendment will do it. It deserves our support. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania had it right. We all support 100-percent deductibility for the self-employed. We just voted for it an hour or so ago. There is no question all of the Senate supports it. We are on record in support of it. The question is whether we should accelerate it. We just voted to accelerate it on this side on the Robb amendment. That isn't the question on this amendment. This amendment is about whether or not we offer 100 million additional Americans the patient protections under the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   In order to clarify that, I ask unanimous consent that the deductibility language be added to both the Republican bill, S. 1344, and the Daschle substitute.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is truly a historic day. My Democratic colleagues and I have been trying for nearly 2 years to bring this debate to the floor of the Senate. 
   For the past 2 years, I have listened to people and their complaints about the health care system. I have come to the conclusion that the reason the insurance companies call them HMOs is that H-M-O sums up their patient philosophy: Having Minimal Options. 
   I thank the majority leader. It is no secret that Senator LOTT faced considerable pressure to prevent this debate. On behalf of the 161 million Americans who need the protections in our bill, we thank him for agreeing, finally, to bring this debate to the floor. 
   Most of all, I want to acknowledge my Democratic colleagues. We would not be having this debate were it not for their steadfast determination and hard work. That is particularly true of the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY. They have each taken considerable risks to demand that this Senate listen to and deal with the real problems America's families are having with their HMOs. Every one of them deserves recognition. 
   The general debate on this bill is supposed to last 3 hours--which, according to an HMO, is enough time for a woman to check into a hospital, deliver a baby, and be sent home. Senator KENNEDY and I and others intend to use these 3 hours to talk about the extraordinary difference in approach between the Democratic and the Republican plans.  
   There are no bills pending in this Congress that will have a greater impact on the lives and health of America's families than this bill. There are no decisions we will make that will have a more profound effect than the decisions we make this week. 
   The issues we will debate these next 4 days are literally life-and-death issues. 
   The insurance industry has spent tens of millions of dollars to try to prevent us from ever having this debate. Many of our Republican colleagues responded and worked with them. The Republicans seem to protect insurance companies the way Briana Scurry protects a soccer goal. The insurance industry has spent millions of dollars on ads designed to confuse and frighten the American people, and intimidate us. They hope that by repeating untruths often enough they will be able to kill this bill and keep their license to practice bad medicine. 
   The truth is, this whole debate comes down to one critically important question: Who should make medical decisions, doctors or insurance company accountants? 
   We have all heard the horror stories. 
   In Georgia, a 6-month-old boy was burning up with a 105-degree fever. His mother called her HMO twice and begged to be allowed to take her son to the emergency room. Both times the HMO refused. She finally decided to take him to the hospital anyway. By the time they arrived, the infection that was causing the fever had destroyed the circulation in the baby's extremities. Both his hands and feet had to be amputated. 
   In Washington, DC, a 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his leg. His oncologist recommended a treatment that could save the leg. But when the doctor's office called the boy's HMO, they were told the only treatment the HMO would pay for was amputation. Four months and several appeals later, the HMO finally agreed to pay for the treatment the doctor ordered. But by then, the cancer had spread; the leg had to be amputated. 
   In Kentucky, a man with prostate cancer needed one chemotherapy injection a month. The injections cost $500 each. 
   His insurance company policy said they were fully covered. But when the HMO changed administrators, the man was told he would have to pay $180 a month out of his own pocket. He didn't have $180 a month, so he had to go with the only other treatment his doctor said could control his cancer. He was castrated. The day he returned from the hospital, he got a letter from his HMO saying they had made a mistake; the HMO would now pay the $500 after all. 
   Three different people, three different parts of the country, but they all have one thing in common: They were all powerless against their insurance companies. 
   Unfortunately, I could go on and on. 
   Two years ago, 130 million Americans said they or someone they knew had a problem with a health insurance company. Last year, that number had grown to 154 million Americans. 
   When we first introduced our bill, nearly 2 years ago, a lot of our Republican friends said we didn't need a Patients' Bill of Rights. Today, they have a bill of their own. We consider that progress. But we still have big differences of opinion about what a Patients' Bill of Rights should do. 
   Our bill covers 161 million Americans. Their bill covers 48 million people; it leaves out more than 100 million Americans. 
   Our bill lets health care professionals make medical decisions about your health. Their bill lets insurance company accountants make those decisions. 
   Our bill guarantees you the right to see a qualified medical specialist, including pediatric specialists for your children. The Republican bill doesn't guarantee that either you or your children will be able to see qualified medical specialists. 
   If your HMO refuses to pay for care your doctor says you need, our bill allows you to appeal that decision to an independent review board. Their bill contains an appeal process, too--except they let the HMO decide what decisions can be appealed. They also let HMOs handpick and pay the people who hear the cases. 
   Finally, our Patients' Bill of Rights is enforceable. Theirs isn't. 
   CBO estimates that the most our Patients' Bill of Rights would increase premiums is 4.8 percent over 5 years--less than 1 percent a year. That comes out to less than $2 per beneficiary --less than $2 a month to guarantee that your health insurance will be there when you need it. 
   Last month, when we offered our Patients' Bill of Rights, a Republican colleagues voted to kill it, without discussing its specific pieces. Yet, they claim they support nearly all the protections in our plan. 
   So this week, we intend to offer our plan again, piece by piece. Let's debate each of the protections in our plan. Maybe when our colleagues really look at our proposals, they will decide they can support some of the protections in our bill. 
   The American people deserve to know exactly where each of us stands on each of these protections. 
   Let me just say a word at this point about the kind of debate we expect this week. By agreeing to this debate, we are assuming our Republican colleagues intend to allow a real, honest debate. That means debating and voting on each of the major protections in our Patients' Bill of Rights. If we have that sort of debate, then, whether we win or lose, we will certainly agree not to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights up again this year. Up or down, win or lose, if the debate this week is fair and honest, we will not offer our Patients' Bill of Rights again this year. 
   But, if we are not able to do that, if we don't have a real debate, if we are not permitted to offer our protections as amendments so that the Senate can discuss and vote on each of them, if there are those who try to prevent an honest debate by using parliamentary tricks, we are putting them on notice now: This debate will certainly not end on Thursday. We will continue to offer the protections in our plan as amendments for as long as we have to until we finally have that honest debate. 
   We know from experience that we can pass bills that protect the health of American families when we want. Together, Republicans and Democrats passed a bill allowing people to take their health care with them when they change jobs. Together, we passed a bill to help working parents purchase private, affordable health insurance for their kids. Together we can pass a real, meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights this week.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me explain the amendment I have just offered. This amendment is the Republican HMO reform bill. We are offering it as a substitute to the Democratic bill for one reason. 
   Senator LOTT has been very candid and open about his intentions. His intention, of course, is to offer at the end of this debate a Republican bill that has not been debated or amended or scrutinized in any way. 
   By offering as our first amendment the Republican substitute, we now lay down a dual track for the week--their bill and our bill. Both bills are subject to amendments. Both are subject to consideration. Both are subject to the debate that we had anticipated when we reached this agreement. 
   We will be offering amendments to the Republican bill. We would love nothing more than for our bill to pass without amendment. But certainly, if that is not to be, we will at least do what we can to make sure the Senate deals honestly with this issue. 
   By offering the Republican bill, we hope to make sure the Senate at least has an honest debate, and we have the opportunity to try to make the Republican bill what it should have been in  the first place--a good bill that deals with each of the issues and offers real protections. 
   I retain the remainder of our time both under the amendment as well as the general debate.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to acknowledge a remarkable young woman from Rapid City, South Dakota, Jeanmarie Hicks, who was recently selected as the National Winner in the 1999 National Peace Essay Contest sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. 
   This year more than 2,500 high school students from all 50 states were asked to express their thoughts on the topic of preventing international violent conflict. Winners from each state were awarded a $1,000 college scholarship and invited to participate in a week of special activities here in Washington. The National Winner receives an additional $10,000 college scholarship. 
   Jeanmarie Hicks, who recently graduated as valedictorian from St. Thomas More High School in Rapid City, wrote an eloquent essay entitled ``Preventive Diplomacy in the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute and in the Venezuela Border Dispute.'' In addition to her writing skills, Jeanmarie recently took first place in South Dakota in both the National French Contest and the National Spanish Contest, and will attend the College of St. Benedict in Minnesota this fall.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation and indulgence. I appreciate very much the opportunity to go out of order. This should not take very long. 
   Mr. President, I want to just take a couple of minutes to talk about why I believe this amendment is needed, primarily for the RECORD, but also for those who may be interested in knowing of a problem that I think is a serious one that has to be addressed. 
   After 4 years of delay, the National Park Service tentatively approved applications to locate two cellular antennae in Rock Creek Park on April 8 of this year. These antennae will be located in areas that are already developed; namely, the Park Service Maintenance Yard and the Fitzgerald Tennis Center. Engineering tests show that the antennae cannot be seen by park users. 
   In March of 1999, the Park Service completed the environmental assessment and concluded that these antennae pose no significant environmental impact. 
   Federal law directs agencies to make their property available to communications facilities so long as they comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, which these antennae do. 
   Unfortunately, even though the decision was approved on April 8, even though we have now waited 4 years, the  National Park Service has yet to announce its final decision. This amendment would simply require them to finish the process within 1 week of enactment--now after 4 years.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to congratulate one of our former colleagues and a dedicated public servant, Jim Sasser, who leaves Beijing this week as our longest-serving ambassador to the People's Republic of China. I commend him for his distinguished and accomplished record in that demanding post. 
   I was proud to serve with Jim Sasser for eight years here in the Senate. I observed his fine work as Chairman of the Budget Committee, and as a key member of the Appropriations, Banking and Government Affairs Committees. He did much for the people of his home state of Tennessee, and for the people of this Nation. 
   When Senator Sasser assumed the chairmanship of the Budget Committee in 1989, we faced growing budget deficits as far as the eye could see. When he left the Senate in 1995, he had worked to set us on a course of fiscal discipline that has created unprecedented economic prosperity and led to the largest budget surpluses in our history. He made the hard choices, he made the tough political judgments, and he displayed tremendous legislative skill in helping put an end to the huge budget shortfalls that plagued our country for far too many years. 
   We were fortunate, them, when Jim Sasser again answered the call to public service when his third term in the Senate came to an end. As our ambassador to China, he has confronted important issues and major problems at a crucial time in our relationship. He traveled first to Beijing during the crisis in the straits of Taiwan in early 1996. He comes home in the wake of the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. In the three-and-one-half years in between, Ambassador Sasser has worked tirelessly to ensure that such incidents will not fundamentally alter the course of our relations with the world's most populous nation. 
   During Ambassador Sasser's tenure, we have seen the exchange of visits between our countries' presidents and the very successful U.S. tour of Premier Zhu Rongji. Those exchanges highlight the hundreds of less prominent, but no less productive, meetings and negotiations that have taken place at various levels of government and business over these 40 months. 
   Clearly, we have important differences with the Chinese. They existed before Jim Sasser went to China, and they will persist after his departure. But the interests that unite us--in trade, in a cleaner environment, in combating drugs and terrorism, in controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction--also remain the same. By helping find the common ground on these issues, by maintaining a constructive dialogue based on those common interests even at the worst of times, Ambassador Sasser has strengthened one of our most important bilateral relationships. And he has done it with the personal touch and political skill those of use who were privileged to serve with him in the Senate know so well. 
   So, today I say thank you to Jim Sasser. Thank you again for your service as a member of the United States Senate, and thank you for skillful diplomacy as our ambassador to China. I know all my colleagues will join me in congratulating Ambassador Sasser for a job well done, and in welcoming him and his wife Mary back home.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with my colleagues Senators KENNEDY, HARKIN, and DODD, I announce the introduction of the Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act of 1999, a piece of legislation designed to stop genetic discrimination. The advent of testing for genes that indicate a predisposition to disease has presented us with a new series of opportunities and challenges. While prior awareness of susceptibility to disease offers millions the chance to take preventive measures that will help them live healthier and longer lives, there also exists the possibility that genetic information will be misused. It is for that reason that we Democrats feel strongly that measures must be taken to ensure that health insurers may not discriminate against patients on the basis of predictive genetic information, and that employers may not discriminate against employees in the provision of health insurance or by withholding job benefits as a result of the improper use of genetic information. 
   When the Patients' Bill of Rights reaches the floor after the July recess, we hope to offer this bill as an amendment to the bill under consideration. This issue, like many others, exposes a fault line between the Republican and Democratic approach to health insurance reform. 
   Scientific advances now make it possible to identify genes that indicate a predisposition to disease. For example, tests for genes associated with hereditary breast cancer are commercially available. Genetic information may prove highly beneficial in areas related to prevention, treatment, diet, or lifestyle. While this is profoundly good news for patients, it also raises fears regarding how genetic information will be used in the workplace. Advances in genetic and screening, accelerated by the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, increase physicians' ability to detect genetic mutations. These technologies and their resulting genomic data will enhance medical science, but may also lead to discrimination. 
   Regrettably, many employers may not hire individuals whom they believe will require time off or medical treatment at some point in the future due to a genetically transmitted disease. Equally disturbing, employers may simply deny insurance coverage to employees who they believe are predisposed to genetic disease. This discrimination could result despite the  fact that genetic testing only indicates that an individual may be predisposed to a disease--not necessarily whether that disease will develop. 
   This issue is already touching the lives of many Americans. For example, a survey last year by the American Management Association of over 1,000 companies indicated that 5% of responding employers currently do genetic testing of their employees. While that number may sound small, its more than the number of companies who test for HIV status. And of those companies who do genetic testing on their employees, 19% have chosen not to hire an individual and 10% have dismissed an employee based on the genetic test results. 
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that fear of discrimination already has inhibited people who may be susceptible to disease from getting genetic testing. In some cases, this means that gene carriers will miss out on early diagnosis, treatment or even prevention. If consumers avoid taking advantage of available diagnostic tests out of fear of discrimination, they may suffer much more serious--and more expensive--health problems in the long run. 
   That is why our proposal to ban employment discrimination is clearly supported by the American people. A recent national poll by the National Center for Genome Resources demonstrates that an overwhelming majority of those surveyed--85%--think that employers should be prohibited from obtaining information about an individual's genetic conditions, risks, and predispositions. 
   We will pay the price in more than increased health care costs if we allow genetic information to be used in a discriminatory manner. Discrimination based on genetic factors can be as unjust as that based on race, national origin, religion, sex or disability. In each case, people are treated inequitably, not because of their inherent abilities, but solely because of irrelevant characteristics. Genetic discrimination that excludes qualified individuals from employment robs the marketplace of skills, energy, and imagination. Finally, genetic discrimination undercuts the Human Genome Project's fundamental purpose of promoting public health. Investing resources in the Human Genome Project is justified by the benefits of identifying, preventing and developing effective treatments for disease. But if fear of discrimination deters people from genetic diagnosis or from confiding in physicians and genetic counselors, and makes them more concerned with job loss than with care and treatment, our understanding of the humane genome will be for naught. 
   Because genetic information could be used unfairly, Congress must expand the scope of its anti-discrimination laws to include a ban on genetic discrimination. Our bill has three major components: (1) it forbids employers from discriminating in hiring or in the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of genetic information, (2) it forbids health insurers from discriminating against individuals on the basis of genetic information, and (3) it prevents the disclosure of genetic information to people who have no legitimate need for the information: health insurers, health insurance data banks, or to employers. 
   Now, before the use of genetic information becomes widespread, we must make sure that dramatic scientific advances do not have negative consequences for the public. We have an historic opportunity to preempt this problem. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I certainly won't, I want to reserve my comments on the overall agreement until after the majority leader has completed his unanimous consent request, which has one more piece. 
   Let me say in regard to the comments made by the majority leader about our assurances, as he has indicated, that we would not pursue this matter further this year. He used the right phrase--``if the normal legislative process'' is followed. 
   Obviously, we expect the normal legislative process to be one which will allow a good debate on an array of amendments, first and second-degrees with limits on time, and that we will have completed an adequate number of those amendments. 
   This issue, of course, is the Patients' Bill of Rights. The agreement doesn't preclude debate and amendments on other health-related matters unrelated to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I am confident that if we have a good debate and if we have an opportunity to consider these amendments, there will be no need to pursue this matter further this year. The Senate will have spoken. 
   I indicated privately in my conversation with Senator LOTT that this certainly is my expectation, and we will decide at the end of that week how well we did. My expectation is the normal legislative process will be followed. 
   I have no objection.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to publicly commend the majority leader for the effort he has made over the last several days to find a way to resolve this impasse. I believe this is a win-win. I think only through his persistence and willingness to consider a lot of different options were we able to reach this point. I am grateful to him and have, once again, enjoyed the opportunity to resolve what has been a very significant procedural difficulty for us all. 
   I also want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts for the outstanding job he has done providing us real leadership on this issue, as he does on so many issues relating to health and education. 
   I also thank the assistant Republican leader as well. 
   I believe this is a good agreement any way one looks at it. It provides us with the opportunity to have a good debate. It provides us with the opportunity to have a series of amendments. It certainly provides us with the focus that we have been looking for with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights. This is a very good agreement, agreed to, I think, with the direct involvement of a lot of people. So we are grateful. 
   The majority leader mentioned a couple of other matters, one having to do with his desire to work full days. He has assured me we will work 9- to 12-hour days that week we come back because he recognizes the importance of giving this issue a full opportunity for debate. I appreciate his commitment in that regard. 
   I also share his concern about how we might make the appropriations process work better. Democrats were opposed, of course, to the overruling of the Chair at the time it occurred. To take it back would be consistent with the position we took when the vote was taken a few years back. So I do intend to work with him to find a way to resolve this matter. That also, of course, is assuming we will have opportunities--I know we have talked about this--opportunities to have good debates with amendments on authorization bills. This will only work if we have the regular order on authorization bills. We certainly have to be sure that we have an opportunity on those occasions when authorization bills are presented to have a good debate with amendments as we have had now on a couple of bills this year. 
   Again, I think this is a good agreement. I appreciate the cooperation of everybody but in particular the leadership of the majority leader and Senator KENNEDY and others on our side.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me explain briefly our situation. 
   Early this year, the majority leader stated we would take up the Patients' Bill of Rights in June. We applauded that commitment. That is really what this fight is all about--maintaining the commitment that was made earlier. 
   Democrats have been saying we will do everything humanly possible to ensure that the Senate engages in a full, meaningful debate on the central issues of managed care reform: 
   Whether doctors or HMO bureaucrats determine what tests or treatments are medically necessary; 
   Whether you or your child can see a qualified specialist; 
   Whether patients have access to a timely, independent, external review to appeal HMO decisions to deny care; 
   Whether HMOs should be held accountable for medical decisions to deny or delay care that injure or even kill patients; 
   Whether an HMO bureaucrat, or your doctor, decides what prescription drugs you need; 
   Whether you or your family member can participate in a clinical trial for a potentially life-saving new treatment; 
   Whether all privately insured Americans deserve protection. 
   The list goes on and on. Those are some of the issues, some of the questions. 
   We have tried to reach an agreement with the majority to call up the bill separately. All we have asked is that we be guaranteed votes on those central issues. So far, the majority has refused. 
   What we have done in the last few days is what we vowed we would have to do: We are offering our proposal as amendments on the floor, as is our right under the Senate rules. 
   In my view, it is also our obligation to bring to the floor of the Senate the issues that matter most to the American people. 
   While some have suggested there isn't time for this debate, others have stated quite clearly their real reason for refusing: They do not want to vote on these issues. 
   Why don't they want to cast these votes? Because they are, frankly, on the wrong side of the issues. They do not want to have to defend their position. 
   They said they want to get beyond the Feinstein amendment. They can. All they have to do is vote on it. The majority wants to accuse us of holding up the Senate, but nothing is stopping any member of the majority from moving to table the Feinstein amendment. They can do that tonight. We could have our vote and move on to another amendment. That is all that is required: Table the Feinstein amendment if you do not like it. 
   But the majority appears not to want to table the amendment. They appear to be afraid to have that vote, afraid to let doctors make medical decisions, afraid to admit they are blocking that patient protection. I have never seen anything like the bob-and-weave tactics that have been employed to date to avoid this vote. 
   So what are they afraid of? What is wrong with doctors making medical decisions? I believe this is gamesmanship at its worst. 
   Last week we heard several Republican Senators talk about how good their Patients' Bill of Rights is. Then they voted to strip it from the floor. 
   Now they are offering the Democratic bill--which they tabled just last week so they could avoid an up-or-down vote on the Feinstein amendment--so they can avoid a vote on whether or not to let doctors and other health care professionals determine what is medically necessary. 
   Every day the majority makes these decisions, every day they avoid these tough votes, someone's child, someone's parent, someone's spouse is being denied medical care prescribed by a doctor because an insurance company accountant is saying it isn't really necessary or that it costs too much. 
   Let me make one thing very clear. This dispute isn't about the Senate's time. In the time the majority has spent avoiding a single vote on medical necessity, we could have considered the entire Patients' Bill of Rights amendments. They have turned down every offer we have made to address this issue in an efficient manner. This dispute isn't about time, it is about actual votes on actual rights. We insist on having them--both the votes and the rights. Apparently our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want neither. 
   Up-or-down votes--isn't that what the Senate is here to do, to vote on the issues that matter the most? If and when the majority is willing to vote on these issues, the Senate can move on. But it is our belief that the Senate should not move on until it has dealt properly with one of the most important issues facing virtually every American--their health care. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader. 
   Mr. President, let me respond to a number of the comments made by the distinguished majority leader. 
   He certainly is right in that we have attempted to work our way through this for some time now. But I will say, if this is a Molotov minuet, there is only one side dancing. And in the Senate, both sides have to dance to make progress. In the Senate, if we are going to have a dance, it takes both sides to make it work. We are getting shut out. 
   That is what this is about. We are shut out. We want to see progress, and there are colleagues on the other side who want to continue to shut us out. We are left with no recourse. We will minuet with anybody so long as there is somebody there to dance with. 
   Let me just talk about the lament of our distinguished majority leader that this is an amendment to an unrelated bill. Just last week, Senator MURKOWSKI offered the Glacier Bay legislation to the steel bill, and I listened very carefully to see if there was one Senator on the other side who would object to bringing up a glacier amendment on a steel bill. It was a cold steel bill, but it was not a glacier bill. 
   Yet there we were, unrelated legislation offered with no objection. 
   The majority leader understandably talked about the ruling on the energy appropriations supplemental. Just for the RECORD, he made mention that it was a ruling. It actually wasn't a ruling. It was the majority overturning the ruling. Fifty-four Republicans, actually 57 people, but 54 Republicans, 100 percent of the Republican caucus, overruled the Chair when the Chair ruled, on March 16, 1995, that you couldn't legislate on appropriations. One hundred percent of the Republican caucus said: Yes, we can, and we are going to say to you, Mr. President, we are overruling you. 
   Now we hear our colleagues saying: Oh, my goodness, we are legislating on appropriations. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment and the rollcall be printed for the RECORD.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader has also said this is a good bill; the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights is a good bill. We don't think so. But if it is such a good bill, what is wrong with just putting it before the Senate and having a good debate about a good bill? That is what we are supposed to do here. We are supposed to put legislation down and have at it. 
   I have lamented several times that there are those in this Chamber who believe that a good bill ought to be accompanied by a good rule. The rule is, we will allow amendments if we like them. If you want that kind of an environment, run for the House of Representatives because they have all kinds of rules like that. If you want to do it the way we do it here, have at it. Let's have some good debate. Let's not say we are going to have to approve every amendment offered by our colleagues prior to the time we even agree to go to the bill. If it is a good bill, it ought to have a good debate. 
   The majority leader also read the unanimous consent request agreement. I will not in any way denigrate the effort that the majority leader has made to try to accommodate both sides. He has worked diligently to make that happen. But let me just explain what is wrong with that agreement as we see it. 
   First of all, it requires an end date. That, perhaps, is the most significant concern we have all had. I dare ask, could somebody come back and tell me when was the last time we said we will take up a bill with an absolute guarantee that we will have an end date? We haven't even talked about--and it is murky--whether we are talking about final passage. I think we are, but we haven't agreed to that. There is just an end date. We would have to quit debating this at a time certain. 
   Well, in a body such as this, when we agree to consideration of a bill without any other rules than that, if we just say we are going to end this debate at a time certain, guess what happens? Anybody can take the floor and monopolize the floor for days, if they want to. That is the first problem. 
   The second problem is, as the distinguished majority leader indicated, under this proposal, each amendment would have 2 hours. That is right. He also noted that each amendment would have 2 second-degrees, subject to 2 hours. By my calculation, sophisticated as it is, that is 6 hours per amendment. One first-degree, 2 second-degrees, 2 times 3 is 6. If the majority leader were good enough to allow the Senate to go for 12 hours, that means 2 amendments per day. There are 3 days. Two amendments per day, 2 times 3, ironically, once again, you get 6. It is amazing how this math works out. It always comes down to 6. That is our problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. Let me finish, and I will be happy to yield. 
   Six amendments. I know our colleagues on the other side say: Certainly, we wouldn't use all that time. 
   With that end date, who knows? As difficult as it has been to bring up amendments with second-degrees and with tabling motions, who knows how long and how many amendments we will be able to bring up. That is the problem. 
   Here are the concessions we have made in this agreement. In the Senate, you are able to bring up a farm bill on a peace treaty. But we said on this bill it has to be relevant. We will agree to relevancy. We said we may even agree to an end date. 
   Now, the majority says: We also are insisting, and it was in this agreement, we are insisting that you never talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights until the next millennium. That is in here. What it says is, you can't bring it up in this entire Congress, but this entire Congress goes into the next millennium. So it is a gag rule until the next millennium on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Now, they did change it. They would acknowledge a willingness 
   to change it to the end of this session, but we couldn't talk about it anymore this session. 
   Then, of course, we have the question of how we resolve the outstanding issues on amendments. I have suggested that we leave it to the two leaders to offer amendments without debate at the end. Say we run up to the end of the time and somebody unfortunately has used all of the time and we are stuck here with 20 amendments and we have only debated one, let's take the worst case scenario. I am stuck here with my colleagues demanding that I protect them, and I have got 19 amendments in my hands. I said: At least let us have a vote on that. No debate; we will just have a vote. They wouldn't agree with that. No debate. No votes. 
   Then the ultimate power the majority has are the two things that the majority leader made reference to. The first is the power of the second-degree. Anything we lay down, they get to second-degree. And because they have 55 votes, usually they win. Second-degrees are powerful, and they have them. We have agreed to that. 
   The other thing they have, probably the most powerful of all, is the majority leader's right of first recognition. Let's assume we have worked through all of this and we have won more than our share of amendments. Well, the majority leader, as is his right--and it will certainly be my right when we are in the majority--has the opportunity to say at the end: Well, I am going to lay down an amendment to wipe out everything we have done. That is my right as a majority leader. I am going to offer an amendment to wipe it all out. 
   He can do that, and that is in this agreement. 
   I must say, I have to ask, what are they afraid of? What is it about these amendments they don't want to vote on? What is it about a procedure that is so extraordinary if all we want to do is be able to offer the amendments and we will agree with most of everything that has been listed here? 
   I can't figure it out, but that is for them to share with the rest of us. 
   We have tried. I think my colleagues have given me a pretty clear indication where they are, as a result of a caucus this afternoon. They weren't very wild about this. I can understand why. We have 48 amendments listed here that my colleagues have all said are important and ought to be determined in debate and in a vote. 
   There are those on the other side who say: We just don't have time. Well, we had time to take up 159 amendments on the defense authorization bill. We had time to bring up 67 amendments on the defense appropriations bill. We had time to bring up 104 amendments on the budget resolution. We had time to bring up 66 amendments on the supplemental appropriations. We had time to bring up 38 amendments on the Ed-Flex bill. We even had time to bring up and dispose of 26 amendments on the military bill of rights. 
   If we had 26 amendments that were legitimately considered on the military bill of rights, how about 20 amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights? That doesn't seem too much to ask to me. 
   So here we are. This is an important issue. It isn't going to go away. We can do it the easy way or the hard way. It appears that we are inclined to do it the hard way. We are prepared to do it any way. We will minuet with anybody, but it takes two to tango. We are here to do our job. 
   I yield the floor.

   I will reiterate that, if we have the opportunity to present 20 amendments up or down, I will be prepared to go to my colleagues and say: Look, we can live with that. I want you to cooperate and find a way in which we can have a good debate with 20 amendments freestanding with up-or-down votes. We can live with that. We could even live with a time certain so long as we have a good debate on those amendments with a vote on those amendments prior to the time we reach the end date. But that is a simple request. It is a simple desire to find some resolution.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take just a few moments to share with my colleagues where we are with regard to our negotiations, and then talk a little bit about the bill itself, the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Senator LOTT and I have had a number of discussions this morning. We are trying to find a way to proceed. I think it is fair to say that we are continuing to lose precious time in an effort to try to resolve our procedural differences. I am hopeful we might be able to reach some agreement. I am not wedded to the latest proposal I have shared with the majority leader, but we do need a time certain for consideration of this bill in the very near future. We certainly need to have the assurance that the amendments we will offer will be considered and voted upon by the Senate. 
   Those are our two principles: No. 1, a time certain for consideration of this bill; No. 2, some assurance that we will have the opportunity to debate amendments and have votes. 
   We recognize that with 45 Democrats we may not have the necessary votes to win a contest with our Republican friends on a comprehensive bill. However, we do know there are a good number of Senators who have expressed their support for various issues in our bill. We hope we can work through those issues and have the assurance we can have a good debate and good votes. 
   We cannot agree to any time certain for final passage if we cannot agree that we will have at least an opportunity to debate these amendments and have votes. 
   Again, our two principles: A date certain, and an opportunity to have up-or-down votes, or even tabling votes, on the amendments we want to offer. 
   I am hopeful we can work through those two principles and find a way that is mutually acceptable. The majority leader, as always, is attempting to be as responsive as he can. I appreciate the cooperative spirit with which we have been undertaking these discussions over the last 24 hours. 
   One of the reasons we feel so strongly about amendments is that they cause the Senate to focus on what it is we are talking about when we say the words ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' I don't know that a lot of people fully understand the magnitude of those words. What does ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' actually mean? We want to be able to spell out what it means. 
   I want to give one example, because it will be an amendment if we can't get an agreement. Our first amendment will deal with medical necessity. Medical necessity simply suggests that  medical decisions ought to be made by medical professionals, not bureaucrats. Our amendment would prevent arbitrary interference by insurers regarding treatment decisions such as hospital length of stay. It also would establish a fair definition of medical necessity. Medical necessity, in our judgment, should simply be an opportunity to use good, professional, medical judgment about the course of action involving a patient. That is what we mean by medical necessity. 
   I will read for our colleagues two other definitions of medical necessity that are currently in insurance policies for HMOs. I must add, I am not making this up. The first is from a Missouri insurance contract. I will read the definition of medical necessity taken right from the insurer's policy.  
   The company will have the sole discretion to determine whether care is medically necessary. The fact that care has been recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a physician or other provider will not establish that care is medically necessary.  
   Let me just make sure everybody understands what this says. It says we do not care whether a doctor or a nurse or any kind of provider has recommended, provided, prescribed, or approved a given treatment. We are going to be the ones to make the decision about medical necessity, not them. Could it be any more blatant than that?

   Mr. DASCHLE. That is the essence of it. The Senator from California has put her finger on it precisely. What it is saying is, we as an insurance company or we as a HMO will override whatever decisions are made by doctors, by nurses, by nurse practitioners, by any kind of provider, if we find it is in our financial interest to do so.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. Let me just say, she asks exactly the right question because there is a followup requirement here which we will deal with in another amendment. What happens if there is a dispute? Right now, the insurance company holds all the cards. 
   The insurance company says: In the case of a dispute, we will make the decision about whether the patient is right or wrong. Our bill says: No, wait a minute; we are going to have a fresh review of the facts by an outside authority. They will make the decision as to whether the procedure was medically necessary or not. There has to be somebody outside the insurance company making that decision, or what good is it for us to guarantee these very important rights to all patients? 
   But I really appreciate the Senator from California making that point. 
   I yield to the Senator from Illinois.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. In fact, in response to the good question posed by the Senator from Illinois, let me read the second statement of policy by another insurance company regarding this very question. Here is the statement of policy relating to medical necessity of a second insurance company. 
   Again, my colleagues, I am not making this up. We did not write this. This is written by the insurance company:  
   Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered, or supply provided, as determined by us, to the extent required to diagnose or treat an injury or sickness.  
   This is actually out of the policy:  
   Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered, or supply provided, as determined by us.......  
   Do we need a Patients' Bill of Rights, when you take this right out of a health insurance manual: Medical necessity is determined by the shortest or least expensive way with which to provide service to a patient? 
   It doesn't end there:  
   The service or supply must be consistent with the insured person's medical condition at the time the service was rendered, and it is not provided primarily for the convenience of the injured person or doctor.  
   No wonder people go nuts when they talk about insurance policies today and what is going on out there, when they combat an insurance company that includes a provision like this. They may not have read all the fine print, but when a company says we are going to determine medical necessity by what is the shortest or least expensive--the Senator from Illinois is exactly right --this overrides everything.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I must say, some of our colleagues on the other side tell us they would rather not have to vote on this. They do not want to have to vote on amendments about medical necessity. That is what is stopping it right now. We are at an impasse because we believe this is such an important issue that votes and amendments on questions like medical necessity ought to be a part of any legitimate debate on a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is why we are not in agreement today. We feel those amendments are required if we are going to have a good debate. Our colleagues have at least today refused to allow them.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California makes a very important point. It is our research and the extraordinary benefits that have come from it that have made a difference in people's lives all over the world. How ironic, after the American people spend valued tax dollars in support of research which is changing the quality of life for millions of people, that there are insurance companies denying patients the opportunity to benefit from research today. 
   What happens? The benefits of that research goes abroad. It goes to Europe. It goes to Asia. It goes to Latin America. Thank goodness it does. But why should it go there and not be allowed here? 
   We use the term ``clinical trials.'' It is a technical term. I like to get away from it, because I am not sure people understand what clinical trials are. Basically, when we talk about clinical trials, we talk about the right to ensure we benefit from innovative research. We should encourage experimental treatments when they are in the interest of the patient, and the doctor recommends them. That should be part of a Patients' Bill of Rights. But there is a chasm between Republicans and Democrats on that issue. Our Republican colleagues said: No, oh, no, that ought to be a decision the insurance company makes, not the doctor, not the patient. 
   I hope we keep talking about research and who benefits and how preposterous it is that in this country, even though we have these fundamental and extraordinary new possibilities to improved lives, there are insurance companies at this very moment that have just denied somebody access to that research. 
   The Senator from North Dakota is always so eloquent and so compelling in his comments. Again this morning he demonstrated why he enjoys the extraordinary respect of Senators on both sides of the aisle. One cannot talk in human terms, in personal terms very long, as he did, and not understand the importance of this issue. You can talk legalisms all you want. But if you put it in human life terms, as the Senator from North Dakota did--he put it in terms of life and death; he put it in terms of helping a young child--all of a sudden the light comes on and you understand why, when an insurance company actually has the audacity to write, ``Medical necessity means shortest, least expensive, or least intense level of treatment,'' why that young boy did not get his facial problems fixed. It certainly did not fit ``shortest, least expensive, or least intense level.'' 
   That case probably is expensive. It is not a short recovery. It is intense. It is the absolute reverse of the definition this particular company uses for medical necessity. Of course, it was medically necessary if that young boy's life meant anything. Of course, it was required if our society is going to be responsive at all. But for any company to say, we don't care what the doctor says, we don't care how inappropriate it may be to override a decision made by a doctor and his or her patient, we are going to decide the medical necessity of a treatment based on how short it is, how inexpensive it is or how much it lacks intensity, that says in spades why this debate is important. It says why we will not give up our rights to offer amendments to ensure that issues like this are properly addressed. We will not walk away from this debate. 
   We must have an opportunity to have a good debate with good amendments on issues as important as this, and we can do it. There is a way to work through this procedure. This can be a win-win situation. I want to find a way with which to ensure we can get a lot done in the next 10 days, and yet accomplish what we believe so strongly  must be a part of the Senate's agenda in this session of Congress. I yield the floor.

Certainly they are not all necessarily Democratic groups or progressive groups.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator explain the term ``clinical trials?'' The Senator has made such an important point about this issue. There are so many differences between the Republican and Democratic bills. One of the myriad of differences has to do with the so-called ``clinical trial'' provision. The Senator has spoken on the floor so patiently and eloquently about the concept of clinical trials and access to them. When we talk about clinical trials, are we talking about innovative techniques to respond to health problems that take full advantage of research and the opportunities of medicine that this country provides? Are we talking about giving people access to that medicine and cutting-edge technology just as soon as it is available? 
   Isn't that really what we are talking about?

   I would note that just the opposite of what the Senator describes oftentimes occurs. A managed care company, or an HMO, actually will make you drive past the nearest hospital to go to a hospital farther away, where they have a contract. 
   Sometimes a patient will choose not to use the nearest hospital, for a lot of reasons--better care, preferred specialists, different services. A patient may want to go farther away. But, in many cases, maybe a preponderance of cases, they actually have to drive past hospitals to go to the hospital the HMO has chosen, rather than the one they would choose for themselves. 
   Again, I think the Senator makes a very good point.

The Superfund Litigation Reduction and Brownfields Cleanup Act of 1999 (S. 1105), introduced by Senators BAUCUS, LAUTENBERG, LINCOLN, and me, contains a provision similar to the distinguished majority leader's and my bill, S. 2180, introduced in this body 1 year ago.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I am pleased to join majority leader in documenting that a compromise has been reached on the paper scrap issue. This compromise is especially important in light of the fact that during her recent testimony before the House Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, the EPA Administrator repeated her support for the recycling provision, a version of which collected 310 House cosponsors. The Administrator stated that should identical language to S. 2180 show up again this year, the administration ``would continue to support it.'' 
   And, in answer to a question, Administrator Browner stated at the hearing that EPA would oppose an exemption for PCB-contaminated paper or materials in excess of 50 parts per million. This issue is important not only to EPA, but also the Department of Justice and the environmental community. For that reason, I am delighted that a compromise was found.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't know how much time is left in morning business, but I will use whatever leader time is required. I want to have the opportunity to respond to my good friend, the Senator from Wyoming, about some of the comments he made with regard to the Social Security lockbox and a couple of other issues he has mentioned. He mentioned Democrats' unwillingness to support the efforts to bring up the Social Security lockbox. Let me make sure that everyone understands we are very desirous of having the opportunity to have a good debate about the lockbox. 
   It is particularly propitious that probably the master of Senate procedure is on the Senate floor, because I want to talk just a moment about the difference, which is more than just a semantical difference, between a cloture vote that is designed to stop amendments and a cloture vote that is designed to stop a debate, a filibuster. There is no filibuster going on here. A filibuster is actually designed to bring debate to a close. When 60 Senators have voted accordingly, we have time remaining and then, ultimately, there is a final vote. There is a big difference between bringing the debate to a close and offering cloture motions and proposing that the Senate preclude the opportunity for Senators to offer relevant amendments. 
   That has been the case on the Social Security lockbox from the very beginning. For whatever reason, our Republican colleagues continue to believe that what the Senate needs is a rules committee. Every day in the House Rules Committee, decisions are made based upon the content of amendments, which amendments are appropriate and which amendments are not. The Rules Committee makes that decision, and then the rule is presented to the House Membership. They vote on whether they accept the rule or not. Based upon the content of those amendments, they make decisions as to whether or not there will be amendments to a certain bill. In their wisdom, the Founding Fathers chose not to allow the Senate to be bound by such constraints, 
   that a Senator, with all of his power and authority and responsibility, ought to have the right to come to the floor and offer an amendment. But what our Republican colleagues continue to insist upon is that they act as an ad hoc rules committee. They want to see our amendments first. They want to approve our amendments first. And only then will they allow our amendments to be considered once they have been given their approval. 
   I ran for the Senate in 1996 because I wanted to be able to be a Senator, not a House Member. I want to be a Senator, and I want all the responsibilities and privileges and rights accorded to me as a Senator from South Dakota. That means the ability to offer an amendment. 
   On the lockbox, it is very simple. Whether you agree or not, we think the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security trust fund ought both to be locked up; we ought to treat them the same. We are dealing daily with the viability of the trust fund on Medicare, and if we can't ensure that viability of that trust fund, then I must say we haven't done our job. 
   We are saying, as Democrats, give us the right to offer an amendment on Medicare. Let's lock up that lockbox as well, and let's have a good debate about whether that makes good public policy or not. That is the issue. 
   The Republicans come to the floor; they file cloture to deny us the right to offer an amendment on Medicare--I must say also, to deny us the right to offer amendments that really mean lockbox when we say that is what we want. 
   They have a provision in their bill. I must say, it is amusing to me, but it says it is a lockbox unless we say we are for reform, and in the name of reform we can unlock the box, including privatizing Social Security. They have that in their bill. They want to be able to privatize Social Security, and they want to be able to ensure that, even if they have now voted for a lockbox, in the name of reform they can unlock it  just by saying: We want to offer a reform amendment, and we will so unlock the box. 
   I am puzzled by the admonitions of our colleagues. I am sorry the Senator from Wyoming is no longer on the floor, because I really hope we can set the RECORD clear. Democrats want to vote on a lockbox. But we want that lockbox to mean something. We want it to include Medicare, and we want the right to offer amendments to do just that. 
   That is what this debate is about. There is a difference on a cloture vote between ending a filibuster and denying Senators the right to offer amendments. 
   We will continue to fight for our rights, regardless of the issue and regardless of how much concern it may bring to some of those on the other side who seem to be determined to lock us out. 
   I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is here. He is anxious to begin the debate on a very important bill. 
   I am hopeful we can pass this legislation today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hoped to get over here prior to the time my colleagues left the floor, but let me compliment Senators KENNEDY, DURBIN, BOXER, SCHUMER, and others who participated in the colloquy this afternoon on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We are very hopeful that over the course of the next two weeks the Senate can reach an agreement on proceeding to the bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We will be more than happy to enter into negotiations with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle with one understanding, that we have the opportunity to offer amendments. In fact, we have suggested at least 20 amendments to ensure that we have a good debate. We don't want to have a sham debate on something of this import. On a bill that we will take up tomorrow, the State Department authorization bill, both sides have agreed to consider 52 amendments. We passed the Defense authorization bill a month ago, and we agreed to over 100 amendments. We have reached an agreement on virtually every bill that has come to the floor. In fact, the juvenile justice bill had 35 amendments with over 18 rollcall votes. 
   But I think the key question is, if tomorrow we can agree, as Republicans and Democrats, to consider 52 amendments on a bill that has, frankly, very little relevance to the day-to-day lives of every American, as important as it is for other reasons, then, my goodness, it would seem to me we could agree to 20 amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   One of the amendments we feel very strongly about offering is an amendment to expand the scope of the bill. I just want to talk briefly about that before I move to another issue. Probably the single biggest difference--I won't say the only big difference, because there are many--but one of the most important differences between the Republican bill and the Democratic bill has to do with what we call scope. By scope, we simply mean who is covered. 
   By everybody's recognition, the Republican bill covers 48 million Americans. Those 48 million Americans fall into one category: those employed by large businesses that are self-insured. Those are the only American people today who are covered under the Republican bill. 
   I have a chart. This is so important. This chart says it so well. This chart shows what the Republican bill does not do, and why we feel so strongly about offering amendments. Mr. President, 48 million Americans are covered through a plan that self-funds insurance within the company. Here are all the people who are not covered; 75 million Americans are not covered who have individual insurance policies or an HMO that is purchased but not funded by their employer. In other words, if you are an employee of a company with self-funded insurance, you are covered. If you work for an employer who contracts with an insurance company or an HMO, you are not covered. 
   There are only 48 million people in that category--those who work for a self-insured employer. There are 75 million Americans who are working for employers who purchase their insurance through separately-funded insurance companies and HMOs. There are another 23 million Americans who have their insurance through their jobs in State and local governments, and then there are 15 million Americans who have individual insurance plans. All of those people are not covered in the Republican plan. Two-thirds of all of those with health insurance are not covered. 
   I do not know why they would not be covered under the Republican plan. I am sure our Republican colleagues have a good rationale for not including all of these people. I have heard them say they are covered in some of the State plans. That is the problem. 
   What if you move from one State to another? The average American family now moves three times in the life of the family as children are growing up. What if you move? What if you get transferred? You may not be covered. How do you know? Are you going to call the State capital and find out? We say: Cover them all. Cover all 75 million Americans who are working for companies that have insurance coverage. Cover all State and local government employees. Cover all people who have individual policies and, yes, cover everybody who is working for a self-insured company. 
   That is just one of the many differences--and we want to talk more about that in the future--but it is why we ought to have amendments. Some suggest let's just have an up-or-down vote on the Republican bill and an up-or-down vote on the Democratic bill. That will not cut it. We will not have an opportunity to talk about issues like this. 
   I really hope we will have the opportunity to have that debate in the next 2 weeks. We will have the opportunity, because if we cannot get an agreement, we will be forced then to offer it as an amendment to another bill.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to briefly talk about another issue, because it is pending in the House at this time and I think it is very important to talk about the gun control issue. 
   Last month, the day before the Senate voted to close the gun show loophole, a prominent Republican Senator made a prediction. He said it really did not matter how the Senate voted, because the House would water down any gun restrictions we pass. 
   That is what was predicted. The gun lobby and its supporters in the House have now made good on that threat. But even though we were warned, we are still stunned that the power of one lobbyist organization can be so demonstrably effective as they appear to have been thus far. 
   The gun lobby's approach to gun control in the Senate was a sham. It is a sham in the House. The first House Republican leadership announcement was that they would divide the juvenile 
   bill into two separate bills: one focusing on youth crime and culture, the other on gun control. 
   We all recognize what that announcement was. It was a move to dilute or even kill the modest gun control measures that had passed in the Senate just a few short weeks ago. Now the House Republican leadership has decided not to bring its sham bill to the floor of the House until 8 o'clock tonight, well after the evening news. I think we know why. The pro-gun forces clearly do not want the American public to know what is going to happen after 8 o'clock tonight. 
   It may be after 8 o'clock tonight when the House begins its gun debate, but it is certainly high noon for those of us who care about this issue. It is time we find out who is going to win  this showdown: the gun lobby or the American people. 
   Littleton, CO, marked a turning point for most Americans, and now we will find out if it marked a turning point for the pro-gun forces on Capitol Hill--or if it is just business as usual. Are we going to make it harder for children and criminals to get guns--or easier? Is it as dramatic a moment, is it as clear a choice as many of us in the Senate believe it is? 
   Today, we are warning those who are about to vote in the House: The gun lobby tried every excuse and half-measure they could come up with to defeat the modest restrictions in the Senate, and they failed. 
   Why? Because we know what America wants. America wants to close the gun show loophole. Sham proposals that do not cover all gun shows and allow criminals to get guns are not enough. Weak measures that only allow 24--or even 72 hours--are not enough. Law enforcement must have up to three business days to complete background checks, when necessary, to make sure that guns do not end up in the hands of criminals. Nothing less is acceptable. 
   The gun lobby says it is, but I guarantee that any family who has lost a child to gun violence will disagree. Listen to your conscience and your constituents, not to the extremist wing of the gun lobby. 
   I come from gun country. Most South Dakotans feel pretty strongly about guns. They are part of our culture, our heritage. I have owned a gun since I was 8 years old. But even in South Dakota, the vast majority of people believe we need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. 
   Tonight, the House of Representatives has a chance to build on the conscientious proposals that passed in the Senate. It is a narrow window of opportunity for Congress to act in a way that will make a real difference for our children and for our communities. Let us listen, let us stop the maneuvering, let us do something now. Tonight is the night. Mr. President, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock, it does not matter. Do the right thing. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, once again, the Senate has the opportunity to do something meaningful for the American people; that is, to protect and strengthen both Social Security and Medicare for generations to come. I fear we may lose that opportunity in just a few moments. 
   Repeatedly, we have seen lost opportunities as we have debated this lockbox issue now for several months. Rather than allowing Senators to exercise their rights and offer amendments to improve a given piece of legislation, many of our Republican colleagues have opted for a take-it-or-leave-it approach. The losers in each instance are the American people. They know this behavior produces gridlock and partisanship and fails to address the problems and concerns faced by American families around the country. Yet, this is precisely the course the majority has chosen to follow on yesterday's so-called lockbox bill and again on today's version. 
   In both instances, our Republican colleagues have resorted to procedural tactics to deny Senators the right to offer even a single amendment. 
   The right to amend is a fundamental part of the legislative process and is particularly important given the nature of the bills before us yesterday and today. Both of these bills have flaws that, if addressed, could quickly lead to final passage of both. Neither the Abraham bill we considered yesterday, nor the House-passed bill we will soon be voting on, sets aside a single dollar for Medicare--not a dollar, not a dime. Nothing. 
   Democrats believe we should protect and strengthen both Social Security and Medicare. Republicans--at least some of them--can't seem to bring themselves to do anything to address the Medicare issue. Given a choice between Medicare and tax cuts, or just tax cuts, our Republican colleagues are choosing just tax cuts every time. 
   This position is particularly troubling given the state of Medicare's finances and the size of the projected on-budget, non-Social Security surpluses. According to OMB, we will have an on-budget surplus of $1.7 trillion over the next 15 years. 
   According to Medicare's actuaries, the Medicare trust fund is likely to go bankrupt in 2015--at the very time when large numbers of the baby boomer generation reach retirement age. 
   Large non-Social Security surpluses are within our reach while large problems are looming in Medicare. It seems only natural that we would try to set aside a portion of the $1.7 trillion in on-budget surpluses to help protect and reform Medicare. This is precisely the approach taken by Democrats in our alternative: pay down the debt and set aside resources for Social Security and Medicare as well. 
   If you look at the comments made by Republicans last year, you would think that they would join us now in our pursuit to protect both of these important programs. Just last year on this floor, Republican after Republican took the opportunity to tell us about the importance of saving Medicare. 
   Quoting one Republican Senator:  
   What would we do if we had half a trillion dollars to spend? The obvious answer that cries out is Medicare. I think it is logical. People understand the President on ``save Social Security first,'' and I think they will understand ``save Medicare first.'' Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare first.  
   So says a Republican colleague just last year. 
   These words, in various forms, were spoken by a number of our Republican colleagues. The only thing that has changed since then is the size of the non-Social Security surplus; it has grown considerably in the intervening period. Despite their words from last year and forecasts this year showing even larger surpluses--$1.7 trillion over the next 15 years--Republicans now resist setting aside a single dollar for Medicare. 
   Equally disturbing about the so-called Social Security lockbox is that it does not even truly protect Social Security.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say just a couple of words about the pending bill. I will use my leader time, because I know we are out of time under the unanimous consent agreement. 
   Let me begin by saying I do not think there is disagreement at all among most of our colleagues about the importance of stopping frivolous Y2K lawsuits. We recognize that high technology is now the driving engine of our economy and will become an even more important part of our economy in the years ahead. We recognize that businesses need to focus on fixing the problem, not defending against lawsuits. 
   So we want a bill. We hope to have a bill the President will sign. I am disappointed we are not there yet. The White House has made it very clear the pending bill will be vetoed even with the changes that have been made so far. So we have gridlock. We have gridlock in large measure because we have not been able to resolve the remaining differences on this important legislation. 
   I think it is very important we balance the legitimate needs of industry to be protected from frivolous attacks and the rights of consumers. We differ on very critical legislative details that were the focus of a substitute Senator KERRY offered some time ago. We recognize that consumers and small businesses will face real problems. We need to protect their rights in court. That is one of our fundamental concerns about the passage of the current legislation. 
   We want a bill. We do not want frivolous lawsuits. But we also want to ensure that people have some protection. 
   Let me just give one example of what will happen if this bill is passed and signed into law. This is just one example. 
   The pending bill only allows small businesses to recover economic losses for tangible property damage. That is a phrase we are going to hear a lot more in the future, ``tangible'' property damage. This does not include the loss of business information, such as that contained in computer databases. So such losses, including billing records or customer lists, property that is critical to a business owner but which is not tangible, is not covered under the bill we are passing. Amazingly, the pending bill would even protect defendants from liability for fraud or misrepresentation. 
   If you are a small businessman watching C-SPAN right now, you are on Main Street and you are wondering what this bill is all about, under this bill, in those cases where you do not have a tangible property matter at stake, you have absolutely no protection. If you lose your database, if you  lose that so-called nontangible property, you have no recourse. 
   That is unacceptable. 
   I know we are going to get all kinds of debate, and I will probably get calls this afternoon: Yes, we do. The fact is, we have had analysis after analysis. The bottom line is that there is no protection for intangible property. That is not protected. 
   Defendants are even protected from liability for economic losses if they engaged in fraud or misrepresentation under the current legislation. 
   Our alternative, by contrast, only protects responsible companies. The biggest difference between our approach and theirs is that we protect only companies that have acted responsibly. We require companies to demonstrate that they have taken steps to clear up the Y2K problems. 
   For example, the pending bill provides blanket proportional liability. The Kerry amendment merely requires companies to have identified and warned potential victims of problems to get proportional liability. 
   The pending bill caps punitive damages for small companies. Punitive damages punish egregious conduct. We provide no such protection for irresponsible behavior in the alternative we offer. 
   The pending bill sets up roadblocks for consumers suffering from real Y2K-related problems. Our amendment lets them in the courthouse door to at least have the opportunity for redress their damages in a court of law. 
   This area of law traditionally falls under State jurisdiction. But this legislation, the pending bill, preempts State law. We acknowledge the need to do so because of unique circumstances, but we also recognize the need to be careful. 
   The pending bill virtually shifts all Y2K suits into Federal court. It makes it harder for consumers to bring a suit. It increases the strain on an already backlogged Federal court system. Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference oppose such federalization. Our bill places limits on class actions but does not federalize them. 
   In some ways our bill is very similar. Our version addresses all the basic concerns raised by the high-tech industry. Our plan is identical to the pending bill in many ways. Both give defendants 60 days to fix a Y2K problem. Both allow either party to request alternative dispute resolution. Both require anyone seeking damages to have the opportunity to offer reasonable proof--including the nature and amount of the damages--before a class action suit could proceed. 
   But while we recognize the need for a bill, we must carefully write it. Evidence is yet unclear as to the extent of this problem. Evidence is yet unclear about how much frivolous litigation will result from the Y2K bug. 
   We should not grant sweeping legal immunity to those who have caused but not corrected problems. Those who have not tried to address problems deserve no special protection. Yet, this bill provides them that protection. 
   Our approaches are identical in every important, necessary way. But they differ in critical ways for consumers and for our court system. 
   Our approach is the only one the President will sign, so it is the only one that has hope of becoming law. 
   The year 2000 is fast approaching. We cannot waste time debating a bill we know will be vetoed only to have to start all over again. It is senseless to do that. 
   If enough of our colleagues vote against this legislation, it sends a message to fix it in conference. If conferees fail to fix it, I will make every effort to pass another bill that addresses the problem, that the President can sign. 
   In fact, I will present again, as clearly as I can, an articulated, very understandable version of what the President will sign. I want to make it very clear what it is the President will sign and what he will not. We owe it to all of our colleagues to 
   reiterate one more time just what it is that he finds so offensive about this. 
   Let's go back one more time, because I think it is so incredible an issue. If you are affected tangibly, if your property is somehow tangibly affected, you have redress, you can be compensated for economic losses; but if your database, if your mailing list, or if anything else in the computer is adversely affected, is lost, is destroyed as a result of an advertent or inadvertent error on the part of technology--you lose everything--you have no recourse. You cannot recover economic losses that result. 
   Is that really what we want to do? Do we want to destroy your opportunity for recourse when you have lost your database? When you have lost your mailing list? Do we really want that to be the law of the land overriding State law? That is exactly what we are voting on. 
   The answer is, I will bet you this afternoon a majority of our colleagues are going to say: Yes, that is what I am voting on. I will support taking away the right of a small businessman to go to court if he has lost his database. I will support the right of an errant computer salesman or somebody else to take away a small business's opportunity to go to court. 
   I do not believe we want to do that. That is why the President said he will veto this bill. We can do better than that. Nobody can plead ignorance. I am saying it this afternoon. I want everybody to understand it. Nobody can say, ``I didn't know that's what the bill did,'' because I am telling you right now, that is what it does. 
   So before you vote, my colleagues, understand, ignorance is not bliss here. Ignorance is no excuse. When they come back and say, ``I didn't know,'' we can say, ``I told you before the vote.'' 
   If you want to take away a small businessman's right to go to court because he has lost everything, you go ahead and vote for this bill. If you want a bill that works, work with us, work with the President; let's get one approved by the Senate he can sign. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I congratulate the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from New York for beginning this colloquy this afternoon. Certainly, the Senator from Massachusetts is a leader on health issues. This is, without a doubt, the single most important health issue facing this Congress this year, next year, and for however long it takes to pass. 
   Senator KENNEDY's question is right on the mark: Why is it, with all of these groups that are urging the Senate to act, that are waiting for the Senate to act, that cannot understand why we have not acted, why is it we cannot schedule legislation this week to get this bill passed? 
   If we can do Y2K, if we can do the array of other matters that have come before this Congress this year, for heaven's sake, why, with 115 million people already detrimentally affected, can't we do it this week? There isn't an answer to that question. 
   I ask the Senator from Illinois if, from the experiences he has had in his own State, he has heard any other issue having the resonance, having the depth of feeling and meaning to the families of America that this issue does; whether or not he ever had the kind of experience I have had where people come up and volunteer that there is no more important question facing this Congress than this issue, and they want Members to solve it; has the Senator had a similar experience?

   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his leadership and comments he has made. 
   Obviously, time is running out. We have 6 weeks left before the summer recess begins in August. We have a few weeks left in September and October, and then we are at the end of the session already. 
   We have very little time to address an issue of this importance. That is why we have indicated we will find a way to ensure this issue is addressed in June. We cannot wait any longer. We waited last Congress. We waited and came up with as many different ways with which to approach this issue procedurally as we knew how. We failed to convince our Republican colleagues to join this side of the aisle in passing it last year. We will not fail this year. We will get this legislation passed. It has to happen this month. 
   I thank the Senator for his leadership and for cooperating and making this a part of our schedule this afternoon.

   Mr. DASCHLE. We still have not seen the text of whatever it is we are supposed to be amending. The Senator from Oklahoma and I talked about that last week. He indicated it is going to be roughly the bill that passed out of the Labor Committee with some changes, as I understand it, but we have not seen the changes. 
   I must say, it would not be in keeping with the traditions in the Senate that we need approval from the majority with regard to amendments before we can move to a bill. We are determined to be as cooperative as we can, but at the same time, we certainly do not seek our Republican colleagues' approval on a list of amendments. That should not be our requirement. 
   We want to offer amendments that we expect to be debated and considered and hopefully voted on. As the Senator from Illinois has said, there are going to be tough votes on all sides on this issue, but they are issues that have to be addressed. If we are going to deal with a Republican bill that was passed out of the committee with an expectation that, obviously, that may be the bill that passes, we are going to have to try to amend it. 
   We do not have any expectation necessarily that our bill can pass without some Republican support. We hope it will be, and we will work with our Republican colleagues to support the Democratic bill. But we have to have an opportunity to offer amendments, and we will protect our Senators' rights to offer those amendments, and hopefully we can work through this. 
   We are prepared to come up with a reasonable list. I have suggested 20 amendments, which is probably a third of what our colleagues would like to offer on this side alone. But we will come up with a list. I certainly do not expect that we will need to seek approval, however, from our Republican colleagues 
   before we offer them. 
   I thank the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1977, Candis Ray, who operated a tour business in Washington, brought an action against Senator Proxmire and Ellen Proxmire, the Senator's wife. The plaintiff claimed that Senator and Mrs. Proxmire had tortiously interfered with her business in order to favor Mrs. Proxmire's competing tour business. One of the plaintiff's claims was that Senator Proxmire had helped to arrange for Senate rooms for his wife's tours. In affirming the district court's dismissal of the complaint, the court of appeals observed that, to the extent that an issue had been raised about compliance with the Senate's rules on use of its facilities, ``[t]he judicial function is not implicated at all, for only in the Senate forum can observance of the rule be compelled.'' Ray v. Proxmire, 581 F.2d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 933 (1978). 
   In the two decades since that decision, Ms. Ray has launched a barrage of civil lawsuits, seeking to obtain damages in connection with this matter, against the Senate, individual Senators, and Senate employees, federal judges and government attorneys who have been involved in her prior lawsuits, and the President. In 1989, Ms. Ray sought to hold Senator Heflin, Sanford, Stennis, and Wallop, as well as an employee on Senator Sanford's staff and the Senate itself, accountable for the Senate's lack of favorable action on her complaints and petitions for financial payment. The Senate Legal Counsel obtained the dismissal of that action. 
   The plaintiff has now filed her fifth lawsuit related to this matter, this time against Senator LOTT and Senator EDWARDS, her home-state Senator. The lawsuit again seeks to hold the Senators responsible for the lack of favorable action on her demands for payment from the Senate. 
   The resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator LOTT and Senator EDWARDS and to move to dismiss the complaint.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I had intended, at the request of the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, to object to the request earlier made by the Senator from Vermont having to do with the schedule tomorrow morning. It was the hope of the Senator from Wisconsin that he could have 30 minutes, prior to  the time we begin at 10, for purposes of morning business.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to say farewell to a wonderful group of young men and women who have served as Senate pages over the last five months, and thank them for the contributions they make to the day-to-day operations of the Senate. 
   This particular group of pages has served with distinction and has done a marvelous job of balancing their responsibilities to their studies and to this body. 
   Page life is not easy. I suspect few people understand the rigorous nature of the page's work. On a typical day, pages rise early and are in school by 6:15 a.m. After several hours in school each morning, pages then report to the Capitol to prepare the Senate Chamber for the day's session. Throughout the day, pages are called upon to perform a wide array of tasks--from obtaining copies of documents and reports for Senators to use during debate, to running errands between the Capitol and the Senate office buildings, to lending a hand at our weekly conference luncheons. 
   Once we finish our business here for the day--no matter what time--the pages return to the dorm and prepare for the next day's classes and Senate session and, we hope, get some much-needed sleep. Even with all of this, they continually discharge their tasks efficiently and cheerfully. 
   Aside from their normal day-to-day duties, this class in particular has had some extraordinary experiences as they witnessed firsthand the democratic process with all of its strengths and its imperfections. On their first day as Senate pages, they were thrown into the middle of the impeachment debate. As their semester here progressed, they witnessed several historic debates such as whether to send our country's armed forces into an international conflict far from home. And they watched our country struggle through the aftermath of tragedies such as Littleton, Colorado and the Senate's efforts to pass meaningful gun control legislation. 
   I hope every person in this page class gained some insight into the need for individuals to become involved in community and civic activities. By living and working together, they have gained knowledge about the political process that they could not obtain from a textbook alone. The future of our nation strongly depends on the generations who will follow us in this august body. I look forward to the possibility that one or more of this fine group of young people will return as a member of the U.S. Senate. 
   Mr. President, with your permission, I would like to insert in the RECORD the names and states of each of the Senate pages to whom we are saying goodbye. They are: Derek Alsup, New Hampshire; Devin Barta, Wisconsin; Halicia Burns, Michigan; Richard Carroll, Delaware; Micah Cermele, Alabama; Cathryn Cone, Missouri; Clay Crockett, Michigan; Danielle Driscoll, California; Mark Hadley, Virginia; Patrick Hallahan, New Jersey; Jessica Lipschultz, Idaho; Jennifer Machacek, Iowa; Brendan McCann, Virginia; Mark Nexon, Vermont; Chandra Obie, Montana; Stephanie Stahl, South Dakota; Marian Thorpe, West Virginia; Stephanie Valencia, New Mexico; and George Vana IV, Vermont. 
   I'm sure all my colleagues join me in thanking these fine young men and women, and wishing them well in the future.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Before we moved off this legislation, it was my intention to lay down an amendment. I don't need any time to talk about the amendment tonight but certainly prior to the time we have the cloture vote. Obviously, our desire is to offer some amendments to the bill. Because the bill is now the subject of the consideration of the Senate, it would be my desire at this point to lay down an amendment.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have to rise to express my frustration with our current circumstances. I have been doing all I could to assure that we could bring this bill to closure. 
   We agreed to a limited number of amendments. We agreed to time limits on those amendments. We have agreed to try to accelerate the consideration of this bill in every way, shape, and form. Now we are told we cannot have a vote on final passage until Tuesday. 
   That is totally inexplicable. We have been told over and over and over again this bill is so important and time-sensitive. We have been told it cannot wait. We have been told we cannot take up other legislation because we do not have time. 
   We have been on this bill for a couple of days. We have addressed every concern Senators have raised. We have offered amendments. We have no reason this bill could not be completed today--no reason at all. 
   It is very hard for me to understand why, after all of this effort to bring us to this point, to have completed our work on the bill, we cannot bring this bill to closure, we cannot move on to other legislation. There is just no reason for it. 
   I am very disappointed. It is very hard to ask my colleagues day after day to cooperate, day after day to try to figure out a way to complete work on bills, and then be told: Well, we have changed our mind. We don't want to complete work on a bill. We are going to bump this bill into next week. And, by the way, we are going to make up reasons to have votes. 
   That is not the way to run the Senate. It is not the way to do business. It makes it very difficult to go back to colleagues and say: Now we have changed our mind again. We are going to try to finish this bill in 2 days. We are going to try to take something else up and work it through, but we want your cooperation. 
   That is unacceptable. I do not know why we cannot have the final vote. I do not know why we cannot finish the legislation. I do not know why we cannot find a way to resolve all the other outstanding issues there are with regard to this bill this afternoon. We can do it this afternoon. It is only 2 o'clock.  
   I am told that all we have left only two or three. That is all we have. We are told by the Republicans that there is no more time, that we will not be allowed to go to final passage today. 
   As I say, it leaves me mystified. I am absolutely puzzled, exasperated. I do not understand. I just wish we had been told, because there have been a lot of other amendments we could have offered on our side had we known we would have all this time. We were told: No. We don't have time. Let's get this bill done, and let's get it to conference. 
   We are now not going to get to conference--not now, not tomorrow, not until next week. 
   There is no excuse.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The deputy Democratic leader is right. There are absolutely as many references to that in the RECORD as any legislation I know of this year, especially from the other side. The Senator from Connecticut has been so diligent and so arduous in recognizing how important this bill is and urging us to move through this and get it done. He is on the floor. I am sure he would be more than happy to vote on final passage this afternoon, but that will not happen.

   Mr. DASCHLE. We certainly do need to move forward on that. We have suggested 20 amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Recognizing that there could be 60 or 70 amendments, given the way many Senators feel about that important piece of legislation, we have said not 60, not 50, not 40, but 20 amendments, and time limits on those amendments. The answer was, well, there may not be time to do 20 amendments. 
   Here we are today. We were told that there wasn't time to do 15 amendments on this bill. 
   I have to give great credit to our ranking member, the manager on our side. He could have filibustered this legislation. I know how he feels about it. He could have been out here making the Senate go through all the hoops. We have talked about this. In the interest of expediting the legislation, moving this through, the Senator graciously has acknowledged that there will be another day. We will work through this in conference. The Senator has said that more than anybody. Ironically, the one man who could have held this thing up for weeks, if not months, is sitting here ready to vote. It is really an irony, it seems to me, that in spite of all the attention about expediting this bill, in spite of all the pressure and all the effort made to express the urgency of getting this done, we sit here this afternoon, at 2 o'clock, waiting for final passage.

   Mr. DASCHLE. That was the whole reason we agreed to be as expeditious as possible. I am going to vote against final passage. I hope a number of my colleagues will join me in doing that. But that doesn't mean I do not want a bill. I have said repeatedly on the Senate floor I want a bill, but I want the right bill. The only way we are going to get to the right bill is to continue to work on it. We are not going to do that this afternoon. We are not going to do that tomorrow. We are not going to do that Monday. We are now going to have to wait until 
   Tuesday. So that just delays for another week the prospects of meaningful compromise and meaningful resolution of the outstanding questions.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the agreement signed yesterday between NATO and Yugoslavia is hopeful news as we move toward our goals of ending the atrocities and genocide in Kosovo and bolstering stability in southeastern Europe. The vote by the UN Security Council today authorizing an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo is yet another hopeful sign. 
   This agreement is a victory for freedom. It is a defeat for dictators around the world. NATO's resolve to halt and redress Milosevic's crimes against humanity sends an important message to world leaders who engage in ethnic cleansing and other atrocities. NATO's victory over Yugoslav aggression also sends a positive signal to the forces of democracy in the region. 
   President Clinton deserves immense credit for his leadership throughout this 11-week military operation. When so many said it was impossible, he kept a 19-member NATO alliance intact. When so many said it would never work, he stuck to the air campaign that led that NATO alliance to victory. 
   The President never wavered in his commitment to the alliance's goals of ending the atrocities in Kosovo, forcing the withdrawal of Serb forces from the region, and ensuring the safe return of Kosovar refugees to their homes. President Clinton's steadfast resolve, together with our NATO allies, forced President Milosevic to back down and accept NATO's conditions for a halt in the bombing campaign. 
   It would appear that some of those who were most critical of the President's Kosovo policies were more concerned with waging a political assault than in stopping the Serbs' military assault on Kosovo. But now that the Serbs have conceded defeat, one can only hope that those who were so harshly critical of the President might concede they were mistaken. 
   Our NATO allies also deserve great credit and much gratitude. They understood the long-term implications of failing to address the Yugoslav threat to Kosovo and to regional stability. They met the challenge head-on and showed that NATO remains the most formidable military alliance in the world. 
   And the front-line states--Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Romania--were forced to experience firsthand the consequences of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing. They, and the Republic of Montenegro, should be commended for accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees and enduring the instability caused by the actions of the Yugoslav government. 
   Of course, those truly on the front lines were our U.S. military forces who contributed so skillfully to the success of the air campaign. They deserve our full support and our thanks for carrying out their mission so bravely, and for achieving our military goals with virtually no casualties. 
   It is now vitally important that the United States and our NATO allies remain vigilant to ensure that the Serbs live up to their agreement so that the Kosovars can return to their country and their homes, and rebuild their lives. They have a right to live in peace without fear of further atrocities. 
   The agreement reached yesterday is cause for great hope that we can achieve those goals, and I want to again commend the President, our troops, NATO, and those front line countries who gave so much for the success and the victory that we celebrate today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to express the views of this Senator on a very important amendment. 
   I think the biggest question facing the Senate today is not whether to support the Y2K liability reform. Most supporters, on both sides of the aisle, agree that we need to protect the high-technology companies from frivolous lawsuits. 
   For more than a decade, this industry has been the driving force of our economy. Its well-being is extremely important to this country and to all of us. 
   In South Dakota, Gateway computers is the largest private employer in the State today. I want a bill that provides Gateway--and every other member of this industry--with reasonable protections from frivolous Y2K-related lawsuits. 
   Businesses need to be able to focus on fixing the problem--not defending against lawsuits. 
   But the high technology industry is not the only group that faces potential difficulties as a result of this problem. 
   Consumers and other businesses that use and depend on computers face potential risks as well. 
   We need to protect consumers who might be hurt by the Y2K bug. We need to protect their right to seek justice in the courts. 
   A major problem with the underlying bill, as we consider just how we do that, is an issue of great importance to many of us; that is, how we resolve the issue of capping punitive damages that go beyond what is needed to prevent frivolous Y2K-related lawsuits. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KERRY, and developed by him, and a number of our colleagues, corrects these problems. 
   Before I describe the differences between our approach and the underlying bill, it is important to point out that--on most of the basic issues--the two proposals are identical to the pending bill. 
   Both approaches encourage remediation by giving defendants 90 days to fix a Y2K problem before a lawsuit can be filed. 
   Both approaches would discourage frivolous lawsuits by allowing either party to request alternative dispute resolution at any time during the 90-day waiting period. 
   Both approaches require anyone seeking damages to offer reasonable proof--including the nature and amount of the damages--before a class action suit could proceed. 
   Both approaches would permit class-action lawsuits to be brought only if a majority of the people in the lawsuit suffered real harm by real defects.  
   Our approach addresses 95 percent--if not 100 percent--of what those in the high-technology community have asked for. It addresses all of the principles they have said are essential. 
   But there are a number of important ways in which our approaches differ. 
   Our proposal carefully balances the rights and interests of the industry, and consumers. 
   It limits its remedies to problems that are truly, legitimately Y2K related. 
   Our alternative offers high-tech companies more incentives than the underlying bill to fix the problem--now, while there is still time. 
   We are concerned that the underlying bill may--perhaps inadvertantly--provide such blanket protection against all Y2K problems, including those that could have and should have been avoided, that companies will lose the incentive to fix problems now. 
   For example, our amendment provides a balanced and reasonable solution to the issue of ``proportionality.'' 
   The underlying bill preempts State laws on this issue. It would grant defendants proportional liability in almost all Y2K cases--no questions asked. 
   Our amendment, simply says that Y2K defendants would have to pass a simple test to quality for this protection. 
   It is sometimes referred to as the ``good corporate citizen'' test. And I know my colleague from Massachusetts has discussed this in some detail this afternoon. All a company has to do to pass the test is to show that it has identified potential problems and made a good-faith effort to alert potential victims. 
   This is a major concession. But we are willing to make it in this case because of the extraordinary circumstances. 
   These are reasonable conditions. Every single high tech company we know of has already met it. 
   If there are others that have not done so, they do not deserve special protection from Congress--plain and simple. 
   There are a number of other ways in which our amendment improves on the underlying bill: 
   It does not prohibit consumers from seeking justice in the courts for real and legitimate Y2K-related problems. 
   The underlying bill would require consumers to meet so many conditions before bringing suit that it would effectively shut the courthouse door. 
   Our bill establishes strict requirements for class actions to protect against frivolous suits. 
   The underlying bill shifts virtually all Y2K suits to the Federal courts. This has two effects. In many cases, it makes it harder for consumers to bring a suit. It also increases the strain on an already backlogged Federal court system. 
   This is strongly opposed by the Judicial Conference--not only because of the additional strain it would place on Federal courts, but also because it would upset the traditional division of responsibility between State and Federal courts. 
   I might say, I am continually amused by those on the other side of the aisle who have expressed themselves as being advocates of States rights and the Constitution and the requirement that States be given the prerogative in matters of jurisdiction on this and so many other areas; but when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle find it convenient, it seems this shift to Federal responsibility comes so easily. This is just yet another example of that shift. There have been scores of those examples in recent years. 
   Our alternative would not enforce illegal contract terms. 
   The underlying bill might. It could enforce any and all contracts--even those that are currently illegal under State and Federal laws. 
   Our alternative does not protect defendants from liability for intentionally wrongful acts. It allows victims of such acts to sue for economic losses. 
   The underlying bill protects companies even when they knowingly harm consumers, or use fraud to pressure someone into signing a contract. 
   Finally, our bill does not include a cap on punitive damages. 
   The pending bill would limit the amount of punitive damages that smaller businesses and municipalities could be assessed--regardless of whether they acted responsibly. 
   The people who would benefit from a cap on punitive damages are bad actors who injure others. 
   Ironically, many of those who would be hurt if this passes are themselves small businesses. 
   In summary, our amendment is identical to the underlying bill in every important, necessary way. 
   But, it does differ in ways that are critical to consumers, to businesses, and to the functioning of our courts. 
   Perhaps the most important difference between our approach and the underlying bill is that our approach is the only version the President will sign. 
   We know that. The administration has said so unequivocally on numerous occasions. Make no mistake, unless the improvements in this amendment are adopted, the President will veto this bill for going too far. 
   So the choice is ours, and the year 2000 is fast approaching. Do we want to engage in an exercise that would be fruitless? Do we want to waste precious days debating a bill we know will be vetoed and then have to start all over? Do we want to limit frivolous Y2K lawsuits? This year is now more than halfway over. How much more time are we willing to let go before we agree to work together on a real solution? 
   The bottom line is, we have the power to fix the Y2K problem today. We have before us now an approach that targets the real problem and can be signed into law. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in adopting the Kerry-Robb amendment. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   12,000TH VOTE FOR SENATOR STEVENS 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-daschle-sd-4-19990609</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DASCHLE. Today, I call the attention of all my colleagues to a very important and historic achievement by one of the Senate's most remarkable Members. With this vote, TED STEVENS will cast his 12,000th vote in his career. 
   It is certainly fitting that Senator STEVENS represents Alaska in the United States Senate. He has lived in that great state and worked for its residents since before it was a state. In fact, as Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, TED was instrumental in setting the groundwork for Alaska's admission to the Union in 1959. 
   In 1964, TED was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives. Two years later, his colleagues elected him House Majority Leader, an honor that surprises none of us who have first hand knowledge of TED's legendary tenacity, legislative acumen and dedication to his constituents. 
   Senator STEVENS brought that determination and skill to the Senate in 1968. I'm sure that every Senator has his or her own anecdote to document TED's dedication and effectiveness as a legislator. 
   TED once declared that his constituents ``sent me here to stand up for the state of Alaska.'' No one who served with TED over the past thirty years can doubt his commitment to do just that. 
   In fact, some surely wonder at times if he isn't more of an ambassador than a Senator. 
   TED has endeavored to ensure that promises made to Alaska under the Statehood Act are kept. He helped pass the Native Claims Act in 1971 and played a pivotal role in bringing the oil pipeline to Alaska in 1973. He joined with Senator Warren Magnuson in co-authoring the 200 mile fishing limit that protects all coastal states from encroachment by foreign fishing fleets and helps sustain America's fisheries. 
   In the late 1970s, when President Carter made the creation of wilderness areas in Alaska a national priority, TED worked with his characteristic focus and tenacity to ensure that the Alaska Lands Act protected his state's interests as much as possible. After the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989, TED managed legislation that not only financed the cleanup of the despoiled coastline, but also required double-hulling on tankers. 
   Senator STEVENS has worked tirelessly and effectively for Alaska. But his accomplishments are certainly not limited to the 49th state. TED's career documents his far reaching influence on national policy and dedication to the institution of the Senate as well. 
   TED has been a leader in the defense area for his entire career, as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and now the full Appropriations Committee. And he has developed recognized expertise in science and technology issues through his long and distinguished service on the Commerce Committee as well. 
   TED has a deep affection for the Senate and has labored to preserve the character, integrity and prerogatives of the institution. He has chaired the Rules Committee and served in the leadership as Majority Whip.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the values and spirit that helped early settlers thrive and prosper in the harsh conditions of life on the prairie are alive and well today in South Dakota. 
   Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet someone who embodies many of the values and ideals that the great state of South Dakota was built upon. Phillip Clark, owner and President of Hansen Manufacturing Corporation of Sioux Falls, is one of 53 persons honored this week by the Small Business Administration as part of its celebration of National Small Business Week. For over two decades, Phil has guided his company through a variety of complex challenges and built a thriving business. In the process, he has made an important contribution to our state, and to the city of Sioux Falls. 
   As a manufacturer of conveyer belt assemblies, Phil invented an enclosed belt conveyor system. Anyone who has worked in or around a grain elevator knows the importance of minimizing dust; it is one of the most important safety steps that can be taken to prevent fires and explosions. This enclosed belt system has helped a number of grain facilities improve the safety of their operations, and dramatically changed the way that grain and other bulk materials are moved. 
   Phil was able to develop this system because he listened to what his customers wanted, and he acted to fill that need. it is a basic lesson that every successful business owner must know: listen to your customer. 
   While Phil has maintained a clear focus on his company's future, he has also taken the steps necessary to position his company to deal with current business conditions. As a manufacturer of conveyor belt systems, Hansen Manufacturing derives much of its business from grain elevators, feed manufacturers, and other companies that process agricultural goods and other bulk materials. Because of the continued crisis in our agricultural markets, many of these companies have faced extremely difficult business conditions over the past few years, resulting in equally difficult times for their suppliers. Furthermore, domestic weakness has been compounded by weakness in foreign markets, which have become increasingly important for Hansen Manufacturing. 
   While short-term business conditions have been challenging, Phil has been able to successfully grow his business while making critical investments in new product lines. His successful stewardship of Hansen Manufacturing serves as an example to all small business people in South Dakota. I commend the Small Business Administration for recognizing his outstanding work. 
   In South Dakota, almost all businesses are small businesses, and that's true nationwide. But in South Dakota small businesses are big business. I thank the Small Business Administration for its work with business owners such as Phil Clark, and I congratulate Phil for his hard work and his outstanding contributions to his community and state.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the American people continue to say they want a comprehensive, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. Toward that goal, several of my Democratic colleagues and I introduced S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, earlier this year. That legislation, which we first introduced in the 105th Congress, addresses the growing concerns among Americans about the quality of care delivered by health maintenance organizations. I am disappointed that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle prevented the Senate from considering managed care reform legislation last year. But I remain hopeful that the Republican leadership will allow an open and honest debate on this important issue this year. 
   I am hopeful that my colleagues will also take a moment to listen to veterans in this country who are raising legitimate concerns about the medical care they receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Many veterans are understandably concerned that the Administration requested approximately $18 billion for VA health care in FY00--almost the same amount it requested last year. They fear that if this flat-lined budget is enacted, the VA would be forced to make significant reductions in personnel, health care services and facilities. I share their concerns and agree that we simply cannot allow that to happen. On the contrary, Congress and the Administration need to work together to provide the funds necessary to improve the health care that veterans receive. 
   Toward that end, and as we prepare to celebrate Memorial Day, I am reintroducing the Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator ROCKEFELLER, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, is joining me in this effort. This legislation, which was S. 2619 last year, calls for veterans to be reimbursed for emergency care they receive at non-VA facilities. 
   The problem addressed in the bill stems from the fact that veterans who rely on the VA for health care often do not receive reimbursement for emergency medical care they receive at non-VA facilities. According to the VA, veterans may only be reimbursed by the VA for emergency care at a non-VA facility that was not pre-authorized if all of the following criteria are met: 
   First, care must have been rendered for a medical emergency of such nature that any delay would have been life-threatening; second, the VA or other federal facilities must not have been feasibly available; and, third, the treatment must have been rendered for a service-connected disability, a condition associated with a service-connected disability, or for any disability of a veteran who has a 100-percent service-connected disability. 
   Many veterans who receive emergency health care at non-VA facilities are able to meet the first two criteria. Unless they are 100-percent disabled, however, they generally fail to meet the third criterion because they have suffered heart attacks or other medical emergencies that were unrelated to their service-connected disabilities. Considering the enormous costs associated with emergency health care, current law has been financially and emotionally devastating to countless veterans with limited income and no other health insurance. The bottom line is that veterans are forced to pay for emergency care out of their own pockets until they can be stabilized and transferred to VA facilities. 
   During medical emergencies, veterans often do not have a say about whether they should be taken to a VA or non-VA medical center. Even when they specifically ask to be taken to a VA facility, emergency medical personnel often transport them to a nearby hospital instead because it is the closest facility. In many emergencies, that is the only sound medical decision to make. It is simply unfair to penalize veterans for receiving emergency medical care at non-VA facilities. Veterans were asked to make enormous sacrifices for this country, and we should not turn our backs on them during their time of need. 
   There should be no misunderstanding. This is a widespread problem that affects countless veterans in South Dakota and throughout the country. I would like to cite just three examples of veterans being denied reimbursement for emergency care at non-VA facilities in western South Dakota. 
   The first involves Edward Sanders, who is a World War II veteran from Custer, South Dakota. On March 6, 1994, Edward was taken to the hospital in Custer because he was suffering chest pains. He was monitored for several hours before a doctor at the hospital called the VA Medical Center in Hot Springs and indicated that Edward was in need of emergency services. Although Edward asked to be taken to a VA facility, VA officials advised him to seek care elsewhere. He was then transported by ambulance to the Rapid City Regional Hospital where he underwent a cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass grafting. Because the emergency did not meet the criteria I mentioned previously, the VA did not reimburse Edward for the care he received at Rapid City Regional. His medical bills totaled more than $50,000. 
   On May 17, 1997, John Lind suffered a heart attack while he was at work. John is a Vietnam veteran exposed to Agent Orange who served his country for 14 years until he was discharged in 1981. John lives in Rapid City, South Dakota, and he points out that he would have asked to be taken to the VA Medical Center in Fort Meade for care, but he was semi-conscious, and emergency medical personnel transported him to Rapid City Regional. After 4 days in the non-VA facility, John incurred nearly $20,000 in medical bills. Although he filed a claim with the VA for reimbursement, he was turned down because the emergency was not related to his service-connected disability. 
   Just over one month later, Delmer Paulson, a veteran from Quinn, South Dakota, suffered a heart attack on June 26, 1997. Since he had no other health care insurance, he asked to be taken to the VA Medical Center in Fort Meade. Again, despite his request, the emergency medical personnel transported him to Rapid City Regional. Even though Delmer was there for just over a day before being transferred to Fort Meade, he was charged with almost a $20,000 medical bill. Again, the VA refused to reimburse Delmer for the unauthorized medical care because the emergency did not meet VA criteria. 
   The Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999 would address this serious problem. It would authorize the VA to reimburse veterans enrolled in the VA health care system for the cost of emergency care or services received in non-VA facilities when there is ``a serious threat to the life or health of a veteran.'' Rep. LANE EVANS introduced  similar legislation in the House of Representatives earlier this year. I am encouraged that the Administration's FY00 budget request includes a proposal to allow veterans with service-connected disabilities to be reimbursed by the VA for emergency care they receive at non-VA facilities. This is a step in the right direction, but I think that all veterans enrolled in the VA's health care system--whether or not they have a service-connected disability--should be able to receive emergency care at non-VA facilities. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator ROCKEFELLER and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that veterans receive the health care they deserve.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to compensate the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota and the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska for losses the tribes suffered when the Fort Randall and Gavins Point dams were constructed on the Missouri River over four decades ago. 
   As a result of the construction of these dams, more than 3,259 acres of land owned by the Yankton Sioux Tribe was flooded or subsequently lost to erosion. Approximately 600 acres of land located near the Santee village and 400 acres on the Niobrara Island of the Santee Sioux Tribe Indian Reservation also was flooded. The flooding of these fertile lands struck a significant blow at the economies of these tribes, and the tribes have never adequately been compensated for that loss. Passage of this legislation will help compensate the tribes for their losses by providing the resources necessary to rebuild their infrastructure and their economy. 
   To appreciate fully the need for this legislation, it is important to understand the historic events that preceded its development. The Fort Randall and Gavins Point dams were constructed in South Dakota pursuant to the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. 887) of 1944. That legislation authorized implementation of the Missouri River Basin Pick-Sloan Plan for water development and flood control for downstream states. 
   The Fort Randall dam, which was an integral part of the Pick-Sloan project, initially flooded 2,851 acres of tribal land, forcing the relocation and resettlement of at least 20 families, including the traditional and self-sustaining community of White Swan, one of the four major settlement areas on the reservation. On other reservations, such as Crow Creek, Lower Brule, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock and Fort Berthold, communities affected by the Pick-Sloan dams were relocated to higher ground. In contrast, the White Swan community was completely dissolved and its residents dispersed to whatever areas they could settle and start again. 
   The bill I am introducing today is the latest in a series of laws that have been enacted in the 1990s to address similar claims by other tribes in South Dakota for losses caused by the Pick-Sloan dams. In 1992, Congress granted the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe compensation for direct damages, including lost reservation infrastructure, relocation and resettlement expenses, the general rehabilitation of the tribes, and for unfulfilled government commitments regarding replacement facilities. In 1996 Congress enacted legislation compensating the Crow Creek tribe for its losses, while in 1997, legislation was enacted to compensate the Lower Brule tribe. The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe have not yet received fair compensation for their losses. Their time has come. 
   Mr. President, the flooding caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched every aspect of life on the 
   Yankton and Santee Sioux reservations, as large portions of their communities were forced to relocate wherever they could find shelter. Never were these effects fully considered when the federal government was acquiring these lands or designing the Pick-Sloan projects. 
   The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act represents an important step in our continuing effort to compensate fairly the tribes of the Missouri River Basin for the sacrifices they made decades ago for the construction of the dams. Passage of this legislation not only will right a historic wrong, but in doing so it will improve the lives of Native Americans living on these reservations. 
   It has taken decades for us to recognize the unfulfilled federal obligation to compensate the tribes for the effects of the dams. We cannot, of course, remake the lost lands that are now covered with water and return them to the tribes. We can, however, help provide the resources necessary to the tribe to improve the infrastructure on their reservations. This, in turn, will enhance opportunities for economic development that will benefit all members of the tribe. Now that we have reached this stage, the importance of passing this legislation as soon as possible cannot be stated too strongly.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act  of 1999. This proposal is the culmination of more than 2 years of discussion with local landowners, the South Dakota Water Congress, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, local legislators, representatives of South Dakota sportsmen groups and affected citizens. It lays out a plan to convey certain parcels of land acquired for the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal features of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota to the Commission of School and Public Lands of the State of South Dakota for the purpose of mitigating lost wildlife habitat, and provides the option to preferential leaseholders to purchase their original parcels from the Commission. 
   In order to more fully understand the issues addressed by the legislation, it is necessary to review some of the history related to the Oahe Unit of the Missouri River Basin project in South Dakota. 
   The Oahe Unit was originally approved as part of the overall plan for water development in the Missouri River Basin that was incorporated in the Flood Control Act of 1944. Subsequently, Public Law 90-453 authorized construction and operation of the initial stage. The purposes of the Oahe Unit as authorized were to provide for the irrigation of 190,000 acres of farmland, conserve and enhance fish and wildlife habitat, promote recreation and meet other important goals. 
   The project came to be known as the Oahe Irrigation Project, and the principal features of the initial stage of the project contained the Oahe pumping plant located near Oahe Dam to pump water from the Oahe Reservoir, a system of main canals, including the Pierre Canal, running east from the Oahe Reservoir, and the establishment of regulating reservoirs, including the Blunt Dam and Reservoir located approximately 35 miles east of Pierre, South Dakota. 
   Under the authorizing legislation, 42,155 acres were to be acquired by the Federal government in order to construct and operate the Blunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project. Land acquisition for the proposed Blunt Reservoir feature began in 1972 and continued through 1977. A total of 17,878 acres actually were acquired from willing sellers. 
   The first land for the Pierre Canal feature was purchased in July 1975 and included the 1.3 miles of Reach lB. An additional 21-mile reach was acquired from 1976 through 1977, also from willing sellers. 
   Organized opposition to the Oahe Irrigation Project surfaced in 1973 and continued to build until a series of public meetings were held in 1977 to determine if the project should continue. In late 1977, the Oahe project was made a part of President Carter's Federal Water Project review process. 
   The Oahe project construction was then halted on September 30, 1977, when Congress did not include funding in the FY1978 appropriations. 
   Thus, all major construction contract activities ceased and land acquisition was halted. The Oahe Project remained an authorized water project with a bleak future and minimal chances of being completed as authorized. Consequently, the Department of Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, gave to those persons who willingly had sold their lands to the project the right for them and their descendants to lease those lands and use them as they had in the past until needed by the Federal government for project purposes. 
   During the period from 1978 until the present, the Bureau of Reclamation has administered these lands on a preference lease basis for those original landowners or their descendants and on a non-preferential basis for lands under lease to persons who were not preferential leaseholders. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation administers 12,978 acres as preferential leases and 4,304 acres as non-preferential leases in the Blunt Reservoir. 
   As I noted previously, the Oahe Irrigation Project is related directly to the overall project purposes of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1944. Under this program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed four major dams across the Missouri River in South Dakota. The two largest reservoirs formed by these dams, Oahe Reservoir and Sharpe Reservoir, caused the loss of approximately 221,000 acres of fertile, wooded bottomland which constituted some of the most productive, unique and irreplaceable wildlife habitat in the State of South Dakota. This included habitat for both game and non-game species, including several species which are now listed as threatened or endangered. Merriweather Lewis, while traveling up the Missouri River in 1804 on his famous expedition, wrote in his diary, ``Song birds, game species and furbearing animals abound here in numbers like none of the party has ever seen. The bottomlands and cottonwood trees provide a shelter and food for a great variety of species, all laying their claim to the river bottom.'' 
   Under the provisions of the Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, the State of South Dakota has developed a plan to mitigate a part of this lost wildlife habitat as authorized by Section 602 of Title VI of Public Law 105-277, October 21, 1998, known as the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and State of South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Act. 
   The State's habitat mitigation plan has received the necessary approval and interim funding authorizations under Sections 602 and 609 of Title VI. 
   The State's habitat mitigation plan requires the development of approximately 27,000 acres of wildlife habitat in South Dakota. Transferring the 4,304 acres of non-preferential lease lands in the Blunt Reservoir feature to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks would constitute a significant step toward satisfying the habitat mitigation obligation owed to the state by the Federal government and as agreed upon by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks. 
   As we developed this legislation, many meetings occurred among the local landowners, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, business owners, local legislators, the Bureau of Reclamation, as well as representatives of sportsmen groups. It became apparent that the best solution for the local economy, tax base and wildlife mitigation issues would be to allow the preferential leaseholders (original landowner or descendant or operator of the land at the time of purchase) to have an option to purchase the land from the Commission of School and Public Lands after the preferential lease parcels are conveyed to the Commission. This option will be available for a period of 10 years after the date of conveyance to the Commission. During the interim period, the preferential leaseholders shall be entitled to continue to lease from the Commissioner under the same terms and conditions they have enjoyed with the Bureau of Reclamation. If the preferential leaseholder fails to purchase a parcel within the 10-year period, that parcel will be conveyed to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks to be used to implement the 27,000-acre habitat mitigation plan. 
   The proceeds from these sales will be used to finance the administration of this bill, support public education in the state of South Dakota, and will be added to the South Dakota Wildlife Habitat Mitigation Trust Fund to assist in the payment of local property taxes on lands transferred from the Federal government to the state of South Dakota. 
   In summary, Mr. President, the State of South Dakota, the Federal government, the original landowners, the sportsmen and wildlife will benefit from this bill. It provides for a fair and just resolution to the private property and environmental problems caused by the Oahe Irrigation Project some 25 years ago. We have waited long enough to right some of the wrongs suffered by our landowners and South Dakota's wildlife resources.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for his advocacy and his leadership on this issue. This is probably one of the most important debates that we are going to have this year with regard to nuclear proliferation. This amendment could be one of the most important amendments that we will have the opportunity to vote on this year with regard to nuclear proliferation. So his advocacy of this issue and this amendment is greatly appreciated. I am very impressed with his command of the facts as we consider its advocacy this morning. 
   Much of the current debate on national security issues these past several weeks has focused on two issues, as we all know: Kosovo and the alleged Chinese espionage of our national weapons laboratories. That concentration is very understandable. 
   In the first instance, the courageous men and women who make up America's military forces are risking their lives daily in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to reverse the genocidal policies practiced by that country's leader. That is a just cause. 
   For the sake of hundreds of thousands of refugees made homeless by Milosevic's reign of terror, as well as the future of NATO, we simply cannot afford to fail. 
   As for the safety of our nuclear secrets, this, too, is an issue of vital national security. It is alleged that for the last two decades the Chinese Government has systematically engaged in efforts to gain access to some of our most important nuclear weapons scientists and the knowledge they possess. 
   Although all agree that classified information has fallen into the hands of the Chinese Government, it certainly  remains unclear who is involved and exactly how much of our national security suffered as a result of these activities. The administration, the Congress, and law enforcement agencies are vigorously exploring answers to these troubling questions. 
   But as important as these issues are, as I noted just a moment ago, I submit there is an issue of equal or greater importance to America's immediate and long-term national security interests, and this amendment addresses it. The issue is the U.S.-Russia relationship and the fate of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and hundreds of tons of nuclear weapons material possessed by each side. 
   The Kerrey amendment recognizes the importance of that relationship. The Kerrey amendment proposes that the United States take a small step to improve this relationship by acknowledging that the Russian nuclear arsenal is shrinking, and adopting the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that our security will not be jeopardized if we do the same. 
   I strongly support this amendment and ask my colleagues to join me. 
   It is difficult to point to a period of time since the end of the cold war when relations between the United States and Russia have been under greater stress. Protests and public opinion polls in Russia demonstrate that anti-American feeling is on the rise in that country. The tension in this critical relationship has grown as a result of both Russia's internal economic and political troubles and actions by this Government. 
   At the very time the U.S.-Russia relationship is under unprecedented stress, the need to work with Russians to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons and the spread of nuclear weapons material and expertise has never been greater. 
   Nearly a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States and Russia still possess roughly 12,000 strategic nuclear weapons, thousands of tactical nuclear weapons, and hundreds of tons of nuclear weapons material. Even more alarming, both sides keep the majority of their strategic nuclear weapons on a high level of alert--something I addressed in past comments and, for the life of me, cannot understand. 
   And reports are growing that Russia's government lacks the resources to properly maintain and control its nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and nuclear know-how. Consider these recent events. 
   In September of 1998, roughly 47,000 nuclear workers protested at various locations around Russia over the Atomic Energy Ministry's failure to provide them their wages for several months. Russian Atomic Energy Minister Adamov told the workers that the government owed the ministry over $170 million and had not provided a single ruble in two months. 
   Again late last year, Russian radio reported that the mayor of Krasnoyarsk-45, one of Russia's closed nuclear cities, where enough nuclear material to build thousands of bombs is stored, warned that unless urgent action was taken, a social explosion in the city was unavoidable. 
   More recently, guards at nuclear facilities reportedly left their posts to forage for food. Others have been reluctant to patrol facility perimeters because they did not have winter uniforms to keep them warm on patrol. 
   At some nuclear facilities, entire security systems--alarms, surveillance cameras, and portal monitors--have been shut down because the facilities' electricity was cut off for non-payment of bills. 
   According to recent testimony by senior Pentagon officials and statements by senior Russian defense officials, Russia's nuclear stockpile is faring no better than the workers hired to maintain and guard it. According to Assistant Secretary of Defense Ted Warner, Russia's force of roughly 6,000-7,000 strategic nuclear weapons will be dramatically reduced regardless of whether Russia ratifies START II. 
   By 2005, according to Warner, ``[Russia] will be hard pressed to keep a force of about 3,500 weapons *.*.* and by about the year 2010, they will be hard pressed to even meet a level of about 1,500 weapons.'' Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev recently stated that Russia is ``likely to have no more than 500 deployed strategic warheads by 2012 for economic reasons.'' 
   Finally, in this weekend's newspapers comes the latest evidence of Russia's nuclear troubles. Under the headline, ``Russia Faces `New Chernobyl' Disaster,'' the London Sunday Telegraph reports,  
   What a Russian energy minister has called a Chernobyl in slow motion is unfolding in [Russia's] far north where nuclear submarines are falling to pieces at their moorings and a decaying nuclear power station has been refused European Commission aid to buy vital safety equipment.  
   According to the Russian chief engineer at the nuclear plant, ``We are in despair.'' 
   Mr. President, while U.S.-Russia relations approach their nadir and Russia struggles to keep the lid on its nuclear forces and workers, what has been the response of the majority of the United States Senate? 
   Unfortunately, for the last several years, a majority of the Senate opted to legally prohibit the United States government from responding by making modest reductions in our forces. A majority in the Senate has prevented the U.S. government from reducing our nuclear forces below the START I level until Russia has ratified START II. This majority has chosen to include a similar provision in this year's defense authorization. This provision further damages U.S.-Russia relations, locks us in at nuclear weapons levels not needed for our security, and drains much-needed resources away from higher priority defense programs. Senator KERREY's amendment wisely strikes this provision. 
   As I noted earlier, our relationship with the Russian government and Russian people is at a low point. Russians fail to understand our actions on several fronts--from NATO enlargement to ballistic missile defense. As Russians look at the inevitable decay of their own strategic nuclear forces, they question why the United States insists on holding firm at weapons levels Russia can never hope to match, let alone exceed. 
   As for whether mandating by law that we retain 6,000 strategic weapons, our senior military leaders--current and former--have decisively expressed their opinions on this issue. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year, General Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and this country's senior military leader, opposed just such a requirement. According to General Shelton, ``I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language that mandates specific force levels.'' General Eugene Habiger, former chief of all U.S. strategic nuclear forces, agreed with General Shelton and went farther. General Habiger stated, ``There is no need to stay at the START I level from a military perspective.'' 
   The Republican decision to keep our strategic weapons levels at an artificially high level also has budgetary ramifications. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that keeping U.S. strategic nuclear weapons totals at START I levels will cost the Defense Department $570 million in FY2000 and nearly $13 billion over the next 10 years. Resources are incredibly scarce, both in the Defense Department and in other areas of the government. We should spend every nickel necessary to ensure a strong defense. But we shouldn't spend a nickel on weapons systems the military tell us they do not need. 
   For all of these reasons, I oppose the provision in the underlying bill. I support Senator KERREY's amendment to strike this provision and restore a modicum of sanity to an increasingly troubled state of affairs. I ask my colleagues to do right by this important relationship, by our senior military leaders, and by the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bill for all we do. I ask for our colleagues' support on the Kerrey amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just remind everyone that we have approximately 24 hours left of this week. In that timeframe we have to do not only the rest of this bill but the supplemental appropriations bill. The only way we are going to finish this is if everybody is willing to cooperate a little bit more and indulge the leadership and the managers of this bill in such a fashion that will allow completion. 
   It has been difficult, and, I must say, increasingly frustrating, for those who have tried to work through all of this in a way that would allow some reasonable conclusion. It seems the longer we work on it, the more everyone's back is up. It is essential we work together and try to resolve this matter. We have been on this bill now for over a week. It is time to bring it to a successful conclusion. 
   I ask the cooperation in the remaining hours of this debate on the part of Members on both sides, so that we can finish it. 
   I have no objection.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we vote, let me make a couple of points very clear. 
   The first point is that we have done everything I know how to cooperate on the juvenile justice bill. We have offered a finite list of amendments. We have worked with our colleagues to reduce that list. We have agreed to time limits. We have not second-degreed or filibustered any amendments on the other side. 
   As I say, we have done it all. We even offered to offer amendments on Friday and Monday. That was rejected by our Republican colleagues because they didn't want to debate those particular amendments on Friday and Monday, after the majority leader made it clear that he wanted to have a full debate on both of those days. We didn't have a full debate, but it wasn't the fault of Democrats. 
   So Members might understand my surprise when the majority leader, out of the blue, without any prior notification, filed this motion to proceed on Y2K. I am not sure why he is doing it today. I sense there are some on the other side who don't want to finish the bill, who would rather put the bill back on the calendar, for whatever reason, and who don't want to do it cleanly. They want to do it in an obfuscated way so our fingerprints are on removing the bill. They want our fingerprints on this bill as it is put back on the calendar. 
   We are not going to do that. We ought to stay on this bill until it is finished. We are getting closer. There is absolutely no reason why, this week--early this week--we couldn't finish this legislation, if we set our mind to doing so. 
   So we are going to oppose cloture today, not because we don't want to move to Y2K. I want to move to that bill, and I will support a motion to proceed to Y2K. I will do it and I hope we do it immediately, after this bill is completed. We don't need to file cloture on it. I will support it, a lot of our colleagues will support it. We want to get a Y2K bill passed. I hope we could do it in a way that would bring a 100-0 vote. I think we are negotiating in a way that could produce that result, but maybe I am too optimistic. 
   Let's take these things one step at a time. Let us ensure that we finish this bill before we move on to the next bill. And when we do, I will move on to the next bill and I will move on to the bill after that. We have to get our work done, but let's do it in an organized fashion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saying how much this Senate, and this nation, will miss Bud Nance. I want, as well, to offer my condolences to Admiral Nance's family, to Senator HELMS on the loss of his childhood friend and staff member, and to Admiral Nance's colleagues at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Other Senators on both sides of the aisle have spoken of Admiral Nance's distinguished careers--in the Navy, the White House, and here in the Senate. He was, as they have said, a war hero, and a true patriot. Senior Naval officer. Commander of U.S. forces in Europe. National security advisor to two Presidents. Chief of Staff to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Senator HELMS is his dearest and oldest friend in the Senate. But Admiral Nance leaves many friends here--on both sides of the aisle. He was a good and decent man. A man of great accomplishment and true humility. He was also a man of integrity. You knew, whenever you dealt with Admiral Nance, that you were dealing with a fair and open man. You knew if Bud Nance made a commitment, it would be kept. His word was his bond. 
   He was also an tireless worker. Most mornings, he arrived at the Capitol at 7 o'clock. He was still at his desk late into most nights. I don't know whether his work ethic was formed in the Navy, or earlier in life, but it was remarkable. And it never wavered, even during his last great battle with sickness and pain. Admiral Nance was a steady hand on the foreign relations Senate ship, just as he was in his command of the aircraft carrier Forrestal. He displayed courage and grace in his fight against illness. 
   The Senate is served every day by men and women of great dedication, commitment and industry who believe in the American system of government. Even among these exceptional people, Admiral Nance stood out. He will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Mary Lyda Faulk; their children, James Lee Nance, Mary Catherine Worth, Andrew Monroe Nance and Susan Elizabeth Nance, and their many grandchildren.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader has propounded a unanimous consent request, reserving the right to object, let me just respond first by sympathizing with his lament about scheduling votes. It is extraordinarily difficult, and both of us are confronted daily with requests for certain prerequisites with regard to votes that make it increasingly difficult for us to schedule legislative debate. There are people who are objecting to votes now even on Friday mornings. I remember Senator Mitchell once lamenting to me personally that the only time he could absolutely schedule a vote without any criticism was Wednesday afternoon. I think there is a lot of truth to that. Now I know fully what he meant. And that is before 7:00. 
   We have been on this bill for 3 days. We have had 15 amendments offered, and there have been good debates. There have been time limits associated, as I understand it, with each one of the amendments. There have been 14 rollcall votes. Our side alone began with a list of 89 amendments, and I do not in any way diminish the importance of any one of those amendments. I think that they are all worthy amendments. Not one of them was dilatory, not one of them was irrelevant to this bill. The problem, however, is that with the extraordinary work of Senator REID and Senator DORGAN, we have now been able to persuade our colleagues to reduce that list. Many of them have waited patiently with the expectation that if they waited patiently, they would get their turn. In many cases, they have waited now 3 or 4 days to be able to offer their amendment. 
   Now what we are telling them is that we want you to offer them today or Monday, even though we have spent 3 days and we have only been able to get through 15 amendments. We have been able to get our list down to around 30 amendments, as I understand it. So it would be very difficult, without further cooperation on both sides, to accommodate the unanimous consent request that the majority leader has understandably propounded.  
   So we will have to object to his request. We would be more than willing to enter into an agreement that would require a complete listing of all the amendments to be offered with time limits. We will offer amendments today and Monday, filling the day today, and then on Monday, in an effort to move this legislation along, and then stack votes on Tuesday, as the majority leader has requested. 
   What we can't agree to, given where we are right now, is any time certain for final passage--recognizing the majority leader's desire to work through a number of other bills yet next week. At least right now, that is not something that we can agree to. I hope, at the very least, as the majority leader suggested, we can submit the list, work on that list, and we can even tighten up the time limits. I think that is all doable. 
   So I have to object to the request as it was propounded.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, I failed to mention my admiration for our two managers and the excellent job they have done in getting us to this point. This has not been easy. They have worked diligently on both sides to bring us to this point. I want to reiterate my gratitude for the effort they have made to get us here. 
   In the 103rd Congress, we spent 11 days on a bill of this kind. It was a very important piece of legislation--I guess it was 12 days. So it is difficult to bring up a bill of this complexity and controversy without having the opportunity to spend some time on it. As the majority leader noted, he has 
   brought this up, as he promised he would, open to amendment. I have indicated that if we were to do that, I would work as hard as I could to ensure that we stayed on the bill and worked diligently to ensure that it is completed in a reasonable time. My hope was that we could do it this week. I think we will get it done in a reasonable time early next week. 
   I am unable to agree to that time limit just because, again, we don't know what the circumstances will be Tuesday. But I will promise this: We will continue to make the effort we have made over the last few hours to lock in time limits on all of the amendments and to make sure there is no quorum call, or any other intervening time that would be dilatory. We want to back these up, one after the other. So we will agree to a list and time limits, but I will have to object to a time certain for final passage.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished assistant Democratic leader for his efforts, again, and for comments he has just made. I am puzzled. I thought we were going to proceed today with additional amendments. We have submitted our list with that intention. We had indicated we were prepared to work this afternoon; we are prepared to work on Monday. But not having our managers here, it makes it difficult. 
   Senator LEAHY is here. And Senator LEAHY has indicated a willingness to come back and work through these amendments. You know, this points up the very problem our colleagues have raised with us when we talk to them about having the need to offer amendments on Fridays and Mondays. 
   If the Republican manager leaves, it is awfully hard for us to offer these amendments. We want to make the most of Friday and Monday. The only way we are going to do that is to have the Republican manager here so we can accommodate those Senators who want to cooperate. It is hard to ask for their cooperation if we do not have somebody on the other side to cooperate with. 
   So I am troubled by that and I hope we can make the most of this afternoon and make the most of Monday. I must say, Mr. President, I am also surprised at the motion to file cloture on the motion to proceed. That is tantamount to pulling this bill. That is what it means. If we get the motion to proceed we are on the Y2K bill. And I thought the majority leader said he wanted to finish this bill on Tuesday.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate that clarification and assurance from the majority leader. As he knows, of course, that takes unanimous consent. There may be people who oppose going back to the juvenile justice bill, and so then we are, under regular order, on the Y2K bill. So a vote for cloture on the motion to proceed would be a vote to table, to put back on the calendar the juvenile justice bill.  
   I have indicated to the majority leader that we would be prepared, based upon the negotiations that have been going on all week, to maybe work some arrangement out with regard to the Y2K bill. We hadn't had any discussion about this. The motion was filed, and so there was no communication at all on that matter--this, ironically, at the same time we were trying to work with the majority leader to try to accommodate his need to move this juvenile justice bill along. 
   Surprises are never welcomed, and this was a surprise that was disappointing. Nonetheless, we will work through that. We will work to accommodate whatever other legislative schedule there may be this next week. 
   I will say this: At this point I am very concerned about voting on the motion to proceed under these circumstances. I think we could finish this bill and then perhaps go on to the Y2K bill. I might even be prepared to move to the motion to proceed and support it myself if we can get this juvenile justice bill done. But to put it back on the calendar and then ask unanimous consent to take it back off the calendar, if we vote for cloture on the motion to proceed--and that is what we would have to do--is a matter that is disturbing. 
   We have a circumstance here that is confusing, to say the least. The majority leader, for good reason, admonished all of us to make the most of Friday, to make the most of Monday, on the juvenile justice bill. Then he files cloture, effectively taking the bill off the calendar and denying the right to offer amendments and to work through these amendments on Friday and Monday. I am hopeful that we can make the most. Let us work on these bills today. Let us work on them Monday. Let us see if we can't work through the rest of the amendments before we divert our attention to other amendments and other bills. 
   This isn't a very orderly process we find ourselves in right now, unfortunately, because of some of these decisions. I am hopeful that we can figure out a way to accommodate the needs of the schedule but also accommodate the needs of Senators who are very hopeful to have their day in court and their opportunity to offer amendments on the juvenile justice bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not because I think this is a very good proposal, I wish we could actually be asking for more than this. I appreciate the managers' efforts to get us to this point. As I have noted to the majority leader, we started with 89 amendments and we went down from there to about 40 amendments. I thank Senators REID and DORGAN on our side. We are now down to around 20 amendments. But those 20 are amendments where the authors have waited patiently for the opportunity to present them and have a debate. I hope they will do it tonight and tomorrow, and I hope we can do it on Monday. I believe we ought to use those days to have the remaining debate about these amendments. They are good amendments and they ought to be voted on. Senators have waited patiently. 
   We also have a right to expect Senators to come forward and 
   present their amendments in good faith and have debate. We are going to be here  tomorrow, I assume, and I hope we will continue to conduct ourselves the way we have all week. This has been a good debate. We have had about the same number of amendments on both sides, Republican and Democrat. We have had good votes. Nobody has been playing political games here. We offer the amendments and have the debate in good faith. I hope we can continue to do that. I have no objection to the unanimous consent request.

   On behalf of all colleagues in the Senate, our hearts go out to the family, to all of those who were so close to Meg over these years. There are few giants in journalism who have the standing stature and the extraordinary influence that Meg Greenfield has had through the years.  
   Her contribution to journalism has been legendary. Her contribution to her country through journalism has been extraordinary. It has been our good fortune to follow her leadership in journalism, to be guided by her wisdom, and certainly to be influenced by her good judgment on many, many occasions over these extraordinary decades which she has been involved.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last evening, Senator ROBB, Senator LEAHY, Senator KENNEDY and other Democratic Senators offered two amendments to S. 254 that were developed by a working group within the Democratic Caucus. Those amendments, together with an amendment to be offered by Senator BOXER to extend after-school programs, provide a comprehensive, measured response to youth violence. 
   Children today face incredible emotional and societal pressures that most people my age never had to worry about. An average of 12 children die each day from gunfire in America. The National School Board Association estimates that 135,000 guns are brought into U.S. schools each day. This reality was painfully reinforced by the terrible, senseless tragedy that occurred in Littleton, Colorado, only a few weeks ago. 
   The fear of school-related violence can have a profound effect on children's ability to learn. This fear has increased over the last decade. Fear for personal safety causes a significant number of students to stay home from school, or avoid certain areas of their schools. A full 71 percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry they will be shot or stabbed while at school. 
   The root causes of the Columbine High School shooting, and wider threats to our schools and communities, are complex and deep. Finding solutions will require a national commitment that goes far beyond legislative proposals. It will require students, parents, teachers and principals, business leaders, faith-based organizations, youth groups, law enforcement officials and many others working together to reduce the threat of violence. 
   While government--alone--can't solve the problem of youth violence, government must be part of the solution. 
   The amendments that make up the Democratic package to S. 254 would help America's communities reduce violence in our schools and communities. 
   Our caucus is united in our support of these amendments. We are also united in our determination to continue to seek long-term solutions to the problem of youth violence--solutions that will encompass both legislative and non-legislative strategies.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a few remarks on this amendment prior to the time we have our vote. 
   I am very appreciative of the efforts made by the distinguished Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Maryland and for their extraordinary leadership in offering this amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
   We call this proposal the American Bank Fairness Amendment. It is cosponsored by a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. On this side, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, is a leading expert and a long-time champion of this measure. We 
   are grateful to him for the work he has done. 
   In a nutshell, this amendment, as my colleagues have noted, would give American banks the freedom to organize their activities in a way that makes the most sense to them. That is basically what it is. It is that simple. Let's give the banks the freedom and the opportunity to make their own choice. We are not going to have Government tell them what is the best choice; we are going to let them make up their own minds. Instead of forcing the banks to organize using an expensive holding company structure, as the underlying bill does, our proposal simply gives banks an option. They can conduct activities through a holding company, or they can conduct their activities through an affiliated operating subsidiary. 
   By giving banks this choice, our amendment will lead to better services at lower costs for all sorts of financial services, from banking to brokerage services to insurance. 
   I want to talk about two specific points--two specific and substantial ways in which our amendment improves on the pending bill. 
   On the issue of safety and soundness, our proposal is actually stronger than the bill offered by the chairman. That is not my assertion. The current Chairman of the FDIC and his four predecessors--three Republicans and two Democrats--all agree. They say that banks face greater risks if forced to use the holding company structure. 
   I think everybody ought to know here that we are talking about an entirely new system. We are talking about moving into uncharted waters. We are talking about making sure that each financial institution has the best option available to it to make the best choice. What we are saying is that as a financial institution makes the choice as it goes into all these uncharted waters, the most important thing we can do is guarantee its safety and soundness. 
   What are we getting? We are getting a virtually unanimous report from the FDIC Chairmen--the current one and four predecessors--that we are using an option here advocating a position that creates more safety and soundness than we have in this bill. 
   So if you want safety and soundness, vote for this amendment. 
   Mr. President, the chairman's bill exposes banks. And I have to say because it exposes banks, it exposes taxpayers to greater risks than our alternative. 
   There are two reasons for that. First, subsidiaries are assets of the bank. They can be sold to satisfy creditors. Affiliates are not considered bank assets. 
   The second reason subsidiaries are safer is because profits from a successful bank subsidiary accrue to that bank. But the profits from a company that is part of a holding company do not directly benefit the bank. 
   Mr. President, it is no secret that of all the issues pending before us, one of those issues into which our Treasury Secretary has put the greatest amount of time and the greatest amount of effort, because he is so concerned about safety and soundness, is this. He wants a tough bill when it comes to safety and soundness. He agrees with the FDIC Chairman and her predecessors, that if we are going to have strong safety and soundness, it is absolutely critical that we ensure we have the structure available to make it happen. 
   Even Fed Chairman Greenspan, who the chairman likes to cite in connection with this bill, agrees that safety and soundness is not the issue here. 
   In his exact words, ``My concerns are not about safety and soundness....... It is not a safety and soundness issue.'' 
   Our proposal corrects a second serious flaw in the underlying bill as well. It does so by giving American banks the same freedom as foreign banks to choose their operating structure. 
   It is absolutely astounding to me that the chairman, who talks so passionately about free markets, actually  dictates in his bill how financial services companies must organize their activities. He gives them one--and only one--choice, which means he gives them no choice at all. 
   Forcing activities into affiliates would place American banks at a competitive disadvantage not only in the international markets; it would actually place American banks at a disadvantage in America. 
   We already give foreign banks the freedom to choose the structure that best serves the business plan. Since 1990, the Federal Reserve has issued approvals for 18 foreign banks to own subsidiaries that engage in securities underwriting activities in the United States. All told, I am told these foreign-owned subsidiaries exceed $450 billion in assets. 
   In a 1992 joint report on foreign bank operations, the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department agreed that ``subject to prudential considerations, the guiding policy for foreign bank operations should be the principle of investor choice.'' 
   The bottom line, therefore, Mr. President, is this: The chairman's bill discriminates against American banks in favor of foreign banks. We say that is wrong. Our amendment levels the playing field. Safety and soundness, basic fairness, these are the important issues that are underlying this amendment that we will be voting on in just a couple of minutes. 
   There is one other important point we need to consider. The President made it absolutely clear that he will veto the financial services modernization bill unless we fix the problem with operating subsidiaries. So the choice is ours--or 
   perhaps I should say it is the chairman's choice. 
   Does he really want a bill badly enough to negotiate and find some solution? Does he want a bill badly enough to give up some potential leverage he might get in conference to deal with this legislation in a way that allows us to focus on the real problems? 
   I hope he will reconsider what threats he has made to pull this bill if his position does not prevail on this amendment. 
   Let's recognize for the good of our country, for the good of our financial institutions, for the good of choice, for the good of safety and soundness, for moving this bill along, that we only have one choice. It is to pass this amendment, and I hope we will do it tonight. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in recognizing a historic achievement by one of the Senate's most remarkable Members. With the vote we are about to cast, Senator JOE BIDEN becomes the youngest Member of this body ever to cast 10,000 votes. 
   It should come as a surprise to none of us that Senator BIDEN should set such a record. He has always been a few steps ahead of the crowd. In 1972, at the age of 29, he mounted his first Senate campaign against a popular incumbent, Republican Senator J. Caleb Boggs. No one--not even his own Democratic party--thought he could do it. But in 1973 he was sworn in as the second-youngest person ever to be popularly elected to the Senate. 
   The first issue Senator BIDEN tackled was campaign finance reform--as we all know, this is a difficult issue for anyone, much less a first-year member. But as we also all know, JOE BIDEN has never shied away from a fight. His candor, strength of character and commitment to principle have led him through many battles over the years. 
   As chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator BIDEN helped this institution, and this nation, sort through the complexities of the most controversial issues of our day--from flag burning, to abortion and the death penalty, 
   Senator BIDEN also presided over perhaps the most contentious Supreme Court nominations hearings in history. In the midst of the controversy surrounding nominee Robert Bork, Senator BIDEN maintained a level of intellectual rigor that raised the bar for committee consideration of all future nominations. 
   We also recall his leadership and doggedness in crafting what may well be the most difficult and important pieces of legislation in recent years, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This included the Violence Against Women Act, the very first comprehensive piece of legislation to specifically address gender-based crimes. 
   He was also instrumental in creating the position of national ``Drug Czar,'' which has been invaluable in our fight against illegal drugs. His commitment to keeping drugs off the streets remains steadfast. 
   The Senate and this nation have also benefitted from Senator BIDEN's leadership in the foreign policy arena. As ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, he is widely regarded as one of the Senate's leading foreign policy experts. 
   He was one of the first to predict the fall of communism and anticipate the need to redefine our policies to fit a post-cold war world. And, as far back as early 1993, Senator BIDEN called for active American participation to contain the conflict in Bosnia. In his public service and personal life, JOE BIDEN sets a high standard we can all admire.  
   His steel will, dedication and compassion, reinforcing a powerful intellect and impressive communication skills, have made Senator BIDEN an exceptional Senator and friend. The number of people he has inspired through his commitment to his family, his values and his beliefs is legion. 
   Mr. President, it is indeed a pleasure to serve with JOE BIDEN, and to count him as a friend. On behalf of all the Members of this Senate, I congratulate JOE on this historic achievement and thank him for his numerous contributions to the United States Senate and to his country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill intended to improve health care for Americans living in rural areas. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 would improve the viability of rural hospitals and clinics, help rural communities attract and retain health care providers and health plans, and make optimal use of the extraordinary medical and telecommunications technology available today. 
   One-fifth of Americans live in rural areas. They experience the same health care access problems that Americans in cities and suburbs face--plus some problems that are uniquely rural. Issues of geography and transportation, which rural Americans face all the time, can make it difficult to visit the doctor or get to a hospital. These problems are made worse by the short supply of health care professionals in rural areas. 
   Rural communities are striving to improve access through telehealth and the recruitment of health care professionals. At the same time, they must also struggle to maintain what they have, to ensure that providers who leave their area are replaced, and to keep their hospitals' doors open. This  bill contains several provisions that will help them do this--by improving Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to rural providers, strengthening recruitment programs, and encouraging the development of telehealth. These are important steps to improve access, increase choice, and improve the quality of care provided in more isolated parts of the country. 
   One problem rural areas face is reimbursement systems that favor urban areas, or that do not take the special needs of rural providers into account. For example, Medicare payments to hospitals are based on formulas that are biased toward urban areas. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and its predecessor, the Prospective Payment Advisory Commission, have been pointing out these inequities for years. This bill would correct the formulas and pay hospitals more fairly. 
   Another reimbursement problem in rural states is payment for health plans in Medicare+Choice. The bill includes a provision to guarantee that plans in rural counties get the increased reimbursement promised in the Balanced Budget Act. This provision is important to ensure that beneficiaries in rural areas have some of the health plan choices available to urban seniors. 
   Rural communities also face difficulty recruiting and retaining health care providers. Despite great increases in the number of providers trained in this country over the past 30 years, rural communities have not shared equitably in the benefits of this expansion. As a result, about 22 million rural Americans live in areas considered Health Professional Shortage Areas because they do not have enough doctors to serve their community. 
   Our bill addresses obstacles in current law to the recruitment and training of providers in rural areas. One obstacle is the current requirement that communities actually lose a physician before they qualify for recruitment assistance to replace that provider. This bill would let communities get assistance for up to 12 months in advance when they know a retirement or resignation is pending. Another provision in the bill ensures that new Medicare reimbursement rules for medical residents, enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act, do not discriminate against areas that train residents in rural health clinics or other settings outside a hospital. 
   Telehealth is another promising tool to bring medical expertise to rural communities. Through telehealth technology, rural patients can significantly shorten their travel time to see specialists, and they can have access to doctors they would otherwise never encounter. The benefits of telehealth extend to rural health professionals as well, providing them with technical expertise and interaction with peers that can make practicing in a rural area more attractive. 
   Our bill addresses some of the barriers that have limited the development of telehealth. It would expand Medicare reimbursement for telehealth to all rural areas, and to all services Medicare currently covers. The bill also would make telehealth more convenient, by allowing any health care practitioner to present a patient to a specialist on the other side of the video connection. The bill also includes a grant program to help communities establish telehealth programs. 
   Mr. President, rural America deserves appropriate access to health care--access to hospitals, access to providers, and access to quality services. Providing this care in rural communities raises unique challenges, but we can--and must--overcome those challenges. The bill I introduce today, along with my colleague Senator BAUCUS and other members of the Rural Health Caucus, takes important steps toward that goal.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Two days ago, when that military transport plane touched down at Andrews Air Force Base and we saw our three American soldiers safe again at last, I said, instinctively, ``thank you.'' 
   ``Thank you, God, and thank you, Jesse Jackson, for bringing Steven Gonzales, Andrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone safely home from their captivity in Serbia.'' Millions of people all across our country, I suspect, said much the same thing. I am pleased today to repeat those words here, in the United States Senate, and to support this resolution honoring Reverend Jackson and the others in his delegation who played such a critical role in securing the release of our service men. 
   ``When I was in prison, you visited me.'' That was one of the ways Jesus said we could recognize those who do his work. In daring to visit our soldiers in prison in Serbia, Reverend Jackson and the delegation of religious leaders who accompanied him surely were following Jesus's teachings as they understood them. Our nation owes them a debt of gratitude. 
   Some have questioned the wisdom of the delegation's trip. There has been speculation about what effect their going to Serbia could have on political or military tactics. Frankly, I don't want to get into that debate. This was not a political or military mission. It was a humanitarian mission.  
   Much praise rightly goes to Reverend Jackson, who organized the trip. I also want to acknowledge another member of the delegation: Congressman ROD BLAGOJEVICH, a second-term Congressman from Chicago's North Side, and the only Serbian-American in the House of Representatives. 
   There are moments in history where a person emerges who seems almost to have been born to fulfill a critical role. On this mission, ROD BLAGOJEVICH was that person. Not only is he a man of significant political and moral courage, he is also the son of Yugoslav immigrants. His father spent four years in a Nazi POW camp during World War II. He learned to speak Serbo-Croation as a child, and still speaks it. 
   I remember when I first was elected to the House. I sought out several of my political heroes to ask them ``How can a young Congressman make a difference--a real difference--in people's lives?'' ROD BLAGOJEVICH has found an answer to that question. Steven Gonzales, Andrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone are united today with their families, in large measure because of the courage he, and Reverend Jackson, and the other religious leaders in their delegation displayed in going to Serbia.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Maryland. I thank him and the Democratic members of the Banking Committee for the tremendous leadership and patience that, in particular, Senator SARBANES has demonstrated in getting us to this point. 
   I also want to acknowledge the efforts of all my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee, and especially the fellow Democrats of the Banking Committee, who have put so much effort and energy and diligence into bringing us to this very important debate, and ultimately this vote which we will shortly have. 
   I might add, as I know the distinguished Senator from Maryland has already noted, that every Democratic member of the Senate Banking Committee is a cosponsor of the substitute we will be voting on shortly. Together, my colleagues on the committee have produced a proposal to give financial service companies new freedoms and new flexibility--without risking the financial well-being of our economy or of individuals. It is a balanced, responsible proposal--one the President can sign--and, on behalf of the entire Democratic caucus, I thank them for producing it. 
   Let me be very clear, Mr. President. Senate Democrats support financial services modernization. We want to see a bill passed. There is no good reason that can't happen this year--in fact, this week. 
   This should not be a partisan issue. Historically, it has not been one. 
   Our substitute is based on last year's H.R. 10. The Senate Banking Committee passed H.R. 10 on a vote of 16 to 2--16 to 2. Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee supported H.R. 10 last year. So did virtually every major financial services industry group. 
   In the House, the House Banking Committee passed a very similar bill this year. Again, the vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan--51 to 8.  
   Until recently, Democrats and Republicans have agreed overwhelmingly that the path laid out in our substitute was the right path. That has all changed. Reform has suffered a major setback this year. In the Senate Banking Committee, the majority forced through a new, harshly partisan bill on a party line vote of 11 to 9. This new bill shattered the consensus that so many people worked so long and so hard to create. 
   In place of the broad support enjoyed by H.R. 10, the committee bill is opposed now by every Democrat on the Banking Committee. It is also opposed by every civil rights group. It is opposed by community groups, community organizations, and local governmental officials. 
   Instead of a clear path to enactment--which is what we would have had had we stayed with the bipartisan approach to H.R. 10--financial services reform is now on two tracks. There is the veto track. And make no mistake, S. 900 is on this track. It will be vetoed if the President receives it in its current form. Then there is the enactment track. That is the track our substitute and the bipartisan House Banking bill are on. 
   We are not saying, ``It is our way, or no way.'' Neither side should ever issue such an ultimatum. That is not the way of the Senate. We have discussed with the majority leader our desire to find a bipartisan way to get the financial services modernization bill back on the enactment track. We have agreed to a floor procedure which will enable us to finish this bill in an expeditious manner. 
   We do not want to delay this bill any longer. That has already happened. It has already been delayed. As I said, we want to pass financial services modernization this year, and perhaps even this week. So the choice for the Senate is clear. It is partisan brinkmanship, or bipartisan accomplishment. 
   We stand ready on this side of the aisle to deliver a bill that the President can sign. He has cited four serious flaws in S. 900 which he has said will force him to veto the bill. Our substitute corrects all four flaws. 
   First and foremost, our substitute does not gut CRA--the Community Reinvestment Act--as S. 900 does. The CRA has proven a huge success in expanding access to credit and investment in low- and moderate-income communities. Investment capital is the lifeblood of these communities. That capital must continue to be available to qualified borrowers in all communities. We cannot draw red lines around the American dream. Democrats will not support a bill that undermines the effectiveness of the CRA. 
   The second major difference between our substitute and the underlying bill is the way the two proposals deal with the separation of banking and commerce. 
   For nearly 70 years, since the collapse of the banking industry during the Great Depression, U.S. law has separated banking from other commercial activities. An army of experts--from Chairman Greenspan to Secretary Rubin to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker--believe that separation must be maintained. 
   But you don't have to look in the history books to understand why mixing banking and other commercial activities is risky business. Look at the recent currency crisis that started in Asia and spread to some of our Latin American neighbors. If anything, the globalization of our economy makes a reasonable separation between banking and other commercial activities even more important now than it was when those laws were first enacted. 
   Unfortunately, as the distinguished Senator from Maryland has observed, the underlying bill weakens the separation of banking and commerce in a number of ways. Our alternative does not. It reflects the careful compromises developed last year. It preserves the separation between banks and other commercial activities without in any way limiting the flexibility financial service companies need in today's economy. It strikes the right balance between opportunity and responsibility. 
   Let me interject here that, should our substitute fail, my colleague from South Dakota, Senator JOHNSON, intends to offer a related amendment. It would close a loophole which commercial companies currently use to mix banking and commerce by acquiring existing unitary thrift holding companies. I will strongly support his effort. 
   A third difference between our substitute and S. 900 has to do with consumer protection. H.R. 10--the bill the Banking Committee passed out last year with overwhelming support--included a number of consumer protections having to do with such 
   things as risk disclosure and licensing of personnel. Those protections were essential for its passage last year. They remain essential to the American people. They have all been stripped out of the underlying bill--every one of them. They are all included in the Democratic alternative. They must be included in any financial services bill this Congress passes, or the President will veto it. 
   There is a fourth way in which our bill differs from both the committee bill and from last year's bill. It involves what financial activities can take place in subsidiaries of banks, and under what conditions. 
   As the legislative process has progressed, the Treasury Department has agreed to significant additional safeguards regarding the financial activities of banks' operating subsidiaries. Our alternative incorporates these safeguards. At the same time, it would permit banks to structure certain new activities in these so-called ``op-subs'' as they see fit. Again, it balances opportunity and responsibility. 
   Mr. President, that is where we stand--the juncture of two tracks: The veto track, and the enactment track.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to compensate the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for losses the tribe suffered when the Oahe dam was constructed in central South Dakota and over 100,000 acres of tribal land was flooded. Its passage will help the tribe rebuild their infrastructure and their economy, which was seriously crippled by the Oahe project during the 1950s. It is extraordinary that it has taken four decades to reach this point. The importance of passing this long-overdue legislation as soon as possible cannot be stated too strongly. 
   This legislation was developed with the assistance of Chairman Gregg  Bourland and Council Member Louis Dubray of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Both men have worked tirelessly to bring us to this point and I am grateful for their assistance. This legislation represents one element of their progressive vision for providing the members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe with greater opportunities for economic development and to fulfill the debts owned to the tribe by the federal government. 
   The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is the companion bill to the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act, which passed by unanimous consent in November of 1997, and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act of 1996, which passed the Congress unanimously in 1996. 
   The bill is based on an extensive analysis of the imp[act of the Pick-Sloan Dam Projects on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe which was performed by the Robert McLaughlin Company. The McLaughlin report was reviewed by the General Accounting Office, which found that the losses suffered by the tribe justify the establishment of a $290 million trust fund, which is the amount called for in this legislation. 
   It represents an important step in our continuing effort to fairly compensate the tribes of South Dakota for the sacrifices they made decades ago for the construction of the dams along the Missouri River and will further the goal of improving the lives of Native Americans living on those reservations. 
   To fully appreciate the need for this legislation, it is important for the committee to understand the historic events that are prologue to its development. The Oahe dam was constructed in South Dakota pursuant to the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. 887) of 1944. That legislation authorized implementation of the Missouri River Basin Pick-Sloan Plan for water development and flood control for downstream states. 
   The Oahe dam flooded 104,000 acres of tribal land, forcing the relocation of roughly 30 percent of the tribe's population, including four entire communities. Equally as important, the tribe lost 80 percent of 
   its fertile river bottom lands--lands that represented the basis for the tribal economy. Prior to the flooding, the tribe relied on these lands for firewood and building material, game wild fruits and berries, as well as cover from the severe storms that characterize winters in South Dakota and shelter from the heat of the prairie summer. Indian ranchers no longer had places to shelter their cattle in the wintertime, causing a significant loss in the value of their operations. 
   The loss of these important river bottom lands can be felt today. During the extreme winter of 1996-1997, the tribe lost roughly 30,000 head of livestock, including 25,000 head of cattle. Without adequate natural shelter, the remaining Indian ranchers along this stretch of river can expect to continue to have difficulty scratching out a living in future years when the winter turns particularly hard. 
   Mr. President, the damage caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched every aspect of life on the Cheyenne River reservation. Ninety percent of the timber on the reservation was wiped out, causing shortages of building material and firewood. Wildlife, once abundant in the river bottom, became more scarce. The entire lifestyle of the tribe changed as it was forced to relocate much of its people from the lush river bottom lands to the windswept prairie. 
   Most Americans, if not all, are familiar with the many broken promises of the United States Government to Native Americans during the 1800's. For Indian tribes located along the Missouri River in the state of South Dakota, the United States Government still has not met its responsibilities for compensation for losses suffered as a result of the construction of the Pick-Sloan dams. This proposed legislation is intended to correct that situation as it applies to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. 
   We cannot, of course, remake the lost lands and return the tribe to its former existence. We can, however, help provide the resources necessary to the tribe to improve the infrastructure on the Cheyenne River reservation. This, in turn, will enhance opportunities for economic development which will benefit all members of the tribe. Perhaps most importantly, it will fulfill part of our commitment to improve the lives of Native Americans--in this case the Cheyenne River Sioux.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leadership time to conclude this debate with a few comments of my own. 
   Let me begin by commending the authors of this resolution, Senator MCCAIN, Senator BIDEN, and others. I support their intent, and I appreciate the effort of all the authors in making this resolution the focus of our attention this morning. 
   There ought to be three rules this country should always adhere to in an addressing an international conflict. The first rule is that every effort should be made to resolve the matter diplomatically. I believe this is being done in the case of the conflict in Kosovo. In this struggle, there is no end to the lengths the United States and NATO have gone in an effort to resolve this matter diplomatically. As we speak, diplomatic efforts are underway. There will continue to be negotiations, discussions, and communications to resolve this matter diplomatically. Up to now all these efforts have failed. 
   Secondly, should diplomacy fail and U.S. forces be needed, we must not tie the hands of the Commander-in-Chief. We must provide whatever support is requested. That is what this resolution says: that the President is authorized to use all necessary force. I understand and support that concept. 
   Thirdly, we must support our troops when they come home--something we haven't always done. We didn't in Vietnam when they were suffering from the effects of exposure to Agent Orange; we didn't in the Persian Gulf when they were hit by Persian Gulf Syndrome. We have not always supported our troops when they come home. Veterans and the Veterans' Administration oftentimes are neglected in times of peace. 
   There is a caveat, an obvious caveat, to these three rules. When deploying force, there must be a clear indication of need. Only in the rarest of circumstances when it comes to executing a war, a military effort, should the Congress get ahead of the Commander in Chief and his military advisers. That is especially true when the United States is involved, as it is today in Yugoslavia, with other nations. They are the ones--the military, the Commander in Chief--who must decide  what kind of forces are to be used, what kind of war is to be waged, what facts must be considered in waging it successfully. 
   The distinguished Senator from Arizona made some comments about the President's unwillingness to use ground troops. It isn't just the President. It is all of his Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is everybody in the Pentagon who advises the President who has said, This is not the time; we do not want to commit ground troops at this point, Mr. President; don't request them. And he has not. 
   It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I reluctantly join in tabling this resolution today. I do so for three reasons. First, as I have just noted, the President has not asked for this authority, nor have his military advisers. They have indicated they don't support the inclusion of ground troops at this time. Why? Because the air campaign is working. That is not what some of the media want you to hear, but it is the case that the air campaign is working. The resolve on the part of Yugoslavia is being tested. And, I must say, there is increasing evidence that their resolve is weakening. There is increasing evidence that, regardless of what criteria one uses to evaluate the success of the air campaign, it is working. 
   Until we have given every opportunity for the air campaign to work, moving to a new strategy is premature. The time involved, the logistics involved, the questions involved in moving forces into Yugoslavia all have to be considered, but not now. This is not the time. Will there come a time? Perhaps. But it is not now. The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously endorse that position--not now. What is the Commander in Chief supposed to do? He 
   listens to his military advisers and they say, ``Not now.'' He listens to his national security people and they say, ``Not now.'' 
   This isn't a matter of courage, this isn't a matter of a lack of resolve on the part of the President. Instead, it is a matter of the President working with all the people in this administration to pick the best course of action. I believe he has done so. 
   Secondly, we must keep one thing in mind about this effort. This is not unilateral. We are involved with 18 other nations, most of whom oppose changing NATO's current air campaign strategy. If all necessary force implies using ground troops, they oppose taking a different course of action. This is a test for NATO. We should all recognize that. If we truly want NATO to succeed, we have no choice, no choice but to make all decisions involving strategy in concert with our NATO allies. 
   For Members today to say we are going to assert that our position calls for a change in strategy, that the air war alone is not working, sends a clear message to all the other NATO countries that we are the ones in charge, we are the only ones making this decision; we don't care what you think, we are not going to resolve this matter in concert with you; it is going to be us; we will call the shots. 
   We are not prepared to do that today, Mr. President. 
   Thirdly, because this authority has not been requested either by the President or his military advisers or by NATO, we have no clear idea what it is we are authorizing with this resolution. Because the President hasn't made a specific proposal, are we voting to use tactical nuclear weapons? Are we committing 500,000 troops for 5 years? Are we committing ourselves to an invasion of neighboring countries, should that be necessary? The answer to these questions, of course, is no. They are extreme options which no one would dare suggest. But what are we authorizing with this resolution? Without a specific proposal from the President, we can only guess. By guessing, we do a disservice to our mission. By guessing, we relegate too much discretion to others. 
   Mr. President, an up-or-down vote on this resolution is premature. There may be a time when it will be required. That time must be determined by the Commander in Chief and our NATO allies. If or when that time comes, it is the responsibility of the Congress to do what we must do and what we have done on many occasions in the past: We must debate it and we must vote on a resolution of approval. Until then, the Senate has spoken on this conflict. On a bipartisan vote, we have given our approval to the air campaign. We have no need to do so again. 
   So I ask my colleagues, let us be patient. Let us support our military as they fight so valiantly and successfully in the air mission. Let us send a clear message to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and to NATO: We will not terminate the air war until we are successful. 
   I might note another bit of evidence of our success occurred just this morning. There are reports that a NATO F-16 fighter jet shot down a Serb Mig29. The air war is working. We will keep the pressure on. We will not look the other way when victims of ethnic cleansing look to us. 
   A vote on this motion to table this resolution is a vote to postpone the decision to alter our military course in Yugoslavia. It is a vote to support our military in their efforts to bring peace to this region. I urge our colleagues to support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate today the names of the 7 young men and women who have been selected to receive the 1999 American Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal. This award is the highest honor given to members of the school safety patrol. 
   There are roughly 500,000 members of the school safety patrol in this country, helping over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young people ensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, and back home in the afternoon. 
   Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But, on occasion, these volunteers must make split-second decisions, placing themselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. The heroic actions of this year's honorees exemplify this selflessness, and richly deserve recognition. 
   The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Rochester, New York. 
   On September 22, 1998, 11-year-old Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School Safety Patrol Katherine Garcia was at her post in the back parking lot. She was helping create order out of the chaos that occurs when buses, walkers and parents all try to leave the school at the same time. 
   Behind her post, a 9-year-old boy and his 7-year-old friend separated from his grandmother to look for their car. They tried to run past Katherine. As they did, she quickly reached out, grabbed the boys by their t-shirts, and pulled them out of the path of an oncoming car. 
   This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Brooklyn, New York. 
   On January 5, 1999, an 8-year-old student asked Public School 151 Safety Patrol Anthony Christian, Jr. if he would walk him across the street. 
   Leaving his post in the hands of his patrol partner, Anthony carefully checked the traffic signal and crossed the street. Just as they reached the other corner, two cars collided at high speed in the middle of the intersection. One of the cars spun out of control, heading directly for the two boys. Without regard for his own safety, Anthony pulled the little boy out of the way just before the car jumped the curb where the two boys were. 
   The third AAA Lifesaving Medal winner comes from Unadilla, New York. 
   On October 8, 1997, Unadilla Elementary School Safety Patrol Nichole L. Decker was at her post at the school's back door when she heard a 7-year-old boy's desperate cries for help. 
   When she went outside, she saw the boy trapped on the ground by a huge dog--a husky/wolf mix. The dog was biting at the little boy's face and throat. Without considering what the 50-pound dog could do to her, 13-year-old Nichole began shouting and waving her arms to distract it from the boy. When the dog ran away, Nichole scooped up the badly bleeding boy and took him inside the school for help. 
   The fourth recipient of the AAA Lifesaving Medal comes from Brooklyn, New York. 
   On January 28, 1999, 10-year-old Public School 91 Safety Patrol Stacia Walker saw a car drop off a 5-year-old boy at school, then depart. 
   Instead of entering the schoolyard, the little boy turned around and headed for a park across the street, Stacia ran to the little boy and stopped him just before he crossed the street in front of a car. 
   This year's fifth AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. 
   On September 2, 1998, 12-year-old Ganiard Elementary School Safety Patrol Michael T. Wiltsie was helping the adult crossing guard at the corner of Broadway and Adams streets, the busiest corner for patrols. 
   The adult crossing guard had just walked to the center of the street to stop traffic when a 7-year-old boy walked around Michael's outstretched arms to follow her. A truck made a left-hand turn and passed between the adult crossing guard and Michael's post on the curb, ignoring the stop sign held by the adult crossing guard. Michael reached out, grabbed the 7-year-old boy by the backpack, and pulled him to safety just as the truck sped by. 
   The fifth recipient of the AAA Lifesaving Medal comes from Fairfax, Virginia. 
   On February 22, 1999, Fairhill Elementary School Safety Patrol Roxanne A. Bauland (BALL-lund) was standing at her post near a bus stop when she noticed there was something wrong with a 6-year-old girl approaching the bus stop from across the street. 
   When the little girl began running toward the bus stop, the hard candy she had been eating became lodged in her throat, causing her to cough and choke. Quickly sizing up the situation, 11-year-old Roxanne performed the  Heimlich maneuver on the little girl and dislodged the candy from her throat, quite possible saving the little girl's life. 
   The final AAA School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Award recipient comes from Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
   On November 2, 1998, 11-year-old Jenny Lind Community School Safety Patrol Tonya L. M. Boner was completing her shift for the day when she decided to wait a little longer to help some stragglers cross the street safely. 
   Three students, ages 7, 9, and 10, began to cross the road. Across the intersection, a car stopped briefly at the stop sign, then headed straight for the crosswalk and the students. Seeing the immediate danger, Tonya hurried the students to the other side just as the car sped through the crosswalk a mere 2 feet from where she and the students had been walking seconds before. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I extend congratulations and thanks to these young women and men who are visiting the Capitol today. They are an asset to their communities, and their families and neighbors should be very proud of their courage and dedication. 
   I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association for providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety patrol on duty nationwide. 
   Since the 1920's, AAA clubs across the country have been sponsoring student safety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against traffic accidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange safety belt and shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the very best of their schools and communities. Experts credit school safety patrol programs with helping to lower the number of traffic accidents and fatalities involving young children. 
   We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that our Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound. 
   And we owe our thanks to these exceptional young men and women for their selfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed deserves the praise and recognition of their schools, their communities and the Nation.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am disappointed with the announcement just made by the majority leader. I think, as others have already indicated, that we have made extraordinary progress in the last couple of days. That would not have happened without Senator DODD, Senator WYDEN, Senator KERRY, Senator MCCAIN, and a number of other Senators who have been very involved in bringing us to this point. 
   I am disappointed, as well, that there was an objection to returning to the Y2K bill, because we were making real progress toward improving the bill. I believe that negotiations have delivered progress, even though more improvements will be needed. I support proceeding back to the Y2K bill. I support keeping the negotiations going. I want a bill. I think we will get a bill. I think it is important we get a bill.  
   I also think, however, that there were unfortunate decisions made by the majority about how we consider legislation on the floor. We are negotiating all of this off the floor. I would much prefer to have a good debate and offer amendments. The amendment tree is filled. We are not able to offer a Democratic amendment--relevant or not relevant. So we are relegated to negotiating off the floor. And we are making progress even in that context. I only wish we would recognize in this Chamber all the rich tradition of debate in the Senate and we would have the opportunity to offer amendments and debate them, dispose of them, and move on. 
   Senator MCCAIN has suggested that. So I am not necessarily accusing the manager of any effort to keep us from having those amendments. But I will say this. We will not be gagged when it comes to our ability to offer amendments. It is religion. And it ought to be religion on both sides. It is a fundamental question about fairness, about rights, and about any one Senator's opportunity to participate fully in the debate and consideration of any important legislation. 
   So I am frustrated that the tree is full. I am frustrated that we are not able to move this process forward in the normal, open process under which we should consider any bill, especially this one. But I am also hopeful that we will come to some resolution. I am hopeful that we will find compromise. I know we will pass this legislation before long. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just want to ask unanimous consent that a list of amendments in the 103rd Congress--the last Congress, of course, that the Democrats were in the majority was the 103rd Congress. I would be remiss if I did not submit for the RECORD right now a list of amendments that were not relevant that were offered by Republicans to legislation during the 103rd Congress. There were at least 19 nonrelevant amendments offered, and this may not be the complete list. We may update this as time goes on. 
   This issue of relevancy is interesting because it was never an issue in the 103rd Congress. Nonrelevant amendments were added. That list details a number of things. In fact, the manager of the bill today, Senator MCCAIN, had a nonrelevant amendment on the motor voter bill that would have allowed certain rescission authority on the part of the President. The Senator from Arizona also offered a nonrelevant amendment to the unemployment compensation bill in December, 1993. The amendment was to eliminate the Social Security earnings test. 
   The ability to offer nonrelevant amendments has been part of the consideration and deliberation of legislation here in the Senate for every Congress, including the 103rd Congress when we were in the majority.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to comment on developments over the last couple of days in particular, and the vote that we just had specifically. There are two issues here. I want to touch on both of them. 
   The first issue has to do with our desire to reach some accommodation, some agreement on Y2K. I have said it publicly and privately, I think this is a serious issue. I believe there is a way with which to resolve this matter. But I don't think it does any of us any good, or the industry any good, or our country any good to pass a bill out of the Senate knowing it will be vetoed. I don't know why we would do that. 
   I have heard the argument, ``Well, we can clean it up in conference.'' Mr. President, I don't know why we don't clean it up here. We have as clear a letter as any I have ever seen from this administration which says the current draft will be vetoed. I don't know how you get any more definitive than this. 
   If we were serious--and I really believe that there are a number of serious and well-intentioned Senators who want to see this resolved--I think this is the test of seriousness, because I believe that the Senators who truly want to see an accomplishment rather than an issue will take this letter seriously. 
   I am very hopeful that in the not too distant future we will see some final agreement that will allow us to vote on an overwhelming basis on this issue. I want to support it. Most of us will support it.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Oregon. 
   Mr. President, there are a number of people--Senator WYDEN, Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator EDWARDS, Senator DODD, Senator KERRY, Senator ROBB--as the Senator has noted, who deserve great credit for moving this process along. There are a number of Senators who are actively engaged in an effort to bring this matter to closure. I am very hopeful we can do that. 
   Let me talk about the second matter, the procedural question. Senator KENNEDY offered an amendment, as is his right, through the recommittal motion simply because he has no other recourse. This is illustrative of an array of frustrations the Democratic Caucus has about the procedure used in each and every instance in which a bill has come to the floor this session of Congress. This is the 28th of April and we have yet to have one amendable vehicle on the Senate floor. 
   I have a great deal of affection for the majority leader, but I must say, I think he should have run for Speaker because I really believe he would be more comfortable as Speaker. I have said that to him, and I think he would acknowledge he would much rather have a Rules Committee in the Senate than the current rules. When I become majority leader, maybe I will have that same feeling. 
   However, in the Senate, we have always prided ourselves on open, free debate. We lay a bill down, offer amendments, have tabling motions, have second-degree amendments, and we have a debate. We call ourselves the most deliberative body in the United States, if not in the world, and I believe we have a right to that distinction. How can we be deliberative when every time we bring a bill to the floor, we fill the parliamentary tree, denying anybody a right to offer an amendment? 
   There is a pent-up frustration and a pent-up pressure to have the opportunity to vote, to have the opportunity to offer amendments on key questions. This happened to be the minimum wage. The distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts said he will pull the amendment if we can reach some agreement, if we can get some final solution here in solving the problem of Y2K. If we can solve it and if we can reach agreement, he will pull this amendment. He made that request and that offer. That is more than I get on many occasions. I have to thank the Senator for that. 
   However, we will continue to see as many challenges and as many significant breakdowns in the effort to reach, with some comity, a solution procedurally and a solution substantively of the issues we want to address in the Senate as long as we fill the tree on each and every occasion. 
   We just did the Social Security lockbox. What happened? The majority leader filled the tree and, in filling the tree, once again denied the minority the right to offer even a single amendment. 
   I am very hopeful we can resolve this matter, but the way to resolve it is to do what we are supposed to do, to do what we are paid to do around here. We come to the Senate with ideas. We come to the Senate with a bona fide appreciation of the differences of opinion that exist in the Chamber, even within our own caucuses. I am exasperated, frustrated, mystified that here in the Senate we are not allowed an opportunity to have a free and open debate. If amendments are undesirable, table the amendments; if the amendments can be improved, improve them with 
   a second-degree. But to deny Democratic Senators--and even Republican Senators, for that matter--the chance to amend a bill is not acceptable. 
   I am hopeful we can find a way to resolve this. If we can't, I will put the Senate on notice that we will use other recourses if we have to. I don't want to have to do that. However, there are ways to respond, to reciprocate, if we are going to be gagged. Committees are meeting with our approval; we don't have to do that. There is an array of other tools we can use to demonstrate our frustration, and we will resort to those if we have to. 
   I hope we can come to a point where we don't have to do this. We can take up issues that are offered in good faith, debate them, amend them, dispose of them. We can do that on Y2K as we are doing today. We can do that on a lot of other issues, and we must.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I do not have the statistics the majority leader referred to. The majority leader showed me the list of occasions when filling the tree was something that Democrats resorted to when we were in the majority. We go back to 1977 to find the first time, and we have only used it, according to his own list, on a handful of occasions since 1977. Over the last 20 years, Democrats may have used this procedure 5 times--5 times in 20 years. 
   This procedure has been used five times in 1999. We will have a lot more to say about the extraordinary utilization of this concept of filling the tree and how undemocratic and unfair it is to the process and to the institution itself. We have to find a way to fix it.

   Mr. DASCHLE. We have created a Rules Committee of one. I think it is unfortunate. They have a Rules Committee in the House. Constitutionally, the House was designed differently than we are. We don't need a Rules Committee in the Senate. 
   Somebody made the comment, I think it was the distinguished assistant Democratic leader, the reason our Senate is so family friendly is that we are not doing anything. If we did something, maybe we would not be so family friendly. 
   I think it is time we do something, we try to resolve these matters. Let's move on and allow Senators the opportunity to express themselves in amendments.

   Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California raises a very good question. Absolutely, our purpose is to present our agenda. That is why we are here. 
   That does not mean to the exclusion of the Republican agenda. Obviously, we ought to have a good debate about both agendas. But you need that debate. You need that opportunity. How do you have that debate? Not just by talking but by offering legislative proposals: the minimum wages, Patients' Bill of Rights, school construction, Social Security, Medicare reform. Those are the things we are here to vote on and work on, and we need the opportunity to do that. 
   We can do it the easy way or the hard way. We can do it by allowing amendments and having a good debate, by having some agreement about what the schedule will be, or we can force these issues by offering amendments and by having to defeat cloture and by doing all the procedural things we have had to do now for so long. By the time we set aside all the procedural time we have spent, we could have had a good debate on the minimum wage or the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The majority leader has said we will bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. He just said we will bring up minimum wage. He has now said we will bring up juvenile justice. So we are making progress. But I think the time has come to drop this procedural stampede that we find every time on the part of the majority when we want to offer amendments. We have to quit trying to steamroll these bills without offering due opportunity to all Members to offer amendments. 
   I know the Senators from Massachusetts and Arizona are waiting to speak, and I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is an old saying heard quite often in the midwest and perhaps other parts of the country as well. The saying is ``what you see is what you get.'' The adage is as simple as it is straightforward. It's a way of letting another person know there will be no surprises--good or bad--associated with the person or object in question. Things are pretty much as they appear. 
   Unfortunately, the proponents of this legislation, the so-called ``Social Security Surplus Preservation And Debt Reduction Act,'' do not subscribe to this plainspoken logic. In fact, quite the contrary. What you see when you examine their language is quite different from what you get when you listen to their rhetoric. They argue they are preserving Social Security. Their own bill language says otherwise. They argue they are reducing the public debt. Again, their bill language betrays them. And finally, they argue they have created a sound mechanism to lock away Social Security. The Treasury Department tells us differently. Mr. President, if votes on this bill are based on what people see and not on what they would actually get, I am confident this measure will be defeated. I strongly recommend that course of action. 
   Let me state at this time that I and every member of the Democratic caucus totally support the objectives expressed by this bill's authors. We must ensure that every dollar of Social Security taxes is dedicated solely and exclusively to Social Security benefits. I have joined with Democrats to fight for this principle earlier this year on the budget resolution. Furthermore, Democrats advocate taking an additional step. We feel Medicare also faces grave challenges and will need additional resources to ensure that radical reform is not necessary. The Democratic alternative to the bill before us today locks away every dollar of Social Security and helps Medicare. It does so in a secure manner that will not threaten the fiscal stability of this country. 
   Unless there is a change in the current procedural situation, Democrats will be precluded from getting a vote on our proposal at this time. If the proponents of this legislation were truly interested in a serious, substantive debate on how to protect Social Security and Medicare, they would not, as a first step, seek to limit Senators' rights to offer amendments. There is only one reason you would stack the deck in this manner on such an important bill before the Senate could even begin debating the merits of the legislation. That reason is partisan politics. The proponents of this bill have decided they would rather play politics with this issue than work together to produce good policy. Only by voting against cloture will Senators be allowed to work their will and offer improvements or substitutes to the Republican bill. 
   I would like to spend a few moments discussing my concerns about the specifics of the Republican bill. To do that, I must take a brief look back. Earlier this year, we witnessed an event that many members of Congress, indeed many Americans, never thought we would see in our lifetimes. After decades of deficits and trillions of debt, the Congressional Budget Office issued its fiscal report projecting budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. According to CBO, surpluses would total $2.6 trillion, including $787 billion in non-Social Security surpluses. Over 15 years, these totals would reach $4.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion, respectively. Democrats proposed on the budget resolution last month that we lock away every penny of the $2.8 trillion Social Security surplus and set aside close to $700 billion of the remaining surplus to keep our commitments to Medicare. Republicans opposed this approach then, and their actions today indicate they have not changed their minds. A $4.6 trillion surplus and the Republicans continue to say nothing for Medicare. Not a dollar. Not a dime. 
   This attitude might be somewhat easier to explain if the Republican bill truly set aside the $2.8 trillion in surplus Social Security taxes for Social Security benefits. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the title of the bill notwithstanding, the Republican proposal fails to preserve Social Security taxes for Social Security benefits. What is the basis for my assertion? Take a look at page 16 of the Republican bill. This page contains language that all Social Security taxes will be set aside unless Congress enacts ``Social Security Reform Legislation.'' And what is ``Social Security Reform Legislation''? Reading from the Republican bill, ``[it]  means a bill or joint resolution that is enacted into law and includes a provision stating the following: Social Security Reform Legislation. For the purposes of the Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act, this act constitutes Social Security reform legislation.'' 
   In other words, Social Security Reform is anything a majority of Congress says it is. And, once declared, this same majority can spend Social Security taxes on anything they choose. Far from setting aside Social Security taxes for Social Security and paying off the national debt, this language allows its supporters to use these proceeds to bankroll tax cuts or other spending programs--hardly a sound means for preserving Social Security or reducing the federal debt. If you are serious about protecting Social Security taxes for Social Security benefits, this is not the bill for you. If you think we should lock in debt reduction, this bill falls short. In light of this huge loophole, it is Orwellian for Republicans to entitle their bill the Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act. 
   My third criticism of this bill centers on the impact its enactment would have on the full faith and credit of the United States government and our economy. This bill creates new statutory limits on debt held by the public. By linking enforcement of its provisions to the publicly held debt ceiling, the Secretary of the Treasury has concluded, ``this provision could preclude the United States from meeting its financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to make benefit payments--including Social Security checks--and could also worsen a future economic downturn.'' In spite of the alterations made to the original version of this bill, the Treasury Secretary has wisely concluded the bill still puts at risk the creditworthiness of the federal government, the U.S. economy, and indeed, Social Security itself. Not surprisingly, Secretary Rubin recommends that the President veto this bill. 
   Now the proponents of this bill have challenged the statement that enactment of their bill could threaten Social Security payments. They point to section 203 of their bill. This section purports to protect Social Security benefits by asking the Secretary of the Treasury to give priority to the payment of Social Security benefits if Treasury funds are running low. Secretary Rubin has looked at this provision very carefully. His conclusion? ``The act does not guarantee that Social Security benefits will be paid as scheduled in the event that the debt ceiling were reached......We do not believe that prioritizing payments by program is a sound way to approach the government's affairs. In addition, this act does not indicate how this complex prioritization process should be implemented, no system currently exists to do so, and any such system would be impractical.'' 
   Mr. President, clearly the bill before us is fatally flawed. In spite of the desires and remarks of its supporters, the Social Surplus Preservation And Debt Reduction Act actually accomplishes neither. Social Security is not truly preserved, and debt reduction is by no means guaranteed. Ideally, Senators would be able to offer amendments to improve this bill and accomplish the stated objectives of its supporters. Unfortunately, that choice is not currently before the Senate. Instead, we are being asked to cut off debate before it has even begun. This is an option we can afford to pass up. I ask that my colleagues oppose cloture.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are approaching the tenth anniversary of the birth of the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program. This initiative, enacted in 1990 as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments, established strict fuel quality standards for the nation's most polluted cities in order to reduce air pollution. It includes a minimum oxygen content requirement, which was intended to provide an opportunity for America to reduce its dependence on foreign oil through the use of domestically produced ethanol and MTBE. 
   Reformulated gasoline was introduced in the American marketplace in 1995. Today it accounts for approximately one-third of all gasoline sold in this country. 
   Congress had several objectives in establishing the RFG program: (1) to substantially reduce harmful air pollutants caused by fuel-related emissions, especially ground level ozone and air toxics; (2) to reduce imports of crude oil and petroleum products, especially those from unstable regions like the Middle East; and (3) to stimulate investment in domestic ethanol and ether plants, thus creating jobs and adding value to grains and other domestic raw materials. 
   The first objective has been not only met, it has been exceeded. In fact, EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called the RFG program ``the most successful air pollution reduction program since the phase-out of lead in gasoline.'' The other two objectives also have been met, though not to the extent that many of us had hoped. 
   A major impediment to full realization of the potential of the RFG program has been the importation of massive volumes of MTBE, much of it subsidized by the Saudi Arabian government, into the United States. Domestic ethanol and MTBE producers have been harmed, and American plants have not been built, largely due to the influx of subsidized product from offshore that makes potential investors unwilling to commit capital to U.S. ethanol and ether plants. 
   The winners in this situation are the Saudi government and a few multi-national corporations. The losers are U.S. corn farmers, butane suppliers and plant workers as well as American consumers who remain potential hostages to foreign energy suppliers. 
   Mr. President, the benefits of the RFG program have been substantial. However, as we prepare to enter Phase II of the program, it is incumbent upon policymakers to reflect upon whether it is achieving its potential in terms of air quality improvements and oil import reductions. 
   It seems clear that the answer to the first question is ``yes.'' RFG is generating substantial air quality benefits and even exceeding the predictions that many had made when the original rules were written. 
   The answer to the second question, however, is a resounding ``no.'' Imports of Saudi Arabian MTBE are growing, and the exclusionary effect of unfairly traded MTBE imports on ethanol usage in key markets such as California has become increasingly problematic. 
   On April 1, 1999, the International Trade Commission (ITC) held a public hearing on its Investigation No. 332-404, concerning MTBE imports and their impact on the domestic oxygenate industry. This inquiry is timely and important. It will cut through the rhetoric, provide policymakers with a clear picture of the nature and effect of MTBE imports on domestic production and U.S. energy security, and set a factual foundation for discussion of what, if anything, should be done about this situation. 
   With those objectives in mind, I commend to my colleagues attention the testimony presented before the ITC by Bob Dinneen, Legislative Director of the Renewable Fuels Association, and Todd Sneller, Executive Director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board, that underscores the damage that has been done by unfairly traded MTBE imports. Mr. Dinneen and Mr. Sneller present cogent analyses of the impact that increasing volumes of heavily subsidized MTBE are having on the domestic oxygenates industry. Their testimony should be a warning to us all.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicaid Nursing Incentive Act, a bill to provide direct Medicaid reimbursement for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. 
   This legislation eliminates a counterproductive Medicaid payment policy. Under current law, State Medicaid programs may exclude certified nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists from Medicaid reimbursement, even though these practitioners are fully trained to provide many of the same services as those provided by primary care physicians. This policy is both discriminatory and shortsighted; it severs a critical access link for Medicaid beneficiaries. 
   The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance the availability of cost-effective primary care to our nation's most vulnerable citizens. 
   Studies have documented the fact that millions of Americans each year go without the health care services they need, because physicians simply are not available to care for them. This problem plagues rural and urban areas alike, in parts of the country as diverse as south central Los Angeles and Lemmon, South Dakota. 
   Medicaid beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable, since in recent years an increasing number of health professionals have chosen not to care for them or have been unwilling to locate in the inner-city and rural communities where many beneficiaries live. Fortunately, there is an exception to the trend: nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists frequently accept patients whom others will not treat and serve in areas where others refuse to work. 
   Studies have shown that nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists provide quality, cost-effective care. Their advanced clinical training enables them to assume responsibility for up to 80 percent of the primary care services usually performed by physicians, often at a lower cost and with a high level of patient satisfaction. 
   Congress has already recognized the expanding contributions of nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. For more than a decade, CHAMPUS has provided direct payment to nurse practitioners. In 1990, Congress mandated direct payment for nurse practitioner services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. The Medicare program, which already covered nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialist services in rural areas, was modified under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to provide coverage for these services in all geographic areas. The bill I am introducing today establishes the same payment policy under Medicaid.  
   Mr. President, the ramifications of this issue extend beyond the Medicaid program and its beneficiaries. There is a broader lesson here that applies to our effort to make cost-effective, high-quality health care services available and accessible to all Americans. 
   One of the cornerstones of this kind of care is the expansion of primary and preventive care, delivered to individuals in convenient, familiar places where they live, work, and go to school. More than 2 million of our nation's nurses currently provide care in these sites--in home health agencies, nursing homes, ambulatory care clinics, and schools. In places like South Dakota, nurses are often the only health care professionals available in the small towns and rural counties across the state. 
   These nurses and other nonphysician health professionals play an important role in the delivery of care. And this role will only increase as we move from a system that focuses on the costly treatment of illness to one that emphasizes primary preventive care and health promotion. 
   But, first, we must reevaluate outdated attitudes and break down barriers that prevent nurses from using the full range of their training and skills in caring for patients. In 1994, the Pew Health Professions Commission concluded that nurse practitioners are not being fully utilized to deliver primary care services. The commission recommended eliminating fiscal discrimination by paying nurse practitioners directly for the services they provide. This step will help nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists expand access to the primary care that so many communities currently lack. 
   As I have worked on access and reimbursement issues related to nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists, I have encountered two related issues I would also like to highlight. 
   Later this month, I plan to introduce legislation to increase the reimbursement rate for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists who practice in rural and underserved areas. Currently, physicians who serve in a health professional shortage area receive a 10 percent boost in their Medicare payment as an incentive to provide services in the regions that need them the most. As we know, nurses are already providing critical primary and preventive care in these areas and deserve the bonus payments that physicians are already receiving. 
   I would also encourage my colleagues to closely monitor the impact of Medicaid managed care on access to care provided by nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. In some areas of the country, implementation of managed care has prevented patients from continuing to receive health care services from nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists because they are not listed as primary care providers or preferred providers. Advanced practice nurses provide cost-effective, local, quality care, and I am concerned about early reports that access to these professionals is being limited by new health delivery arrangements. We should certainly keep an eye on this issue as Medicaid managed care systems develop.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this morning we all have to return to business, but it is an especially difficult day to do so. 
   It is difficult to think of anything other than the terrible tragedy in Littleton, CO yesterday. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Columbine High School--the students and staff injured; the families of those who were killed; and everyone who suffered the terrifying ordeal there. 
   Our nation is suffering, too--at the thought that such horrifying events are taking place all too often in our country. 
   It was heartening to see so many parents reunited with their children yesterday. Still, those joyful hugs were bittersweet reminders of the families waiting for students and staff who didn't come home. 
   These families and the community of Littleton have lost their loved ones, and their lives will never be the same again. Their losses cannot be replaced. They, and everyone affected by yesterday's events, have lost their innocence, too. 
   We all want to believe that our schools will be places where children can learn in a safe, supportive environment, where they will learn not only what they need to go on to college or vocational school or work, but also what they need to become well-balanced, emotionally secure people. 
   Certainly schools cannot be expected to do the job by themselves. It does take a village to raise a child. 
   It takes, first and foremost, parents who love and respect and talk to and spend time with their children. Parents must be prepared to meet the daunting challenge of rearing children in a society that seems to move too fast. As important as schools are, parents are their children's first and most compelling teachers. Parents must realize that, even when they aren't conscious of it, they are teaching their children constantly. Their example is the most powerful teaching tool available, and it  can be used to constructive or destructive ends. Our children's values originate from their parents' values--those taught, and those exemplified, those that are negative and those that are positive. 
   It also takes a child care system that pays its workers more than the minimum wage. It takes schools that truly educate and do their best to give every student the attention he or she needs. It takes qualified teachers who value their students and, in turn, are valued by us. It takes friends and neighbors who get involved in supporting parents, schools, and children. It takes a juvenile justice system that protects society from violent criminals and strives to intervene in youthful offenders' lives before they are beyond our help. It takes a society that shows children the way without alienating them. 
   It takes all of us. 
   Our schools are populated by a talented, committed generation of young people. I am optimistic about our future, their future. It is a sad reality that just a few people can cause such great devastation--in our schools and on our streets. The problem is not our children--it is our failure to deal adequately with their needs. Too many of today's children face intense fear, anger, and confusion. They need our time and attention. They need us to teach them how to deal with those emotions in constructive ways. 
   Even children who have good values--and are good kids--face incredible emotional and societal challenges and pressures that most children of my generation never had to worry about. And they need our help. I never had to worry about assault weapons or pipe bombs when I went to school. I wasn't confronted with drug pushers. And I had two loving parents who were involved in my education and my life. 
   We can't go back in time, and we shouldn't undercut our basic freedoms. But we do have to work together--every one of us--to address the problems that threaten the fabric of our society. 
   We can--and should--have a thoughtful discussion about how to shape a comprehensive national response to the problem of violence in our schools and our communities. We should have that discussion soon. 
   But today is about grieving the loss of those killed, sending positive thoughts to those who were injured, and praying for everyone involved in this terrible tragedy.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is an unfortunate fact around here that budget resolutions are frequently seen as little more than meaningless manipulations of numbers. They are perceived by some to have no real impact on Congress and even less on the American people. Whether you agree or disagree with this perception of previous budget resolutions, I think we can all agree that the budget resolution before us is different. 
   What we have been debating and are about to vote on, is our nation's first budget of the 21st century. The FY 2000 budget resolution represents a blueprint for our future. The decisions made on this resolution could determine how we live--not just next year--but for a generation--maybe longer. 
   Before getting into the specifics of the budget proposals before us, let me say a few words about what a budget resolution should do. In my view, a budget resolution should be visionary. It should look at today's circumstances, assess where improvements are needed and apply the appropriate amount of resources. 
   A budget resolution must be fiscally responsible. Prior to 1993, previous Presidents and Congresses have frequently failed to live within their means. The result was large annual deficits and a $4 trillion national debt. Since 1993, we have reduced the deficits 7 years in a row. Future budget resolutions must continue this pattern. 
   A budget resolution must save money to keep promises we've already made. The federal government has legally binding commitments on Medicare, Social Security, child nutrition and student loans to name a few. A budget resolution must live up to the federal government's legal obligations in these areas. 
   Finally, Mr. President, a budget resolution must invest in the future--in things like education, transportation, technology, and health care--so we can pass the promise of America onto our children. 
   Unfortunately, the budget resolution before the Senate today does none of these things. This resolution is deceptive and fiscally irresponsible in the extreme. It claims to protect Social Security and Medicare. It claims to live within our means. In reality, this budget fails on both scores. It does not adequately lock away Social Security trust funds and fails to add any resources to Medicare. It also includes hundreds of billions of exploding tax cuts that are paid for with projected surpluses. There is a huge problem with this approach. The tax cuts come and keep on coming whether or not the surpluses ever appear. 
   This approach adopted by my Republican colleagues represents a radical departure from the policies that lifted America out of recession in the late 1980s and early 1990s and created the strongest economy in a generation. After a decade of massive deficits caused primarily by ballooning tax breaks, President Clinton and a then Democratic Congress embarked on a new path, a path that coupled spending cuts with targeted investments and tax cuts for working families. This budget abandons that successful approach and will return this country to the large deficits of the 1980s. 
   Even more distressing to me, if we follow this plan, we will squander the best opportunity--perhaps in our lifetimes--to keep our commitments on Medicare and Social Security and effectively deal with some of the most serious social and economic needs facing our country--now, before they become crises. 
   It is my impression that debate on this year's resolution has been short, indeed, perhaps the shortest in my memory. The reason may well be that there are not a lot of small details to debate. Instead, we face a single major question: What should we do with the $4.6 trillion in surpluses projected over next 15 years? Without a doubt, this is the most important fiscal decision confronted by Congress in generations. With this budget resolution we face real choices with real consequences. Every family, every business, in America will be profoundly affected by how we answer this one question. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican budget resolution conference agreement makes too many wrong choices. It is wrong on Social Security and Medicare. It is wrong on debt reduction. It is wrong on tax relief with its emphasis on tax breaks that favor the wealthiest over working families. It is wrong on education, health care, and other critical investments. Therefore, I've concluded this resolution is wrong for America. And I will vote against it. 
   I would like to say a few words about the choices we face in the future. However, first, I think it's important to take a brief look back. When President Clinton took office in 1993, the budget deficit was a whopping $290 billion--the highest level in this nation's history. And, it was projected to grow to more than $500 billion by this year. In that year, 1993, President and Democratic Congress--without a single Republican vote--took action; together we passed the largest deficit reduction package in our nation's history. 
   Our political opponents condemned our plan; they predicted economic ruin. They said it would destroy our economy and trigger a second Great Depression. Many who made those predictions are still here today. Many who bravely voted for our plan are not. They knew they were risking their careers when they voted for our plan. But they did it anyway, because they believed we could not continue the ruinous economic policies of past. 
   Today, the results of Democrats' 1993 economic plan should be clear to all. The deficit has declined 7 years in a row--the first time that's happened in our nation's history. Last year, this nation enjoyed the first unified balanced budget in 30 years. This year, we expect a $111 billion unified surplus. In addition, we are experiencing the strongest economy in a generation. Eighteen million new jobs have been created since 1993. We have the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 30 years--4.5 percent. We have the lowest core inflation rate in more than 2 decades--2.5 percent. We have witnessed a 2.5 percent rise in wages--the fastest growth in wages in more than 20 years. We are living during the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. Largely as a result of this string of economic good news, the Congressional Budget Office is now projecting budget surpluses for as long as the eye can see--a total of $4.6 trillion over the next 15 years. 
   So Mr. President, we faced the tough questions in 1993. The question facing Congress this year ought to be easy. Then the question was: how do we reduce the deficits? How do we get America working again. Now, the question is: what should we do with the surplus? How do we keep America working? 
   We've already proved tough decisions don't have to be cruel decisions. We can continue to make economic progress today, without sacrificing our economic future. With the plan we offered this year, Democrats balanced the budget--and cut taxes on working families--without gutting our investments in our children's education. We balanced the budget--and cut taxes on working families--without raiding Social Security and Medicare. We balanced the budget--and cut taxes on working families--without sacrificing our ability to protect our environment. We balanced the budget--and cut taxes on working families--without adding more Americans to the rolls of the uninsured. In fact, we found a way to help parents who work full-time, but don't have insurance, to provide health insurance for their children. 
   Our budget plan builds on our past success. We make tough decisions. But we also make smart decisions. We honor the commitments our nation made in the past, and we invest in the future. The Democratic vision for our fiscal future is based on 4 principles. First, we protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare. The Democratic plan locks away every penny of the $2.9 trillion Social Security surplus, plus an additional $700 billion for  Medicare. We are first to admit: our plan doesn't solve all the issues facing these two important programs. We know we also need to make structural reforms. But, by locking away every penny of Social Security and saving 15 percent of the unified surplus for Medicare, we can avoid a crisis--which dramatically reduces chance of having to make radical changes. 
   Second, our plan pays down the national debt. In 10 years, we can reduce our public debt from $3.5 trillion, to $1.6 billion. In 18 years, under our plan, we can eliminate the debt entirely. By 2018, America could be debt-free. Debt reduction keeps interest rates down. This means lower mortgage rates, lower rates on car loans, lower monthly credit card bills, and lower student loan bills. It also means more investments for businesses, more 
   economic growth, more jobs, and more opportunity for the future. 
   Third, our plan cuts taxes for America's working families. Our plan provides $400 billion in targeted tax relief to help families save for retirement and pay for child care. Our plan also includes a $1,000-a-year tax credit for elderly and disabled Americans who need long-term care--or the family members who provide that care. It cuts the marriage penalty tax. And, it provides tax credits for research and experimentation. 
   Fourth, our plan invests in America's future--over $400 billion in key priorities. These resources can be used to provide for more teachers for our kids, more pay and better housing for our troops, and more law enforcement agents. It provides more for job training, more for safe drinking water and clean air quality. It will result in better roads and safer airports and rail lines. 
   The Republicans are offering a very different plan. It makes very different choices. Their plan sets aside nothing for Medicare. As I said earlier, we save 15 percent of the surplus--$700 billion--for Medicare. We put it in a real lockbox; these funds can't be used for anything but Medicare. Their plan does not save one penny specifically for Medicare. Moreover, when Senate Republicans introduced their budget resolution, they said they were setting aside $133 billion for Medicare. Later, they revised that figure down to $100 billion. In the conference agreement before us today, there's nothing to preserve the existing Medicare program. The truth is Republicans are not setting aside any money specifically for Medicare. Their budget resolution recommends we extend the solvency of Medicare through benefit cuts alone. 
   If we act as this resolution proposes and fail to set aside real money for Medicare now, and fail to enact real reforms soon, the Medicare trust fund will go broke. That would be an emergency of staggering proportions. And the Republican budget does nothing--nothing--to prevent it. 
   Their plan does not guarantee one additional day of solvency for Social Security. Under the Democratic plan, Social Security's solvency is extended until at least 2055--23 years longer than what's now projected. 
   Now, Republicans say they will set aside 62 percent of the surplus for Social Security--the same as our plan. But nowhere in their plan do they say what they intend to do with that money. While they say they will put every dime of Social Security taxes in the Social Security trust fund, nowhere in their plan do they promise to keep the funds there. Nowhere do they guarantee that Social Security will continue to provide a monthly benefit. Nowhere do they commit to preserve unemployment benefits workers now get, or death benefits for their survivors. In fact, the conference report before us specifically allows Republicans to divert Social Security resources out of Social Security and use them to pay for private retirement accounts or additional tax cuts. 
   If the Republican majority believes the federal government should keep the commitments it has made, they should say so, clearly, in writing. Social Security taxes for Social Security benefits is not a difficult concept to grasp, and an even easier one to say. Despite all their rhetoric during the budget debate, the Republican budget resolution chooses not to say it. And even worse, it does not do it. Instead, the Republican resolution treats Social Security as just another piggy bank to pay for their tax breaks or private retirement accounts. That is its second major failing. 
   The third major problem with Republican budget resolution is the choice it makes about who gets tax relief. Our budget targets tax cuts to the needs of working families. Republicans say their plan is better because it contains tax cuts for everyone. That's not true! Under the 10 percent across-the-board tax cut endorsed by many in their party, nearly two-thirds of benefits would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans. If you earn $800,000 a year, you save $20,000 a year in taxes. But if you earn $38,000 a year or less --like 60 percent of American families--you'll save $99 a year--27 cents a day. That's if you're lucky. According to the Joint Tax Committee, Congress's official tax-estimating body, 48 million middle-class families would get nothing under a 10 percent tax cut. Not a nickel! 
   What would that 27 cents cost America's families? It means there will be nothing left over to protect and preserve Medicare. It also means crippling cuts in education, health care, environment, agriculture, food safety and countless other critical areas. According to an analysis by the Office of Management and Budget, the Republican budget will cut domestic investments by 11 percent across-the-board this year. By 2004, these cuts will grow to 27 percent. The Republican budget resolution would eventually force the federal government to cut more than one out of every four dollars it now spends on critical domestic priorities. Frankly, it's amazing to me that some of the same people who only weeks ago said Congress would be forced to break budget caps this year can now claim, with a straight face, that they can cut federal spending by 27 percent over next five years. 
   Their tax cut plan is unfair and unworkable, and we all know it. The last time we tried their tax plan--the last time we tried to grow the economy by cutting trillions of dollars in taxes and giving most of the money to wealthiest Americans--we quadrupled the national debt and ran the economy into the ground. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, there are terrible problems with the Republican budget resolution. Democrats tried to correct these problems in the Budget Committee. We tried to make adjustments on the Senate floor. In both places, we were defeated on party-line votes. So, we will pass this conference agreement in a few minutes. 
   And while we may disagree on its merits, we all know, Democrats and Republicans alike, this plan will never become law. So, we have a lot of work ahead of us in the next several months. Democrats will listen to any reasonable, responsible plan anyone wants to propose. We're willing to negotiate across the aisle, and make compromises, to come up with budget proposals that can be signed by the President. However, we will not compromise on our commitments. We will not repeat mistakes of the past. We cannot squander this opportunity.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, while the Senate was in recess for the Easter/Spring break, a member of the Senate family ended his Senate career. Ron Kavulick, the Chief Reporter of Debates, retired. 
   As a matter of fact, Ron was to have ended his Senate career at the close of the 105th Congress, but remained in his position as the Senate conducted the impeachment trial of the President. Ron's expertise and dedication to detail were needed throughout the tedious proceedings of the trial. 
   Ron became an Official Reporter of Senate Debates in 1979 and served ably in that capacity until he was elevated to the position of Chief Reporter in 1995. 
   Ron has a very impressive reporting background. He was an official court reporter in the Air Force's JAG office. While employed with Alderson Reporting Company, Ron had the opportunity to work at the White House. Ron traveled extensively both with President Johnson and President Nixon. 
   Ron spent many hours and many nights working in the West Wing of the White House providing official White House transcripts of state dinners, press conferences and news briefings. Certainly Ron's experiences at the White House were helpful as he endured many a late night in the Senate. 
   My staff and I personally cannot thank Ron enough for his service. Since my arrival at the Senate in 1987, I have relied on Ron's institutional memory and unfailing kindness. He has always been available, day or night, for any help that my staff or I needed. It would be impossible for me to count the times that Ron and his very able staff have assisted us. Having said that, no one deserves a rest from the long, sometimes grueling hours of the Senate more than Ron Kavulick. I can attest to the fact that he will be greatly missed here in the Senate. 
   As Ron goes on to enjoy time with his wife, Pat, his children and granddaughter, Allison, I thank him for his diligence and perseverance in his service to his country and for his friendship to us here in the Senate. My staff joins me in wishing him all the best in the years to come. 
   Ron, good luck and Godspeed.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Today marks the final day of work in the Senate for Kim Koivisto, the associate director to the Democratic Steering and Coordination Committee. I didn't want the day to pass without taking a moment to thank Kim for a job well done. 
   The Democratic Steering and Coordination Committee is the liaison office between Senate Democrats and a good portion of the rest of the country, including representatives of state, county and local governments and people from every imaginable interest group. The committee is an important part of our caucus's efforts to talk with and listen to Americans from varying perspectives. 
   Kim has worked as associate director of the committee for the past two years. During that time, she has consistently demonstrated the highest level of commitment, professionalism and creativity. She has worked most intensively on women's, Hispanic and labor issues. 
   One highlight of Kim's tenure is the creation of a new outreach program to strengthen relations between our caucus and national Hispanic organizations, Latino elected officials and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. She also used her fluency in Spanish to translated materials into Spanish, and to organize Spanish-language press conferences for Senate and House Democrats.  
   Kim has also worked closely with labor organizations and women's groups to advance causes that are important to American families--and to Kim personally. Issues she worked especially hard on include closing the pay gap between men and women, raising the minimum wage, and strengthening the federal commitment to breast cancer research. Kim was also active in the fight to retain the Federal Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program last year as part of TEA-21, the new Federal highway bill. 
   Kim's immediate plans include traveling through Indonesia. She will attend the Graduate School for Counseling at the University of Maryland in the fall. 
   On behalf of all Senate Democrats, I'd like to thank Kim for her hard work, and wish her the best of luck in her travel and studies. She will be missed.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota for his leadership on this matter. 
   Let me say, you can't say it better than what the ranking member of our committee, Senator HARKIN, has just said. The fact is that you can look at virtually any commodity in agriculture today, and the situation continues to worsen. Whether it is in livestock or in grain, the commodity doesn't matter. 
   The fact is, our circumstances are so dire that in spite of all the help we have attempted to provide through disaster assistance over the last 6 months, we are still going to lose millions of farmers and millions of rural Americans in the next couple of years. That is fact. 
   All we are simply saying is this: If we are going to be of any assistance as we go through this extraordinary transition, we need to recreate the safety net that we once had. We need to recognize that farmers and ranchers cannot do it alone. We need to recognize that if there is going to be a surplus, one of the single best investments we can make is to ensure that those farmers and ranchers can survive with what meager tools they are going to have to manage their risks more effectively. 
   That is what the Senator from North Dakota is saying. We are not going to specify and delineate each and every tool today. We will work that out. But we have got to set the parameters. We have got to send the message. We have to ensure that the priority is there. 
   I have to say, Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. I applaud  the Senator from North Dakota for his willingness to take the leadership in ensuring that we are at this point. I am hopeful that we can get a broad bipartisan consensus in passing it. It sends as clear a message as we can send out to agriculture across this country: We hear you. We are as concerned as you are, and we want to do something about it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, some people have mischaracterized the vote yesterday in favor of an amendment by the distinguished Senator from Missouri (Mr. ASHCROFT) as a vote against the President's plan for investing a portion of the Social Security surplus in private equities. Such investments have been proposed by the President and many others as a way to boost the return on investment of the Social Security trust fund's reserves. Clearly, the amendment did not reflect the President's plan. 
   Democrats and Republicans alike are opposed to direct investment by the federal government in private financial markets. That is why the President and other proponents of diversifying the investment of the trust fund have suggested that firewalls be constructed to insulate such investments from direct government control, or any interference by the federal government. 
   As the Administration has made clear, such investments would be made by private-sector professional fund managers, overseen by a board with the independence of the Federal Reserve Board. The members of the board would not be able to pick and choose which stocks or industries to invest in, nor exercise the voting rights associated with those shares. Instead, investments would be limited by law to stock index funds broadly representative of the entire market. 
   Many Senators, including me, drew a very significant distinction between the government investment and investment by non-governmental entity on behalf of the Social Security Administration. There's a big difference. Democrats and Republicans agreed that we cannot support direct government investment. But many of us believe we should have professional managers oversee a certain portion of the portfolio, which is something altogether different. This senator supports that idea, and many senators wanted to leave that option open so we could revisit it later on. 
   The vote on the Ashcroft amendment was not a vote on the President's plan. I look forward to full consideration and debate of responsible proposals for investing a portion of the surplus in equities in order to increase the earnings on the reserves of the Social Security trust fund.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars for its excellent work over the last 25 years. The Center, which was founded by William and Sheila Burke in 1975, is an independent, non-profit educational organization that has placed more than 24,000 students from over 750 colleges and universities in internships across the Washington, D.C. area. 
   The Center plays a critical and formative role in teaching students the value of public service. The organization fosters an enduring civic awareness by placing students in internships and by holding academic seminars that introduce students to the exciting culture and history of our nation's capital. In addition to helping students experience the extraordinary educational opportunities that exist in the District of Columbia, The Center has made an invaluable contribution to public service by helping those of us in Congress to identify talented and energetic young men and women to assist in our work on behalf of the American public. 
   I know that many of my colleagues share my deep appreciation for this extraordinary achievement, and join me in commending The Center for its pioneering efforts over the last quarter century to promote participatory learning in the nation's capitol. On this, The Center's 25th anniversary, it deserves the recognition and thanks of all of us who work in our nation's capitol and who have benefitted from The Center's important work. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish the Washington Center continued success in fulfilling its vital mission to enhance the lives and learning of our nation's college students. This Center's work has immeasurably enriched the lives of students and the lives of those who have been fortunate enough to work with them, and I know it will continue to do so for many years to come.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators LEAHY and TORRICELLI in introducing The Seniors Safety Act. All too often, seniors are primary targets for financial exploitation and subjected to neglect and physical abuse, and as our country's senior population continues to grow, the plague of crimes against the elderly has the potential to spiral out of control. The Seniors Safety Act combats this very serious issue by increasing penalties for crimes against seniors, improving law enforcement tools necessary to prevent telemarketing and healthcare fraud, safeguarding pension and benefit plans from fraud and bribery, and preventing nursing home abuse. 
   Seniors are often targeted by criminals because of their lack of mobility, isolation, and dependence on others. The criminals targeting seniors should be subject to enhanced penalties, and we must develop new strategies to combat their crimes. The Seniors Safety Act requires the sentencing commission to review and consider amending sentencing guidelines to include age as one criterion for enhancing a sentence and enhances the penalty for fraudulent schemes that result in serious injury or death. In addition, the bill directs the Attorney General to conduct a comprehensive review of crimes against seniors in order to develop new ways to combat criminals who target older Americans. 
   Federal investigators estimate that senior citizens constitute nearly 80 percent of telemarketing scam victims. In 1996, the AARP estimated that 14,000 companies nationwide were illegally defrauding citizens of their hard-earned money through telemarketing schemes. The fraud committed by only 300 telemarketers exposed by the FBI in 1995 resulted in an estimated $58 million loss from 52,000 seniors in just two years. The Seniors Safety Act puts in place important law enforcement tools needed to stop telemarketing fraud. The Act gives federal officials the ability to cut off a fraudulent telemarketer's telephone service. It also creates a hotline for victims of telemarketing fraud. Through the hotline, victims can register complaints against companies, can receive information regarding common fraudulent schemes and be referred to the appropriate enforcement agency. A database of complaints will be established so that victims can check for previous complaints against a particular company. 
   Health care fraud also disproportionately harms older Americans. The Seniors Safety Act provides important new tools to law enforcement officials for use in health care fraud investigations. The bill authorizes the Attorney General to get injunctions to stop false claims and health care kickbacks and to issue administrative subpoenas for health care offenses. With court permission, the Attorney General would also be permitted to share grand jury information for use in civil investigations of health care fraud and abuse. In addition, the bill extends existing anti-fraud safeguards applicable to Medicare and Medicaid to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act. 
   We must protect the economic security of our country's senior citizens by safeguarding pension and employee benefit plans from fraud and misuse. For this reason, an important provision of the Seniors Safety Act creates a new ``retirement fraud'' crime modeled on existing bank fraud and health care fraud statutes. The bill provides for civil penalties for commission of a retirement fraud crime, and increases the existing penalties for theft or embezzlement and bribery and graft with respect to the operation of an employee benefit plan. 
   In 1997, the Department of Health and Human Services reported a 14 percent increase in nursing home abuse since 1994. Our society must provide a safe environment for older Americans who move into nursing homes. This bill will combat nursing home fraud and abuse by creating new federal and criminal penalties against persons or companies who willfully engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. The bill will also protect persons who report health and safety violations by allowing them to bring a civil cause of action for acts of retaliation against them. 
   Finally, we must provide greater protections for senior crime victims. The Seniors Safety Act will do just that by requiring criminals to forfeit ill-gotten gains and property acquired by defrauding pension plans to the victims. The bill also prevents criminals from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying judgments by prohibiting judgments or settlements in Medicare or Medicaid fraud cases from being discharged in bankruptcy proceedings and  allows False Claims Act actions to proceed despite concurrent bankruptcy proceedings. 
   These and other provisions in The Seniors Safety Act will make a real difference--a positive difference--in protecting the senior citizens of this country. This comprehensive bill is a vital part of our ongoing effort to secure the safety of our families and our communities, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with the distinguished Ranking Member of the Banking Committee, the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. SARBANES, we are introducing the ``Financial Services Act of 1999.'' We are joined by all Democratic members of the Banking Committee. 
   The President has indicated through his Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, that he can support our approach and sign it into law. 
   This bill makes a clear and unambiguous statement: we want financial services modernization enacted this year. 
   This should not be a partisan issue. Our bill is based on last year's H.R. 10, which enjoyed wide bipartisan support. It was approved last year by the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. Most Republicans supported it. It was supported by virtually every major financial services industry group. 
   A similar bill was adopted by a bipartisan 51 to 8 vote this year in the House Banking Committee. 
   Sadly, reform efforts suffered a major setback this year in the Senate Banking Committee when the majority forced through a bill on a party line vote of 11 to 9. 
   Mr. President, financial services reform is now on two tracks toward reform. There is the veto track, and the Banking Committee bill is on it over the Community Reinvestment Act and other concerns. 
   There is also the track toward enactment, which this bill and the House Banking bill are on. 
   But it can't be ``take it or leave it'' on either side. We have agreed with the distinguished Majority Leader [Mr. LOTT] to discuss this issue immediately after recess in an effort to find common ground. 
   The choice is clear: it's either partisan brinksmanship--or bipartisan accomplishment. We reject the former and stand ready to deliver on the latter.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help address the economic malaise that has gripped certain rural and remote areas of our country and the problems arising from the high cost of developing and maintaining infrastructure in remote communities. The legislation will provide grants to rural communities suffering from out-migration and low per-capita income and will help ensure that remote communities are not unfairly penalized by the high cost of services, such as water, waste water, fuel and utility services. I want to thank my colleague from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, for his work on this legislation. His contribution in addressing these problems is most welcome. 
   Rural areas of our Nation continue to experience vast fluctuations in their economic well-being due to their dependence on worldwide agricultural markets. The link between global economic forces and local economic conditions is nowhere as pronounced as it is in rural America. And yet, rural communities are often those least capable of weathering the severe periodic downturns that occur in global markets. 
   Statistics bear out these fluctuations in economic activity, but they fail to fully capture the human suffering that lies just beyond the numbers. Economic downturns lead to the migration away from farm-dependent, rural communities, further stifling economic opportunities for those left behind. The 1990 Census highlighted these migratory trends, and I anticipate that similar trends will be captured by the upcoming Census, as well. 
   In short, the bandwagon of prosperity that has carried many Americans along through the past decade has left many rural areas standing by the wayside. If this trend continues, more and more young people will be forced to leave the towns they grew up in for opportunities in urban areas. In towns like Webster, Sisseton, and White River, South Dakota, we are seeing farm families broken up, populations decline, and main street businesses close their doors. While there is no doubt that economic growth in our urban areas has benefited our Nation, the disparity of economic development between our rural and urban areas cannot be ignored. If nothing is done to address the economic challenges facing these areas, we will jeopardize the future of rural America. 
   That is why Senator MURKOWSKI and I are introducing legislation to provide the Nation's rural areas with the resources necessary to make critical investments in their future and, by doing so, to create economic opportunities that will help them sustain a valuable and important way of life. While Federal agencies, such as the United States Department of Agriculture's Office of Rural Development and the Economic Development Administration, provide assistance for rural development purposes, there are no Federal programs that provide a steady source of funding for rural areas most affected by severe out-migration and low per-capita income. For these areas, the process of economic development is often most arduous. The Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act of 1999 will provide the basic, long-term assistance necessary to aid the coordinated efforts of local community leaders as they begin economic recovery efforts to ensure a bright future for rural America. 
   Specifically, the Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act of 1999 will provide a minimum of $200,000 per year to counties and Indian tribes with (1) out-migration levels of one percent or more over a five-year period, (2) per-capita income levels that are below the national average, and (3) borders that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area. This legislation authorizes the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to set aside $50 million in Community Development Block Grant funding for this purpose. The money, which is already included in the agency's budget, will be allocated on a formula basis to rural counties and Indian tribes suffering from out-migration and low-per capita income levels. 
   County and tribal governments will be able to use this federal funding to improve their industrial parks, purchase land for development, build affordable housing and create economic recovery strategies according to their needs. All of these important steps will help rural communities address their economic problems and plan for long-term growth and development. 
   In addition to addressing the problems of out-migration from low per-capita income areas, this legislation also focuses on the unique problems associated with those communities located in areas with high energy costs. Specifically, the legislation sets aside $100,000,000 for weatherization efforts, the construction of cost-efficient power facilities and fuel storage facilities, energy management programs, water and waste water facilities, the acquisition or disposition of real property for rural and remote development activities, and for the implementation of a comprehensive rural and remote development plan. 
   Mr. President, the Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act of 1999 holds great potential for revitalizing many of  our nation's most neglected and vulnerable areas. I urge my colleagues to support its enactment this Congress.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 1999, which requires health insurance plans to provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for mastectomies and lymph node dissections performed to treat breast cancer. 
   This bill would prevent insurance companies and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) from forcing women to leave the hospital prematurely following a mastectomy or lymph node dissection or to have these treatments on an outpatient basis. Insurance company accountants should not make medical decisions without considering a doctor's judgments or a patient's needs. This legislation is part of my ongoing effort to protect patients and require that insurance companies deliver necessary, promised coverage. The Patients' Bill of Rights Act, S.6, also addresses these types of abuses, while providing a range of other important protections. 
   The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act would guarantee women at least 48 hours of inpatient care following a mastectomy and at least 24 hours following lymph node dissection. These standards were designed in consultation with surgeons who specialize in this area and reflect the minimum amount of inpatient care necessary following these procedures. Patients, in consultation with their physicians, would be able to leave the hospital earlier if their situation warrants. The bottom line is still that insurers should allow coverage for the time necessary to ensure a proper recovery. 
   Over the last several years, the average length of hospitalization following a mastectomy has fallen from 4-6 to 2-3 days. Patients undergoing lymph node dissections in the past were hospitalized for 2-3 days. While some of the reductions in length of care may be the result of better medical practices, hospitalization is still critical for pain control, to manage fluid drainage, and to provide support and reassurance for women who have just undergone major surgery. 
   Nevertheless, some patients have been told that their health maintenance organization (HMO) will cover their major surgery only on an outpatient basis. These determinations have been made on the basis of studies by their own actuarial consulting firms. However, both American College of Surgeons and the American Medical Association have concluded that inpatient stays are recommended in many cases. Women suffering from breast cancer deserve to know that their insurance will cover care based on their medical needs rather than the coverage recommendations made by HMO actuaries. 
   My bill is a companion to H.R. 116, which was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman DeLauro. I would like to express appreciation to Congresswoman DeLauro, and to Senators FEINSTEIN, MIKULSKI and MURRAY, for their tireless efforts on behalf of breast cancer patients. All have been invaluable leaders who have inspired and challenged us to address the very real need for breast cancer treatment reform. 
   As we discuss the importance of ensuring quality care for breast cancer sufferers who have health insurance, it is also important to note that many women in the United States must fight this life-threatening disease without any health insurance at all. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) funds breast and cervical cancer screening--in South Dakota, 1300 low-income women have been screened during the past 18 months--but there is no funding for actual treatment when that screening detects cancer. While the CDC effort is a critical part of the fight against cancer, it is ironic that those women who test positive for breast and cervical cancer may have no way to pay for the treatment they need. 
   With one in eight women expected to develop breast cancer, it is increasingly likely that all of our families will be affected by this devastating disease in some way. In South Dakota, 500 women will be diagnosed with, and 100 will die of, breast cancer in the next 12 months. Let us take this small step to ensure the experience is not complicated by insecurity and confusion over health insurance coverage. Let us put critical health care decisions back in the hands of breast cancer patients and their physicians.

As eternal an optimist as I am, I am still not optimistic at this point that we can complete work on all 90 amendments prior to 11 o'clock, so I will object. 
   I do ask for the cooperation of our colleagues in the hopes that we can finish this bill. Obviously, there is a great deal of work that yet needs to be done. If we work this afternoon and work hard, perhaps as early as this evening we might be able to finish, but let's give it our best effort and revisit the question of when we can go to final passage.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his eloquence, as well as the Senator from Nevada, whom I also heard. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for making the effort to allow us this opportunity on the floor this morning. 
   Mr. President, last week, when Joe DiMaggio died, I heard many people say it is a shame how few heroes there are left among us. To anyone who believes that, I say: Meet my friend, BOB KERREY. To me and to many others, he is a genuine American hero. 
   As others have noted, on a moonless black night, 30 years ago this past Sunday, Lieutenant KERREY, then a 25-year-old Navy SEAL commander, led his squad in a surprise attack on North Vietnamese Army guerillas on the island of Hon Tre. 
   During the fierce firefight that broke out, an enemy grenade exploded on the ground beside him. The blast shattered his right leg below the knee, badly wounded his right hand, and pierced much of his body with shrapnel. 
   Despite his massive injuries, Lieutenant KERREY continued to direct his squad until the last man was safely evacuated. Days later, doctors were forced to amputate his injured leg just below the knee. Lieutenant KERREY had been in Vietnam only 3 months. 
   For his sacrifice, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the highest award our nation bestows for bravery, the Congressional Medal of Honor. But it is not only what others pinned over his heart that makes BOB KERREY a hero. It is what is in his heart.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for making the offer that he has. He and I have been in discussions throughout the morning trying to find a way with which to resolve this impasse. I appreciate very much his willingness to have the up-or-down votes that we now have wanted for some time. 
   We have 20 amendments that Senators want to offer. For the life of me, I don't understand. We had over 20 amendments offered, voted on, considered, and disposed of on the military bill a couple of weeks ago, and we resolved that bill within 3 or 4 days. We could have easily done that by now. 
   I have offered to the majority leader the agreement that he has just articulated, with one minor change. We keep the time. We go to the time certain that the majority leader suggested in his unanimous consent request. But we would also accommodate four other amendments: Two offered by Senator WELLSTONE, an amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, and the amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota--all related to Ed-Flex, directly related to Ed-Flex, with the exception of Senator DORGAN's report card amendment. Those four amendments would not require any additional time beyond the 5 hours; that is, we divide up the time allotted to us in whatever amount is required for each amendment. But we would accommodate at least those three Senators who have waited patiently now for over a week to offer their amendments. 
   So I hope the majority leader can modify his request with that simple outstanding caveat, that one additional change: No additional time, one additional change to accommodate three Senators who have waited patiently and who want to resolve this matter. I hope the majority leader will modify his request in that regard, and I ask unanimous consent to that effect.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to briefly thank those Senators on both sides of the aisle. This is a very important procedural agreement we have reached, after some deliberation and a great deal of willingness to cooperate on the part of many Senators. There were many, many Senators who had expressed the hope that they could offer their amendments; they were precluded from doing that. Frankly, I am disappointed that they were precluded. But I will say this: I am also grateful to the majority leader for agreeing to have up-or-down votes on the class size amendment, on the dropout amendment, on the social promotion amendment, on the amendment with regard to report cards, and on the amendments Senator WELLSTONE will be proposing on the accountability. 
   This represents, I think, a compromise that we hoped we could reach. It represents an extraordinary amount of good-faith effort on both sides. I think the Senators from Oregon and Tennessee ought to be commended as well for their patience and tolerance in working with all of our colleagues in bringing us to this point. 
   It goes without saying, the managers of the bill, the Senator from Vermont and the illustrious and extraordinary ranking member, Senator KENNEDY, deserve a great deal of credit. We have come a long way. We have reached a point now where we are going to be able to finish this bill--a very good bill that deserves support. This also allows us to deal with the amendments that a number of Senators have been fighting to have votes on now for several days. 
   I thank all Senators for their cooperation. 
   Mr. President, there have been a number of questions about how we are going to be proceeding under the unanimous consent request. We consulted with the majority leader and with the manager of the bill. 
   I ask unanimous consent that all but 1 hour of time allotted under the unanimous consent agreement be consumed today, allowing 1 hour under the arrangement anticipated by the unanimous consent agreement to be used tomorrow. I then ask unanimous consent that those who might wish to express themselves on the bill or on amendments be allowed as if in morning business to speak later on this evening.

I appreciate the indulgence of both managers.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I bring to the attention of my colleagues an article that recently appeared in The Washington Post, ``Hearing Loss Touches a Younger Generation.'' This article raises important issues related to hearing loss and gives us practical advice for protecting our hearing. 
   Hearing loss affects approximately 28 million Americans and is affecting more of us at younger ages. Hearing difficulties among those ages 45 to 64 increased 26 percent between 1971 and 1990, while those between ages 18 and 44 experienced a 17 percent increase. 
   About one third of the cases of hearing loss are caused, at least in part, by extreme or consistent exposure to high decibel noises. While the Environmental Protection Agency has worked to decrease our exposure to loud noises at work, many Americans now face threats to optimal hearing during their leisure hours from loud music, lawn mowers and outdoor equipment, automobiles, airplanes and other sources. Too many Americans simply are not aware of the devastating impact loud sounds can have on their hearing. 
   At the encouragement of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) is leading a collaborative effort with the National Institute on Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Institute on Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to help improve awareness about noise-induced hearing loss. It is my hope that this effort ultimately will help reverse the trend toward increasing noise-induced hearing loss. 
   Health professionals, too, play an important role in the treatment and prevention of hearing loss. In particular, I'd like to highlight the important work of audiologists in successfully combating and treating hearing loss. Over the years I have been impressed by the cost-effective, quality care they provide, most notably demonstrated in the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system, which has allowed veterans direct access to audiologists since 1992.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to agree and disagree with the distinguished majority leader. Let me point out my area of agreement first. 
   I believe it is important, as we begin our legislative session this year, that Senators be fully apprised of the schedule, and we understand that we have to be here on Fridays and on Mondays. 
   I think the majority leader is absolutely right in expecting that we have votes on Friday mornings and Monday afternoons or Monday evenings. 
   I hope Senators will accommodate that schedule with their own personal schedules, because that is the only  way, as we get into more legislative work, that we will be able to accommodate all of our needs legislatively. 
   I must say that I am in strong disagreement with the leader's decision to file cloture. We have a very important amendment that I was hoping we could offer even this morning, the class size amendment, the 100,000-teacher amendment offered by Senator MURRAY and Senator KENNEDY, and a number of other Senators. That was not possible because of the decision made by the leader. 
   What is perhaps most perplexing to me is, having filed cloture yesterday, that 17 Republican Senators filed cloture, then they voted against tabling a banking amendment to the education bill this morning. 
   So we have an unusual set of circumstances where the very same Senators who signed a cloture motion yesterday, voted not to table an extraneous amendment having nothing to do with Ed-Flex today, the banking amendment. I must say it doesn't help us as our colleagues are attempting to work through this procedurally to understand what the nature of the strategy may be on the other side. It appears that what they are trying to do is simply deny the Democrats the right to offer our amendments. They will vote no on a Republican amendment--they will vote not to table; that is, a Republican amendment--having to do with banking, but then they will preclude Democrat Senators from offering legitimate, important amendments having to do with education, such as the class size amendment, and for having a debate on it. 
   So I am perplexed by that. It sends the wrong message. We want to cooperate.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an important bill. Ed-Flex is a bill that, in my view, as I have said before, warrants a 100-to-nothing vote. We ought to give States more flexibility. But we also ought to recognize that if we are going to begin debate on education policy in the U.S. Senate, there are other issues that also merit consideration and opportunity for an up-or-down vote: Whether or not we have an afterschool program, whether or not we have an effort in this country to prevent dropouts, whether or not we consider 100,000 teachers and class size, whether or not we have school construction. All of those are legitimate education issues. 
   So I will offer to my distinguished majority leader another effort at compromise. I will attempt to see if we might come down to five or six amendments and say: Look. We will agree to those five or six amendments; we will agree to time limits and up-or-down votes on those five or six amendments; and then let's move on. The majority leader was very generous, I thought, with what he said earlier to the Governors. As I understand it, the majority leader said, Let's go to the Senate; let's take a week; let's take 2 weeks, if necessary, but let's talk about education. Let's take 2 weeks if necessary. We haven't even taken a week yet. 
   So I really appreciate the majority leader's interest in trying to find some way with which to resolve this impasse. I think he is understandably desirous of moving on to other things. We want to do that. We want to pass the Ed-Flex bill. We want to pass good education amendments. We want to resolve this matter. We want to find a way to do it in a bipartisan manner. And I am confident that if we continue to work at it that we will. 
   So I will offer, again, to see if we might limit our amendments to maybe five or six with time limits and have up-or-down votes. I believe that is the best way to break through this. I am hopeful that we can get broad bipartisan agreement. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate recently bid farewell to a longtime employee, William J. Lackey, who retired from the position of Journal Clerk. Bill was a familiar presence on the Senate dais, faithfully and accurately recording the daily proceedings of the Senate. 
   In fact, the Constitution requires that ``each house of Congress shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time ..... publish the same.'' The Journal is the highest authority on actions taken by the Senate and can only be changed by a majority vote or by unanimous consent. Bill was responsible for recording the minutes of the Senate's legislative proceedings for publication as the annual Senate Journal. He always undertook this responsibility with great professional diligence and attention to detail. 
   In total, Bill gave 35 years of service to the Senate, more than 20 of those in the Office of the Journal Clerk. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Bill for his faithful and dedicated service, and wish him well in his retirement.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we celebrate the life of a very special American, Congressman Morris K. Udall. Today, and every day, I think of him for all the wit and wisdom he shared with the world, and for the remarkable commitment he made to public service and the causes he believed in. 
   Mo inspired us with his integrity, compassion, dedication and humor. 
   His loss is deeply felt by all who knew him. 
   I first got to know Mo Udall when I came to the House of Representatives in 1978. He was a leader on issues that are still critical to the national debate, including protecting the environment, promoting honesty and fairness in the financing of campaigns, and making quality health care more accessible. I had the pleasure of working closely with him and sharing his passion on these priorities. 
   When I was a struggling young Congressman, Mo went the extra mile to lend me his support and his assistance. He was always willing to offer a joke or a piece of advice, and he even traveled to the middle of South Dakota on behalf of this very junior Member of Congress. 
   I am certainly not the only one who has benefited from the generosity of Morris Udall. In particular, those who shared his struggle with Parkinson's disease owe him a great debt of gratitude for his work on raising the awareness and funding for research on this debilitating illness. Although complications related to Parkinson's ultimately took his life, it is my hope that a speedy discovery of better treatments and, eventually, a cure for Parkinson's will be Mo's legacy to those at risk of developing this deadly disease. 
   I join my colleagues both to celebrate the life of this remarkable man as well as to express my deepest sympathy to Mo Udall's family, especially his wife, Norma, and his children, MARK, Randolph, Judith, Anne, Bradley and Katherine. They have had the pleasure of knowing him best, and they will certainly feel his loss the most. 
   There will never be another man with Mo Udall's unique combination of wit  and passion. We are all better for having worked with and learned from this wonderful leader. As we honor him today, as we celebrate his life with our words, may we also be challenged to follow in his footsteps as a dedicated servant of the people and honor him with our actions. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize Barry Wolk, Director of Printing and Document Services, as he concludes over 23 years of service to the United States Senate. I know I speak for all of my colleagues, their staffs and others in the Senate community in acknowledging his excellence service. The Senate is well served by staff such as Mr. Wolk--people who are dedicated to the Senate and serve without partisanship year after year in carrying out critical administrative functions without which any institution could not carry out its mission. 
   Mr. Wolk has spent his Senate career serving in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate. He has carried out the Secretary's statutory responsibilities to ensure that Senate committee hearings are printed and has supplied Senators' offices and committees with stationary and other necessary items.He also assisted the Secretary in reducing the cost of these services through automation. 
   The Senate is fortunate to have so many long-term and dedicated employees like Barry Wolk. As Barry leaves the Senate and enters a new phase of his life, I join my colleagues in wishing him and his family well.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for 24 years Justice Harry Blackmun gave voice on the highest court in this land to ordinary Americans. He gave voice--in his own words--to ``the little guy.'' Early this morning, that voice was silenced. Harry Blackmun died at the age of 90. 
   He was an extraordinary man and a quintessential American. His tenure on the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court extended through the terms of nine Presidents. 
   Years ago, Justice Blackmun predicted the first thing obituary writers would say of him today is that he was the man who wrote Roe v. Wade, and that clearly was the best known and most controversial decision in Justice Blackmun's career. But Harry Blackmun stood for much more than that. He was regarded by many as the Justice most insistent that the Court confront the reality of the problems it considered and the real-world consequences of those decisions. 
   In a dissenting opinion, he once challenged what he called ``the comfortable perspective'' from which his fellow Justices ruled that a $40 fee did not limit a poor woman's right to choose. The reason he saw that matter differently from his fellow Justices was due--at least in part--to the fact that Harry Blackmun had been raised differently. 
   He was born in Nashville in 1908 but grew up in St. Paul, MN. His father owned a hardware store and a grocery store. His family did not have a lot of money. When Harry Blackmun was 17 years old, he was chosen by the Harvard Club of Minnesota to receive a scholarship. At Harvard, he majored in mathematics. To cover living expenses, he worked as a janitor and a milkman, painted handball courts, and graded math papers. 
   He considered seriously going to medical school but chose Harvard instead. He worked that same string of odd jobs to pay for his room and board all the way through law school. After law school, he spent 16 years in private law practice in St. Paul. 
   In 1950, Harry Blackmun became the first resident counsel at the world-renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. He later called this ``the happiest decade'' in his life, because it gave him ``a foot in both camps--law and medicine.'' 
   A lifelong Republican, Justice Blackmun was nominated in November of 1959 by President Eisenhower to the U.S. Court of Appeals' Eighth Circuit. 
   At the time, he was labeled a conservative. 
   In April of 1970, he was nominated by President Nixon to the Supreme Court. He had been recommended to President Nixon by a man with whom he had been friends since they attended kindergarten together: Chief Justice Warren Burger. Justice Blackmun was, in fact, the third choice to fill the seat vacated by Abe Fortas. Typical of his self-effacing wit, he often referred to himself as ``Old No. 3.'' 
   When the FBI conducted its prenomination investigation of Harry Blackmun, they turned up only one complaint: He works too hard. 
   In his early days on the Court, Justice Blackmun tended to vote with his old friend, the Chief Justice. In fact, their records were so similar they were called by some ``the Minnesota Twins.'' 
   As he began his second decade on the Court, Justice Blackmun found his own voice. He began to use that voice more frequently and more forcefully to speak for those he thought too often went unnoticed by the Court. He emerged as one of the Court's most courageous champions of individual liberty. His overriding concern was balancing and protecting the rights of individuals against the authority of the government. 
   He was a staunch defender of free speech and what he called ``the most valued'' of all rights: the right to be left alone. 
   He was criticized by some and praised by others for what many people perceived as a change in his political beliefs. He always insisted to friends that he had not moved to the left; rather the Court had moved to the right. ``I've been called liberal and conservative; labels are deceiving. I call them as I see them,'' he said. 
   Roe v. Wade combined Justice Blackmun's two most enduring interests: the right to privacy, and the relationship between medical and legal issues. For weeks before writing the majority opinion, he immersed himself in historical and medical research at the Mayo Clinic. 
   Over the years, he would receive 60,000 pieces of hate mail as a result of his decision. He read every one of them. Once when he was asked why, he replied, simply, ``I want to know what the people who wrote are thinking.'' 
   He understood why Roe v. Wade produced such strong passions in people--because it had elicited strong feelings in him. 
   In 1983, he gave a long interview to a reporter--something that remains nearly unprecedented for a Supreme Court Justice. In that interview, he recalled what it was like to write the opinion in that landmark case.  
   I believe everything I said in the second paragraph of that opinion, where I agonized, initially not only for myself, but for the Court. 
   Parenthetically, in doing so publicly, I disobeyed one suggestion Hugo Black made to me when I first came here. He said, ``Harry, never display agony in public, in an opinion. Never display agony. Never say `This is an agonizing, difficult decision.' Always write it as though it's clear as crystal.''  
   Justice Blackmun wrote an agonized opinion because for him--and, he understood, for most people--abortion is an agonizing decision. It was then, and it remains so today. 
   I, for one, am grateful to Justice Blackmun that he did not try to minimize the difficulty of that decision. To do so would have been disrespectful, I believe, to the vast majority of Americans who are truly torn, intellectually and emotionally, by the question of abortion. 
   In 1994, when Justice Blackmun announced his retirement, he told President Clinton, ``I'm indebted to the Nation.......for putting up with the likes of me.'' 
   Today, as we bid farewell to Harry Blackmun, it is we who are indebted to him. He was the champion of liberty, and ``we are not likely to see the likes of him'' for a long time. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with Justice Blackmun's friends and family, especially his wife and partner of 58 years, Dottie, and their three daughters, Nancy, Sally and Susan. Our Nation will miss Harry Blackmun.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the distinguished Majority Leader's enthusiasm for the potential of electronic  commerce and his assessment of the role of the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the encouragement of that potential. I also appreciate the concerns he referenced about the need for balance on the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. The advisory panel can provide policymakers with valuable perspective on many of the issues that must be resolved if the potential of electronic commerce is to be fully realized.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with the Majority Leader. When Congress debated the Internet Tax Freedom Act, considerable attention was paid to the section of the bill that delineated the membership of the Advisory Commission. The legislation is very clear in specifying a balanced makeup of this panel. While some adjustments have already been made in an effort to achieve that goal, further discussion of the make up of the Commission and the requirements of the statute is clearly required. 
   As the Majority Leader knows, state and local governments have a lot at stake with respect to the deliberations of this Commission, and the Internet Tax Freedom Act anticipates their full participation on the panel. If we hope to reach consensus on a uniform taxation system that allows electronic commerce to flourish without eroding state and local tax bases, a balanced, representative Commission is in all parties' self-interest.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Dr. Carter G. Woodson was the son of former slaves. He believed passionately that the solution to injustice was education. If Americans from different backgrounds could learn to see our similarities and appreciate our differences, he believed, we could end the fear that is at the heart of racial discrimination. 
   So, in February 1926, Dr. Woodson proposed the first Negro History Week as a way to preserve African American history and promote greater understanding among all Americans. Over the years, as the civil rights movement progressed, Negro History Week evolved into what we now know as Black History Month. 
   This month, as our nation once again pauses to reflect on the achievements and experiences of African Americans, we celebrate the birthdays of several renowned leaders, including Frederick Douglass, Rosa Parks, and Barbara Jordan. We also celebrate the founding 90 years ago of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, one of this century's most powerful engines for social and economic justice. 
   It is right and fitting that we acknowledge such famous people and important milestones. But it is also important to recall the contributions of other African Americans who were less well known, but who contributed much to their communities. Today I want to pay tribute to two such men from my home state of South Dakota: Oscar Micheaux and Ross Owens. 
   Oscar Micheaux was a gifted, early filmmaker who settled in Gregory, South Dakota, in the early 1900s. His company, the Micheaux Film Corporation, was responsible for producing films that ran counter to Hollywood's negative portrayal of African Americans at that time. 
   Ross Owens was a 1925 graduate of my alma mater, South Dakota State University. Not only was he inducted into SDSU's Athletic Hall of Fame, but his masters thesis, ``Leisure Time Activities of the American Negro Prior to the Civil War'', became a classic in African American history and physical education. 
   One can only wonder what else Mr. Micheaux and Mr. Owens might have achieved had they been born later, after the civil rights movement toppled many of the barriers to equality that existed during their lifetimes. 
   Today, thanks to the vision of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall and John Lewis, as well as countless other Americans whose names are less well known but whose courage was no less real, many of those barriers are gone. Our nation no longer tolerates legal discrimination. We no longer permit injustices like poll taxes, ``separate but equal'' schools, and segregated public facilities. We have moved closer to that ideal on which our nation was founded: that all men--and women--are created equal. And we are all better for it. 
   Today, as our country thrives, millions of African Americans are sharing the benefits of the best economy in decades. But not all African Americans have been given the opportunity to share in America's economic progress. Not all of the barriers have been torn down. There is still work to be done. As we prepare to enter the new century, we must remain committed to equal educational opportunity, and economic and social justice--for all Americans. 
   This month, as we celebrate Black History Month, let us recall the words of the poet Langston Hughes, who wrote of a land ``where opportunity is real, life is free, and equality is in the air we breathe.'' And let us rededicate ourselves to finishing the task of establishing that land here, in the United States.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I believe we must significantly boost compensation for the men and women of our armed forces who serve this nation so tirelessly and effectively. The end of the Cold War has meant that the numbers and types of overseas missions we ask these people to perform has grown. The rising number of military operations abroad coupled with an extremely vibrant U.S. economy has meant the military services are having a harder time attracting and keeping highly skilled personnel. 
   The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs recognized this troubling development last year in testimony before the Congress and began making the case for addressing the military's recruitment and retention problems. The examples they cited were troubling. The Air Force is experiencing serious shortfalls in retaining its pilots. The Navy is having difficulty manning its ships. The Army finds itself coming up short in filling out its units. Only the Marine Corps appears to be faring well at the moment. 
   The President listened to our senior military officials, and he responded. The President proposed a $23 billion personnel initiative in his FY2000 budget to improve the military's pay and retirement benefits. The President's budget would provide the men and women of our armed services with the largest pay raise since 1982. In addition, it would reform military pay tables to reward performance, increase specialty pay and bonuses to address retention issues, and restore retirement benefits. Just as important as this list of benefits is the fact that the President made these proposals while remaining faithful to his pledge to Save Social Security First. The President was able to accommodate these proposed increases without spending any of the surplus in FY2000. In short, the President's proposal is fully paid for. 
   Like numerous members of Congress from both political parties, I have gone on record in the last several months in support of the Defense Department's argument that military pay and retirement benefits need to be enhanced if we are to continue to field a well-trained, highly capable military. That is why, along with Senator LEVIN, Senator CLELAND, and many other Democratic Senators, I introduced the Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999--a bill to increase pay and retirement benefits for members of the Armed Services. I am pleased that many provisions of this legislation were included in S. 4. Although the initial Democratic and Republican proposals were slightly different, I think we can all agree that people are the military's most important asset. 
   To see why, you need look no further than my home state of South Dakota and the more than 3,000 active-duty personnel stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base. Like their counterparts at military installations around the county and throughout the world, the men and women at Ellsworth Air Force Base serve their country with pride and distinction every day. Most recently, crews flying and maintaining B-1B bombers from Ellsworth participated in Operation Desert Fox. This was the first time that B-1Bs were used in combat, and the fact that B-1B crews from Ellsworth were so successful in hitting their targets is a credit to their enormous commitment and dedication. 
   With dedicated people like those we see at Ellsworth and other military installations around the world, it is easy to see why all of us--President Clinton, Defense Secretary Cohen, Joint Chiefs Chairman Shelton, Democrats, and Republicans--agree that something must be done. Therefore, a key issue before the Senate today is how best to accomplish this end, how best to ensure that some of this nation's best and  brightest continue to pursue a career in the military? 
   However, it is not the only issue. Those who are concerned about having a well balanced, fiscally responsible defense plan must also ask another question. What is the best way to provide military personnel with the pay and retirement benefits they so richly deserve while remaining true to our other defense and domestic priorities and staying within the tight fiscal constraints we find ourselves operating under? Indeed, this may be the most important question we face today: how do we do right by our military personnel, our other defense and domestic priorities, and our obligation to be fiscally responsible? 
   The bill before us today provides only a partial answer to this critical question, as it spends $12 billion beyond the President's proposal without providing offsets for the additional spending. As I said earlier, I wholeheartedly support providing additional benefits to our troops, and I will vote for this bill today. What troubles me about S. 4, however, is that its authors have chosen to stay strangely silent on how they will pay for the additional $12 billion in benefits. 
   Mr. President, I believe that when it comes to something as important as the pay and retirement benefits of our military, Congress should leave no questions unanswered. Fortunately, the action we take today in the Senate on S. 4 is the first step in a multi-step process. The House must develop its version of this bill, and differences between the House and Senate versions must be resolved in a conference. I urge the House and Senate members who participate in this process to fill in the blanks contained in S. 4. Our troops deserve additional pay and benefits. We owe it to both the troops and the American people to show how we will pay for them. I will be working hard with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide this answer and produce a military pay and retirement bill of which we can all be proud.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, in just a few moments, each of us will be called upon to do something that no one has done in American history. We will be voting on two articles of impeachment against an elected President of the United States. 
   Having listened carefully to nearly 50 of our colleagues who share my point of view, it is both difficult and unnecessary to attempt to reiterate the powerful logic and the extraordinary eloquence of many of their presentations. 
   I share the view expressed by so many that this body must be guided by two fundamental principles. I recognize that we are not all guided by these principles, but I and others have been guided, first, by this question: Has the prosecution provided evidence beyond a reasonable doubt; and, second, if so, do the President's offenses rise to the level of gravity laid out by our founders in the Constitution? 
   After listening to both sides of these arguments now for the past 5 weeks, I believe--I believe strongly--that the record shows that on both principles the answer is no--no, the case has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and, no, even if it had been it would not reach the impeachable level. 
   I also share the view expressed by many of my colleagues on the process which brought us here: an investigation by an independent counsel which exceeded the bounds of propriety; a decision by the Supreme Court subjecting sitting Presidents to civil suits--it is my prediction that every future President will be faced with legal trauma as a result--a deeply flawed proceeding in the House Judiciary Committee, which in an unprecedented fashion effectively relinquished its obligation to independently weigh the case for impeachment; the disappointing decision to deny Members of the Senate and the House the opportunity to vote on a censure resolution, even though I believe it would be supported by a majority in both Houses; and finally, the bitterly partisan nature of all the actions taken by the House of Representatives in handling this case. 
   But as deeply disappointed as I am with the process, it pales in comparison to the disappointment I feel toward this President. Maybe it is because I had such high expectations. Maybe it is because he holds so many dreams and aspirations that I hold about our country. Maybe it is because he is my friend. I have never been, nor ever expect to be, so bitterly disappointed again. 
   Abraham Lincoln may have been right when he said, ``I would rather have a full term in the Senate, a place in which I would feel more consciously able to discharge the duties required, and where there is more chance to make a reputation and less danger of losing it, than 4 years of the Presidency.'' 
   Maybe it is because of my disappointment that I was all the more determined to help give the Senate its chance to make a reputation, as Lincoln put it, at this time in our Nation's history. 
   The Senate has served our country well these past 2 months. And I now have no doubt that history will so record. There are clear reasons why the Senate has succeeded in this historic challenge. 
   First is the manner in which the Chief Justice has presided over these hearings. We owe him a big, big debt of gratitude. He has presented his rulings with clarity and logic. He has tempered the long hours and temporary confusion with a fine wit. In an exemplary fashion, he has done his constitutional duty and has made it possible for us to do ours. 
   The second reason is our majority leader. Perhaps more than anyone in the Chamber, I can attest to his steadfast commitment to a trial conducted with dignity and in the national interest. He has demonstrated that differences--honest differences--on difficult issues need not be dissent, and in that end the Senate can transcend those differences and conclude a constitutional process that the country will respect, and I do. 
   Third is our extraordinary staff--the Chaplain, my staff in particular, Senator LOTT's staff, the floor staff, the Parliamentarians, the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate. They have served us proudly. Their professionalism and the quality that they have demonstrated each and every hour ought to make us all proud.  
   Finally, if we have been successful, it has been because of each of you--your diligence, your deportment, your thoughtful arguments on either side of these complex, vexing questions. This experience and each of you--each of you--have made me deeply proud to be a Member of the U.S. Senate. 
   Growing up in South Dakota, I learned so much, as many of us have, from relatives and from the people in my hometown, and my parents especially. Something my father admonished me to do so many, many times in growing up is something I still remember so vividly today. He said, ``Never do anything that you wouldn't put your signature on.'' I thought of that twice during these proceedings--once when we signed the oath right here, and again last night when I signed the resolution for Scott Bates. 
   I will hear Scott Bates' voice when I hear my name called this morning. My father passed away 2 years ago. He and Scott are watching now. And I believe they will say that we have a right to put our signature on this work, on what we have done in these past 5 weeks, for with our votes today we can now turn our attention to the challenges confronting our country tomorrow. And, as we do, I hope for one thing: That we will soon see a new day in politics and political life, one filled with the same comity and spirit that I feel in the room today, one where good governance is truly good politics, one which encourages renewed participation in our political system. It is a hope based upon a fundamental belief which is now 210 years old, a belief that here in this country with this Republic we have created something very, very special, a belief so ably articulated by Thomas Paine as he wrote ``Common Sense.''  
   The sun will never shine on a cause of greater worth. This is not the affair of a city, a county, a province, or a kingdom, but of a continent. This is not the concern of the day, a year, or an age. 
   Posterity is are virtually involved in the contest, and will be more or less affected even to the end of time by the proceedings now.  
   So it is as we cast our votes today and begin a new tomorrow. 
   Each of us understands that the decision we must make is the most demanding assigned to us, as Senators, by the Constitution. The Framers did not believe it a simple matter to remove a President. They did not intend that it occur easily. 
   Only a certain class of offenses--treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors--could justify the President's removal. Only a supermajority--two-thirds of the Senate--could authorize it. 
   The Framers made as plain as they could that each Senator must judge, on all the circumstances of the case, whether the facts support this extraordinary remedy. 
   As I look at this case, I am compelled to consider it from beginning to end--from the circumstances under which the House fashioned and approved the articles, to the trial here in the Senate when the House pressed its arguments for conviction. And I find a case troubled from beginning to end--one marked by constitutional defects, inconsistencies in presentation, surprising concessions by the Managers against their own position, and even damage done to that position by their own witnesses. 
   In short, the case I have seen is one that I do not believe can bear the weight of the profound constitutional consequences it is meant to carry. 
   Its constitutional defects began in the House. 
   Rather than initiating its own investigation, and making its own findings, the House rested on the referral from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
   Never before has the House effectively relinquished its obligation to independently weigh the case for impeachment. 
   But this time it did, relinquishing that obligation to Mr. Starr. 
   Mr. Starr's 454-page referral became the factual record in the House. The arguments he made in that referral served almost exclusively as the basis for the articles prepared and voted by the House. 
   The House called no independent fact witness. The only witness was Mr. Starr. And it is telling that Mr. Starr's own ethics adviser, Professor Sam Dash, resigned his position with the Office of Independent Counsel to protest the improper role played by Mr. Starr in the impeachment process. 
   The House proceedings set a dangerous constitutional precedent, and the decision to follow this course has reverberated throughout the trial here in the Senate. 
   Because Mr. Starr carried the case in the House, the House did not develop or explain its own case until the time came to prepare for trial in the Senate. Those explanations, when they came, were replete with inconsistencies--not technical or minor inconsistencies, but rather inconsistencies that struck at the heart of their position. 
   On the one hand, the Managers charged the President with serious crimes. Yet, they also argued that they should not be required to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that the President committed those crimes--that they need not meet the standard that applies throughout our criminal justice system. 
   On the one hand, the Managers acknowledged that the House rejected an article based on President Clinton's deposition in the Jones case. Yet, throughout their presentations, including their videotaped presentation on February 6, they repeatedly relied on the President's statements in that civil deposition. 
   On the one hand, the Managers insisted that the record received from the House provided clear and irrefutable evidence of the President's guilt. Yet, one Manager declared that reasonable people could differ on the strength of the case, and another stated that he could not win a conviction in court based on that record. 
   On the one hand, the Managers originally claimed a record so clear that the House was not required to call a single fact witness--other than Mr. Starr. Yet, in the Senate, they insisted that their case depended vitally on witnesses. 
   In the end, the Senate authorized the deposition of witnesses, 
   two of whom--Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan--were central to the core allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice. These were witnesses identified by the House--witnesses the Managers expected to help support their case. 
   This is not, however, how it turned out. 
   In the final blow to the case for removal brought by the Managers, those very witnesses provided the Senate with clear and compelling testimony--in the President's defense. 
   It cannot have escaped many of us that the defense showed more and longer segments of this testimony than the Managers who sought these witnesses in the first place. 
   What did Ms. Lewinsky say about the false affidavit she filed in the Jones case? That she never discussed the contents with the President. That she thought she might be able to file a truthful, but limited affidavit and still avoid testifying. That she had reasons completely independent from the President's for wanting to avoid testimony. That the President did not ask her to lie or promise her a job for her silence. 
   What did Ms. Lewinsky say about the return of the gifts given to her by the President? That she raised with the President whether she should turn the gifts over to Ms. Currie. That she recalls that the President may have advised her to turn them all over to the Jones lawyers. That she told an FBI agent of this advice, but it somehow was omitted from the Independent Counsel's investigative report. That six days before her White House meeting with the President, she had already made an independent decision to withhold gifts from her own lawyer. 
   What did Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan say about the job search for Ms. Lewinsky? That it was never connected to the preparation of her affidavit, much less conditioned on her making any false statements to a court. 
   What did Mr. Jordan say about any pressure placed on the companies he contacted to hire Ms. Lewinsky? That he only recommended her. That two companies he contacted would not hire her. That the third company, which did hire her, did so on the strength of an interview in which she made a strong personal impression--much like the one she made to the Managers in their first meeting with her. 
   These witnesses--the House's witnesses--made it impossible, I believe, for the Managers to sustain a case already weakened by a defective House  process, serious inconsistencies in their arguments, and doubts about its merits that even some of the Managers themselves candidly expressed. 
   Surely a case for removal of the President must be stronger. 
   Surely a case for conviction must be strong enough to unite the Senate and the public behind the most momentous of constitutional decisions. 
   Surely a case to remove the President from office must be strong enough to meet the high standards established with such care by the Constitution's framers. 
   In requiring that the Senate remove only for ``high'' crimes and misdemeanors, the framers acted with care. As the House Judiciary Committee stated in its Watergate report 25 years ago, ``[I]mpeachment is a constitutional remedy addressed to serious offenses against the system of government.'' Its purpose is to protect our constitutional form of government, not to punish a President. 
   It is for this reason that the framers made clear that not all offenses by a Chief Executive are ``high'' crimes--and that even a President who may have violated the law, but not the Constitution, remains subject to criminal and civil legal process after he or she leaves office. 
   Whatever legal consequences may follow from this President's actions, the case made by the House Managers does not satisfy the exacting standard for removal. 
   For all of these reasons, I will vote to acquit on both articles. 
   This is my constitutional judgment about whether the Senate should remove the President from office. My personal judgment of the President's actions is something altogether different, reflecting my values and those of South Dakotans and millions of Americans. 
   Like them, I am extraordinarily disappointed, and angered, by the President's behavior. Since I have long considered the President a friend, my own sense of betrayal could not run more deeply. 
   There is no question that the President's deplorable actions should be condemned by the Senate. 
   I fervently hope that the Senate will do what the House would not--permit the people's elected representatives to express themselves and reflect their constituents' views on the President's conduct, for the benefit of our generation and those still to come. 
   So let us proceed now to a vote and resolve this constitutional task after these long and arduous months. Then the time will have come to return to the urgent work of the country. 
   When we do, I believe that all of us--members of the majority and members of the minority, however we choose to cast our votes--will be able to agree on this: 
   That in 1999, 100 Senators acted as the Constitution required, honoring their oath to do impartial justice and acting in the best interests of this country they so dearly love.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know I speak for all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, sharing the expressions of gratitude that Senator LOTT has just articulated for all of our staff. They have done a remarkable job. He mentioned all those who work for all of us. Let me mention a couple of people who work for those of us on this side: Bob Bower, Bill Corr, Pete Rouse, Marty Paone, and so many people who were particularly responsible for the fact that we were able to conduct our work so effectively throughout this very difficult challenge. 
   So on behalf of the Democratic Caucus, we join with Senator LOTT in expressing our deep sense of gratitude for the great, great job that they have done in these difficult weeks that we have now concluded. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today's votes on the Articles of Impeachment mark the end of a long and difficult journey. The story of this impeachment process suggests a number of lessons on which I expect we will all reflect individually and collectively for some time. 
   From the beginning of this process, I objected in the clearest terms to the President's legal hairsplitting and attempts to find a legal excuse, or any excuse, for his deplorable personal conduct. In my view, the President violated the public trust and brought dishonor to the office he holds. For that, he will have to answer to the people of this country, and to history. 
   But it was every senator's duty to put personal views aside and render impartial justice, based on constitutional standards and the evidence before the Senate. In my view, the President's conduct did not, under our Constitution, warrant his removal from office. Others, acting on equally sincere motives, reached a different conclusion. 
   It is regrettable that something about this process led to a situation, particularly in Washington, where sincere voices on both sides were too often drowned out by partisan voices--again, on both sides. But, if we listen to voices outside the nation's capital, the  voices of citizens rather than of partisans, those voices tell us that something has gone terribly wrong in our public discourse. 
   Those citizens see the impeachment process not as a solemn constitutional event, which it assuredly was, but rather as another sad episode in the sorry saga of a bitter, partisan and negative political process that runs on the fuel of scandal. In this sense, to many Americans, the Starr investigation, and the impeachment process it spawned, were all too familiar. 
   To much of the American public, this whole process was a long-running, 50-million-dollar negative ad built on personal attacks, the likes of which Americans regret and reject. 
   I know this belief is shared by thousands of South Dakotans and millions of Americans who hold widely varying views of what the outcome of the impeachment proceeding should have been--conviction or acquittal, removal or continued service by the President to the conclusion of his term. 
   What are the elements, the component parts, of this political process that so many Americans judge to be merely an ugly spectacle increasingly unworthy of their participation? What is making Americans so cynical that they are voting in record-low numbers and tuning out the government meant to serve them? 
   Surely they must be concerned about the increased use, and misuse, of the legal process in our political process. They are no longer certain they can distinguish the proper application of the law to address real wrongdoing properly before the courts from the hijacking of the law to bludgeon political opponents and extend the battlefield of political attack. 
   In just ten years, we have seen the public careers of three House Speakers, representing both political parties, destroyed by scandal. As the process has escalated, Independent Counsels have pursued members of Presidents' cabinets--of both parties--and then, the President of the United States himself. 
   We have watched what we all acknowledge as ``the politics of personal destruction'' threaten to devour our democratic ideals. 
   We can, and we will, argue the merits of the Independent Counsel statute when it comes up for reauthorization this session. We can, and we will, continue to pursue those who are corrupt, who use their offices for personal gain, or who otherwise deserve punishment. 
   But the law must be preserved as an instrument for the rendering of justice, not manipulated to serve as another readily accessible weapon to be used against political adversaries. 
   And the law should not become a substitute for elections. Political choices in this country must remain in the hands of the people of this country, not conveyed to prosecutors and lawyers. 
   It is not the law's fault that there has been a hardening of position and a commitment to win at any cost. To paraphrase our former colleague Dale Bumpers' now famous declaration in his presentation to the Senate, ``Sometimes we want to win too badly.'' 
   It is time for elected officials to ask themselves, ``Does anyone in this country really feel as though they have been winners in this seemingly interminable process of investigation, media spectacle and impeachment controversy?" 
   I hope we can keep Senator Bumpers' words in mind and honor each other with the same degree of commitment that we bring to our disagreements. I hope we can persuade without spinning; that we can argue without shouting; that we can dissent without dividing. 
   We can be passionate in our beliefs without prosecuting those who believe differently. 
   There were no winners in this impeachment process, but there were plenty of losers. There are good people who have accumulated thousands of dollars in legal bills as a result of the years of investigating the President. There are good people--on both sides of the aisle--whose private lives will be never be private again. There are people whose reputations have been battered and beaten. 
   I hope we can keep those people in mind and call for--indeed, insist upon--a truce in the political wars. We need now to think about what we owe ourselves, each other and the public as we move--and I hope without further delay--to address the true agenda of the American people.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Francis Burk for his nearly three decades of service to the United States Senate and to wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his life. 
   Frank Burk began his career with the Senate Office of Legislative Counsel in June 1970. For more than 25 years, Frank was the primary drafter in the Senate of legislation relating to banking, securities, housing, mass transportation, and small business. Senator BYRD, as President pro tempore of the Senate, appointed Frank as Legislative Counsel of the Senate on January 1, 1991. He continued to serve in that position until his retirement on December 31, 1998. 
   Mr. President, Frank Burk is one of the dedicated public servants who serve the Senate for years and who become sources of knowledge and expertise for all Senators and staff. They are our institutional memory: those who allow us to proceed from Congress to Congress with a sense of history and continuity. Our jobs would be even more difficult without people like Frank. 
   I know I speak for other Senators and for staff when I say we will miss Frank Burk.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also wish to extend my best wishes to Mr. David G. Marcos on the occasion of his retirement. 
   Mr. Marcos has had a long career of distinguished service to the Senate, under both Republican and Democratic majorities. He worked hard to discharge whatever responsibilities were assigned him, whether as Executive Clerk, Assistant Executive Clerk, Keeper of Stationery, or in other responsible positions. For 39 years, David provided dedicated service to the Senate, and I know that I speak for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, when I commend him for his long and dedicated service. Undoubtedly, Dave has seen many changes and improvements in the administrative operations of the Senate over his long career. He can be rightfully proud of the contributions he has made to the improvements in the Office of the Executive Clerk and the Senate Stationery Room. Again, I offer my best congratulations to Dave. May he enjoy many years of health and happiness in his retirement.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Thursday, January 21 marked the end of Thomas Pellikaan's Senate career. 
   Over the past 35 years, Tom Pellikaan served the Senate with distinction in various capacities--first as Senate press liaison and then at the Office of the Daily Digest, where he spent the majority of his Capitol Hill career. He advanced from a staff assistant in the Daily Digest office to serve as Editor of the Daily Digest since 1989. 
   Tom's attention to detail is well known around the halls of the Senate. His office has the responsibility of ensuring that the information contained in the Daily Digest section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD reflects the actions taken on any given day in the Senate. The Daily Digest is an important and useful tool for the Senate family. Tom and his staff are to be complimented for the excellent job they have done and will continue to do. 
   While Tom has left the Senate, I am sure his interest in the Senate will continue. On behalf of my Democratic colleagues, we wish him well as he enjoys the ``country life'' on his farm in Culpeper, VA.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this resolution honoring one of the towering figures of our time. 
   Peace-loving people throughout the world feel a deep sadness over the death of Jordan's King Hussein. By the sheer force of his personal and political courage, he changed the world for the better. 
   None of us will ever forget how he rose from his sickbed at the Mayo Clinic last fall and came to the Wye River peace talks when those talks seemed in danger of collapse. Those who were there say he restored to those talks a sense that peace was not only possible, but worth making great sacrifices for, and taking extraordinary risks for. 
   His was a clear voice for moderation, tolerance and accommodation as he urged the two sides to work for peace. His admonition that there had been ``enough destruction, enough death, enough waste'' helped bridge the gap and forge an agreement. 
   King Hussein himself took a risk for peace in 1994, when he forged the historic peace agreement between Jordan and Israel. 
   Another image we will perhaps always remember is the picture of King Hussein kneeling not long ago at the feet of an Israeli father whose child had been killed by Jordanian border guards, and apologizing to the man for his loss. He was a noble man and, at the same time, a humble man. 
   He was also a man of great vision and skill. When he became the King, the Hashemite kingdom enjoyed little of what it has now. 
   In just a generation and a half, he created in Jordan a system of schools and roads and all the other infrastructure of a modern state. 
   King Hussein was a true friend of the United States. And, like all friends, we did not always see eye-to-eye on every matter. 
   In the end, however, it is not our differences with him that we remember. It is how he inspired people to come together despite their differences. 
   A man small in physical stature, he walked among us like a giant.  
   The world is diminished by his passing. 
   We will miss him greatly. 
   Today, as King Hussein is buried, we offer our prayers and sympathy to his family--especially Queen Noor and each of his children--and to all the people of his beloved Jordan. 
   We also pledge to work closely with King Abdullah and the Jordanian people to protect King Hussein's legacy. We must continue our efforts to promote peace in the Middle East, including implementing the Wye River Peace Accord, which would not have been possible without his courage. 
   Finally, I hope we will work expeditiously to approve the aid to Jordan that was agreed to at Wye as a tangible demonstration of our support for King Abdullah and our ongoing commitment to peace in the Middle East. 
   Our friend is gone, but his spirit lives on in the fragile Middle East peace. Let us nurture it and help it grow, in his name and in his memory.

   Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader. I thank our Chaplain for his gracious prayer. 
   The presence of Scott Bates in that chair and in our lives is something most of us have counted on each and every day. As the majority leader so eloquently said, he, Scott, served the Senate, our country, and each of us so admirably for the last 30 years. Who can forget that resonant voice? Who can forget the call of the roll? Who can forget the authority with which he articulated each of our names? The answer is--no one. 
   When Scott began his service, Senator Mansfield was the majority leader and Senator Hugh Scott the minority leader. Ever since that time, Scott was  an integral part of the history created in this Chamber and certainly an integral part of our Senate family. He grew up with small town values, active in his church and Boy Scouts. He loved politics and school and served as a page in both the House and the Senate in the Arkansas Legislature. Scott's love of politics came naturally for him. His father actually served as a member of the Arkansas State Legislature. In 1970 he came here as a summer intern for Senator John McClellan, in the bill clerk's office, and began his work for us in 1973. 
   Today, we send our thoughts and our prayers to his wife, Ricki, who remains in the hospital, and to their three children, Lisa, Lori, and Paul, and his family in Arkansas, who are now dealing with this tragic loss.

Her motion would restrict both managers to transcripts, written transcripts. I am not sure in which order her motion should be offered, but since it relates to the third one, perhaps it would be in concert with that motion.

    Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 9 years ago Congress took the landmark step of extending benefits through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 (RECA) to thousands of American victims of the Cold War who were unknowingly and wrongly exposed to life-threatening levels of radiation and other harmful materials as part of our nation's nuclear weapons program. 
   This law was long overdue, and was an important step by Congress to acknowledge the federal government's responsibility for its failure to warn or take adequate steps to protect victims of radioactive fallout from weapons testing and underground uranium miners who breathed harmful levels of radon as they worked to supply our nuclear weapons program. The law makes individuals who have developed cancer or other health problems as a result of their exposure to radiation eligible for up to $100,000 in compensation from the government. 
   In the 9 years since the passage of that bill, we have had time to reflect upon its strengths and its shortcomings. During that time, it has become overwhelmingly clear that we have not fully met our obligation to victims of our nuclear program. Most seriously, we have arbitrarily and unfairly limited compensation for underground miners to those in only 5 states, despite the fact that underground miners in other states such as South Dakota faced exactly the same risk to their health. This fact alone requires us to amend RECA so that we can right this wrong.  
   However, we have also excluded other groups of workers, and their surviving families, from compensation for serious health problems and, in some cases, deaths, that have resulted from their work to help defend our nation. Many of those who worked in uranium mills, for example, have developed serious respiratory problems as a result of exposure to uranium dusts and silica. Concerns have been raised about above-ground miners and uranium transportation workers as well. 
   It is the obligation of the 106th Congress to continue the work of the 101st. Not only is it incumbent upon us to extend the law to compensate underground miners unfairly left out of the original legislation, we need to extend the law to cover new groups of workers who face similar risks to their health. It is for that reason that I am joining with Senator BINGAMAN today to sponsor the Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act of 1999. This legislation will expand RECA to cover underground miners in all states, as well as surface miners, transportation workers and uranium mill workers who have had health problems as a result of their work with uranium. I hope my colleagues will join us to pass this legislation quickly. 
   I also feel an obligation to correct the historical record. During my review of the scientific literature on the uranium industry and of testimony before Congress, I was concerned to see that South Dakota's former uranium industry has gone virtually unnoticed by the rest of the nation despite the fact that South Dakotans who worked in the industry appear to be suffering exactly the same long-term health consequences as residents of other states. For that reason, I would like to take a moment to outline the history of uranium mining and processing in my state. 
   Uranium was first discovered in South Dakota in the summer of 1951, along the fringe of the Black Hills where grasslands uplift into pine forest. As you know, 1951 was a difficult time in American history. The Cold War with the Soviet Union was deepening, and the United States was rapidly expanding its arsenal of nuclear weapons. To supply this new weapons program, the United States adopted a program of government price supports to create a domestic uranium industry under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). 
   Almost immediately, South Dakota became one of the AEC's suppliers. After uranium was discovered in South Dakota, the AEC established an office in Hot Springs to conduct airborne radiometric surveys, and small-scale prospecting began. South Dakota's first uranium ore was shipped by rail to Colorado for processing, until an ore-buying station was established by the AEC in the town of Edgemont in December of 1952. A uranium mill was constructed in Edgemont shortly afterwards. 
   Uranium mining and milling continued for nearly two decades in my state. According to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, there were over 100 uranium mines in the vicinity of Edgemont, of which at least 22 were underground. In their 20 years of operation between 1953 and 1973, these mines produced nearly 1 million short tons of ore and just over 3 million pounds of processed uranium. 
   Ore from South Dakota's mines was processed at the mill in Edgemont. According to a document provided to me by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which later acquired the mill and the responsibility for its cleanup, ``From 1956 through 1972 (when the uranium circuit was shut down and the mill stopped producing uranium concentrates), approximately 2,500,000 tons of mill tailings were produced onsite. Of this total, approximately 2,050,000 tons--82 percent--were produced under contract with the AEC for defense purposes. In fact, all of the uranium concentrates produced through December 31, 1966, and a portion of those produced until 1968 were sold to the AEC. The remaining 450,000 tons of mill tailings--18 percent--were produced under contracts for commercial sales.'' 
   Mr. President, much of this information was difficult to come by, and to ensure that all those who need it in the future have full access to it. 
   As these records make clear, for over 20 years South Dakota played a significant role in supplying uranium for our nation's nuclear weapons program. Yet rarely will you find South Dakota mentioned in any of the debate over the long-term consequences of that program. I am determined to change that fact, and to ensure that all South Dakotans, and other individuals across the country, who are suffering from poor health, or who are surviving relatives of uranium workers who have died as a result of their work, are fairly compensated by the federal government for their losses. 
   As my colleagues know, in RECA Congress officially recognized that ``the lives and health of uranium miners and of individuals who were exposed to radiation were subjected to increased risk of injury and disease to serve the national security interests of the United States.'' However, the law only makes this determination for fallout victims and for underground uranium miners in 5 states. I believe it must be broadened to include underground uranium miners in all states. This is a matter of simple fairness. I can find no reasonable explanation for the failure of the law to include South Dakota and other states that had underground uranium mines whose workers would have been exposed to unsafe levels of radon. In addition, the law should be broadened to include uranium mill workers, surface miners and transportation workers to ensure that all those who may be suffering from health problems as a result of exposure to uranium dust or other harmful materials are compensated fairly. While there are strong grounds on which to expand the act to include all of these groups of workers, it is helpful to examine closely the evidence supporting the inclusion of one of these groups--mill workers--to better understand our reasons for seeking this change. 
   The grounds for expanding the act to include mill workers are largely the same as those which led Congress to pass RECA 9 years ago. The United States government, which created the domestic uranium industry through price supports in order to supply its nuclear weapons program, failed to adequately warn mill workers of potential risks to their health, to take reasonable measures to create a safe working environment, or to act on initial warnings and conduct long-term studies of mill workers to determine whether their health was being affected by their work. 
   The federal government recognized the potential risks of uranium production from the onset of our nuclear program, and in 1949 the Public Health Service (PHS) initiated a study of both underground miners and millers to determine whether they were suffering from any adverse health effects. Troublingly, a decision was also made by the federal government not to inform workers that their health could be at risk. As Senior District Judge Copple noted in his decision in Begay v. United States, ``In order to proceed with the epidemiological study, it was necessary to obtain the consent and voluntary cooperation of all mine operators. To do this, it was decided by PHS under the Surgeon General that the individual miners would not be told of possible potential hazards from radiation in the mines for fear that many miners would quit and others would be difficult to secure because of fear of cancer. This would seriously interrupt badly needed production of uranium.'' While the court's decision does not make clear whether that same decision applied to uranium millers, subsequent research has shown that over 80 percent of former mill workers felt they were not informed about the hazards of radiation during their employment. 
   The early results of this study, as described in a May 1952 report entitled, ``An Interim Report of a Health Study of the Uranium Mines and Mills,'' are disturbing. It notes that, ``In 1950, 13.8 percent of the white miners and 26.5 percent of the white millers showed more than the usual pulmonary fibrosis, as compared to 7.5 percent in a control group. In the same year, 20 percent of the Indian millers and 13.2 percent of the Indian miners showed more than the usual pulmonary fibrosis, as against none in the controls. Such a finding would indicate a tendency on the part of these individuals to develop silicosis from their exposure.'' Given these and other findings, the study notes the ``need for repeating the medical studies at frequent intervals.'' 
   It is inexplicable to me that these critical follow-up studies which were so  strongly recommended by the Public Health Service took place only for underground uranium miners. No long-term, follow-up studies of uranium millers were conducted. This decision was made despite the fact that it was well established that uranium millers were being exposed to uranium dusts and silica, which increase the risk of non-malignant lung disease. 
   One of the reasons the health problems of mill workers appear to have been so neglected is that most officials assumed that risks could be controlled by adopting standards to prevent workers from breathing or swallowing dust produced by yellowcake or uranium ore. As the 1952 PHS study states, ``In general, it may be said that there are no health hazards in the mills which cannot be controlled by accepted industrial hygiene methods.'' Noting poor dust control in the mills, the PHS study concluded, ``Until adequate dust control has been established at this operation, the workers should be required to wear approved dust respirators. Daily baths and frequent changes of clothing by the workers in this area are also indicated.'' 
   These recommendations appear to have been largely ignored. Recent studies of former uranium mill workers by Gary Madsen, Susan Dawson and Bryan Spykerman of the University of Utah paint a devastating picture of workplace conditions in uranium mills prior to the enforcement of stringent safety standards in the 1970's. Eighty percent of former mill workers interviewed by the researchers for one study said they were never informed about possible effects of radiation. Of workers who reported working in dusty conditions, 35 percent did not wear respirators, and 20 percent wore them infrequently or said they were not always available. Sixty-eight percent reported moderate to heavy amounts of dust on their clothing at work, and virtually all workers reported bringing their dust-covered clothes home to be washed. One respondent noted, ``We washed the clothes once a week. It was messy. We were expecting our first child. I had to shake my clothes outside. There was yellow sand left at the bottom of the washer. All of the clothes were washed together. Nobody told us the uranium was dangerous--a problem. My wife would get yellowcake on her. I would remove my coveralls in the kitchen. Put them in with the rest of the [family's] laundry.'' Others reported regularly seeing workers outside the mills with yellowcake under their fingernails or in their ears. 
   Mr. President, the dangerous conditions revealed by these studies show an inexcusable failure on the part of the federal government to ensure safe working conditions in an industry it created and controlled. And despite failing to enforce these standards or to even inform workers of the risk to their health, the government nonetheless decided to end long-term studies monitoring the health of mill workers. As a result, only a few studies have been conducted of the health impacts that uranium milling has had on workers. Dr. Larry Fine, Director of the Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, summarized the results of these studies in recent testimony before Congress: 
   ``Health concerns for uranium millers center on their exposures to uranium dusts and silica. Exposure to silica and relatively insoluble uranium compounds may increase the millers' risk of non-malignant respiratory disease, while exposure to relatively soluble forms of uranium may increase their risk of kidney disease. The two mortality studies of uranium millers have not had adequate population size or adequate time since exposure to detect even a moderate risk of lung cancer if present; neither study reported an elevated risk of lung cancer. One of the two completed mortality studies of millers found an increased risk for cancer of the lymphatic and hematopoietic organs (excluding leukemia), and the other found an increased risk for non-malignant respiratory disease and accidents. A non-significant excess in deaths from chronic kidney disease was also observed in the second study. There have been two medical studies of uranium millers, one of which found evidence for pulmonary fibrosis (possibly due to previous mining) and the other of which found evidence for kidney damage.'' 
   I am deeply concerned by our failure to study uranium mill workers more thoroughly and by the indications given by the evidence we do have that these workers are suffering long-term health consequences as a result of their work on behalf of our country. Unfortunately, it may now be too late to gather more conclusive evidence. These workers are growing older and some are now dying. Their numbers have grown so small that it may no longer be possible to conduct the type of conclusive study that should have been done years ago. We owe these mill workers the benefit of the doubt and should make them or their surviving families eligible for the same compensation that underground miners receive. 
   Indeed, I have heard from many South Dakotans who have waited long enough for compensation. They tell me of former miners and mill workers who have died of cancer or who suffer from respiratory disease they believe is directly related to their exposure to harmful materials in their workplace. 
   One of the most tragic stories I have heard was written to me in a letter from Sharon Kane, a widow in Sturgis, South Dakota. After working for 11 years in Edgemont's uranium mill, her husband, Joe, developed severe respiratory problems and was forced to leave his work at the mill. Unfortunately, his health problems continued. Joe died of bone cancer in 1987. 
   It is difficult for me to understand why or how our country let this happen. However, it is now up to us to ensure that all those who have suffered as a result of our nation's actions are fairly compensated. We must expand RECA to include uranium mill workers and other groups of workers who are suffering as a result of their exposure to uranium dust or other materials. We also must ensure the law is expanded to include underground uranium miners in all states. By doing so we can make good on our debt to workers who have sacrificed their health--and sometimes their lives--during the height of the Cold War in order to protect their country. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in the effort to meet these goals.

    Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Thursday, January 21 marked the end of Thomas Pellikaan's Senate career. 
   Over the past 35 years, Tom Pellikaan served the Senate with distinction in various capacities--first as Senate press liaison and then at the Office of the Daily Digest, where he spent the majority of his Capitol Hill career. He advanced from a staff assistant in the Daily Digest office to serve as Editor of the Daily Digest since 1989. 
   Tom's attention to detail is well known around the Halls of the Senate. His office has the responsibility of ensuring that the information contained in the Daily Digest section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD reflects the actions taken on any given day in the Senate. The Daily Digest is an important and useful tool for the Senate family. Tom and his staff are to be complimented for the excellent job they have done and will continue to do. 
   While Tom has left the Senate, I am sure his interest in the Senate will continue. On behalf of my Democratic colleagues, we wish him well as he enjoys the ``country life'' on his farm in Culpeper, VA.

    Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate must bid goodbye today to an excellent group of young men and women who served as United States Senate Pages this last fall and winter. 
   This group of pages observed a number of important and historic debates in the last few months. Since the beginning of last fall, the Senate has debated measures to reform our nation's bankruptcy laws, to govern commerce over the Internet, and to provide funding for the varied programs of the United States government, among others. Of course, in the last few weeks, these pages have seen history being made in the impeachment trial of a President for only the second time since our government was founded. But pages are not just passive observers. They are active participants in the daily operations of the United States Senate. 
   Mr. President, a page's life is certainly not easy. They are up before dawn, at page school at 6:15 am, then here in the Senate for the rest of the day. While they are here, their duties run the gamut. They help set up the chamber, deliver messages all over the Capitol complex, and help things function smoothly here on the Senate floor and in the cloakrooms. During their limited down time, they often try to sneak in a few minutes of homework. At the end of their long day, it is back to the dorm for more homework, a little down time, and a little sleep before they wake up and do it again the next day.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator LEAHY and several other Democratic Senators in introducing the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999. Thanks in large part to the legacy of success that Senate Democrats have had in the area of anti-crime legislation, the crime rate in this country has been going down for six consecutive years. This is the longest such period of decline in 25 years, and the comprehensive crime bill that we are introducing will build on this success and reduce crime even further. 
   Despite the decrease in crime throughout the last six years, juvenile crime and drug abuse continue to be problems that weigh heavily on the minds of the American people. In my home state of South Dakota, there has been a particularly alarming increase in juvenile crime, and I have been working extensively with community leaders and concerned parents to focus public attention on this issue. Now is the time when we must target the real needs of American families and communities, and I believe that the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 will do just that. This bill will reduce crime by targeting violent crime in our schools, reforming the juvenile justice system, combating gang violence, cracking down on the  sale and use of illegal drugs, strengthening the rights of crime victims, and giving police and prosecutors more tools and resources to fight crime. In addition, this bill would build on one of the most successful initiatives of the 1994 Crime Act by extending the authorization for the COPS program so that an additional 25,000 police officers can be deployed on our streets in the coming years. We will soon meet the commitment that we made in the 1994 Crime Act to put 100,000 new police officers on the beat across America--under budget and ahead of schedule--and we should build on that success. Putting more police officers on the streets, however, is not enough. 
   Unfortunately, in the last few years, our schools have been plagued by tragic shootings far too many times. These senseless tragedies must be stopped, and the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 targets violent crime in schools by providing technical assistance in schools, reforming the juvenile justice system, assisting states in prosecuting and punishing juvenile offenders and reducing juvenile crime, while also protecting children from violence. 
   Moreover, we must stop street gangs from spreading fear in our neighborhoods and interfering with our livelihoods. A recent report by the Department of Justice indicates that more than 846,000 gang members belong to 31,000 youth gangs in the United States, and the numbers appear to be growing. The ramifications of this trend could be disastrous. For this reason, an important provision of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 would crack down on gangs by making the interstate ``franchising'' of street gangs a crime. It will also double the criminal penalties for using or threatening physical violence against witnesses and contains other provisions designed to facilitate the use and protection of witnesses to help prosecute gangs and other violent criminals. The Act also provides funding for law enforcement agencies in communities designated by the Attorney General as areas with a high level of interstate gang activity. 
   We can also do more to keep our children off the street and out of trouble. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 will do just that by providing additional funding for proven prevention programs in crime-prone areas and creating after school ``safe havens'' where children are protected from drugs, gangs and crime with activities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence training. In this way, we can provide kids with coaches and mentors now, so that they will not need judges and wardens later. This makes sense for our children, this makes sense for our communities, and this makes sense for our future. 
   There are many other provisions in the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999 that will make a real difference--a positive difference--in the lives of the people of this country. This comprehensive bill is a vital part of our ongoing effort to secure the safety of our schools, streets and citizens, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for 3 full days now, this Senate has been sitting as a court of impeachment. We are only the second Senate in the history of our nation to sit in judgment of a President, and the first Senate ever to consider impeaching an elected President. 
   Deciding, ultimately, whether to overturn a free and democratic election is almost certainly the most awesome responsibility any of us will ever be called in our public lives to fulfill. 
   But it is not the only responsibility before this Senate, Mr. President. On many other urgent issues--from improving our children's schools, to passing HMO reform, to saving Social Security--the American people are waiting for us to act. They've been waiting--frankly, for too long. So today, on behalf of my fellow Democratic Senators, I am introducing our first bills of the 106th Congress. 
   Our proposals target the real needs of America's families and communities. They are relevant, not revolutionary. If they seem familiar, it's because most of what is in them we first introduced in the last Congress. But they did not pass, despite the support of the American people and, in some cases, by a bipartisan majority of Senators. We offer them again in this Congress because the need for them has not diminished. In fact, it has grown.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join with my colleagues to introduce the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. 
   First, let me commend my colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, for all of his work to develop this legislation. This bill addresses some of the critical threats to wildlife habitat and species diversity and demonstrates his commitment, which I strongly share, to solving the many challenges we face in this regard. 
   The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act will help to ensure that some of our most valuable and beautiful species of birds--those that most of us take for granted, including bluebirds, goldfinches, robins and orioles--may overcome the challenges posed by habitat destruction and thrive for generations to come. It is not widely recognized that many North American bird species once considered common are in decline. In fact, a total of 90 species of migratory birds are listed as endangered or threatened in the United States, and another 124 species are considered to be of high conservation concern. 
   The main cause of this decline is the loss of critical habitat throughout our hemisphere. Because these birds range across international borders, it is essential that we work with nations in Latin America and the Caribbean to establish protected stopover areas during their emigrations. This bill achieves that goal by fostering partnerships between businesses, nongovernmental organizations and other nations to bring together the capital and expertise needed to preserve habitat throughout our hemisphere. 
   As we begin the 106th Congress, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It has been endorsed by the National Audubon Society, the American Bird Conservancy and the Ornithological Council. I believe that it will substantially improve upon our ability to maintain critical habitat in our hemisphere and help to halt the decline of these important species.

   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for those of us granted the rare privilege of representing our citizens as United States Senators, the convening of a new Congress is a moment filled with hope and optimism. I know this is a sentiment shared by my colleagues who have served here together for many years; I am equally certain it is a feeling in the heart of every new member whom we welcome into the Chamber today. 
   We all choose to enter public service in the belief that small differences made every day somehow contribute in large measure to the betterment of our national life. For me, this has always been a day that represented great promise and potential. 
   And despite the difficult circumstances that confront us on the first day of the 106th Congress, I choose to face the grim task of the impeachment proceedings with a sense of hope and optimism, too. 
   It is my sincere hope that we can continue to be guided in the Senate by a completely nonpartisan approach to our responsibilities--and I pledge the cooperation of the entire Democratic caucus in that effort. We remain optimistic that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can come together on a sensible plan that adheres to the principles of fairness, expedition and due process. 
   The promise of bipartisan consensus is within our grasp. If we succeed in coming to closure on an acceptable resolution to govern these proceedings, then we have the potential for not only ending this unfortunate episode, but for laying a foundation for rebuilding a working coalition to address the critical policy issues that so demand our absolute attention. 
   But to complete the work at hand, we must first set some things aside. We must set aside our partisan instincts. We should reject any notion of political advantage in this process, and act solely in the national interest. 
   We must set aside feelings of grave disappointment and anger directed at the President for his actions. We must also set aside the resentment many feel over the manner and method of the long investigation that begat these articles of impeachment. 
   Regrettably, we must also set aside--until this matter is resolved--important legislative work on matters like education, health care, Medicare and Social Security. This, in and of itself, should serve to motivate us to proceed with deliberate dispatch on these articles, accepting not even a day's delay in the coming trial. 
   And finally, we should set aside the rancor and recriminations that have marked these sad deliberations, and rise to a level of dignity and decency that will be judged favorably in history's long light. 
   But we will not set aside our responsibility. We will not defer our duty. 
   Make no mistake: Senate Democrats will follow the Constitution. We intend to abide by the Senate's procedures. We will respect past precedents. We will duly consider these articles. We will insist on fair treatment of the President. And we will hear the evidence presented by the House Republicans who have made these charges. 
   But we should not put process ahead of progress in this matter. We must  find a way to resolve this, and move forward. 
   The United States Constitution is a document that continues to reveal an uncanny resiliency after two centuries. It's as if the framers found a formula to adapt to contingencies unseen; and to circumstances unknowable. Their wisdom in drafting the Impeachment clause affords us the opportunity to seize one of the options we are considering today. If we now simply apply some common sense, we will find common ground, and the result will be the common good. 
   I have faith in the Senate, and faith in my colleagues, that we will do so. 
   The Senate may never decisively resolve this maddening legal argument; but we must find a way to end this lingering national torment. 
   As do all my colleagues, I love this country. And I care deeply for this institution, the Senate of the United States. I want to do right by both. Working together, Republican and Democrat, I think we can. 
   Just as we have sworn an oath today to put the Nation's interests above all others, tomorrow when we are sworn as judge and juror, we must do the same. That will require absolute fairness, due process, deliberate speed, and a final resolution of these charges. The Democratic caucus is committed to each and every one of those goals, and is prepared to proceed immediately toward achieving them. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
