   Mr. BURNS. I understand that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, intends to request that the Department of Commerce transfer the Internet's authoritative root server to ICANN's control. The authoritative root server is the foundation of the Internet, which cannot function without it. Would the chairman agree that the Department of Commerce should retain control of the authoritative root server until the appropriate committees of Congress have reviewed the legality, appropriateness and implications of such a transfer?

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we find ourselves in a predicament as old friends. Of course, we are this morning talking about our friend SLADE GORTON from the State of Washington. In a way, we were classmates. We came here in 1988. Of course, it was not his first time here, since he was defeated in 1986 and then came back and won reelection in 1988. 
   We had a lot of things in common--not only representing the Northwestern part of these 48 contiguous States. We also have great friendship and we served on some of the same committees. I took from him great lessons about this body and how to represent our constituencies. He and Sally have been friends with Phyllis and me for all these many years while he has been serving in his second and third terms. 
   We in Montana have a quality that I think will become more and more admired as this country grows and matures. We are brutally honest with each other in that part of the world. I spent my time in business--in the cattle business and the auction business. People will just tell it like it is. If you like it, that is fine. If you don't like it, well, that's the way it is. SLADE GORTON is that kind of a person. He is probably the most pragmatic of all of our Members with whom I have had an opportunity to serve in this body, and he is brutally honest. 
   I have made speeches before graduating classes and a lot of other places, and I am always interested in the way people treat the history of our country. We have revisionists who like to gloss over some of the warts, the bruises, and the bumps this country has encountered in all its history. That is not to say it is not the best country in the world, but we have historians who tend to revise things. 
   As you know, for those who do not study history and have little or no institutional knowledge of our country and the way it was built, one has to remember that we make decisions based on history and it affects all of us in the future. I have often said those folks who tend to revise history also tend to tinker with the compass of our Nation, because our decisions are still based on history. SLADE, being the bright and honest man that he is, understands this body and this country so well. He understands our history as it truly is, not as revisionists would have us believe. And I hope historians pay him the same respect and remember him as the great man and great Senator that we know today. 
   As you know, many years ago when his family was young and he was a little younger, SLADE took a bicycle trip from Olympia, WA, to Boston, MA. I  said, ``That is a long trip, SLADE.'' He said, ``It was. We spent all of it in Montana.'' It is a very long State. In fact, from the Yaak to Alzada, MT, it is further than it is from Chicago to Washington, DC, as the crow flies. 
   But that tells you something about the man, and it also tells you something about the family. 
   Nobody in this body has fought harder for property rights, the cornerstone of a free society; fought harder for States' rights; and for what he offered in education to take the money that flows from what I call ``17 square miles of logic-free environment'' to the local communities to let the local communities decide how to use that money. If they need teachers, they could hire teachers. If they need bricks and mortar, they could build. But the decisions on how to use those dollars at the local level should be made at the local level to fill their needs. Nobody fought harder for that. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. STEVENS, a while ago alluded to the fact that in this body there are show horses and workhorses. And all of us know that SLADE is a workhorse. I will tell you, you couldn't hook him wrong, and he worked from both sides of the tongue. There will be some folks who will figure that out and some folks who never will. But it is a quality that every Senator should have. 
   I remember his fight to keep Mariners baseball in Seattle. They could have lost that ball team had it not been for his efforts to save professional baseball in Seattle, because it was important to him and it was important to his people. 
   He will be missed here. What he leaves with a lot of us will be used for many years to come. 
   We don't say goodbye to our friends, we just say so long, because our trails will cross later on in our lives. The friendship forged between the Gortons and I will never be forgotten. We will miss him, and we wish him well. But his influence on this body will be felt for years to come. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Madam President, the conference report for the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary appropriations bill provides that $5 million is appropriated for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Rural Outreach Program at the Small Business Administration, SBA. Given how this legislation evolved, I believe that clarification is needed as to how the Conferees intend that the SBA spend such money. 
   Next year, there will be two programs at the SBA that focus on small high-technology business outreach: The Federal and State Technology Partnership (FAST) program and the SBIR Rural Outreach Program. While the FAST program and the Rural Outreach Program share the similar goal of facilitating the development of small high-technology businesses, they are separate programs and the FAST program is much broader in scope than the Rural Outreach Program. The FAST program is a competitive matching-grant program that provides states with wide latitude to develop strategies to assist in the growth of their small business high-technology sectors. In contrast, the Rural Outreach Program is targeted at only those states that receive the fewest SBIR awards and is limited to funding activities to encourage small firms in those states to participate in the SBIR program. My state of Montana has benefitted greatly from the Rural Outreach Program and it is very important that this program be funded. 
   The FAST program, which has been included in SBIR legislation that has  been separately passed by both the Senate and the House and which I anticipate will be enacted prior to Congress adjourning, was initially appropriated $5 million in the bill reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee. In the conference report, it appears that the funds appropriated for both the FAST program and the Rural Outreach Program were inadvertently combined under the general heading of funding for the Rural Outreach Program. This is apparent because $5 million is targeted in the conference report for the Rural Outreach Program, while the authorization for that program is only $2 million. I am concerned that without clarification about how the SBA is required to spend such funds, that the SBA will use excess amounts for programs other than the FAST program and the Rural Outreach Program. Accordingly, am I correct in my interpretation that funding for the FAST Program was combined with funding for the Rural Outreach Program in the conference report and that the Conferees intend that the $5 million be used to support both programs?

    Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I support the passage of the Commerce-Justice-State conference report, which includes a bill of critical importance to rural America, the ``Local TV Act.'' The Local TV Act will create a $1.25 billion loan guarantee program that will bring local TV signals to Montana and other rural states, over satellites or other technologies, in a fiscally responsible way. 
   I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the Majority Leaders in both the Senate and the House for helping to reach completion on this issue. I should add that Senator LEAHY, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator THOMAS and Senator GRAMS have worked tirelessly on this matter. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the House for their efforts. Representative GOODLATTE was involved in every stage of the complex negotiations that took place on this bill, as were House Commerce Committee Chairman BLILEY, House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman TAUZIN, House Agriculture Committee Chairman COMBEST and Representative BOUCHER. I thank them all for helping to reach such a positive result, which was only possible through an extraordinary, bipartisan effort. 
   Providing access to local television signals is crucial to rural states. With over-the-air broadcast signals and cable delivery limited by the geography of my own state of Montana, satellite television has been a staple of our so-called ``video marketplace'' for many years. In fact, Montana has the highest penetration level of satellite television in the country at over 35 percent. 
   I initially proposed legislation in this area because I was concerned that without it, only the largest television markets in America would receive local-into-local service authorized by the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. These are the profitable cities like New York and Los Angeles with millions of television households. Currently, only the 20 largest television markets are being offered local TV signals via satellite. The two largest direct broadcaster satellite providers have announced plans to offer service to an additional 20 or 30 large markets over the next few years. 
   What about the other TV markets? There are 16 states--including my own--that do not have a single city among the top seventy markets. Because of the ``Local TV Act,'' they will now no longer be left out of the information age just because they are smaller. 
   The ability to receive local television signals is more than just having access to local sports or entertainment programming. It is a critical and immediate way to receive important local news, weather and community information. Access to local signals is particularly critical in Montana, where we experienced severe flooding last fall and sudden blizzards are always a possibility. 
   The ``Local TV Act'' reflects the belief that the loan guarantee program should not favor one technology over another and it should not pose a burden to the taxpayer. The ``Local TV Act'' is a win for consumers and for taxpayers. Earlier this year, the bill passed the Senate 97-0, a similar version passed the House by an overwhelming margin and I again thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for reaching agreement on this critical matter.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize Robert A. Ellerd--a great Montanan, a great Marine, and a great man. 
   This year, Bob will be honored as Marine of the Year by the Gallatin Valley Detachment of the Marine Corps League. Every year these Marines get together for the Marine Corps Birthday Ball in Bozeman to honor the tradition of the Marines as well as recognize one of their own. Bob certainly deserves to be the one honored. 
   Bob enlisted in the Marines in December 1941, even though he worked in an essential industry--meat packing--and could have accepted a deferment. After training in San Diego, he left for the South Pacific. There he helped guard the Samoa Islands and took part in the fierce combat in the Allied efforts to take Guadalcanal and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. 
   Later in the war, Bob used his combat experience to train other infantry before they headed to the front lines. No doubt his work helped save hundreds of lives and contributed to the victory that saved the world from tyranny. 
   There really are no words that I can say to adequately thank Bob Ellerd, but I can express my appreciation from a grateful nation. Bob is one reason we now call it the Greatest Generation, and they couldn't have a picked a better Marine of the Year. Thank you Bob, and Semper Fi.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a disaster facing many Eastern Montanans. As you are aware, Montana has faced wildfires and drought this summer. Another type of disaster has struck the upper Yellowstone Valley. This region grows and processes about one million tons of sugar beets a year. Sugar beets must be harvested before the ground freezes to ensure the quality of the product. On October 4, 2000, temperatures dropped very low and a heavy frost impacted the area. The growers who are under contract to Holly Sugar are now left without a viable crop that, under normal conditions, would bring $40 million to the area. This is the major cash crop for this part of Montana. Without this revenue, futures, jobs, and businesses will be in jeopardy. I bring this important matter to your attention today, so that you will be prepared to assist me in getting the necessary financial help to these producers whose very future may hinge on the help we can provide.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his work on the fiscal year 2001 Department of Transportation appropriations bill. The conference report we are considering today is a balanced report. The bill meets fully the congressional commitment to highway, transit and aviation spending in TEA-21 and AIR-21. 
   The bill makes transportation in our nation safer and more efficient. Our healthy economy is dependent on this bill. I would like to request one small item of clarification. The report includes a remark in the FHwA's Intelligent Transportation Systems account directing $750,000 to allow the State of Montana to complete the STARS program. This a great new program that I expect will receive national attention in the near future once long haul truck operators are made aware of the efficiencies it will provide them. 
   However, I have been made aware by my staff that the intention of these funds were to allow the State of Montana to use these funds to complete deployment of the STARS programs and also establish a GIS/GPS framework on the State's public roadways which will benefit the safety of the traveling public in Montana.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the passing of an outstanding leader in the agriculture community of Montana. I first met Ed  Kuntz and his family in the 1960's. He and his family lived in the small community of Custer, Montana. They farmed small grain, sugar beets and fed cattle. It was a typical diversified farming operation found on the many irrigation projects along the Yellowstone River. 
   Ed was a little different. He was not only of the land but was of the people who lived on the land and called it home. Just another average American of the silent Americans who served this country when asked and served his community when no one else would. Average? Not at all. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   His service to his community and neighbors did not stop at the county line. He was an excellent farmer and stockman. His love and respect for the sugar industry took him to national leadership where he was one of their most respected leaders. With the demands on the farm and dedication to a family, he still found time to work for the sugar beet industry not only for himself but his neighbors. I know first hand the impact he had on this town of Washington as he represented the many sugar growers across the country. 
   He was born May 3, 1926 in Billings, Montana. He was educated and graduated from Custer High School in 1944 and enlisted in the Army Air Corps and trained as a gunner on a B-17. While on furlough, he married his high school sweetheart, Peg Qusest. This December they would have been celebrating being married 56 years. 
   Ed became a director on the Mountain States Beet Growers Association and served 35 years on that board. He was treasurer for more years than anybody can count and president for 10 years. He also served on the board of directors of the American Sugar Beet Association in Washington, D.C. and devoted many hours away from the farming operation and family. 
   He is survived by his wife, Peg of Custer, Montana, a daughter, Belva; 2 sons, Rick and Cody. 
   By paying our respect to Ed Kuntz, we acknowledge the unsung leaders across this land who silently build a nation every day. He was just one that has been described as being a part of the greatest generation.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the achievements of two native Montanans, Mrs. Monica Joan Tranel-Michini, and Mrs. Jean Foster. 
   Mrs. Tranel-Michini is a Billings native who competed recently in the Sydney Olympics. She not only qualified for the finals of the women's single sculls, a rowing event, but she also placed sixth in the event. Six is a magic number for Monica, because she is the sixth of ten brothers and sisters. She and her family grew up on a cattle ranch just outside of the city limits of Billings, Montana. Before the age of twenty, this now established U.S. champion and Olympic finalist had not  seen a body of water larger than her family's irrigation pond. It was not until this accomplished woman attended law school in Philadelphia that she gained the passion for rowing. I salute this young woman, for her proud representation of the sport of rowing, the country, and the state of Montana. 
   Mrs. Jean Foster is another young woman from Bozeman, Montana whom I want to recognize. Joan's career in shooting was paved a little better than Monica's. Jean is from a family with world championships in shooting under their belt, her mother being a world champion in rifle shooting, and her father a two-time Olympian and a USA hall of famer in shooting. Jean represented our state and our country with distinction in the 3-position rifle event. I congratulate Jean on the effort she put forth and on her and her family's commitment to the sport of shooting.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the agricultural community across Montana was saddened this month by the passing of Frank Daniels. He was known to all of us as ``Bud''. 
   He was born and raised on the northern high plains in eastern Montana. He gave up to cancer and was 72. His daughter wrote that he left us as quietly and gently as he walked across that newly cut stubble field to be with His Lord. 
   A life long devotion to improving the lives of rural Americans and keeping farmers on the land he loved, which he valued so highly, led him to countless areas of involvement and gained him the admiration of his peers. No man or woman ever gave so much to the Montana Farmers Union than did Bud Daniels. 
   He participated in the three-year Kellogg Extension Program at Montana State University which enabled him to visit far corners of the world and taking him to China in 1976. He believed in the fraternity of agriculture. 
   His interest in farming issues and programs was generated and groomed through the Montana Farmers Union. He was president of Montana Farmers Union and vice president of National Farmers Union. He also served on the Farmers Union Mutual Insurance Companies. 
   During his years of farming and serving, he founded the Rural Policy Institute, established a cooperative curriculum at Montana State University, and developed strong ties with farm groups in foreign countries. He had a passion for travel as it was his education and his way to reach out to the rest of the world that was crying for the technology and ways to feed a hungry world. 
   We in Montana will miss him as he was the inspiration of leadership. Did we always agree? No. That was not important but the dialog and communications that enabled us to help those in need that farm and ranch was important. He would say that we are the providers and there is no higher calling on God's Earth. 
   Bud is survived by 4 daughters, Amy, Becky, Rachel, and Karen. Also by their mother, Laura Daniels of Billings, Montana.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today to join my colleague from Montana in introducing the Wheat Protein Mismeasurement Compensation Act. In 1993 the Federal Grain Inspection Service changed the technology used to determine the protein content of wheat. As a result a number of producers were harmed. 
   The issue has had our attention for a number of years, and has cumulated in a recent exercise over the past few months to find a resolution. The simple fact is that the USDA has failed to work with the farmers harmed so we can determine the actual financial impact to all producers. However, I am very confident we can address the losses shouldered by Montana's producers with the $465 million cap in this legislation. 
   My number one priority is to ensure that those producers who were harmed by the Federal Government's miscalculation are fully reimbursed for their losses. As we work this bill through the legislative process I believe we may need to readdress the section on the amount of compensation for the attorneys, but only time will tell. I believe this bill is a good step forward, and I welcome a process that will make USDA sit down face to face with these producers and compensate those that were harmed by the mismeasurements.

   Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 2796, The Water Resources Development Act of 2000. I want to thank the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator SMITH of New Hampshire, and my colleague from Montana, Senator BAUCUS for working with me to include two provisions in this year's bill. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced the Fort Peck Fish Hatchery Authorization Act of 2000. As you may know, the Fort Peck Reservoir is a very prominent feature of North Eastern Montana. The Fort Peck project was built in the 1930s to dam the Upper Missouri River. The result was a massive reservoir that spans across my great state. 
   The original authorization legislation for the Fort Peck project, and subsequent revisions and additions, left a great many promises unmet. A valley was flooded, but originally Montana was promised increased irrigation, low-cost power, and economic development. Since the original legislation, numerous laws have been enacted promising increased recreational activities on the lake, and also that the federal government would do more to support the fish and wildlife resources in the area. 
   In this day and age, economic development in rural areas is becoming more and more dependent upon recreation and strong fish and wildlife numbers. The Fort Peck area is faced with a number of realities. First, the area is in dire need of a fish hatchery. The only hatchery in the region to support warm water species is found in Miles City, Montana. It is struggling to meet the needs of the fisheries in the area, yet it continues to fall short. Additionally, an outbreak of disease or failure in the infrastructure at the Miles City hatchery would leave the entire region reeling with no secondary source to support the area's fisheries. 
   We are also faced with the reality that despite the promises given, the State of Montana has had to foot the bill for fish hatchery operations in the area. Since about 1950 the State has been funding these operations with little to no support from the Corps of Engineers. A citizens group spanning the State of Montana finally decided to make the federal government keep its promises. 
   Last year the citizens group organized, and state legislation subsequently passed to authorize the sale of a warm water fishing stamp to begin collecting funds for the eventual operation and maintenance of the hatchery. I helped the group work with the Corps of Engineers to ensure that $125,000 in last year's budget was allocated to a feasibility study for the project, and Montanans kept their end of the bargain by finding another $125,000 to match the Corps expenditure. Clearly, we are putting our money, along with our sweat, where our mouth is. 
   Recreation is part of the local economy. But the buzzword today is diversity. Diversify your economy. The Fort Peck area depends almost solely on agriculture. More irrigated acres probably aren't going to help the area pull itself up by its boot straps. But a stronger recreational and tourism industry sure will help speed things up. 
   A lot of effort has already gone into this project. A state bill has been passed. The Corps has dedicated a project manager to the project. Citizens have raised money and jumped over more hurdles than I care to count. But the bottom line is that this is a great project with immense support. It is a good investment in the area, and it  helps the federal government fulfill one thing that it ought to--its promises. 
   Unfortunately, everything we wanted wasn't included in this legislation. As I originally drafted the legislation it ensured that the federal government would pick up part of the tab for operation and maintenance. Unfortunately, as Chairman SMITH and Senator BAUCUS worked out the details of the legislation for inclusion in the Water Resources Development Act, they were unable to support this provision. I had hoped that, as in the portion of this bill dealing with the Everglades, they would allow the federal government to pick up a larger portion of the operation and maintenance overhead. 
   Second, the legislation continues to include a section for power delivery that directs the Secretary of the Army to deliver low cost Pick-Sloan project power to the hatchery. This provision in the bill has raised the concerns of the local electric co-operatives and those that use Pick-Sloan power. I have worked with the Corps and the local interests to assure that this provision is not needed as drafted. I have discussed the need for changes with both the Chairman and Senator BAUCUS. I have secured a commitment from both of them to resolve this issue when the legislation goes to conference committee. 
   Despite this shortcoming with the legislation, I am have worked hard on the hatchery project and feel it is necessary that we must move ahead as it has been included. I thank the Committee for working with me to ensure the hatchery project was included on my behalf. 
   Another Montana specific provision, recently added to the legislation, allows the Corps of Engineers and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to dispose of sites that are currently occupied by cabin leases and use the proceeds to purchase land in, or adjacent to, the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge that surrounds Fort Peck Reservoir. This provision is a classic example of a win-win situation that will help support recreation and wildlife habitat in the region. By selling these cabin sites, we are reducing government management considerations, offering stability to the cabin owners, and providing a revenue source to purchase inholdings. Senator BAUCUS and I have been working on this legislation for a few years, and to see it included in this legislation is a great accomplishment for both of us.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am honored to serve as one of this year's congressional co-chairs for National Bible Week, sponsored by the National Bible Association. This observance occurs during the week of November 19-26, 2000, the week during which Thanksgiving Day occurs. This is appropriate  since many Americans will attend houses of worship during that week to give thanksgiving. 
   As we gather to give thanks, let us remember that ``Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'' (Matthew 4:4) When we try to live by bread alone, we nourish the body but starve the mind. Members of Congress are called upon to right wrongs and correct injustice. There is no better way for all of us to satisfy our hunger and thirst for justice than by ``eating'' the life-giving spiritual food found in the Bible. By ``eating'' the food of the Bible, I mean not just reading and studying the lessons found there, but to ponder those messages in our hearts and apply them to our own lives. John Quincy Adams, our sixth President, said, ``For years I have read the Bible through once a year. I read it every morning, as the very best way to begin the day.'' 
   We are all very busy people. Many of us think we do not have time to read the Bible every day. D. L. Moody once answered this common excuse by saying, ``My friend, if you are too busy to read the Bible every day you are busier than Almighty God ever intended any human being should be and you had better let some things go and take time to read the Bible.'' 
   The Bible has always been more than a doctrinal source book or a compendium of theological beliefs. People have turned to it time and time again for comfort, encouragement, guidance and direction. I have my Bible on my desk. Woodrow Wilson, our twenty-eighth President, said, ``I am sorry for the men who do not read the Bible every day. I wonder why they deprive themselves of the strength and of the pleasure.'' 
   Read the Bible. Study the Bible. Ponder the messages contained in the Bible. By doing this you will learn of God's will for your life. Apply those message to your life and you will learn that there is salvation, there is forgiveness of sins and there is the hope of eternal life in the presence of God.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects and to acknowledge our prisoners of war (POW) and those still missing in action (MIA). 
   In the year 2000, fewer and fewer Americans understand the meaning of POW/MIA Day, Memorial Day, or Veterans Day. I feel it is important that I and my fellow veterans help our Nation understand that freedom is not free. It is paid for by the service and sacrifices of those who served our country. 
   The United States of America has been honored and blessed with the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. Our Nation has been kept strong and safe by these great Americans and for this we owe a debt we can never fully repay. Nobody knows this more than the friends and families of those souls who became prisoners of war or are still listed as missing in action. Their anguish and pain is unimaginable. I believe it is important to acknowledge those friends and family members on this day as well. 
   On September 15, 2000, we acknowledge with upmost respect and gratitude those who have given their freedom to preserve ours. Those who have been prisoners of war have demonstrated steadfastly the beliefs of duty, honor, and country. They never gave up on these beliefs and the United States must never give up on them. We must take care of those who have taken care of us and this includes making every effort to account for those patriots who are missing in action. Our Nation must bring them home to their loved ones. 
   To those who paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for our country, we must always be thankful. We must never take for granted the freedoms we have due to the men and women who have faithfully served our country in times of war and peace. 
   May God bless all these American heroes and their families on this and everyday.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize Raymond S. Teston. Ray is a great man, and an American hero. 
   Specialist Raymond S. Teston had served close to one full year of field duty and was to leave Vietnam to return home to Georgia. The night before his departure, August 12, 1969, and the following morning, ``C'' troop, First Squadron, 1st Calvary of the American Division was overrun while at Base Camp, Hawk Hill, Hill 29. The first wave of the attack was from rocket propelled grenades and 122 mm rockets killing several soldiers and injuring many more. Ray was critically wounded during the ensuing battle and out of the 86 men assigned, was one of only eleven who survived. 
   On November 5, 1999, the President of the United States of America, the Army Adjutant General and the Secretary of the Army awarded the Purple Heart to Specialist Raymond S. Teston, United States Army, for wounds received in action in the Republic of Vietnam on August 12, 1969. This is Ray's second award of the Purple Heart; his first came on April 2, 1968, just outside of the Tam Key, Vietnam. 
   I commend Ray Teston's courage and bravery. I thank him, and all veterans, for their service and sacrifices to our great country and for defending our freedoms. Each time I salute the flag, I like to think of heroes such as Raymond S. Teston, who symbolize all the things that are good about this country--duty--honor--faith in our democracy. Thank you Raymond S. Teston.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of the  Rural America Prosperity Act of 2000. I am pleased to be a cosponsor, along with my colleagues, Senators LUGAR, ROBERTS, and SANTORUM. I am a cosponsor of this bill because it gives our farmers some of the tools they need to succeed in today's economy and works to finish what was a key tool in our current agriculture policy. 
   In 1996, we passed a new version of the farm bill. This legislation began the process of eliminating government control over farmers. No longer did the government dictate what crops farmers could plant. Farmers could use their own discretion, honed by generations of living on the land, as to how their land and finances would be managed. The farm bill made numerous steps in the right direction, but there is more we can do. This, I believe, is a very important step to make this legislation better and more flexible. 
   This legislation takes us a few steps further down the road to better farming policy. It includes three important tax provisions that I feel are vital to the survival of Montana's and America's farmers. The first is the repeal of the estate tax, which would allow farms to be passed along to the next generation. Without the repeal, sons and daughters are forced to sell the only home they have ever known to pay the estate taxes, when their parents die. Family farms are disappearing fast enough without this added burden. 
   The second vital tax provision is the exclusion of capital gains from the sale of farmland. This simply puts farm owners on an even playing field with homeowners, who already benefit from exclusion of capital gains. The third tax provision lies in the area of health insurance. Farmers, and others who are self-employed, do not have health insurance provided for them. They must cover the full cost themselves. This legislation would give those who are self-employed a tax deduction for the cost of their insurance. 
   Farmers, more than any other sector of our economy are likely to experience substantial fluctuations in income. Market forces in farming are very unique: drought, flooding, infestation and disease all play a vital role in a farmer's bottom line. And it's not often when the elements of mother nature allow for a profitable harvest more than once in several years. I believe that farmers need to be able to smooth out fluctuations in their income in order to offset the effect of the high marginal tax rates that occur in years when both yield and prices are up. Income averaging is an important tool for farmers. Currently, alternative minimum taxes prevent many farmers from receiving the benefits of income averaging. This bill would fix that. Farmers will be able to put up to 20 percent of their annual farm income into a FARRM account that is deducted from their taxes. 
   As many of you know, while the rest of the economy is surging ahead, agriculture has been left behind in the dust. Prices are dropping, and farmers and ranchers are going out of business. We must assist in their survival and the development of new markets is an essential part of that survival. Imposing trade sanctions hurts American farmers and ranchers. Sanctions have effectively shut out American agricultural producers from 11 percent of the world market, with sanctions imposed on various products of over 60 countries. They allow our competitors an open door to those markets where sanctions are imposed by the United States. In times like these our producers need every available marketing option open to them. We cannot afford lost market share. Foreign markets offer a great opportunity for our agricultural products and negotiating trade agreements may put life back into our rural communities. 
   The farm bill took bold steps, but we cannot stop there. This legislation continues to make those steps towards a better situation for our farmers.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words of praise for an act of heroism displayed by a couple of long haul truckers earlier this month in my home state of Montana. 
   I came to the floor today to not only praise the good deed but to also support a mode of transportation that supports the economy of Montana and the entire nation. 
   As I have said, earlier this month in my home state of Montana a pair of truckers rescued four people from a car that had overturned in a ditch filled with flood water. The car, containing three people, was submerged underwater for at least three minutes after skidding off an eastern Montana highway during a flash flood which left only the car's tires above water. 
   Luckily for the passengers, a truck driver stopped just past the overturned car. The trucker backed his trailer off the road and over the bank risking his own safety and property. After securing a chain around the bumper of his trailer, he waded into the water, secured the other end around the car and pulled it back up onto the road. A second truck driver also stopped to assist. 
   I would like to recognize these unknown individuals for their heroism. Too often we take our nation's truckers for granted. It is continually becoming more and more difficult to make a living as a long haul trucker in this country considering fuel prices and regulatory factors. The high cost of fuel has hit this industry especially hard. 
   A proposal to drastically alter a trucker's drive and rest periods is being considered by the Administration. This proposal threatens not only to increase the costs of long haul truckers, it also threatens to keep them away from their families for longer durations. I think it is about time we take a long hard look at the important role these truckers play in our daily lives. 
   Whether it's a delivery to our local grocery or the transport of petroleum products, these truckers sacrifice time away from their families to make our lives easier and better. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me to ensure any hours of service proposal accomplishes three important goals: Ensure safety on our nation's highways; ensure truckers are not burdened with additional costs; and ensure the final ruling will allow truckers to spend more of their non-driving time at home with their families. The current proposal fails miserably to address these matters. 
   Again, I would like to personally thank and commend the two individual truckers for their heroism, but also commend all truckers for their hard work and dedication to safety on our highways. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in the four years since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, dramatic changes have occurred in our telecommunications markets. We have seen competitive environments in such areas as wireless communication and long distance service. Advanced telecommunications services have great potential for deployment in the near term, if only the Federal Communications Commission would more aggressively promote them. All of this change is occurring in the context of an explosion of information technologies and the Internet. 
   Yet the '96 Act dealt with much more than the high tech changes we read so much about these days. The legislation was designed to transform the entire telecommunications industry under the leadership of the FCC, to the benefit of all consumers. And the Act was designed to ensure that all Americans could have access to the vast array of services the Act will stimulate. 
   Today I would like to briefly address one aspect of the '96 Act that is often overlooked in the glamour of ``high-tech.'' Public payphones are a critical piece of this access. For millions of Americans, public payphones are the only access to the telecom network. And when the batteries or the signal for the wireless device fail, public payphones are a reliable source of inexpensive access, in an emergency or otherwise. Public payphones are emerging as public information portals, true on-ramps to the information highway, available to anyone at anytime. 
   In order to ensure that these instruments of public access would continue serving as gateways of last resort and continue evolving using new technologies, the issue of adequate compensation for pay phone operators was addressed by the '96 Act. This requirement of the '96 Act was designed to promote fair competition and benefit consumers by eliminating distorting subsidies and artificial barriers. However, the law has not been successfully implemented, and I am calling on the FCC to act expeditiously to address this regulatory oversight. Payphones are an important segment of the telecommunications industry, especially in low income neighborhoods and in rural areas like those in my home state of Montana. 
   Local telephone companies operated payphones as a legal monopoly until 1984, when an FCC ruling mandated that competitors' payphones be interconnected to local networks. Still, local telephone companies were able to subsidize their payphone service in competition with independent payphones. The '96 Act was designed to change all of this. It was designed to create a level playing field between all competitors and to encourage the widespread deployment of payphones. It did this by requiring local telephone companies to phase out subsidies; by mandating competitive safeguards to prevent discrimination by the ILECs and ensure fair treatment of competitors when they connect to local systems; and by assuring fair compensation for every call, including so-called ``dial around'' calls which bypass the pay phones' traditional payment mechanism. 
   Yet the basic requirements of the '96 Act are not being implemented by the FCC to assure fair competition. Pay phone operators are not being compensated for an estimated one-third of all dial-around calls, particularly when more than one carrier is involved on long distance connections. An industry proposal to remedy this situation has been pending at the FCC for more than a year without any action being taken. And the FCC also needs to bring to a hasty resolution the issue of the appropriate line rate structure for payphone providers. Today, there are about 2.3 million pay phones nationwide. While all payphones are threatened by the gaps in dial-around payments, 600,000 of them are independently owned and are under particularly intense pressure; many small payphone operators now find themselves being forced to pull payphones or go out of business altogether. They are also in need of certainty regarding the rates they pay the telephone companies. This situation should not exist more than four years after the enactment of the 1996 legislation.  
   I hope the FCC will act quickly to assure adequate compensation for each call. I hope the FCC will take immediate steps to enforce the requirement for non-discriminatory and fair line rates. I hope the FCC will take those basic steps required by the 1996 law. Fair competition--and the resulting benefits to consumers envisioned by Congress--will not occur until these actions are taken. As Chairman of the Senate Communications Subcommittee, I will be carefully monitoring actions taken by the FCC on these important issues in the weeks and months ahead.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I guess I have been around this old business of agriculture about as long as anybody. We have seen high commodity prices and we have seen low commodity prices. Years ago, when we would get a high surplus of any type of commodity, the price went down and so did the price in the grocery store. We had to eat our way out of this thing, so to speak. It happened in livestock, pork and beef and chicken products. But that is not the case anymore. 
   I was interested in his chart showing how, even though the price of sugar has gone down, the prices of candy, cookies, other baked goods, cereal, and ice cream has continued to go up. I don't want anybody fiddling with my ice cream. I like it like it is. If it goes up a little bit, that is OK. But don't come back and say if all of the support is taken away from sugar, the prices will go down in the store. It doesn't work with this product. It was about a year and a half ago that live hogs hit an all-time low and got down to around 10 cents a pound. Yet, when I went to my grocery stores out here in Springfield, VA, and back in Billings, MT, guess what? Boned out, double-cut pork chops were still around $5 to $6 a pound. 
   Folks, I don't know how sharp your pencil is. But that ``don't pencil.'' That just ``don't pencil.'' 
   We are looking at a program that has cost the taxpayer virtually nothing. Yet it sustains many small farmers. Sure, there are a couple of big ones down in Florida. But there are a couple of big ones in everything. For the most part, this is support for farmers in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming and the Yellowstone Valley between Billings and Sidney. It keeps them in business. 
   I ask the American people, when it comes to farm programs or insurance, do you insure your car? Yes. You do. Do you insure your house? Yes. You insure your house. Do you insure your life? Yes. We do that. I look upon this as just a little insurance policy. It doesn't cost us very much money, but it ensures that your grocery stores will be full of the most nutritious and safe food of any grocery store in the world and priced less than the percentage of the disposable income of any other place in the world. That is a pretty good insurance policy. We don't have to garden. We don't have to plant, or seed, or weed, harvest, or process. We can continue to do what we want to do in our profession. It is guaranteed that you are going to have that supply in any amount and fixed in any way and processed in any way. 
   We already talked about the numbers. But we are basically looking at people who have a great deal on the line. They risk a lot. They are subject to the elements. They have no control over that. They have no control over the retail end of the product--none whatsoever. If we are going to keep this very efficient food machine alive, this is the insurance policy that we all have. It serves this country very well. 
   I suggest that you not support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. It is well intentioned. As the Senator from Louisiana said, it is indeed July. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. I whole-heartedly support this amendment which is so critical to so many Montana families. The SUA waiver is of particular concern because long winters and high utility costs are something all Montanans face, regardless of income. This waiver allows a credit to a household's income when determining eligibility and amount of food stamp benefits. Because of the unique set of challenges facing Montanans in terms of extreme weather conditions, termination of the Standard Utility Allowance could very well put many needy households at risk of experiencing hunger. 
   The current SUA waiver is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2000. However, the USDA Food Nutrition Service has conditionally approved the extension of the Montana SUA waiver for an additional year to September 30, 2001. A primary condition to that approval is congressional approval of adequate funding. 
   To date, this waiver has been very successful in its goals to provide nutritional assistance to low-income citizens. I strongly support funding this program at $500,000 and will work with my colleagues to make that happen by the end of conference.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise this evening, along with my colleagues, as we talk about and remember and celebrate the life of PAUL COVERDELL. He was born in Des Moines, IA. He was a graduate of the University of Missouri. That is where I went to school. PAUL COVERDELL was a person who came to the Senate with a history of being a doer. He was a workhorse in this Senate. 
   Early on, he demonstrated that he could be relied upon to take on the essential but unspectacular tasks for the good of the Senate and this Nation. He was rewarded for that when he was elected by his fellow Senators to be the Secretary of the Senate Republican Conference. I know something about that because he beat me. I could not have lost to a better man. 
   He had his little mannerisms. He could put you in a box, put a cap on you, do a lot of things. But his quiet demeanor and lack of fuss in tackling whatever tasks were assigned to him belied his effectiveness. 
   He served President Bush as Director of the Peace Corps. He was a man of peace. He served as leader of the Republican Party in the Georgia Senate for 15 years, from 1974 to 1989, skillfully guiding that body through some difficult but rewarding years. 
   His leadership really surfaced when he came to the Senate. We have talked about him being a stalwart on national defense and on taxes, but I think he had his best vision and his best grasp of this business in reforming public education because he always referred back to his vision for the next generation. The next generation was always on his mind. As a proponent of equal educational opportunities, he introduced sweeping education and tax reform bills. The list of his achievements in the Senate is substantial, indeed.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is another attempt to do away with the timber program and the salvage program, and all those associated with them. If you want to do something about fires, or the safety of the forests, or the health of the forests, what you do is maintain a healthy harvest situation. In other words, it just makes a lot of sense. It is the old idea of the Government having to own all the land. You have to harvest those trees. To take the money away from it does not get to the environmental objective that a lot of us want to get to. 
   I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered to this piece of legislation is a freestanding bill, S. 2005, the Installment Tax Collection Act of 2000. 
   Basically, it allows small businesses or farms that sell their businesses on the installment plan to pay their capital gains taxes as they receive the money. Right now, they are required to pay the capital gains taxes in one lump sum. In other words, in some cases, when properties are sold, they even have to borrow the money to pay the capital gains up front. 
   It is no cutback in revenue to the Government. We just receive the money whenever the owners receive their payments for their property. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on the eve of marking up the Conservation Reinvestment Act--an act that can only be described as great politics but very bad policy--to enact a law that gives the Federal Government a blank check to buy land for the purpose of conservation, preservation, or any other so called environmental cause is ill-advised and ill-conceived, it appears, on the surface, the idea of putting land under Federal control for conservation purposes is a good idea and good policy for the nation. However, under the surface, hidden in the dark side of government ownership of lands, it is very bad policy. 
   Nobody has hunted or fished and appreciated it more than this Senator. Nobody enjoys the outdoors as much as I do--the cold crisp mornings in a hunting camp or a fishing camp is unequaled and one would not need a fishing rod or a rifle. 
   I would say that nobody in this body has fought harder for habitat and policies that promote the enjoyment of the outdoors, hunting, and fishing. As former cochairman of the sportman's caucus and still active in the foundation, we guard this privilege. 
   There is no way, Mr. President, this piece of legislation can be made to reflect or fulfill our role in the protection and improvement of our public lands. Just adding acres to the Federal estate does not get it done. Just no way. The supporters of this legislation has been blinded by the prospects of dollars, free dollars coming to their respective States. The money comes from royalties from off-shore drilling. I have no problem with that and, in fact, support such a scheme. It is the purchasing of land for the Federal estate that I cannot support. 
   I ask your patience to bear with me but I feel some facts should be made part of this record and my colleagues need reminding of some startling facts. 
   The Federal Government now controls one-third of the land in the United States. That is wrong and was never intended to be as envisioned by the Founders of our Nation nor the Framers of our Constitution. 
   However, the Federal Government has from its first day, a healthy appetite for land ownership and has never stopped acquiring more and more land. Some for good and solid reasons. In the last 40 years, however, land acquisition has been under the guise of conservation and preservation. 
   Do we have enough surplus of money to squander on the idea that the Federal Government needs more land. 
   Since 1960, major Federal land agencies have added 33.6 million acres of land. That is the area the size of Florida. 
   These agencies control more than 612 million acres or just over one-fourth of the land area of the United States. 
   True, the majority of Americans support land conservation and some acquisition, but few know or understand what it entails. 
   Most of those demanding public ownership of lands have come from groups who have little regard for private land ownership or property rights as provided by our Constitution. Land ownership is the cornerstone to individual freedom which most Americans hold very dear. Have you not seen the movie, ``The Patriot''?  
   ..... A major increase in Federal funding for land acquisition has long been needed. There is a tremendous backlog in land purchases. .....  
   So says Carl Pope, Ex. Director of the Sierra Club. 
   Ron Tipton, a vice president of the National Park Conservation Association echoes the same line. 
   I would suggest that both organizations have the money and the political will to buy land for conservation, preservation, or to heal some real or perceived environmental ill. The problem arises that they also would be responsible for the operation and management of the lands. 
   That being the case, why in the world does the Federal Government need more land? That is why I started to do some research some 3 or 4 years ago and using some information gathered by very credible organizations, I was startled what I found. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has gone so far as to suggest a freeze on Federal acquisitions. A 1999 report asserts:  
   Land management agencies should improve their stewardship of the lands they already own before taking on additional acreage and management responsibilities. 
   Environmental objectives might be best met by improving that they already own.  
   There is one glaring fact that throughout our history, private individuals and groups have offered the best and most sound resource conservation. Several organizations such as the Sierra Club has the funds and expertise to do and I suggest they proceed. 
   Here is CBO's concern. BLM, USF&W, and NPS have added 840,000 acres per year since 1960. That is the area the size of Rhode Island. 
   In the 1990's, 3.4 million acres and 25 new units for NPS; 2.7 million acres and 24 new units for USF&W; plus 18 million acres in military installations, 8.5 million acres in BOR, and 11.7 million acres in the Corps of Engineers. Even the conservation reserve ``CRP'' controls 33 million acres.

   Mr. BURNS. It will not take long to make the point. I will facilitate everything, as the chairman of the subcommittee wants. 
   If Members want to talk about wildlife in Yellowstone, you will see very little variety in wildlife in Yellowstone in the wintertime. If you have been there, you know that about the only thing you will see is bison. Let me tell you, you don't bother them with a little old snowmobile. They are just walking around, and they go wherever they want to, whenever they want to. So let's not be worried about the bison. Whether you agree with it or not, there are too many bison in the park. We have grazed that country right into the ground. 
   I remind Members that those who operate the snowmobiles out of West Yellowstone have gone to the Park Service and said: We will make arrangements to prevent line-ups at the gate, we will get new, cleaner, quieter machines, we will work with you in order to protect the environment of Yellowstone Park. 
   There will be more people in a week this summer through the park than all of next winter. You cannot even get through that park for traffic right now. One of these days, you will have to go to a gate and pick a number and they call your number and you get to go to the park. The impact is in the summer, not in the winter, no matter what you are riding. It could be an old gray horse or a snowmobile, it doesn't make any difference. And are we concerned about that?  
   Let's not be shocked. The Senator from Wyoming has a good idea. It is time we take a realistic look at this, do the study, and go forward with the recommendations that are made.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of the men and women of this country who value hunting and fishing as an important part of their lives. I am one of them, and I know I am not alone in the Senate. Many of my colleagues have joined me as members of the Sportsmen's Caucus, and I am pleased that we enjoy such strong support. In my home state of Montana, hunting and fishing are incredibly important. These are some of the activities we engage in to enjoy our beautiful outdoors. Hunting and fishing give us the chance to spend time with our families, and to take part in the traditions that generations of Montanans have enjoyed. 
   It is this strong tradition that brings me here today. There has been a grave injustice dealt to America's sportsmen. I am referring to the abuse of Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson funds by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These are funds from the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs which impose an excise tax on the equipment hunters and fishermen buy. Then the tax monies from the sporting goods are used for things like wildlife habitat and hunter safety programs. These programs were started in 1937, with the strong support of both the sportsmen who pay the tax and the states who administer the projects. 
   As years went by, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which manages the programs, started straying further and further from the original intent of Pittman-Robertson funds. After an oversight investigation by House Committee on Resources, chaired by Mr. YOUNG of Alaska, it was found that the Fish and Wildlife Service was using Pittman-Robertson for purposes far outside the intent of the law. Funds were used for everything from foreign travel to grants for anti-hunting groups and programs that work against the interests of hunters. This is just plain wrong, and goes against everything the program was originally intended to accomplish. 
   In response to the abuse uncovered by his Committee, Mr. YOUNG introduced legislation to fix the problems. Part of the legislation caps the administrative expenses for the program and sets in stone what is an authorized administrative expense. This is a step in the right direction, because it will restore the integrity to this program. His bill, H.R. 3671, passed the House on April 5th with an overwhelming vote of 423-2. 
   I am proud to be included as a co-sponsor of the Senate version of this bill, S. 2609. My colleagues from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG and Mr. CRAPO, have modeled it after H.R. 3671 and included provisions for valuable programs like hunter safety, as well as a multi-state conservation grant program. This bill ensures that the money sportsmen pay for wildlife conservation and hunter safety is actually used for those purposes and restores the accountability that has been missing for too long. It is time we made this right, and earned back the trust of the people we are here to serve.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is in essence S. 2005, the Installment Tax Correction Act of 2000. It has 41 cosponsors, as listed on the stand-alone bill, in the Senate. It is a very simple bill, but it is very important to small businesses, farmers, and people who sell their businesses and carry back some of the financing. As you know, whenever you sell your business, if you have capital gains, you pay the full capital gain on the sale price of that business. Yet your money may be returned to you in yearly installments. What this bill does, is provide an easier method to pay your capital gains tax. The amendment doesn't change the rate. It changes nothing. But it does allow you to pay your capital gains tax as you receive the money on installment. 
   We think this is more than fair. It doesn't put the seller at the disadvantage of having to go to the bank to borrow money in order to pay the capital gains tax whenever a business is sold. 
   I cannot add a lot to what the Senator from Texas has said about the marriage penalty. But I will tell you this, Joshua and Jody Hayes, of Billings, MT--two kids I have known for a long time, now pay $971 more in taxes just because they are married, rather than if they had remained single. 
   That is just one example. Mr. President, I still think when you start to look around this great country and you see the standard of living that generations, since this country's established, have created, 
   it has been progressive. This is because we in this country live for the next generation. Most of us, being parents or grandparents, work for our kids. That is important. We want them to be better educated than we are. We want them to start with a little nest egg which they can invest. We want to start them on their careers, at a rung higher than we started. 
   I was interested in the explanation of the Senator from Texas that this President thinks if you make $25,000 a year, you are rich. I happen to remember the day that if I was making $25,000 I would have thought I was pretty rich. I have a daughter now who is starting her life career making more than I am making now. I find that pretty mind-boggling. 
   Nonetheless, we have always worked for our kids. While we have done that, we have elevated the standard of living for more Americans than any other society on the face of the planet. Now we have found a way to tax it. 
   That tax comes from families--a mom, a dad, a grandma, and a grandpa. Say you have a young family and are trying to pay for a home and saving money to send their kids to school--there are more than enough things going on. You should not have to be penalized by the tax man. Some 21 million couples nationwide pay $1,400 or more a year in income taxes. Now to some people that's not a lot of money, but I know a lot of folks who think it is a lot of money. 
   I urge the passage of this legislation, and I also hope this body will look with favor on the amendment I have sent to the desk which helps small businesses and farmers. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for this amendment to repeal federal excise taxes on telephone services. 
   This tax was first introduced as a ``temporary'' luxury tax in 1898 to fund the Spanish-American War. However, over 100 years later this tax remains in effect. The definition of temporary should not span an entire century. 
   This tax is imposed on telephone and other services at a rate of 3 percent. Furthermore, these taxes are not applied to a specific purpose that enhances telephone service in our nation--rather these taxes are directed to the general revenue account. In other words, there is no reason we should not repeal this tax. Not doing so means only one thing--Montanans end up paying one more tax to encourage Government spending. 
   As I said a moment ago, this tax was enacted to fund the Spanish-American War. Considering that war was ended a mere six months after it began, I feel it's time to repeal this tax. Instead, Montana consumers continue to pay this tax on all their telephone services--local, long distance, and wireless. 
   It is time to eliminate this excise tax. At the time of enactment, this tax was considered a luxury tax on the few who owned telephones in 1898--this tax has now become an unnecessary burden on virtually every American taxpayer. Repealing this excise tax on communications services will save consumers over $5 billion annually. 
   Furthermore, this tax is regressive in nature. It disproportionately hurts the poor, particularly those households on either fixed or limited incomes. Even the U.S. Treasury Department has concluded in a 1987 study that the tax ``causes economic distortions and inequities among households'' and ``there is no policy rationale for retaining the communications excise tax.'' 
   Rural customers in States like Montana are also disproportionately impacted. This tax is even more of a burden on rural customers due to the fact that they are forced to make more long distance calling comparative to urban customers. 
   This tax also impacts Internet service. The leading reason why households with incomes under $25,000 do not have home Internet access is cost. If consumers are very price sensitive, the government should not create disincentives to accessing the Internet. Eliminating this burdensome tax can help to narrow the digital divide. 
   This is a tax on talking--a tax on communicating--a tax on our Nation's economy. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to repeal this unnecessary and burdensome general revenue tax. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment that would provide tax relief for farmers, ranchers, and other small business owners. 
   This amendment contains several provisions that are very popular among the Nation's farming and small business communities. Among those provisions is a bill I introduced in January along with over 40 of my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This bill, S. 2005, the Installment Tax Correction Act of 2000, would allow small businesses to pay the capital gains on the sale of their business over the term of the sale rather than in one lump sum at the time of the sale. 
   Without this provision, the sales of small businesses will be disrupted or scrapped altogether. Many sales of small businesses use the installment sales method. This amendment will allow small business owners the opportunity to defer over the period of payments the capital gains tax on the sale of their business. We're not talking about major corporations--rather, we are talking about small businesses that support a community. 
   This amendment will ensure that action is taken on this issue this year and also ensure that the present or future sales of small businesses are not adversely affected by this legislation. 
   This amendment also contains several other tax relief measures for our Nation's farmers and ranchers. The amendment will not only create savings for farmers but also encourage savings for farmers to be used for future. 
   The agricultural community is in a crisis. These are the men and women  that produce our Nation's food products. It is important that we do all we can to help relieve these families of the burdens based on the unique fluctuations in agriculture. While a farmer may have a banner year, his next may be devastated by hail, disease or price. 
   Mr. President, I can tell you that prices for agricultural products have hit rock bottom and there is no sign of improvement. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the small business owner by supporting this amendment.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the comments of the Senator from Illinois on striking section 116. Let me preface my point by saying the language in the bill is the same language that was in last year's bill. There is a reason for it. Contrary to the argument being voiced by one side of the aisle, this is compromise language. It passed the House and the Senate last year. It was cleared by the Council on Environmental Quality and signed into law by the President. 
   As part of his speech, the Senator from Illinois showed us a picture of rangeland in poor quality. Well, I could take that same picture in Yellowstone Park. There is not one cow in Yellowstone Park, not one. There are a lot of buffalo, though. It is all managed by educated, competent land managers. The problem is, they have a hard time cutting back on the herd there. So let's not say that all the ranchers in the world are the rapers and the pillagers of the land, because we can see range in worse shape being managed by the National Park Service. 
   I go back on open range, range country, with the BLM and Government land back to the 1950s, and even a little before that. I can remember riding into Chicago with cattle for J.C. Penney at the old International Stock Show. So I know a little bit about these cattlemen. I know a little bit about grass. I know a little bit about rain. I know a little bit about sunshine. 
   If it had not been for the ranching community in our public lands States, there would also be no wildlife on that range because there is no water. For the most part, the land that was not claimed under the Homestead Act was land without water. Water was later developed on that land by the people who leased it from the government. To water their cattle they built reservoirs and wells. They also used pipelines. Anyplace livestock can graze, one will find wildlife. 
   There was an organization formed just after World War II. The country was coming out of a depression and also some devastating years of drought in the thirties. There are probably not a lot of folks standing around here who know much about that. I do not see that much gray hair around. 
   An organization was formed to improve the range. It was called the Society for Range Management, long before Government had established any kind of environmental rules, long before there was an establishment of the BLM and guidelines for the men and women who would judge the quality of the range. Government did not fund the Society for Range Management. It was strictly funded by those stockmen who ran livestock on public lands. The Taylor Grazing Act was then established, and that is what governs how we handle permits today. 
   I want to talk about the Society for Range Management. Every year--and I started this in Montana by the way--we have Montana Range Days. About 300 to 400 people show up for a 3-day camp. They sleep on the ground, and they sleep in the back of pickups. The people run from little shavers in the first grade to seasoned stockmen. During the 3 days, we identify the grass, the foliage, noxious weeds, the carrying capacity of a particular strip of range. 
   I started that when I went into the broadcast business in 1975 because rangeland is the basis for the economies in the eastern counties of Montana. And as a result, the grazing permits on public lands are vital for Montana. 
   The range today carries a lot more livestock, a lot more recreation, and more activity overall because of a group called the Society for Range Management. They have been responsible, and that is something we should recognize. Oh, sure, you can take a picture of an area after a drought and it won't be pretty. But as I said, I can show you that in Yellowstone Park where the buffalo took the grass into the ground. I can show you that in Jackson Hole. I can show you that around Devils Tower in the Black Hills, and the rangeland of North Dakota. I could probably show you some pastures in the State of Illinois that are privately owned and are overgrazed. There are always one or two bad examples that one can magnify and say the whole world is doing this to my or our land. 
   I have yet to see any government organization that has taken care of its land, or our land, as well as a private landowner who has made an economic and cultural investment in that land. It just does not happen. 
   Last year, we compromised with those opposing the language that we would solve the problem of renewing the permits. We told them that in accepting this compromise, the language before us today, we would have to come back each year until the Bureau of Land Management cleared up the current backlog of permits. 
   The State of Montana does not have as much BLM acreage as some other States. I do not think we have as much as our neighboring State to the south,  Wyoming. They probably also have more people employed by the BLM because of the environmental laws that have been passed. Some of those BLM folks are very good land managers, but they are also hamstrung by some very narrow-minded people who think they know more about the rangeland than they do or the stockmen who run it. 
   In the meantime, there is a huge backlog of grazing permits that have gone unapproved, and that is the heart of Section 116. 
   If they get the backlog cleared up, this language goes away. What is to fear? If the permit work is done and the permits have gone before the board, this language goes away. We are making sure everybody plays fair--just fair. That is all we are doing. 
   We are good to our word, and with the BLM's failure to process the backlog of permits, we have used the same compromise language we did last year to prevent kicking family ranchers off the land through no fault of their own. They get their work done. That is the bottom line. It cannot get any more definitive than that. 
   I do not want America to think that what I heard spoken before is an accurate assessment of our public lands because I will show you land managed by a stockman that lays next to what the Government manages, and there is a big contrast. It is huge. I will take the stockman's land 9 times out of 10 because I have seen it. I have seen the growth. I have seen the maturity and the things we put in place in range country to make it better, and we have done it with our own money. We did not do it with Government money. We did it with our own money to improve that range country. 
   I support my good friend from Illinois in the area of good environmental practices, but it is my belief that it is not just Government employees who understand good environmental practices. It is done all through farm and agricultural country, whether it be on public lands or private lands. 
   This change does nothing to impact the compromise language of a year ago. 
   I oppose striking section 116. I think it is necessary, understanding there are those who do not want anything, anybody, or any livestock on those lands whatsoever, and particularly people. I can put faces on the people who use these lands very conservatively and improve these lands. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my friend from Minnesota on this issue. I am not really sure if he was talking about families or not. The standard of living that this country enjoys has to be attributed in part to parents, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, and their ability to pass on some of their wealth to the next generation. 
   We all work hard for our kids. I don't know of a parent who doesn't work for their kids in this country. While we were doing that, we elevated the standard of living and the wealth of this country for more people than any other society on the face of the planet. 
   I didn't come from very wealthy folks. 
   My dad was a small farmer in Missouri with 160 acres, two rocks, and one dirt. But last year, I lost one of my elderly aunts, a sister to my father. In her estate, I inherited only one thing in the will--a 1991 Lincoln Town Car. I have never owned a Lincoln in my life. But you know what happened to that old car? It was sold in the estate sale to pay for the taxes. I was mad. Well, I am not saying we are doing badly now; what I am saying is, forget about the top 2 percent that the other side talks about because they don't pay estate taxes, folks. They have CPAs and lawyers. They can set aside trusts and do a lot of things to guard their fortunes and pass it on to the next generation of the family. It is the middle who gets hit. It is the man and wife who started off as a young couple and built a business. They pass on, the Government taxes it again after it has been taxed all of those years. 
   So how much do you want these folks to give? We could have been talking about a lot of things today. We could have already had an H-1B visa bill, which is being blocked by the other side. They didn't like a lockbox for Social Security. They didn't like education reform, so they blocked that too. 
   Now we are talking about a simple estate tax. To give you an idea, I have some good friends who live up in the middle part of Montana, and they are not wealthy, either. But this is who gets hurt. This is real stuff, not pie in the sky. This is not philosophical. This is plain old middle America. 
   These folks lost their father and were given, starting in 1991, estate taxes of $4,584.81. Then they started making regular payments. In 1992, $13,000; in 1993, $15,000; in 1994, $14,000; in 1995, $14,000; in 1996, $16,000; in 1997, $15,000; in 1998, $12,000; in 1999, $12,000, and they have another payment coming up this December. They have been paying on this for their father who has been dead for 13 years. These aren't wealthy people. I know them personally. That is who this falls on. The top 2 percent? That is a myth and everyone should know it. 
   Some folks in Polson, MT, have a series of small theaters. They are in little bitty towns in Montana. They are scared to death of this thing. They are getting to the age now where they are starting to worry. They have to set up some ways to shield themselves, but they are finding out that being that small, they can't. That is what we are talking about.

   Mr. BURNS. I would like to engage my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Iowa on a couple of issues relating to the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. Access to healthcare in Montana is often inadequate. I would like to focus on a couple of projects that must be addressed in the state in order to address some immediate rural healthcare needs. The first is a mobile health clinic. St. Vincent Hospital in Billings has partnered with Ronald McDonald House Charities to operate a mobile health clinic in Eastern Montana. They hope to begin operating this clinic later this year. This mobile health clinic will focus on providing preventive health care to children at no cost in small rural communities. These communities are in dire need of medical services. Mr. Chairman, Mr. HARKIN, this is no small matter--31 Montana counties are designated as ``medically underserved'' by the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA). Twenty-three percent of Montanans lack access to a primary health care provider.

   Mr. BURNS. The second concern is the fact that there is a need for additional dental hygienists, but Montana is the only state without a dental hygiene education program. There are currently 333 active licensed dental hygienists in Montana. A survey of all Montana dentists and dental hygienists  was conducted late in 1996 which indicated a need for additional hygienists to fill current and future vacancies. The lack of a dental hygienist in a practice reduces the number of hours the dentist is available to deliver care only he or she is able to perform. Licensure as a registered dental hygienist in Montana requires graduation from an accredited dental hygiene program of either two or four years. Montana's only dental hygiene education program was closed in 1989 at Carroll College. Since that time efforts to open a new program have been unsuccessful, but are ongoing. Montana students desiring hygiene degrees must travel out of State. Of the current 28 students at Sheridan Community College in Wyoming, half are from Montana. Montana has fewer dentists per capita than the U.S. average. Many communities, especially rural areas, are losing dentists (to retirements and other factors). A large percentage of Montana dentists are expected to retire in the coming decade, while the number of available dental school graduates has been declining. With two-thirds of Montana's active dentists age 45 years or older and more than a quarter over age 55, concerns over the effect of retirement in coming years has grown. If a dental hygiene program were established in Montana, hygiene graduates would be available to perform hygiene tasks which presently are being performed by dentists. This would free the dentists to perform diagnosis and treatment services which only the dentist is trained to provide. The establishment of this program would be of vital importance to eliminating the strong prevalence of under-served areas in Montana.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the Military Construction Conference Report for fiscal year 2001. 
   The Senate and the House went into conference with very different recommendations for projects and unfortunately, not enough money to go around. 
   We have worked hard with our House colleagues to bring the Military Construction Conference to a successful conclusion. 
   This agreement represents a tremendous amount of work and great deal of cooperation between the House and Senate. 
   Mr. President, the military construction portion of this bill has some points I want to highlight.  
   We have sought to recommend a balanced bill that addresses key, military construction requirements for readiness, family housing, barracks, quality of life and funding for the reserve components. 
   In the final conference agreement relating to military construction, we met our goals of protecting quality of life and enhancing mission readiness throughout the Department of Defense. 
   It provides a total of $8.8 billion in spending, an increase of $200 million over the levels recommended by both the House and Senate, and an increase of $800 million over the President's budget request. 
   It is my hope that we can move this bill forward very quickly and send it to the President.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the achievement of the Carey Cattle Operation in Boulder, Montana. 
   In the late 1800's Bart Carey settled in the Boulder Valley. Two of his sons worked the mines and mills in Montana and Idaho hoping to stake their own ranches in the Valley. 
   Frank, the patriarch of the operation, followed the gold rush north to Alaska, enduring shipwreck and a winter living with an Eskimo family. After returning to the Valley he established a ranching legacy that endures to this day. Frank and his wife Mary Ellen have 12 children and 45 grandchildren. 
   Their legacy of cussed independence, integrity, and determination instilled in their children the qualities of hard work, responsibility and most importantly a deep abiding faith in God. 
   This attitude of responsibility fostered a deep sense of patriotism and resulted in their son, Martin B., answering his nation's call during World War II. He was joined by four sisters--Lillian, Agnes, Eleanor, and Josephine--who served as Navy nurses. 
   Service to our country, in spite of the demands of managing a thriving cattle operation, and the concessions that were available under such conditions saw their youngest son Tom, the current patriarch, answering the call during the Korean conflict. 
   As the only remaining son, Tom and his extraordinary wife Helen, carry on the tradition. Operating out of the main ranch they have endeavored to instill these same values in their children and grandchildren. In spite of the current condition of American agriculture they are making every effort to ensure that their children and the children of Tom's siblings have every opportunity to continue their ranching legacy. 
   As the Carey family gathers for a reunion this Fourth of July they will find a base of operation being restored to its original state. They understand the importance of preserving history and their role in this dwindling aspect of the great American west. 
   I would like to extend my congratulations and sincere best wishes to the Carey family for high grass, plentiful water, and most importantly a fair market price for the fruits of their labor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to America's local fire fighters who put their lives on the line every day protecting the lives and property of their fellow citizens. When the call comes in, they answer without question or hesitation. Unfortunately, local and volunteer fire departments are in dire need of financial support. The health and safety of fire fighters and the public is jeopardized because many departments cannot afford to purchase protective gear and equipment, provide adequate training, and are short staffed. It is time for Congress to lend them a helping hand. 
   That is why I have cosponsored a bill in the Senate called the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement or FIRE Act. This bill, S. 1941, authorizes a program granting up to one billion dollars for local fire departments across our great country. The money would be available to volunteer, combination, and paid departments. It would help pay for much needed equipment, training, EMS expenses, apparatus and arson prevention efforts and a variety of education programs. 
   Wildfires across America and Montana are a growing threat. The FIRE Act is especially critical for rural states such as Montana as we rely heavily upon our volunteer firefighters to protect those things we hold dear. Quite often these volunteer departments are the only line of defense in these rural communities. It's time we provide them with the needed funds for proper training and equipment to better protect their communities. 
   I offer my sincere gratitude to our Nation's fire fighters who put their lives on the line every day to protect the property and safety of their neighbors. They too deserve a helping hand in their time of need. 
   I commend Senators DODD and DEWINE for introducing this important legislation, and urge all my colleagues who have not done so to sign onto this bill. I would like to encourage the Committee to hold hearings on S. 1941 and suggest that we continue to move this bill forward toward ultimate passage. 
   Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I commend Senator ABRAHAM, Senator MCCAIN, and Chairman BLILEY for their hard work in the conference on the digital signatures bill, which grants online contracts and other transactions the same legal force as those conducted with pen-and-ink. I should add that Senator LEAHY and Senator WYDEN made significant positive contributions to the bill. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation and I am very pleased with the conference report before the Senate today. 
   Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of the conference report by a vote of 426-4. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report, which is a bipartisan product that will allow businesses to  take advantage of the speed and efficiency of the Internet while also protecting consumers. I have no doubt that the passage of this legislation will help to make sure that electronic commerce can meet its full potential. 
   The issue of online authentication is one of the most important issues to the development of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce holds great promise, in particular, for states like my home state of Montana, where businesses and consumers have to deal with vast distances. E-commerce is expected to continue its upward surge to about $1.6 trillion by 2003, up from $500 billion last year. The explosion of information technology has created opportunities undreamed of by previous generations. In Montana, companies such as Healthdirectory.com and Vanns.com are taking advantage of the global markets made possible by the stunning reach of the Internet. 
   This bill allows for consumers to enter into binding contracts over the Internet and eliminates the need to engage in needless, burdensome exchanges of paper documents. This bill will create a uniform system where contracts have the same validity across all 50 states. 
   The bill is also technology-neutral and does not impose government mandates on what formats or software businesses or consumers choose to use to conduct online commerce. 
   Numerous consumer safeguards are included in the conference report, including the requirement that consumers confirm that they are able to read the format that companies use for online contracts. Also, safeguards are contained in the bill that will still require that critical notices such as insurance cancellation and mortgage foreclosure notices be sent on paper. Furthermore, consumers still have the right to receive any documents on paper if they so choose. 
   The passage of the digital signatures bill is a critical step in ensuring the continued growth of the Internet-driven economy. This legislation grants additional choice and convenience to consumers and will also translate into more efficient products and services. 
   Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the work of Senator ABRAHAM and Senator MCCAIN, Chairman BLILEY in the other body, Senator LEAHY, and Senator WYDEN who had quite a lot to do with this. Of course, it came out of the Subcommittee on Communications. This is just one more of the digital dozen we set our goals to pass during this Congress. 
   So far, we are up around the eighth or ninth bill out of that digital dozen that will probably lend greater credence to the Internet and the way we use it as a tool in business and in our personal lives. I thank those Senators who were instrumental in passing this legislation. I congratulate them and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to address an issue today that means an awful lot to Montanans. That issue is the very right to have access to a choice of cars and trucks that will meet the rigorous needs of rural life. I don't know how many of those listening today have driven in Montana, but it is a much different story than driving in more densely populated states. CAFE standards have a huge effect on Montanans in a lot of different ways that many people here today would not understand. 
   Today, some of my colleagues have cited statistics about the impact of large vehicles harming occupants of smaller vehicles. This is extremely unfortunate, but large vehicles are not a luxury. For many of us they are a necessity. Just as 18 wheeled diesel trucks keep our country's goods moving on our interstate system, large vehicles are a necessity to keep our rural economies alive. Hauling a heifer to market just is not feasible in a Geo Metro. 
   Now, in the Washington, D.C. area, there are many more small, economical cars on the road than there are in Havre, Montana. But, I have to remind you that in Montana we have winter for a large part of the year. A long, cold winter with plenty of snow and ice. It is the kind of weather that makes 4-wheel drive a life saving device. When you are driving your family down the road in the middle of December and the weather is miserable and cold, you want to be confident you will all be safe. This generally means a sturdy vehicle with four-wheel drive. It'll help you stay on the road, which is important considering it could be a very long time before you see anyone else, and the nearest town could be 80 miles away. If you are unfortunate enough to slide off of a two-lane road in the black of night it is nice to know your family will be protected. This is the reality in parts of Montana, as hard as it is for some of my colleagues in the Senate to imagine. 
   Similarly, when you live in an area of Montana that is geographically isolated, and there are very few that are not, you need to be prepared to buy more than one bag of groceries at a time. Maybe you need to buy a month's worth of groceries, and feed for the animals, and fence posts, any other odds and ends you might need and bring them all home at the same time. How you will fit that all into a little car is a mystery. You'd better leave the kids home, that's for sure 
   Besides that fact that stricter CAFE standards could hurt rural Montanans and the general safety issues that concern me, I think there is more at stake here. We are basically telling consumers that they have no right to choose the car they want to drive. This isn't right. In recent years, the American automobile industry has made great strides in developing better cars in every possible way. On the whole, our cars are becoming safer, and cleaner than ever before. This ingenuity is what makes American industry great. 
   We have done a good job of making sure the manufacture of automobiles is consistent with the environmental goals we want to reach. But to step aside and allow federal regulators to enact a blanket policy that punishes those people who use large vehicles as a necessity of every day life, and stifle the right to choice for rural consumers, is the wrong approach.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to today in support of a bill I introduced last week along with my friend Senator MOYNIHAN and 26 other members on both sides of the aisle. The bill, S. 2698, the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000, crates tax incentives for the deployment of broadband (high-speed) Internet services to rural, low-income, and residential areas. 
   This bill will ensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable access to the Internet over current and future generations of broadband capability. 
   The legislation provides graduated tax credits to companies that bring qualified telecommunication capabilities to targeted areas. It grants a 10-percent credit for expenditures on equipment that provide a bandwidth of 1.5 million bits per second (mbps) to subscribes in rural and low-income areas, and a 20-percent credit for delivery of 22 mbps to these customers and other residential subscribers. 
   This bill has been endorsed by a number of organizations, including Bell Atlantic, MCI/Worldcom, Corning Incorporated, the National Telephone Cooperative Association, the Association for Local Telecommunications Services, the United States Distance Learning Association, and the Imaging Science and Information Systems Center at Georgetown University Medical Center. 
   Mr. President, in a few short years, the Internet has grown exponentially to become a mass medium used daily by over 100 million people worldwide. The explosion of information technology has created opportunities undreamed of by previous generations. In my home state of Montana, companies such as Healthdirectory.com and Vanns.com are taking advantage of the global markets made possible by the stunning reach of the Internet. 
   The pace of broadband deployment to rural America must be accelerated for electronic commerce to meet its full potential, however. Broadband access is an important to our small businesses in Montana as water is to agribusiness. 
   I am aware of all of the recent discussion regarding the ``digital divide'' and I am very concerned that the pace of broadband deployment is greater in urban than rural areas. However, there is some positive and exciting news on this front as well. The reality on the ground shows that some of the ``gloom and doom'' scenarios are far from the case. By pooling their limited resources, Montana's independent and cooperative telephone companies are doing great things. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a bill which I have co-sponsored. The bill, S. 2330, will repeal federal excise taxes on telephone services. 
   This tax was first introduced as a temporary luxury tax in 1898 to fund the Spanish American War. However, over 100 years later this tax remain in effect. The definition of temporary should not span an entire century. 
   This tax is imposed on telephone and other services at a rate of 3 percent. Furthermore, these taxes are not applied to a specific purpose that enhances telephone service in our nation--rather these taxes are directed in the general revenue account. In other words, there is no reason we shouldn't repeal this tax. It means only one thing--Montanans end up paying one more tax to encourage government spending. 
   As I said a moment ago, this tax was enacted to fund the Spanish American War. Considering that war was ended a mere six months after it began, I feel its time to repeal this tax. Instead, Montana consumers continue to pay this tax on all their telephone services--local, long distance, and wireless. 
   It is time to eliminate this excise tax. At the time of enactment, this tax was considered a luxury tax on the few who owned telephones in 1898--this tax has now become an unnecessary burden on virtually every American taxpayer. Repealing this excise tax on communications services will save consumers over $5 billion annually. 
   Furthermore, this tax is regressive in nature. It disproportionately hurts the poor, particularly those households on either fixed or limited incomes, Even the U.S. Treasury Department has concluded in a 1987 study that the tax ``causes economic distortions and inequities among households'' and ``there is no policy rationale for retaining the communications excise tax.'' 
   Rural customers in states like Montana are also disproportionately impacted. This tax is even more of a burden on rural customers due to the fact that they are forced to make more long distance calling comparative to urban customers. 
   This tax also impacts Internet service. The leading reason why households with incomes under $25,000 do not have home Internet access is cost. If consumers are very price sensitive, the government should not create disincentives to accessing the Internet. Eliminating this burdensome tax can help to narrow the digital divide. 
   Mr. President, this is a tax on talking--a tax on communicating--a tax on  our nation's economy--I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this bill to repeal this unnecessary and burdensome general revenue tax.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to the fact that the Smurfit-Stone Container Plant in Missoula, Montana has received the Jefferson Smurfit Group Worldwide Award as plant of the year. 
   As you know, Montana's wood products industry has been hit extremely hard with federal regulation and the lack of available federal fiber to keep our mills running. Despite these hardships, our mill workers and managers continue to take great pride in their work and continue to do the best with the hand they have been dealt. 
   The result is that Missoula's Smurfit-Stone Container employees have ensured that their mill rose above the other 563 Smurfit facilities world wide and defined themselves as being able to increase productivity and reduce operating costs while actually improving safety and the quality of production. 
   These accomplishments were worker driven and accompanied a 20% reduction of OSHA incidents last year. Some times efficiency comes at the expense of safety or environmental responsibility. This is not the case at the Missoula plant. In addition to reducing injuries, the plant was able to increase paper efficiency while reducing waste, energy consumption and maintenance costs. While Montana's wood products industry relies on renewable natural resources, we are keenly aware that these resources must be conserved and used responsibly. Smurfit-Stone container consistently looks for ways to make the fiber available to them go as far as possible. It makes sense from both a business and an environmental standpoint, and it is a goal that makes them one of the top employers in Montana. 
   As I mentioned, Montana has been hit extremely hard by federal restrictions on the wood products industry. As a result we have lost 17 mills in Montana over the last decade. These mills provided jobs for thousands of families and numerous communities. While times are extremely tough, Montanans involved in the industry still take great pride in what they do. This is reflected in the honor recently bestowed on the Missoula Smurfit-Stone Container paper mill. Clearly, this mill deserves recognition not only by their parent group, but by Congress as well.

   Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I commend the conferees for their efforts to finalize the crop insurance report. The crop insurance proposal before us today is the culmination of literally years of hard work by numerous Senators and Congressmen. As you may remember, I have been a supporter of S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, and I am extremely happy to see that the work on that legislation has finally been dove-tailed into the work of the House of Representatives. You will also note that the report includes over $7 billion in supplemental appropriations to help farmers and ranchers cope with the current farm crisis. 
   Some will note that this is the third year in a row Congress has provided a large supplemental appropriation to help America's farmers. However, those of you that have traveled to our rural communities know that every dime we can send to these areas is vitally needed. Agriculture is facing one of the most dire times that I can remember. Families are losing farms, ranches, and the livelihood that makes up their own family histories. A way of life is at risk, and in Montana, that way of life is what makes my state what it has become. Without these monetary adjustments to make up for failing markets, entire communities would dry up and blow away. In Montana, our economy is already reeling, and agriculture is our number one industry. 
   Without adequate agricultural support, the investments we have made in economic development to diversify our economy will be threatened. Agricultural production is the foundation that we must build upon. Agriculture is what keeps products moving across the shelves, restaurants open, and food on the table. Without that, it will be almost impossible to keep towns vibrant enough to attract new investment and new technologies. 
   Some critics are pointing out that this is the third year in a row that we have supplied rural America with supplemental appropriations. I agree that this pattern is costly, but I must point out that the promises given to rural America have not been carried out. We were promised strong foreign market penetration and a workable market that would get our fair share of the dollar back to producers. This has not happened. Look at any trade deal that has been negotiated in the last few years and you will see that our agriculture industry is almost always left with little protection, and actually very little support from our trade representatives. The result is an onslaught of foreign competition within our own markets, and not nearly enough of our product making it out of the country. Unfortunately, the administration and current world market trends have not allowed current farm policy to work in the manner that was anticipated at the time of its implementation. I continue to support the principles of our current farm policy but am deeply disappointed that we have not found a way to address the inaction of the administration in opening foreign markets. It will be necessary for Congress to look for ways to allow our current farm policy to continue and provide for the times of depressed markets such as we are facing currently. 
   The current farm policy has not created the trade imbalance and subsequent market collapse, but it has not been flexible enough to protect our consumers. The combination of failed trade policies, and an unresponsive farm policy has resulted in the need for direct supports being sent to our producers. This year may be even more vital than previous years. We are facing 
    drought across the West. Livestock is already being moved for lack of water and irrigation has started earlier than in recent memory. Markets and mother nature have combined forces and Congress must respond with a strong message to rural America that we will be there to help, both this year and in the future. 
   I thank the conferees for heading some of my requests and helping out those farmers hurt by the bankruptcy of AgriBiotech. The ABT language is vital to producers who have been negatively impacted by a bankruptcy that was no fault of their own. Additionally, our wool producers have been given a shot in the arm to help make sure their industry remains viable. These are just a few examples, but I can assure you that this Montanan extends our thanks for these helping hands. 
   The underlying legislation that is carrying this supplemental package is equally important, and is part of the necessary message that Congress is willing to support agriculture in the future. It is a proposal that offers much-needed changes in the area of risk management for farmers and ranchers. Managing risk in agriculture has become perhaps the most important aspect of the business. Agricultural producers who are able to effectively manage risk are able to sustain and increase profit and operate more effectively in business cycles. An effective crop insurance program will provide our producers new possibilities for economic stability in the future. It will provide another foothold in our attempts to help agriculture out the current hole that it is in, and it will provide a vital tool to help prevent future depressions in the agriculture industry. 
   The Federal Government must help facilitate a program to unite the producer and the private insurance company. The control must be put in the hands of the agricultural producer, and coverage must be high enough to warrant enrolling in the program. Although no producer can completely control risk, an effective management plan will reduce the negative effects of unavoidable risks. Today's family farmer must have adequate options, or one bad year could mean the difference between keeping the family farm or having to leave agriculture. 
   This bill addresses the inadequacies of the current crop insurance program. The problems and inconsistencies with the current program make it both unaffordable and confusing to agricultural producers. Costly premiums with low coverage percentages are the biggest problem. In years of depressed market prices, crop insurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for farmers. 
   This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide the highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of buy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the problem of unaffordable premiums. It also allows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized. 
   Another important provision in this bill is a pilot program to reward producers for risk management activities. It will allow producers to elect to receive a risk management payment or a  crop insurance subsidy. The risk management payments will be given to those producers that utilize any two of several activities, including using futures or options, utilizing cash forwards, attending a risk management class, using agricultural trade options or FFARRM accounts or reducing farm financial risk. Quite simply, it rewards a producer for utilizing management tools that will help protect his, and the government's, exposure in the current agriculture market. 
   This bill also takes into account the lack of production histories for beginning farmers or those who have added land or recently utilized crop rotation. This will make it possible for producers to get a foot in the door and receive affordable crop insurance. 
   This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance program into a risk management program, designed to help the producer in the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for farmers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to produce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable margin. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely happy that the conferees have finally completed their work on this important proposal. It is vital to Montana and the rest of our Nation's rural agriculture communities. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator HARKIN of Iowa, Senator KERREY of Nebraska, Senator ROBERTS of Kansas, and the Ag Committee--I do not serve on the Ag Committee--for completing this legislation. 
   This legislation, by the way, was promised 2 or 3 years ago. They have labored a long time with the Crop Insurance Program which is probably the best package that has ever been produced by Congress and given to the American agricultural community to manage their risks. This is a tool to manage their risks. 
   Also, my colleagues will note this report also includes $7 billion in supplemental appropriations to help farmers and ranchers cope with the current farm situation. 
   Think about that a bit. This is landmark legislation because we are not even to Memorial Day, we are not even into the meat of the growing season, and we have already made preparation to deal with the situation that exists in agricultural today. 
   We have been stripped from some of our markets, and our prices continue to be very low. On the other hand, the American consumer is still supplied with the most wholesome food in the world. 
   This Congress has fulfilled its promise to have this money ready to go for our Nation's ag producers. 
   Without these monetary adjustments to make up for failing markets, entire communities will dry up. They are experiencing more financial stress than ever before, probably even through the Great Depression. Without this support, the investments we have made in economic development to diversity our economy will be threatened. This also sends a strong message to the financial community and the farm community that we are serious about the support of that industry and will not just let it dry up on the vine. 
   I congratulate the people who worked so hard. This conference was not an easy conference. It was not an easy package to put together. Next year, we will be debating what is good for a farm program, and we know there will be some changes made. Right now, the signal to our producers on the land is direct and it is very sharp. 
   We have had some unfortunate things happen in the State of Montana. We depend heavily on the Pacific rim for exports. Three years ago, the economics of the Pacific rim collapsed: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand. Some of those economies are just starting to come back. 
   Just yesterday, we signed an agreement with the Taiwanese--they will be visiting the State of Montana--on buying wheat from my State. We have also put in the act that the Department of Agriculture has tools to use to fight the competition on the international markets. They have chosen not to do that. There is enough blame to go around for a farm economy that is hurting. Nonetheless, this is a positive bipartisan step in the right direction. 
   The producers of our country should take a look at this package. There is a lot of flexibility here. Not only do we talk with multiperil things that can happen in a crop-year, but we are also talking about revenue, and we have never done that before. We have a complete package, a package that offers a tool for risk management for our ag producers on the land. 
   Again, I compliment the Agriculture Committee on both sides of the aisle for their work on this legislation. It is very important to the farm States of this country. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa for allowing me a little time. I congratulate him and thank him for his leadership on this issue and everybody who had a part in putting this together. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for legislation introduced today by my colleague, Senator BAUCUS, that will transfer ownership of the Miles City, Montana Veterans Hospital from the Veterans Administration to Custer County, Montana. Indeed, I am co-sponsor of this bill for the reason that within the Veterans Administration there are unused properties that have become liabilities that detract from the mission of the VA, which is to take care of our veteran population. At the same time, these resources could be assets to the communities where they exist. 
   This is exactly the situation we have in Miles City, Montana. Maintaining a facility that is no longer needed costs the VA approximately $500,000 that would otherwise be dedicated to improving access and quality of care for Montana's veterans. At the same time, the community of Miles City has need of additional space for use by the community college and other entities designed to enhance the quality of life and economic development opportunities for all the people of southeast Montana. 
   This legislation represents a creative solution that serves the best interest of all involved. The situation is not unique to Montana but we are willing to address the issue and take the first step towards a more efficient Veterans Administration. We need to dedicate the limited resources of this agency to the essential task of maintaining our commitment to America's veterans with adequate health care rather than to excessive administration and maintenance costs. 
   At the same time, what is a liability for the VA will be an asset to a community that has an inadequate tax base to support the development of infrastructure that will have a significant and long-lasting impact on jobs creation, educational opportunity, and will ultimately enhance the tax base as well. 
   The concept that is inherent in this bill is a win-win situation for all the affected parties and I encourage positive consideration by my colleagues.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide funding for the rehabilitation of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, authorize funds to address the maintenance backlog facing the park's sewer and drinking water infrastructure, and allow the Secretary to enter into a demonstration project to rehabilitate the historic hotels in Glacier National Park using private funds. 
   This legislation is a companion to a bill recently introduced by Representative RICK HILL in the House of Representatives. The bill would provide $20 million for much-needed water and sewer infrastructure upgrades, which could extend the park's yearly operating season to six months. Extending the season is extremely important to ensure that revenue will be generated to rehabilitate these historic structures in Glacier National Park. 
   Additionally, the legislation will allow the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an extended concessionaire agreement so that the concessionaire will be eligible for tax incentives that will make the multi-million dollar investment in these historic lodges affordable. The National Park Service is supportive of this effort and would benefit from the added flexibility to exempt competitive concessions contracts from the current 20-year maximum contract length. Permitting this exemption would allow concessionaires to qualify for historic preservation tax credits and dedicate funds toward Many Glacier Hotel and the Lake McDonald Lodge. 
   The marriage of public and private investment allowed by this pilot project is the only workable solution that we have found that will save the park's historic structures in a timely manner. With a multi-billion dollar backlog of maintenance projects in our National Parks, it is highly unlikely the rehabilitation projects could be funded using purely public funds. Glacier Park is a place that all Montanans hold dear, and its historic hotels are a significant part of its rich heritage. After years of use, these hotels are now  in dire need of rehabilitation, and unfortunately the funds just aren't available at the federal level. This pilot project offers us a unique opportunity to begin the work necessary to maintain Glacier Park's preeminent place in our national park system and preserve it for generations to come. The legislation still ensures a competitive concessionaire program, but will also ensure that America's citizens are able to enjoy these century old buildings for generations to come. 
   Finally, the legislation authorizes funding to rehabilitate the Going-to-the-Sun Road. This highway is a true feat of engineering, and one of the most beautiful roadways in the world. It is the centerpiece of Glacier National Park, and must receive this added attention as soon as possible to avoid risking public safety and increasing the eventual cost of rehabilitating the road to acceptable standards. 
   I look forward to swift consideration of this legislation and the support of my colleagues.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I join Senator BOND, Senator KERRY, and others in support of a Senate resolution urging the President to adopt a policy to ensure that the 5-percent Federal procurement goal for women-owned small businesses is met. 
   In 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, establishing a Government-wide goal for small businesses owned and controlled by women. This act allows for no less than five percent of the total dollar value of all prime contracts and subcontract awards for each year. 
   Over the past few years, we have witnessed the growth of women-owned businesses, including federal contracts. Over the past ten we've seen thousands of women entrepreneurs start or expand their own businesses. It is important we realize that women-owned businesses are the fastest growing segment of the business community in the United States. In fact, in the next ten years, it is expected that women-owned businesses will make up more than one-half of all businesses in the United States. 
   This week has been designated as Small Business Week, therefore it is only fitting that the Senate should pass this resolution to symbolize the Senate's concern that the Federal departments and agencies have not made adequate effort in meeting the five percent goal established in 1994 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. I fully support this Senate resolution and urge Federal agencies to make a concerted effort to meet this 5-percent goal.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, We are setting an all-time record for spending Senate time on the military construction bill this year. Never has it taken this long to pass military construction. Since this bill is under my management, I am not real happy about the precedent that we are setting. 
   I do want to rise in support of the Byrd-Warner amendment. This debate today is not about withdrawal, or even the continued deployment, of our troops in Kosovo. What it is about is more important: the role of Congress and its relationship with the executive branch of this Government under our Constitution. 
   Congress has a constitutional responsibility to vote on long-term military commitments, especially when they are offensive and not defensive in nature. Kosovo is not a defensive response to an armed attack against the United States or its allies. There is no pressing emergency requiring the President to act with dispatch. In such cases, it is very important for Congress to act on its role. It is easy to see the need for the exercise of Congressional responsibility in the case at hand since the administration has already spent $21.2 billion since 1992 in the Bosnia/Kosovo area. 
   Contrary to the rumors, and even as stated by my good friend from Massachusetts who has interpreted this as a step to withdraw, the Byrd-Warner amendment makes specific provisions for Congress to continue American presence beyond July 1, 2001. The process outlined is orderly but it will require planning by the administration and the type of public debate expected in a democracy. 
   Without the Byrd-Warner amendment, the administration is taking congressional appropriations as a tacit approval by the Congress for American involvement in Kosovo. In these circumstances, by approving emergency supplemental funding to continue our presence in that area, Congress can be seen as avoiding its responsibilities under the Constitution. 
   In the first place, we are not properly exercising our Constitutional responsibility for the power of the purse as vested in the Congress. United States presence in Kosovo, without congressional scrutiny and affirmative endorsement, does not meet our duties to the American people that their voices be heard through congressional representation. 
   Administration officials have repeatedly spent defense funds for these deployments. Afterwards, they come back to the Congress and ask us to pay bills that are improperly--and some would say illegally--incurred. This process must stop. 
   Our effort to uphold the Constitution will not undermine the troops in the field. There is ample time under the amendment for rational implementation while still imposing the accountability required by our laws. 
   Some opposed to the Byrd-Warner amendment say we should not even have this debate, and that the timing is wrong. But when is it a good time to intercede? The Congress has been patient with the administration in Kosovo. But we, too, have responsibilities under the Constitution, especially when it comes to spending money. Today is the day we step up to the plate to face those responsibilities. 
   The amendment shifts the responsibility for determining our future involvement in Kosovo to the next administration. 
   I think the American people should also understand one other thing. We are not just talking about cents or dollars. I repeat that we are talking about $21.2 billion spent in this area since 1992. In addition, we currently have over 5,000 troops there participating in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. 
   The primary responsibility of the peacekeeping force is to act as escorts for Serbs and Albanians. That is not what our troops were trained for. And administration officials wonder why our recruitment and retention in our military services is lagging. 
   Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey had it right when he called upon our NATO allies to provide their share of resources in this operation. That is what this amendment does. It is not because the Europeans don't have the resources or cannot get the resources. This debate has gone on, and they have been willing to let the United States of America shoulder the majority of the costs of the operation. As long as somebody in the administration stands up and says we will always do it, then we will always have to do it. But, we cannot be the police force for the world community. 
   It is time to give our good friends, the European allies, the opportunity to demonstrate to the world their support for true democracy in the face of a dictator that was overstepping his bounds in the region of the Balkans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is well thought out, and needs our full support. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wasn't going to say anything on this subject, but after listening to several of the statements, both last night and again this morning, I am compelled to speak. Everybody is talking about a message that was conveyed to this country last Sunday. There was a message there. I walked through that crowd. There weren't too many television cameras following me because I am not one of the superstars here. I do not take this floor and do a lot of talking. But this time I think I must. 
   If you listened to them, there was a message. Common sense? Yes, that message was there: Do some commonsense things that will really reduce our exposure to crimes committed using firearms and enhance safety around children. They were not only talking to Congress; they were talking to America. They were saying: Americans, if you have children and young adults in your home and you also own firearms, then you have some responsibility. You, as the adult of that home, have a responsibility. You have a responsibility to your community as well as to this Nation that that child or young person or young adult knows and respects the weapon. The message was: Come to your senses, America. 
   We can pass laws in here. We can pass this sense-of-the-Senate measure. We can pass the juvenile crime bill. But if we as adults in our own homes and with our own neighbors do not take responsibility, it will not change a thing --not one thing. 
   There is a reason the second amendment was put in the Constitution. All we have to do is look around the world. We are a different society. We are a free society. Those men who shaped the Constitution and fought over it and bled over it, who walked, not the Halls of this building but in Philadelphia and New York, probably did not know exactly what they wanted in the Constitution, but they knew exactly what they did not want --tyranny by government. 
   We are no different from the roots from which we sprang. I go back to the words of Benjamin Franklin. I will never forget them. I think they are very true today, just as they were then: 
   Those who think we can pass laws that make us feel good and warm and fuzzy, who say look what we have done but do not change the circumstance any, they will say we are more secure now, but it is a false security. 
   Those who would sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither. 
   Those are the words of Benjamin Franklin. They are words that ring through these Halls today. If there is no responsibility, nothing happens, and the message from the Million Mom March is for naught. Pass the laws. Those who obey the laws become the prey, and those who are willing to break the law have no fear of it and become the predator and therefore rule by fear. 
   Common sense, America; common sense. That is what they said. No matter what the law, the bottom line is responsibility--adult responsibility--not  given to the Government, not given to the schoolteacher, not given to the babysitter; it is part of what we call parental responsibility. We should not be lulled into a false sense of security because we have passed a law that basically changes nothing. 
   Those who have lost children in any way, in any fashion, understand that down in their gut. How can they tell the story? Because they believe it deep down. 
   When I drive across this great country of ours--Washington is not the center of the universe--when I drive on the other side of the mountains and out across the prairies of America into the West and clear to the coast, I see people who are willing to take responsibility. They built a great nation, and they did not build it on false security. 
   Last night I played a tape called ``Touch Tones in Valor.'' It is a 10-minute tape on the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. I started wondering: Why did these men and women of great courage think so much of freedom that they were willing to pay the supreme cost? Yet we cannot seem to teach that in our schools. 
   During this debate, there have been numbers quoted, stats quoted, and there are politics involved. Why don't we say to the organizations that have the ear of people who shoot for sport and to hunt: Instead of this adversity, why aren't we working with those folks and their programs of education and responsibility and do something to raise awareness to make communities safe? 
   We can do that, America. We can do that. We can work with parents, and we can work with schools, but we have to get involved. We cannot pass a law, walk away, and say look what we have done, and all at once believe that we are safer. We have to get involved with the young people. It is about time we remind ourselves to teach right from wrong and that there are consequences for wrong. 
   It boils down to the message I got on Sunday, which is to help us; help us, but for Heaven's sake, when you go into groups, talk about parental responsibility, talk about the way to raise our children, talk about the way to teach our young adults. Do not go through this process of pretense and then say, ``Look what I have done.'' Do not be afraid to teach. 
   My good friend from Washington comes out of the education community, and I bet she was a good teacher. We all teach every day. Every one of us, every adult, teaches every day. That is where it starts. That was the message of this past Sunday: Be a leader; be a role model. 
   For Heaven's sake, don't do something with a paintbrush and think we have a new barn because we still have the same old one. We have to change from the inside. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment and tell my good friends, especially the Senator from New York who has left the floor, make no mistake, I am proud of my vote. Make no mistake about that because I love this Constitution. We should not be out here arguing about something. We should all be working together, trying to get America working together so we can do something about this violence. This is what I said a while ago: It boils down to communities' and individuals' responsibilities. We can pass laws all day, make us all feel good and warm, but they are not going to work. They are not going to work. I feel bad about that. 
   I am proud of my vote today. Don't worry about me, that I did not have nerve enough to stand up here and vote my conscience. I voted my conscience.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the achievements of an outstanding student from Somers, Montana. Each year the American Association of University Women--Montana sponsors an essay contest for high school students in grades 10-12. The subject of this essay contest is ``Women in Montana.'' Students are to research and write about Montana women who have contributed to the quality of life of this wonderful State. 
   This year's top essay was written by Adrienne Maxwell, an outstanding young woman attending Flathead High School. Her essay was chosen the best of all those in Montana and received first place in the contest. She writes about her mother, an immigrant who is no stranger to sacrifice and struggles, but believes through hard work comes triumph. Her essay tells the story of a woman with the true spirit, drive, and determination to achieve her goals while making a home for her family in a new land and never failing to give generously back to her community.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction appropriations bill and report for fiscal year 2001. This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that the ranking member, Senator MURRAY of Washington, and I have tried to maintain regarding military construction on this subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator MURRAY and her staff. They have been very cooperative throughout this  whole process. That is very important because we take our jobs here very seriously and this appropriations bill very seriously. 
   This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on May 9. The bill recommended by the Committee on Appropriations is for $8,634,000,000. The bill is $600 million over the budget request and approximately $292 million over last year's enacted level. However, there are some considerations we must make. More importantly, the legislation reflects a reduction of $1.2 billion from just 4 years ago--a decrease of almost 12 percent. 
   We sought to recommend to the Senate a balanced bill, and we believe it addresses the key military construction requirements for readiness, for family housing, barracks, quality of life, and the Guard and Reserve components. 
   As my colleagues well know, we take into strong consideration the Guard and Reserve components because we have seen a shift in our force structure. Our force structure has shifted from Regular Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines to Reserve and Guard components. When we started to do that, we found that around this country our infrastructure was lacking for training of these personnel. 
   This bill honors a commitment we have to our armed forces. It helps ensure that housing and infrastructure needs of the military are given proper recognition. 
   Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within the committee's 302(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and outlays. 
   This bill has some points I want to mention. It includes $3.5 billion to provide better and more modern family housing for our service personnel and their families. 
   On another quality-of-life measure, we have added substantially to the budget request for barracks construction projects. The bill provides $712 million for 43 projects throughout the United States and overseas. This funding will provide single service members a more favorable living environment wherever they are stationed. 
   The committee also provides $101 million for 14 environmental compliance projects. 
   We also address the shortfalls that continue to plague our Reserve components. 
   As our active force grows smaller, we are more dependent than ever on our Guard and Reserve for the maintenance of our national security. I continue to be greatly alarmed that the Department of Defense takes no responsibility for ensuring that our Reserve components have adequate facilities. 
   For the members of the Guard and Reserve, quality of life, too, is very important. It is all about buildings and it is all about facilities from which they work and perform their mission. 
   Their lack of regard for the total force concept very much concerns me and many of my colleagues. In Montana, we have the greatest example of a unified Red Horse Division at Malmstrom Air Force Base. It is made up of Regular Air Force and Reserves and is working very well. 
   This comes at a time when our country is so heavily dependent on the Guard and Reserve to maintain our presence around the world. For example, the President's budget request was for only $222 million for all of the Reserve components and the National Guard. That was just not enough. 
   Recognizing this chronic shortfall, we have again lent support by adding $359 million to these accounts. 
   In each case, the funds will help satisfy the essential mission; quality of life, and, of course, our readiness requirements. 
   We fully fund the budget request for the base realignment and closure account by funding $1.17 billion to continue the ongoing BRAC process and consumate the remaining closures and realignments. 
   As you know, in this line particularly, it has been very troubling to this committee that environmental cleanup has really soaked up a lot of our funding that should have been used for quality of life. 
   We will work very closely with the Senate Armed Services Committee as we put together a conference package for military construction. 
   This bill also includes year 2000 supplemental funding for the Department of Defense in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and other requirements. 
   The chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, will speak to these issues as we move along. 
   I urge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and to move it forward as quickly and as expeditiously as we possibly can. 
   Now I yield to my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Universal Service Support Act, a bill that will spur increased access to communications services for rural America. Just a few short years ago, we took the dramatic step of reshaping our nation's communications policy by passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996. A significant element of that initiative was the codification of a reconstituted policy of universal service, which guarantees all Americans with the ability to access to quality communications services. 
   Nevertheless, a significant impediment to the fulfillment of this national policy exists. There currently exist two regulatory caps that are limiting the amount of support that can be directed to high-cost infrastructure deployment initiatives that are covered under the 1996 Act. 
   The regulatory caps were first instituted in 1994 at a time when a significant number of communications infrastructure acquisitions were taking place. This was in the days prior to the 1996 Act, which initiated competition and deregulation into the communications industry. Many of the acquisitions of that time involved the rural exchanges of large incumbent local exchange carriers that were divesting themselves of properties deemed to be unprofitable or otherwise undesirable. The entities purchasing such exchanges were generally the small rural cooperative and commercial systems that have served large portions of the nation's rural areas for years. 
   The Federal Communications Commission instituted these caps because  the acquiring carriers were seeking support for these newly acquired exchanges in order to upgrade them to the standards of the day. Generally this meant that universal service support was being sought and approved for areas which had never before received such support. The FCC was concerned that the level of support might escalate and in response it imposed both a cap on individual areas and also on the overall support channeling through the system. While waivers to the caps were occasionally granted, for all intents and purposes growth of universal service support other than for the addition of new lines was effectively halted. 
   However, shortly thereafter the 1996 Act was enacted, which radically changed this nation's telecommunications landscape. The Act envisioned an evolving universal service support system which would help ensure the deployment of advanced services. The regulatory caps are at odds with this policy and must be repealed. 
   We cannot permit regulatory policies that are so clearly inconsistent with statutory policy to stand unchallenged. A national, statutory policy dedicated to universal communications service exists, and we can no longer allow inappropriate regulatory actions to undermine its intent. I urge my colleagues to join me in moving this initiative forward to passage prior to the end of this Congress.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa. 
   This has been an interesting debate on this part of the Tax Code, and I have been listening to this debate with a lot of interest. If there ever was something that needed fixing, it is unfairness in the tax code. I am not going to talk about a disincentive for folks to get married. I look at it from a standpoint of fairness. 
   Young couples who are starting out and trying to save a little money for the education of their children, or trying to pay for a home, these couples are penalized. They have dreams of participating in American opportunities, and they are kept from this by an unfair tax code. In Montana, 90,000 couples are penalized to the tune of $51.5 million every year in extra taxes simply because they are Mr. and Mrs. 
   We made it pretty clear on this side of the aisle that tax reform is needed.  If we have to do it one step at a time or one inch at a time, then that is the way we will do it. That makes it very slow and very painful. Yet it has to be done. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of married couples pay higher taxes due to their married status. The marriage tax penalty increases taxes on affected couples $29 billion per year. Currently, this marriage tax penalty imposes an average additional tax of $1,400 a year on 21 million married couples nationwide. 
   I, along with my Republican colleagues, have made it clear that continued tax reform and tax relief is necessary, and I can think of no other tax that has such a dramatic impact on so many people. To some people, $1,400 may not sound like a lot of money, but to a lot of Americans $1,400 does mean a lot of money. Especially when it can be used for things like saving for education, or supporting young families, or a long list of things that need to be fixed around the house. 
   The marriage tax penalty can have significant negative economic implications for the country as a whole since the tax code can discourage some people from entering the workforce altogether. 
   Additionally, this is a good time for us to restore fairness for married people. No. 1, I think what we have seen this week in the stock market, what we have seen in the high-tech stocks, shows that we may not be in the real booming economy now that everybody thinks we are. No. 2, if you live in farm country, we know we are not in a booming economy. Look at our small towns around my State of Montana and all through farm country. We know what tough times are. And then to be penalized in your taxes just because you are married seems a little unfair. 
   I support this particular piece of legislation. I want the American people to know that we will take this one step at a time. After all, we did not get into this situation overnight. Maybe it will take one step just to get us out of this kind of a situation. 
   Mr. President, as I said, I rise in support of legislation currently on the floor that will put an end to the marriage tax penalty. We have been fighting this tax inequity for several years now. The people of Montana have spoken to me either through letters or conversation--they think this tax is unfair. 
   Last year, I met with a couple in Billings, MT, to determine the impact of this tax on them. Joshua and Jody Hayes paid $971 more in taxes because they were married than they would have paid if they remained single. 
   In Montana, it is estimated that nearly 90,000 couples are penalized by this tax to the tune of $51.5 million--solely for being married. 
   I along with my Republican colleagues have made it clear that continued tax reform and tax relief is necessary, but I can think of no other tax that has such a dramatic impact on so many people. 
   If ever there was a disincentive to be married, this penalty would be it. I believe this, along with the estate tax, is one of the most unfair taxes on Americans. It is not right for people to be penalized with higher taxes simply because they choose to get married. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), almost half of all married couples pay higher taxes due to their marital status. Cumulatively, the marriage penalty increases taxes on affected couples by $29 billion per year. Currently, this tax penalty imposes an average additional tax of $1400 on 21 million married couples nationwide. 
   The marriage penalty can have significantly negative economic implications for the country as a whole as well. Not only does this penalty within the tax system stand as a likely obstacle to marriage, it can actually discourage a spouse from entering the workforce. 
   By adding together husband and wife under the rate schedule, tax laws both encourage families to identify a primary and secondary worker and then place an extra burden on the secondary worker because his or her wages come on top of the primary earner's wages. 
   As the American family realizes lower income levels, the Nation realizes lower economic output. From a strictly economic perspective, the fact that potential workers would avoid the labor force as a result of a tax penalty is a clear sign of a failure to maximize true economic output. As a result, the nation as a whole fails to reach its economic potential, which is demonstrated by decreased earnings and international competitiveness. 
   I am very disappointed the President has indicated he will veto this bill as he has in the past. That is not just the veto of a bill--that is another signal the administration does not support the union of two people and their impending family. 
   Congress has the momentum to correct this inequity and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to repeal the marriage penalty.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring recognition to a very special group of people in our Nation, our public safety communicators. These people are the ones who, hour after hour, stand by ready to dispatch emergency assistance to Americans in times of crisis and often tragedy. In 1992, President George Bush set aside the week of April 9th through the 15th to bring special recognition to all of those who dispatch emergency aid across this great country. Everyday Americans reach for the telephone to dial the numbers 9-1-1, seeking a voice that will bring them the help they so desperately require. A parent holding a child who has suffered a life threatening injury, an elderly person who has no one else to turn to, or a family who has awakened to a home filled with smoke; they are all calling this number just waiting for the voice that will bring them much needed assistance. The men and women who answer the 9-1-1 call are the ones who often make the difference between life and death for thousands of people in this country every single day. Our 9-1-1 dispatchers are on call 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, always there with that calm reassuring voice that puts hope back in the hearts of those in need. It is a great honor for me to bring recognition to these unsung heroes of our country and I hope that you will join me in offering your praise and thanks.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 1810, ``Veterans Claims and Appeals Procedures Clarification and Improvement Act.'' 
   Recent court decisions have made it more difficult for veterans to get their rightful assistance from the Veterans Administration, VA, and to develop their claims. This bill will clearly lay out the rules of how the VA will assist veterans with these claims. This bill will remove many of the barriers now standing in the way of veterans gathering information from many different sources to make their claim ``well-grounded.'' 
   Right now, many veterans who have filed claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs must wait for months and, in some cases, even years for the claims to be decided. This creates a hardship on our veterans who have served our country with pride. In my state of Montana, I have seen veterans wait five to 10 years for their claim and the necessary appeals to make it through this bureaucratic system. Over the past few years, I have seen my veterans' casework increase due to veterans having problems in obtaining information that the VA previously provided. 
   My President, can you imagine a homeless veteran finding out that they must call this federal agency or write to this private hospital to obtain his or her own information for a claim? Often, many veterans just give up when they face these many bureaucratic obstacles. They fall though the cracks of a system that is fast becoming a legal nightmare and a system that was supposed to be there for them when they came home. Why? It is because the Department of Veterans Affairs has ceased being helpful to the veterans in the development of their claims. 
   We must honor our commitment to our veterans and ensure the VA is being as helpful as possible to all veterans. This bill will do just that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and bring an end to the nightmare that America's veterans are having with the present system.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Texas, chairman of the Banking Committee, and also the ranking member of the Banking Committee, my good friend from South Dakota, for his work on this bill. 
   We offered in the Satellite Home Viewers Act last year, an amendment in conference that would enable us to help people in smaller markets around the country. This would help people to receive their local television signal on satellite by facilitating the delivery of these local stations in the gray areas--the B contour and the C contour where reception is poor --in the station's area of dominant influence. 
   I chair the Communications Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee. In Montana, we have great distances to cover with few people in between. Other States share this difficulty and also the geographical challenge posed by the mountains. Since the television signal is line of sight, mountains can make the problem of providing local coverage for people in hard to reach places even harder to solve. So, how do we do that? How do we level the playing field and still provide the compulsory licensing for cable, and for satellite television users and, of course, for those local programmers? 
   I think we now have before us a better bill than the one we offered last year. This bill is more complete, because it takes into account both the agencies that are going to make the loans, and also those who will be borrowing the money. It puts some responsibility on each of the parties to make sure, No. 1, that it works and, second, that they assume some of the risk so taxpayers' money is not in jeopardy. 
   I thank the Senate Banking Committee for their commitment in bringing this issue to the Senate floor as fast as they possibly could. Their word has been good, and by working with the Agriculture Committee and also a lot of us individually, the Banking Committee has helped us build a better bill than we had last year. 
   Providing access to local television signals is crucial to rural States. With over-the-air broadcast signals and cable delivery limited by geography in my own State, satellite television has been a staple of the so-called video marketplace for many years. Montana has the highest penetration level of satellite television of any State, at over 35 percent. 
   When I initially proposed the legislation in this area, I was concerned that, without it, only the largest television markets in America would receive local-to-local service as authorized by the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. These are the profitable cities such as New York and Los Angeles with millions of television households. But it is not so profitable a venture in areas where we have quite a lot of dirt between light bulbs. 
   The issue we will be debating, of course, will be the amendment offered by my good friend from South Dakota and the cosponsors. 
   Let's talk about the other 140 TV markets in this country. There are 16 States, including my own, that do not have a single city in the top 70 markets. It is time we help those 16 States gain equal footing with the ones with more urban populations. 
   Just because they are small doesn't mean they should be left out of the mix when we talk about local to local, because people enjoy their local sports, they enjoy their local weather, they enjoy their local news. It doesn't do any good for anybody who lives in rural Kentucky to watch a station that is based out of Charlotte, NC. 
   We have to find ways of delivering their signal off the satellite. The ability to receive local television signals is much more than just having access to local sports or entertainment programming. It is a critical and an immediate way to receive local news, weather, and community information. 
   Access to local signals is particularly critical in rural areas, such as Montana, when we experience flooding and other weather situations, including blizzards. 
   This is very important. The LOCAL TV Act reflects the belief that the loan guarantee program should not favor one technology, it should be technology neutral. It is a win-win for consumers. It is also a win-win for the taxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to support this. I don't think we have received more mail on any other subject since I have been here. Whenever they start turning our networks off the satellite, we get immediate responses. 
   I look at this the way I looked at REA when I was a lad on a farm in northwest Missouri. I have made this speech many times. Had it not been for the Rural Electrification Administration, we would be watching television by candlelight. That is fact. We were in rural areas. We would never have seen the build-out of electricity or power to our farms and ranches. 
   We have to take the same look at smaller markets in television because the only support they get is through advertising. That advertising is based on viewership, and the profitability of that station is at stake and, with that, the services they provide. I think it is pretty important. 
   This bill is set up with a three-member board. It offers access. The administration is very tight, and it also protects the taxpayer. Remember, the taxpayers' dollars are at stake. 
   We will move through the debate on different amendments that will come up and should be debated. The concept of the bill, if passed right now as it is, is darn good. There are a couple of amendments that I think will improve this piece of legislation.

   This bill offers much-needed changes in the area of risk management for farmers and ranchers. Managing risk in agriculture has become perhaps the most important aspect of the business. Agricultural producers who are able to effectively manage their risk are able to sustain and increase profit. An effective crop insurance program will provide farmers and ranchers possibilities for economic sustainability in the future and help them out of the current financial crisis. 
   The federal government can help facilitate a program to unite the producer and the private insurance company. The control must be put ultimately in the hands of the agricultural producer. Although he cannot control risk, an effective management plan will help him to manage the effects of risks, such as weather, prices and natural disasters. 
   This bill addresses the inadequacies of the current crop insurance program. The problems and inconsistencies with the current program make it both unaffordable and confusing to agricultural producers. Costly premiums are the biggest problem. In years of depressed market prices, crop insurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for farmers. 
   This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide the highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of buy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the unaffordable premiums. It also allows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized. 
   Another important provision in this bill is a pilot program to reward producers for risk management activities.  It will allow producers to elect to receive a risk management payment or a crop insurance subsidy. The risk management payments will be given to those producers that utilize any two of several activities, including using futures or options, utilizing cash forwards, attending a risk management class, using Agricultural Trade Options or FFARRM accounts or reducing farm financial risk. This bill also takes into account lack of production histories for beginning farmers or those who have added land or use crop rotation. This will make it possible for those producers to get a foot in the door and receive affordable crop insurance. 
   Many times, especially in Montana, multi-year disasters occur. This bill helps producers that take a blow several years in a row, which reduces their Annual Production History (APH). If a producer has suffered a natural disaster during at least 3 of the preceding 5 years and their APH was reduced by at least 25 percent they may exclude one year of APH for every five years experience. During this time, the producer's APH may increase without limit back up to the level before the multi-year disaster began. 
   Specialty crops such as canola or dry beans, are another important addition to this bill. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) is now authorized to spend up to $20 million each fiscal year to create partnerships for developing and implementing specialty crop risk management options. Additionally, the Non-Insured Assistance Program (NAP) area trigger has been removed. The Secretary now has the authority to provide assistance for specialty crops without any requirement of an area loss. Before, producers were penalized in the case of a disaster for planting alternative crops if their neighbors continued to plant traditional commodities. I would like to thank my colleague, Senator BAUCUS, for his hard work on getting the provisions for specialty crops in this bill. 
   This bill will ultimately put more control in the hands of active producers by including four active producers on the Federal Crop Insurance Commission (FCIC) Board. The board would also include nine private insurance industry experts the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the Under Secretary for Rural Development, and the Chief Economist of USDA. In addition, it mandates that the Board Chairperson be one of the non-governmental members. These are important steps to ensure that the new program is run for the producers by the producers. 
   This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance program into a risk management program, designed to help the producer in the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for farmers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to produce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable margin. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senators ROBERTS and KERREY, as well as Senator LUGAR on this important piece of legislation. I believe this bill will pave the way for massive crop insurance reform and help agricultural producers out of this economic crisis. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2003, Keep our Promises to America's Military Retirees Act of 2000. 
   This is an important step in providing the men and women who serve our nation with a benefit our government promised them when they entered the military and, a promise that our government broke. It is our duty to restore these benefits. 
   There are still a few of us who serve in the Senate that wore our country's uniform in time of war and in time of peace that know of the hardships placed on the military people and their families. We also know, first-hand, of the promises made by our government to our service men and women. This bill is just a small step in restoring one of those most important promises--health care for military retirees. There are military retirees in my State of Montana that drive hundreds of miles to get their health care. There are some living a few miles from Malmstrom AFB, who cannot get an appointment on base. Mr. President, these are the folks that we promised to take care of it they spent 20 years of their lives defending our freedom. 
   We have a long way to go and much more to be done for our military personnel, active duty, retired, as well as our veterans. As chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on Military Construction, I place a high priority on providing the active duty men and women and their families with adequate homes and facilities to work and live in. Mr. President, we have the best trained and the most highly educated military in the world--we must make a commitment to provide them with the tools necessary to do their jobs, with the salaries and benefits to recruit and retain them and with adequate homes and facilities to live and work. Just as these people honor their country with their commitment, this country must honor our commitment to them. With anything less, we lose these valuable people. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support S. 2003.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. It is high time we eliminated this Depression-era provision which penalizes motivated senior citizens for working to augment their Social Security income. 
   As the law currently stands, if a person between the ages of 65 and 69 earns more than $17,000 per year, their Social Security benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 they earn above $17,000. That just isn't right. Ours is a society which values hard work; only our Government would devise a scheme to penalize people for working. 
   Before too long, in 2025, Montana will have the third largest proportion of senior citizens in the Nation. This growth rate is nationwide, however. Our country is aging and the programs which our parents relied on in their golden years need to change if they are to keep pace with the changing face of American society. 
   Most of the senior citizens affected by this unfair provision are those who can afford it the least. These are the very people who struggle to make ends meet every month. Many may face the impossible decision of putting food on  their tables or prescriptions in their drug cabinets. We expect retirees to augment their Social Security income with money from outside resources but then turn around and penalize them for working. Isn't it about time to bring consistency into Social Security? Eliminating the Social Security earnings limit is one important step in reforming the laws which affect our senior citizens. 
   I urge the Senate to follow the House of Representatives by expediting passage of this important legislation. Working seniors deserve no less. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, there are a lot of truckers in town, protesting what they say is an unwarranted increase in fuel costs that is putting them out of business. 
   It really doesn't surprise me. It seems every year we come to the floor of the Senate to criticize the administration's failure to implement a domestic energy policy that would support a sustainable oil and gas industry. We argue for tax relief, common sense royalty collection, access to oil and gas reserves on Federal lands. We do this because there are a lot of us who watch figures, and every day we can see that we are growing more dependent on foreign sources of oil and gas. Oil traditionally coming from the Middle East and gas coming from Canada in ever increasing volumes despite large, untapped reserves in America. I have been joined by numerous Senators from around the Nation in bringing those concerns to the floor. We have proposed numerous pieces of legislation to combat the problem, yet we have not been successful in getting many of them enacted into law. 
   As a result, we are faced with what is happening today: Oil prices are now around $30 a barrel, with few domestic producers reaping any benefits, and with most of our oil coming from offshore. There are few domestic producers enjoying the rise in oil prices because the Administration's energy and environmental policies have just about run them all out of business. That is sad. I speak not only for the oil and gas industry, the trucking industry and the transportation industry, but also for all consumers. A case in point is that we are already witnessing a surcharge being put on airline tickets; the same thing will happen soon with rail transportation as well. 
   When I take a look at my home State of Montana, fuel costs are at least 50 percent higher than they were just a year ago. We have cause for frustration. Montanans are at the end of the line. I don't care if you are receiving goods or shipping product, it hurts us. This is especially true for our number one industry, agriculture. We end up selling wholesale, buying retail, and paying the freight both ways. One has to remember that these costs have to be absorbed by somebody. This somebody is generally the person least able to afford it. Now we have to ask ourselves a question. Are we doing anything about fixing the root of the problem? What are we doing to fix the root problem we have in energy development? 
   Today's rally of long-haul truckers underscores the reality that all consumers and all producers are being faced with fuel increases resulting from a failed domestic energy policy. Prices are simply raising out of sight. We have 26,000 people in Montana who are employed by the trucking industry. They are being impacted by these increases. Farmers are coming upon the planting season. They are facing higher fuel costs which add to their uncontrollable costs of production. Costs of producing in the agricultural industry cannot be passed on; they never have been in the past. It is a buyers' market and you sell for what they offer. End of story. Just because our fuels costs go up, does not mean we get to charge more per bushel. We also aren't faced with the luxury of turning a tractor off and waiting for fuel prices to go down. Mother Nature dictates when you plant, when you till, and when you harvest. She doesn't care if diesel is 50 cents a gallon, $1 a gallon, or $1.80 a gallon. When the time comes, you go. 
   We have seen some improvement in the livestock industry, but we have not seen any kind of improvement in the grain industry. There again, with grain, we get hit harder by energy costs than anywhere else. 
   So far, the administration's only action has been to send the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, to ask OPEC to release more oil and reduce prices. That tells me we are not in a very strong bargaining position. That is upsetting when we could have taken steps to avoid our current plight. The problem of inaction by the 
   administration carries over into other areas of energy. One example is the production of clean coal. We have a lot of coal that is clean coal and considered ``compliant coal'' by the Clean Air Act. It has low SO  
   2 levels, and low emissions. But so far, the Department of the Interior has blocked any sale of that coal, which lies right at the top of the earth. The only thing that has to be done is to take the overburden off, mine the coal and reclaim the area. The result of this inaction has been--and it will show up later on in America's power bills--that soon we will face a shortage of clean coal and stringent emissions controls, and all at once our electric bills will increase because we haven't done a very good job in managing our clean coal resources. 
   Secretary Richardson has testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that clean coal will be an integral portion of our Nation's energy portfolio for the next 30 years. But after they say that, they have done nothing or they are unwilling to ensure that the political actions of the Department of the Interior do not endanger the supply of clean coal. 
   It doesn't make a lot of sense. How about hydroelectric production of electricity? Secretary Babbitt wants to be known as the first Secretary to tear down large dams that are placed along some of our major waterways, and he offers no response when asked how we are going to replace the power produced by those dams. In light of the recent action on the nuclear waste bill, the administration has also opposed any cohesive policy for nuclear energy management, instead desiring to sit back and posture on the debate. 
   Again, we see evidence of a failed energy policy. Today we see the truckers coming to town, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The Department of the Interior has thwarted any attempts to reinvigorate the domestic gas industry. They have closed vast areas of our Outer Continental Shelf to gas. They will release a statement saying they fully support the natural gas industry, yet fail to deliver on any of the policies to help it along. 
   The same has been done throughout the Rocky Mountains. We have reserves of natural gas across Montana that could be used to fuel this nation. There is a large supply, yet we cannot tap it because of the Department of the Interior and this administration's policy seal it away development. 
   I want to bring up one more fuel related problem we are faced with in Montana. In my hometown of Billings, MT, we have three refineries. They produce gas, diesel, and other refined petroleum products, not only for domestic use in Montana but also for the entire region, including eastern Washington. We have to reroute a pipeline that lets those products flow to the Spokane area, and it has to cross about 60 miles of Forest Service managed public lands. This reroute has been vigorously opposed by this administration.  
   What happened? The Yellowstone Pipeline Company went to the Forest Service and said: Give us an estimate for the reroute proposal. We have to do an environmental impact statement. We want to do it right. This was back in 1997. What will it cost they asked. Less than a million dollars was the response from the Forest Service. Good they responded, let's go ahead with the EIS process and find a viable route. Three years later, the Yellowstone Pipeline Company has paid $5 million to resite those 60 miles of pipeline, and just a week and a half ago the Yellowstone Pipeline was forced to pull the plug on the project because the Forest Service refused to acknowledge that their preferred alternative was too expensive to build. A pipeline, the cheapest way to move fuel and distribute energy across this country, now is in jeopardy, if not dead. 
   The result will be that these 60 miles absent of pipeline will be crossed in another way. We are going to rail it or truck it. We will probably have an accident, even the Forest Service's EIS documents acknowledge this. A spill will probably result--we have already had one at Alberton. We might also truck it. However, with energy costs as high as they are today, that will increase the cost to consumers. It also, in that 60 miles, exposes traffic to large semis on a two-lane road. Lives will be at stack. The Forest Service has also acknowledged that, but continues to forge along proposing an unbuildable route. 
   The hazards to the public, and the costs to the consumer, increase. That is just an example of what this administration has failed to do to ensure that we have energy prices that are affordable and energy is accessible to all Americans. 
   So we feel for those truckers out there. We know what it is like to go down that road and try to deliver the goods to America in an efficient and safe way, and to get the products to market in a competitive manner so they fall within the consumers' reach of affording them. 
   Two years ago, we were buying gasoline for around 85, 90 cents a gallon. It didn't take us long to get spoiled, did it? But now we find that through that we usually have to pay the piper one time or another. It is us, the consumers, that will pick up the bill of a failed energy policy. The administration will be gone, but we will be left holding the tab. It is our economy that will slow, and it is our families that will have to do with less. We see it happening today in our oil and gas production. Let's not see it happen in our electricity production. This economy we have been enjoying all these years could go away in a flash--just a flash. It takes a while for an administration's action to lead to a tangible impact, we are beginning the impact of this administration's failed energy policy today. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce a bill that is designed to clean up a terrible mess at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, dealing with civil rights. 
   Last year, a finding was made that the USDA had, for decades, been guilty of violating many of America's producer's civil rights. When these producers tried to take advantage of the programs offered by the USDA they were treated differently than their friends and neighbors. 
   Many cases have been pending for too long. At least one has been on the list for up to ten years. Due to USDA's inaction, Congress waived the statute of limitations on certain USDA discrimination cases, giving farmers until October 21, 2000, to file or re-file cases that allegedly occurred between 1981 through 1997. In addition to the cases that have been pending, that added another major backlog. 
   While we realize there is a massive backlog of cases to be dealt with, we feel Congress has made a good-faith effort to assist the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in every way possible. We have written countless letters and met with Rosalind Gray, the Director of the OCR to discuss this issue. In addition, in 1998 the Senate included money in the agricultural appropriations bill, to deal with this back-log of cases. 
   However, despite numerous phone calls and letters, no progress has been made in resolving these cases. I have invited Department officials to come to Montana and speak with the civil rights complainants so that we may solve these cases more quickly. So far, I have not seen enough action and not nearly enough closure. 
   The horror stories about the treatment civil rights complainants have received from the USDA are numerous and unbelievable. These complaints are simply being ignored. The inadequacy of this process is adding insult to injury. These people are being put on hold while the USDA plods through their cases. Many have been forced to the brink. They don't even know if they can still make agriculture their livelihood should USDA finally decide in their favor. Operating costs alone are placing many producers at a disadvantage. Add to that, the costs associated with filing a complaint and you can see why many feel completely helpless, and hopeless. 
   I have constituents calling my staff at home because they are on their last leg. The OCR has continually ignored requests for information from my staff, or delayed sending pertinent information to these people. Those affected by these decisions cannot afford to waste more precious time listening to the USDA's excuses while they try to find a way to buy next month's food. Allowing these cases to go on for years and years is a travesty. How can these people get on with their life? The USDA has taken away their livelihood. Without equal treatment from the USDA they can't run their operations. Without a working farm, they have lost everything they had. 
   Secretary Glickman has stated publicly and repeatedly that the civil rights issue within the Department of Agriculture is an extremely high priority on his agenda. It should be. But still, I have seen very little action. 
   These constituents cannot get on with their lives until the USDA does take action. My bill will give the OCR 270 days to resolve the complaint after it has been investigated. If, after 270 days the complaint is not resolved, the complainant may petition the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ shall then conduct a review and make a recommendation to the OCR within 30 days. 
   This law will also broaden the statute of limitations. As I said earlier, legislation passed by Congress waived the statute of limitations on certain USDA discrimination cases, giving farmers until October 21, 2000, to file or re-file cases that allegedly occurred between 1981 through 1997. However, I want to make sure that civil rights cases do not fall through the cracks of that waiver. If an act occurred prior to February 22, 1998, for example, that person could not file for discrimination. This legislation will cover that gap. 
   These cases must be resolved soon. These producers have suffered too much already. They cannot afford to wait any longer. We look forward to working with members of other states affected by this abuse of the civil rights program to resolve these complaints as quickly as possible.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fort Peck Fish Hatchery Authorization Act of 2000. As you may know, the Fort Peck project was built in the 1930s to dam the Upper Missouri River. The original authorization legislation for the Fort Peck project, and subsequent revisions and additions, left a great many promises unmet. A valley was flooded, but originally Montana was promised increased irrigation, low-cost power, and economic development. Since the original legislation, numerous laws have been enacted promising increased recreational activities on the lake, and also that the federal government would do more to support the fish and wildlife resources in the area. 
   In this day and age, economic development in rural areas is becoming more and more dependent upon recreation and strong fish and wildlife numbers. The Fort Peck area is faced with a number of realities. First, the area is in dire need of a fish hatchery. The only hatchery in the region to support warm water species is found in Miles City, Montana. It is struggling to meet the needs of the fisheries in the area, yet it continues to fall short. Additionally, an outbreak of disease or failure in the infrastructure at the Miles City hatchery would leave the entire region reeling with no secondary source to support the area's fisheries.  
   We are also faced with the reality that despite the promises given, the State of Montana has had to foot the bill for fish hatchery operations in the area. Since about 1950 the State has been funding these operations with little to no support from the Corps of Engineers. A citizens group spanning the State of Montana finally decided to make the federal government keep its promises. 
   Last year the citizens group organized, and state legislation subsequently passed to authorize the sale of a warm water fishing stamp to begin collecting funds for the eventual operation and maintenance of the hatchery. I helped the group work with the Corps of Engineers to ensure that $125,000 in last year's budget was allocated to a feasibility study for the project, and Montanans kept their end of the bargain by finding another $125,000 to match the Corps expenditure. Clearly, we are putting our money, along with our sweat, where our mouth is. 
   Recreation is part of the local economy. But the buzzword today is diversity. Diversify your economy. The Fort Peck area depends predominately on agriculture. More irrigated acres probably aren't going to help the area pull itself up by its boot straps. But a stronger recreational and tourism industry sure will help speed things up. 
   A lot of effort has already gone into this project. A state bill has been passed. The Corps has dedicated a project manager to the project. Citizens have raised money and jumped over more hurdles than I care to count. But the bottom line is that this is a great project with immense support. It is a good investment in the area, and it helps the federal government fulfill one thing that it ought to--its promises. 
   Mr. President, I want to acknowledge that this legislation is still a work in progress and many of the specifics will change as the Corps completes its feasibility study on the project. It may cost slightly more. It may cost less. The cost share requirement may need to be altered to make the project work, but I feel this legislation must be introduced now to expedite its consideration.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Brent Stanghelle who has been an integral asset to Montana's agricultural scene. 
   Brent Stanghelle has been the voice of agriculture for North Central Montana for several years. Broadcasting from Great Falls, Montana at KMON, Brent has brought the agricultural news to producers faithfully. Brent has proven himself to be a true friend of Montana's natural resource-based economy. 
   Brent Stanghelle has made the decision to move on and pursue other agriculturally related interests in his life. With his parting, there will be a quiet spot on the air for many listeners. 
   I extend my thanks to Brent Stanghelle for a job well done. He was trusted and relied upon by many producers. He has dedicated many years to keeping the voice of agriculture alive and ``on the air'' in North Central Montana. His work and dedication have not gone unnoticed.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will repeal a little-noticed, yet extremely detrimental, installment tax provision on small businesses. 
   This provisions, enacted at the end of last year's congressional session as part of the conference report of H.R. 1180, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 was placed into effect on December 17 when President Clinton signed the bill. 
   According to this provision, many small-business owners who sell their businesses will now have to immediately pay in one lump sum all capital gains taxes resulting from the sale, even if the sale's payments are spread out in installments over a period of several years. Under previous treatment, the capital gain tax payment could be spread over the life of the installment note. 
   An unintended consequence of this provision has been to adversely affect the sale of small businesses. Most sales of these businesses use the installment sales method. Larger publicly traded corporations are not impacted as they tend to use other financing methods involving cash or stock transactions. 
   According to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), it is possible that most of the 200,000 small business sales which occur each year will be adversely affected by this provision. Some estimates show that, depending upon the circumstances, this provision could reduce the sale price of a business by 5, 10, 20 percent or more. 
   My legislation will repeal the elimination of this provision giving small business owners the opportunity to defer over the period of payments the capital gains tax on the sale of their business. 
   Mr. President, the American public is aware of this tax. I have seen press releases, newspaper articles and even a story on a national news network. This will effect not only the liquidity and price a seller is required to accept for a business. 
   We're not talking about major corporations--rather, we are talking about small businesses--a local hamburger joint, a laundromat, a car wash, the businesses that support a community. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the small business owner by cosponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. BURNS. As the sponsor of the low power television provisions contained in the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify one of the provisions. Specifically, I want to ensure that a qualified low power television (LPTV) station in New York City serving the Korean-American community on Channel 17 (WEBR(LP), formerly W17BM) is not prohibited from obtaining Class A licensing as a result of Sec. 5008(f)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. 
   As drafted, Section 5008(7)(C)(ii) requires a qualified LPTV station to demonstrate the it will not interfere with land mobile radio services operating on Channel 16 in New York City in order to obtain the Class A license. However, in 1995, the Commission authorized public safety agencies to use Channel 16 in New York City on a conditional basis pursuant to a waiver of the Commission's rules. The Order granting that waiver specifically stated that the low power television station on Channel 17 would not have any responsibility to protect land mobile televisions on adjacent Channel 16. Do you agree with my understanding of Section 5008(f)(C)(ii), namely that this section is not intended to prevent that low power station's qualification for the Class A license?

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the prime sponsor of S. 1547, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 486, I would like to make remarks on a technical edit to H.R. 486. I believe Sec. 3(f)(1) of Sec. 5008 needs some clarification. Subsection (1)(D) states very clearly that the ``Commission shall act to preserve the contours of low-power television licensees pending the final resolution of a class A application.'' The Commission's function to preserve the protected contours is very clear. But creating separate subsections for the certification and application processes may have created some uncertainty regarding the timing of when the Commission should begin to provide this protection. I want to assure my colleagues that I agree with the prime sponsors of H.R. 486 that the front-end certification process is an integral first step in the application process. It is clearly our intent that as soon as the Commission is in receipt of an acceptable certification notice, it should protect the contours of this station until final resolution of that application. Of course, this provision does not exempt licensees from other provision of this act. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, shared appreciation agreements have the potential to cause hundreds of farm foreclosures across the nation, and especially in my home state of Montana. Ten years ago, a large number of farmers signed these agreements. At that time they were under the impression that they would be required to pay these back at the end of ten years, at a reasonable rate of redemption. 
   However, that has not proved to be the case. The appraisals being conducted by the Farm Service Agency are showing increased values of ridiculous proportions. By all standards, one would expect the value to have decreased. Farm prices are the lowest they have been in years, and there does not seem to be a quick recovery forthcoming. Farmers cannot possibly be expected to pay back a value twice the amount they originally wrote down. Especially in light of the current market situation, I believe something must be done about the way these appraisals are conducted. 
   USDA is attempting to fix the problem with proposed rules and regulations but farmers need help with these agreements now. The USDA has published several regulations addressing the issue but the comment period will further drag out the process. I am fearful that in the meantime more farmers will be forced into foreclosure. 
   My bill mandates by legislation these important regulations. It will exclude capital investments from the increase in appreciation and allow farmers to take out a loan at the ``Homestead Rate,'' which is the government's cost of borrowing. 
   Farmers should not be penalized for attempting to better their operations. Nor can they be expected to delay capital improvements so that they will not be penalized. It will be necessary for most of these agricultural producers to take out an additional loan during these hard times. It is important that the interest rate on that loan will accommodate their needs. The governments current cost of borrowing equals about 6.25 percent, far less than the original 9 percent farmers and ranches were paying. 
   I look forward to working with members in other states to alleviate the financial burdens imposed by shared appreciation agreements. I hope that we may move this through the legislative process quickly to provide help as soon as possible to our farmers.

   Mr. BURNS. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, this is a compromise to facilitate the passage of this omnibus bill. We have worked a long time on this. We are working up to a deadline where we could see some blue screens after December 31. But one cannot ignore the fact that even our satellite viewers should be able to receive local broadcasts or network stations in their local areas. The only way we will ever provide any competition for the cables under the rules they live by, under must carry, and still have a viable satellite service that will compete with cables is through this method. 
   I appreciate the commitment of the Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee. I thank my friend from Montana. He has worked hard on this. I thank the majority leader. Without their commitments, we would be talking a different tune now. I also commend the leadership in the House of Representatives for making the same commitment that this legislation be passed early next year. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I am pleased to be joined by Mr. BAUCUS, in sponsoring a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which addresses the backlog of Montana civil rights complaints at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
   Last year, a finding was made that the USDA had, for decades, been guilty of violating many of America's producer's civil rights. When these producers tried to take advantage of the programs offered by the USDA they were treated differently than their friends and neighbors. We enacted Legislation last fall, that was intended to right this wrong. Even with passage of this provision, it remains a difficult challenge to ensure that those who have been harmed by USDA will receive a prompt and balanced resolution of their complaints. 
   It appears that a number of those previously investigated complaints have fallen into some sort of ``black hole''. Despite numerous phone calls and concerted pressure, no progress has been made in resolving these cases. We have been contacted by a number of Montanans who have shared horror stories about the treatment their cases have received from the USDA's Office of Civil Rights. These complaints are simply being ignored. The inadequacy of this process is adding insult to injury, keeping these producers in limbo and allowing their complaints to rest, unresolved. These constituents cannot get on with their lives until the USDA takes action. For those who have justified complaints, this delay is another slap in the face. 
   This resolution expreses the sense of the Senate that USDA's delays must stop. These cases must be resolved soon. It is our intent that they be resolved by March 1, 2000. These producers has suffered too much already. They cannot afford to wait any longer. 
   We look forward to working with members of other states affected by this abuse of the civil rights program to resolve these complaints as quickly a possible.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Linda Morgan. During her tenure as the chairwoman of the Surface Transportation Board, Ms. Morgan has failed to achieve a primary goal of this independent agency--protecting the rights of shippers using rail transportation. Earlier this year, I along with a number of other colleagues, introduced a bill, S. 621, that would help to create competition among rail carriers where that competition does not currently exist due to regional monopolization. 
   This bill would resolve the economic inequities found around our nation. In my State of Montana, our farmers pay dramatically more for transportation costs than farmers anyplace else in the State. In fact, on a proportionate comparison, Montana's farmers pay more than most other shippers in the world. Why? I'll tell you why--because nearly the entire State of Montana is captive to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad. In the case of Montana farmers, Montana is captive to BNSF. 
   I cannot blame Ms. Morgan for this. The board's decision are based on misinterpreted statute that was legislated in the early 80's. 
   However, I cam blame Ms. Morgan for not recognizing this as the case before the shippers asked me and several of my colleagues for assistance. It is inexcusable to treat the Nation's shippers so pitifully. It is arrogant on behalf of the railroads to think that they can take advantage of small shippers using strongarm tactics to determine shipping costs. It should not cost more to ship from Montana to the Pacific Northwest than it costs to ship from the Midwest to the Pacific Northwest--over the same tracks. This is an absurd manner in which to allow a railroad to operate. 
   Back to Ms. Morgan. It is about time for Congress to recognize the inequities in the rail industry. Competition is based on choice. Without multiple competitors to choose from, we are left with a monopoly. BNSF has a monopoly in Montana and the four behemoths that have evolved since the early 80s when we had over 40 large railroads have monopolies all across this Nation. 
   Let me quote Ms. Morgan from hearings held earlier this year: 
   Ms. Morgan has stated, ``If Congress feels the statute doesn't work, it's up to Congress to provide a revision to the statute.'' Mr. President, Ms. Morgan is the chairwoman of the STB and a very intelligent woman. Ms. Morgan has recommended to this body that Congress would need to change the law in order to create an equitable environment. If the STB is saying this, if hundreds of shippers are saying this, if economists are saying this, why won't Congress react? I'll tell you why. Railroad interests in this city have a stronghold on legislation that would take away their ability to charge unchallenged rates. 
   Ms. Morgan has also stated the following: 
   ``The role of the STB is to allow competition where it exists and protect those where it does not exist.'' Let me give you an example of where competition does not exist. Competition does not exist in the entire state of Montana. Competition does not exist in the entire state of North Dakota. With four major railroads in the country, regional rail monopolies are very common. Montana was one of the first--we've been captive since 1980. 
   Another statement from Ms. Morgan. 
   ``The board is there to make sure that no rate is unreasonable. The equalization of rates is not inherent in the statute.'' A goal of the STB is to make sure that no rate is ``unreasonable''. The STB could define as unreasonable the rate paid by Montana's farmers. These rates are unreasonable! Lastly, Ms. Morgan has indicated that, ``The statute does not make competition a priority.'' I agree with her and that is why I am sympathetic, Her's is a thankless job and until Congress gives the STB the proper tools to decide cases in an equitable manner, it will continue to be a thankless job. 
   Mr. President, we have an opportunity to do what is right for America. I will not support Ms. Morgan but I will support reform of the STB. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, when a hurricane engulfs the Eastern seaboard or an earthquake shatters the lives of Californians, we reach out with compassion to those people who are affected. America's hearts and minds always turn to those who are adversely impacted by these events. 
   I bring to your attention a devastating natural disaster that recently struck the Eastern portion of my home State, Montana. On Halloween night, it seems as if Mother Nature played a frightening trick on many rural Montanans. A storm below out of the Rocky Mountains and onto the plains of the short grass prairie with winds in excess of 70 miles per hour. 
   These violent winds stoked several prairie fires. The wild fires immediately became uncontrolled infernos as they are driven along by the gusts, in some cases the wall of flames spanning many miles. 
   The tiny town of Outlook, MT, was evacuated in the face of this unmanageable fire. Unfortunately, the town itself was laid to waste in the wake of the flames. Thankfully, due to the early evacuation and quick response of the authorities, no lives were lost. 
   Two hundred and fifty miles south of Outlook another town was facing the same fate. The rural community of Ekalaka was also under evacuation orders. A different fire of the same magnitude was moving toward town as it was swept ahead of the horrific winds. This fire spared the community but still left ruin in its wake. It is estimated that ten to twenty sections of good winter grazing land has been destroyed along with miles of fences and corrals. That is between 6,400 and 12,800 acres that producers will not be able to use for winter feed. The increased costs of buying hay to feed livestock will put a great burden on ranchers already experiencing financial hardship within their industry. 
   Not only were these two communities impacted, there were several other communities in Eastern Montana that sustained damage due to fires. I offer my sincere gratitude to all of those who worked so diligently to fight these fires and save property and lives. 
   We now have Montanans facing the onset of winter, homeless, without the security of their places of business, and agricultural producers, without feed for their livestock. Just as we unite together for those who are struck by other natural disasters, I hope that you will join with me in support of these Montanans, who lost not only their homes but their livelihoods. 
   Entire communities have been adversely affected by this unforeseen emergency and I will be watching closely to see that these folks receive the aid needed to rebuild their lives. Montanans have suffered great losses no less devastating than the hurricanes on the East Coast and they too deserve a helping hand in their time of need. 
   My thoughts and prayers go out to each and every individual whose lives are in disarray due to this sudden tragedy.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the Martel family of Bozeman, Montana. 
   In 1951, Emil Martel and his family fled communist Russia and eventually settled in Bozeman. In 1960, Emil and his son, Bill, formed Martel Construction and constituted its entire workforce. In the past forty years, however, Martel Construction has grown to employ 200 people and now contracts in six states. Today, Martel Construction maintains its familiar character and is still run as a family business. Martel Construction was recently awarded the United States Small Business Administration's 1999 Entrepreneurial Success Award as well as the 1999 Montana Family Business of the Year award by the College of Business at Montana State University-Bozeman. 
   Martel Construction and the Martel family represent a modern American success story. I applaud them not only for what they have accomplished for themselves but also for what they have given back to their community. Their hard work serves as inspiration for other small businesses in my state of Montana; their success is proof that the American Dream lives on.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over the lack of adequate privacy protections in the financial modernization bill under consideration. While I feel that the current laws governing our financial services industry are out-of-date and in need of modernization, I do have strong concerns over the inadequate and weak privacy provisions included in this bill. 
   Paramount to our freedom is the right to privacy; to be left alone and to be secure in the belief that our business is just that, ours and no one else's. When we do share our personal business information with others it is with the real and reasonable expectation that it remains our property. When dealing with our doctor or lawyer we know that the communication is privileged. Traditionally, when providing information to our banker or insurance agent or our stockbroker, we similarly believed that the information provided was specific to that transaction. 
   We choose to compromise our privacy to the extent necessary to conduct business and with the belief that the information is ours and does not become the property of the person with whom we are dealing. No one has the right and no one should have the right to market our personal information without our prior approval. To do so violates our privacy and compromises the trust relationship that is vital to commerce. 
   Regrettably, we now know that those we trusted with one of our most prized possessions, our privacy, have violated that trust in the interests of profit. In the course of deliberations of this bill, we have heard that the sharing of information is essential to efficiency in the market place and to better provide customer benefits and services. However, the fact remains that these benefits come at the expense of personal privacy and that creates an atmosphere of distrust and invites abuse by the very people we must trust to conduct our business. Technology must be tempered with caution. Efficiency cannot be at the expense of personal privacy. Institutions should not have the license to exploit our information unless they allow us to opt out. Individuals should have the right to allow institutions to share their information by opting in. Customers should be given sufficient notice and choice to deny financial institutions from sharing or selling their nonpublic, personally identifiable, sensitive financial information. Americans must have the ability to say ``no.'' 
   This bill remembers the big financial institutions in this country, however, seems to forget the most important variable in the equation--the individual. This bill protects banks' rights, but fails to consider an individual's rights to privacy. We need to establish rules to protect the privacy of a customer's confidential information. No longer should we rely upon or expect the financial institutions themselves to do this, as they are the very ones profiting from the sale of customer information. We must find a balanced system that protects consumers. 
   I assure my colleagues that we will very soon be revisiting this issue and that these deliberations will be prompted by constituents abused as a result of the loopholes contained in this bill. Bottom line, financial institutions should not be allowed to share and sell confidential, personal customer information without consent. Americans need provisions which truly protect their privacy. Americans deserve this right, no less.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will dramatically expand rural America's access to modern health care. 
   The Health Care Access Improvement Act creates a significant tax incentive, which encourages doctors, dentists, physician assistants, licensed mental health providers, and nurse practitioners to establish practices in under-served areas. Until now, rural areas have not been able to compete with the financial draw of urban settings and therefore have had trouble attracting medical professionals to their communities. The $1,000 per month tax credit will allow health care workers to enjoy the advantages of rural life without drastic financial sacrifices. But the real winners in this bill are the thousands of Americans whose access to health care is almost impossible due to a lack of doctors and dentists in small town America. 
   There are nine counties in the great state of Montana which do not have even one doctor. In these rural settings, agriculture is often the only employer. Farming and ranching is hard, dangerous work. Serious injuries can happen in an instant. And while Montanans have always been known as a heartier breed of people, we get sick too. It is unreasonable to expect the farmer who has had a run-in with an auger or the elderly rancher's widow to drive two hours or more to get stitched up or to have a crown on a tooth replaced. As doctors, dentists, physicians assistants, mental health providers, and nurse practitioners are attracted to under-served areas, Montanans and others in isolated communities will finally enjoy the medical treatment they deserve. 
   Mr. President, everyone wins with this legislation. Rural Montana, rural America, and providers all benefit from increased access, service and a better quality of life. I look forward to this legislation's quick passage.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to urge passage of S. 438, The Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 1999, introduced by myself and Senator BAUCUS of Montana. S. 438 is the ratification of an agreement among the United States, the State of Montana and the Chippewa Cree Tribe settling the water rights of the Tribe in Montana. This represents a fair and equitable settlement that will enhance the ability of the Tribe to develop a sustainable economy while protecting existing investments in water use by off-Reservation ranchers who rely on water for their livelihoods. 
   The Settlement was negotiated with extensive involvement by the Tribe and its members, the State of Montana, the Administration, and the water users who own private land on streams shared with the Reservation. It has the support of all those affected and received the overwhelming support of the Montana Legislature when presented for ratification in 1997. 
   It is a tribute to the Governor of Montana, Marc Racicot, represented by the Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission; the chairman of the Tribe, Bert Corcoran and the Tribe Negotiating Team; David Hayes, Acting Deputy Secretary of the Interior, the Federal negotiating team; and the water users on Big Sandy and Beaver Creeks in the Milk River valley of Montana, that this Compact represents a truly local solution that takes into account the needs and sovereign rights of each party. 
   In addition to ratifying the Settlement, the bill provides the necessary authorization for funding to develop the water resources on the Reservation and to assure a safe drinking water supply for the Tribe. For several years we have worked closely with the Senate Indian Affairs and Energy Committees to fashion a bill that is consistent with federal policy toward Indian tribes. Thanks to the substantial efforts of the Committees, I believe we have accomplished that goal. 
   This is the first Indian water right settlement to come before Congress in many years. in approving the Chippewa Cree Settlement Act, we have the opportunity to send the message to western States that we endorse negotiation as the preferred method of Indian water right quantification, and that we will defer to States and Tribes to fashion their own approach to the allocation of water. 
   In closing, I believe that the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act is an historic agreement. This is truly a local solution that takes into account the needs and sovereign rights of each party. Just as the mentioned parties have worked closely together to get us to the submission of this bill today, I want to thank all members of Congress with whom I worked closely to ensure passage of this important bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this has not been a good week--losing a friend and colleague; Payne Stewart, and, yes, another friend here in this town who had a government relations job. 
   We often hear the word ``lobbyist'' put in a negative tone, but this was a man who built a reputation of integrity and honesty in government relations. 
   This week, cancer claimed R. Duffy Wall. He died at his home on the Eastern Shore. He was friend and mentor. 
   You know what we would be without the folks who work in different areas of American life who represent that way of life to the Congress of the United States. We are not all wise. We do not know everything about everything. We need help. Duffy Wall was such a person--honest, straight shooter, a friend, dead at age 57, far too young. We will not get to use his services and wisdom anymore either. 
   I could talk longer about these friends. This has been a bad week, especially losing our Senator and losing a person very close to us.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, tomorrow, most of us will make our way toward Rhode Island. We will attend the memorial services for John Chafee, our colleague and friend who we have all known and grown to respect in our work in the Senate. 
   As I look across this Chamber and I notice the black pall and the flowers that grace the desk of Senator Chafee, my memory is triggered to the first time I ever met him. 
   When I first ran for the Senate back in 1988, he called me up. I was going through this agonizing process of making the decision whether to stand for election to the Senate. I received a call from Senator Chafee inviting me to a gathering of prospective candidates at Williamsburg, VA. I accepted that invitation. I met for the first time this giant of a man from Rhode Island. I do not use the term ``giant'' loosely. He has not diminished. This was the impression he made on me at our first meeting, and over the years that has been the lasting impression. 
   In our daily work here in the Senate, did we agree on everything? No. Did I have a true understanding of his constituency in his State? No. Nor did he of mine. So we did not agree on everything, nor should we. Men of substance do not need to agree but be men of honesty, of civility, and of integrity. 
   When we refer to the legions of great Americans who have answered above and beyond the normal call, John Chafee rightfully takes his place among the most distinguished: A marine in the South Pacific, Guadalcanal, all during World War II; and, if that wasn't enough for his country, he came home, graduated from law school, got his law degree, and he answered his country's call again, serving in Korea. I, a former marine, understand that. But that was not enough for this man yet who took public service very seriously--a Governor, Cabinet Secretary, Secretary of the Navy, and Senator. At every station, he distinguished himself, his State, his Nation, and his family. 
   Though the voice has been silenced, his words of wisdom and leadership will echo through these Halls for generations. He was one who quietly went about his way in making America a better place. What a legacy we would all like to leave. 
   He was a leader of a generation. Tom Brokow got it right. It was a generation that quietly built a nation no matter their station in life. 
   So we say thank you, John Chafee. May we be men and women who protect and respect what you have done. You were a giant among men.

Grizzly athletes will visit local schools and promote the concept of service above self. They will speak to students about the virtues of being a positive role model. Griz ACES is a comprehensive year-round program of personnel development that is based on our Nation's founding principle, which is service to country. I commend these student athletes and the service men and women who have provided the guiding light for this excellent program.

   Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. 
   The amendment that was crafted by Senator BENNETT and myself is a very important amendment regarding this business of freedom of speech and how it is connected to the issue of campaign finance reform. What the amendment actually says is that citizens who use the Internet to express 
   themselves politically are not subject to ``Big Brother'' policing imposed by the Federal election bureaucrats. The amendment simply prevents the FEC from defining political communications by individuals over the Internet as campaign contributions. 
   I thank my friend from Utah for his input when we crafted this amendment. I should emphasize to my colleagues that this amendment is very narrow in scope and covers only individuals who don't receive compensation for their Internet communications. I think that is very important--individuals who do not receive compensation for their Internet communications. Further, these individuals cannot solicit political contributions using the Internet. 
   If an American citizen feels strongly enough about a candidate or an issue to create a web site to express his views, he should not be subject to oversight by the Federal Election Commission. Free expression is the founding principle of this country. 
   Currently--and not a surprise to those of us who have seen the explosion of the Internet--there are 90 million Americans who use the World Wide Web to access information, e-mail, and other services every day. Undoubtedly, many of these communications are political in nature. Are we to expect the FEC to somehow monitor and regulate all of this political dialog? To me, that is a very chilling scenario. 
   I myself use the unique capabilities of the Internet for a host of things--to communicate with my constituents, for services. We have a web page that allows my constituents access to my office electronically. Every week, I do a ``cybercast'' from my web site, where I answer questions posed to me by my constituents from Montana and across the country. 
   By the way, once you go on the web, you are everywhere. Just yesterday, in my cybercast, I commented on the tremendous, productive debate that has  resulted from the increased use of this great thing we call the Internet. It allows any individual to become a publisher and have the same access in the marketplace of ideas as the largest political party, or corporation, for that matter. 
   We have seen the leveling of marketing because one person with an idea for a service or goods can now go on the web and take on the largest corporations and be successful. That is what makes it a very powerful tool. 
   We have seen spectacular growth result from the upward spiral of the Internet. A recent Commerce Department study has indicated that over a third of the U.S. increase in gross domestic product since 1995 is directly traceable to information technologies and, in particular, the Internet. Small businesses and individuals have used those capabilities of this new tool to tap into global markets and compete directly with large corporations. 
   Even more important than the raw economic numbers, however, is the flowering of the discussion of ideas that has been fostered by the Internet. Whether on web sites, chat rooms, or e-mail, the revolution in information technology has resulted in the ongoing, vigorous, sustained debates on the critical issues that now face our country. 
   A year ago, I was in China and there, too, as the capability grows, the Internet grows--not as fast as we have experienced here in this country, because of infrastructure more than anything else, but it is growing. And with it is a growing fear in that country where the Government controls every aspect of information; the fear of the freedom of flow on the Internet is very real. 
   The Internet uniquely provides the ability for any individual to express his political beliefs, and we think that should not be infringed upon. To limit free speech of individuals in the very country that created the Internet is as dangerous as it is misguided. As chairman of the Senate Communications Subcommittee, and cochairman of the Internet Caucus, I have been convinced time and time again of the folly of trying to regulate the Internet. 
   Government should not impose burdensome regulations on political speech on the Internet, or any other medium. Instead, the Government should act to keep the Internet and those medium outlets a free speech zone. 
   I urge my colleagues, if this amendment sees the light of day and comes to this floor, to adopt this amendment as part of the ongoing reform. 
   I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend from Kentucky. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the senior Senator from Missouri, who is also the chairman of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Subcommittee responsible for the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill, in a colloquy. This colloquy is to clarify the committee's position on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s funding in fiscal year 2000 to implement the regional haze rule. I have concerns about how the EPA may distribute fiscal year 2000 funding provided for this rule.

   Mr. BURNS. I understand that in the conference report to the fiscal year 2000 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and independent agencies appropriations bill, $5,000,000 is provided to help the states and recognized regional partnerships implement the new EPA regional haze rule. Of this total, an unspecified amount will be provided directly to the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) and the remaining portion will be allocated among the states and other recognized regional partnerships. My concern is, given that 10 states are part of the WRAP, EPA may distribute a major share of the $5,000,000 to the WRAP and not provide any funding to these 10 states since they are involved with the WRAP. In essence, EPA could assume that funding for the WRAP constituted funding for these 10 states. This is not what I believe this report language intended. Thus, I believe that we need to ensure that EPA understands that funding for the states includes those states working in the WRAP.

   Mr. BURNS. The purpose for this conference report language to directly fund the WRAP was based upon Congressional concerns with delayed funding in fiscal year 1999 to the WRAP. As of the end of fiscal year 1999, no funds from EPA had been allocated to the WRAP as had been appropriated. This delay in funding has jeopardized the program and progress of the WRAP to assist the states in addressing new regulatory requirements and deadlines of the regional haze rule. This delay also seems a bit ironic since EPA encourages states to form regional partnerships to implement this new law. Since the WRAP is faced with an October 2000 deadline to develop target levels for sulfur dioxide emissions and a contingent Market Trading Program for this new rule, direct funding in fiscal year 2000 is the most effective way to ensure the states meet this new rule.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, Chairman COCHRAN and his staff have done a highly commendable job of crafting a bill to help agriculture in these tough times. Important funding is included in the bill for agricultural research, nutrition programs, natural resource programs, food safety, export enhancement, rural development, and marketing and regulatory programs. I am exceptionally pleased with the funding that will go to Montana to carry out important agricultural research and promote rural development. 
   Times are tough in agriculture. In Montana, thousands of farmers and ranchers are experiencing a severe price crunch. Commodities simply are not bringing the prices agricultural producers need to break even. Now is an essential time to provide producers opportunities for diversification and increased marketing opportunities. Times are tough and times are changing. 
   The Federal Government has the opportunity to provide agricultural producers with enhanced options for marketing. We can do that through funding for agricultural research and rural development and policy changes for sanctions reform, country-of-origin labeling, rescission of the USDA grade, balance of trade laws, and price reporting. 
   I am extremely pleased with the inclusion, at my request, of reporting in this bill. Mandatory price reporting is a milestone for livestock producers. For too long there has been too much mistrust between agricultural producers and meat packers. Four major packers control 79 percent of the meat-packing industry. Many producers raising and feeding livestock feel that packers can control the market by not providing data on either the number of cattle they buy or the prices they pay for it. The USDA collects the information voluntarily. This legislation mandates that packers will provide that data twice daily and make it easily accessible to ranchers. 
   Mandatory price reporting provides Montana producers with all the pertinent information they need to make the best possible marketing decision. It means that a Montana rancher can check the daily markets. They will have the necessary data to make the decision to sell their livestock immediately or hold out for a better price. A five cent increase in the market can mean an extra $30 per animal. On a 300-head operation that means an extra $9,000. To those experiencing the best economic times in years, $9,000 doesn't seem like much. I can tell you--to a rancher who hasn't met the cost-of-production in three or four years, any amount of money in the black looks pretty good. 
   Lately ranchers have not had the money even to buy necessities for operating expenses. Due to the nature of the business and risks involved, farmers and ranchers are used to utilizing credit and operating loans. However, this economic crisis has bankers and rural business worried. Main Street Rural America is hurting too. Producers making knowledge-based marketing decisions helps everybody. It helps agricultural producers--and it helps rural communities who depend on agriculture for their livelihood. 
   Kent and Sarah Hereim own a 300-head operation between Harlowton and Judith Gap, MT. Nine thousand dollars means to them a new computer. That gives them even more accessibility to marketing information and the ability to make better marketing decisions. A computer provides access to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade for futures marketing options. It provides an updated mechanism to pay bills and keep spreadsheets on operating expenses. A computer can be a valuable tool for ranchers to keep production records, carcass data, grazing plans, and other management information. These records allow producers to be better managers and increase profits. 
   Nine thousand dollars can mean a new bull in addition to the computer. Buying better seedstock increases genetic capability and produces better animals. Increase in quality increases profit. More and more emphasis is being placed on paying producers on a grid. Paying on a grid means ranchers are paid on the quality of their animals not merely the number of pounds. This gives producers who strive for better genetics and meat quality a clear advantage. 
   Rural communities win too. An extra $9,000 helped the local computer store and it helped others in the industry. That new bull Kent and Sarah bought helps the seedstock (bull) producer who now has extra money to buy fencing supplies from the local agricultural supply store. The owner of that ag supply store now has extra money for Christmas gifts at the local clothing store. That clothing store owner puts extra money in a CD at the bank. In a rural community a dollar turning over makes a world of difference. 
   This example is why it is so important to put control back in the hands of the livestock producer. It is exceedingly important to producers to have an assurance that they are receiving timely and accurate data. It doesn't make sense for those raising the commodity to be a passive price-taker. Having the information readily accessible puts the rancher in a position to make good marketing decisions and not be left fully at the mercy of the buyer. 
   In Montana, livestock outnumber people by at least twice. These are less than a million people in Montana and over 2.5 million head of livestock. Sixty-four percent of the land in Montana is used for agricultural production. Livestock producers depend on the livestock markets for their livelihood. Mandatory price reporting gives them that data and the controls to use it. 
   Also important to livestock producers is the Sheep Industry Improvement Center. This center, which is located at USDA, has a $30 million budget to assist the sheep and goat industries in research and education. 
   I realize that no long-term solution will work until this current economic crisis is taken care of. This bill goes a long way in getting producers back on their feet and on the way to a better agricultural sector. Immediate funding needs of farmers and ranchers are addressed in a manner that will give them an opportunity to get back on track. 
   The $8.7 billion package contains important funding for Agricultural Marketing Transition Act (AMTA) payments for wheat and barley producers in Montana, as well as $322 million for livestock producers and $650 million in crop insurance. 
   I am pleased that important language for durum wheat producers was included in the bill. Before this change, the method for calculating loan deficiency payments (LDP) repayments unfairly presumed a high quality for  durum, which resulted in a lower repayment rate for their crop. However, as a result of this language, the USDA has agreed to correct inequities in the current loan deficiency program (LDP) program for durum wheat. 
   The crop insurance portion of the bill will provide $400 million to provide agricultural producers with a premium discount toward the purchase of crop insurance for the 2000 crop year. Currently, farmers would pay a higher premium for the year 2000 than for 1999 or 2001. With the lowest prices in years, agricultural producers cannot afford higher premiums. 
   I am disappointed that sanctions reform was taken out of the bill. I believe these concerns must be addressed as soon as possible. I will support Senator ASHCROFT in his efforts to exempt food and medicine from sanctioned countries. American farmers and ranchers stand much to lose by not having all viable markets open to them. 
   Imposing trade sanctions hurts American farmers and ranchers. Sanctions have effectively shut out American agricultural producers from 11 percent of the world market, with sanctions imposed on various products of over 60 countries. They allow our competitors an open door to those markets where sanctions are imposed by the United States. In times like these our producers need every available marketing option open to them. We cannot afford lost market share. 
   Trade sanctions are immoral. Innocent people are denied commodities while our farmers and ranchers are denied the sale to that particular country. It is my sincere hope that my colleagues will see fit to open up more markets by supporting Senator ASHCROFT. 
   Farmers and ranchers must be provided a fighting chance in the world market, and the people of sanctioned countries must be allowed access to agricultural commodities. 
   Again, I thank the fine chairman Mr. COCHRAN, and his staff, for all their work on this bill. I will continue to fight for Montana farmers and ranchers and provide a voice for agriculture.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the efforts of a group of farmers in eastern Montana who pulled together following a tragic accident to help the Family of Bill Wolff harvest their crops. 
   Sadly, the Wolff family suffered a terrible loss on September 10, when a farming accident claimed Bill's life. In the midst of this tragedy, Bill's neighbor's gathered in an impressive effort to help the Wolff family harvest their grain. 
   In all more than 20 trucks and 12 combines arrived in Glendive to assist in the harvest. Working simultaneously, the combines were able to cut 135 acres per hour and bring in the harvest for the Wolff family. 
   Jim Wolff, one of Bill's nephews said, ``After experiencing the great teamwork here today, it's going to be difficult to go home and finish my own harvest by myself.'' In addition, many neighbors mirrored Jim's sentiment and expressed a sense of privilege that they were able to join with the Wolff family during their time of need. 
   Montanans are truly a special breed of people--always quick to lend a hand to others. It says so much that these people took time away from their own extremely hectic harvest schedules to help the Wolffs, and I commend them for it. Their selflessness serves as an example of us all. 
   I also extend my most sincere sympathies to the Wolf family. As evidenced by the outpouring of support from his neighbors. Bill was a man who was loved by a great many people and his loss will be shared by them also.

   Mr. BURNS. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Chair. 
   I listened to the exchange. It is very interesting. Why we are in this debate was not initiated by this side of the aisle. This whole process was not initiated by this side of the aisle. It was a reaction that was initiated by our friends on the other side. That is irrelevant right now. What is relevant is our Nation's security and the merits of this treaty and how it affects us and our national security. We have but one deterrent for the safety of the people who live in this country, and that is our reliable nuclear capability. Once it is questioned, then our ability to deter in this world of uncertainty would be damaged. 
   I rise to record my opposition to Senate passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty. This treaty bans all nuclear testing forever. Thus, it is a ban on ``bang'' for all time; it is not a ban on bombs. No one ought to be under the illusion that this treaty ends nuclear weapons development by America's foes. At home, an essential part of the administration's plan to implement the treaty is a ``safeguards package''. The mere existence of the safeguards package speaks for itself: without them, the treaty poses too many risks. Unfortunately, the treaty we are asked to vote upon contains none of the safeguards because the terms of the treaty expressly preclude making the safeguards package part of the treaty. In other words, the treaty prohibits meaningful reservations. Consequently, we are asked to bet on the come that the administration can deliver all that is promises in the safeguards package, not only in the next few years but far into the future. We are told that the Joint Chiefs of Staff support the treaty with the safeguards and is unable to comment on the merits of the treaty without the safeguards. I fully understand the Chain of Command. Our leaders also understand the Chain of Command. We do not have to read too much between the lines to conclude that without the safeguards package, this treaty poses unacceptable risks to our national security. 
   A total ban on all nuclear testing for all time has never been supported by prior Presidents-and for sound reasons. This administration's best sales pitch for a total ban on bangs for all time is that it is an important step in the direction of doing away with the threat of nuclear war. This is a nice dream and a great idea for another planet. But on earth it is a downright dangerous false hope. The complete ban treaty has a fatal flaw in the real world: the treaty is unenforceable. In one sentence, the fatal flaw is that violations cannot be verified. 
   The best intentions humans can conceive are of no use if the treaty is not implemented not only by us but also by the other nuclear players. And what is the score? Well Russia and China have not ratified this treaty and they are unlikely to do so. Even if they did, either one could veto any attempts at enforcement by the U.N. Security Council. North Korea did not even participate in the negotiations about the treaty. India and Pakistan have not signed on to the treaty. The score on rogue nations such as Iraq and Libya varies but we have to ask whether they could be trusted to keep their commitments anyway. The administration has, once again, gone off and negotiated a deal that is not acceptable to the Senate. I suppose the White House media spin will again be that the United States will suffer a loss of world leadership if the Senate does not buy this pig in a pike treaty. Well maybe the negotiators should have thought of that before they put American's credibility on the line. The spinmeisters should re-read our Constitution. Treaties must be acceptable to two thirds of the Senators. That requirement has been there since the founding of the Republic. The White House should not pretend to be shocked when the Senate turns down a treaty that it does not like because the treaty has no teeth. there are too many undefined characters in the world who are unaffected by this treaty. 
   This treaty is not a good idea for a number of other reasons. The agreement puts international handcuffs on nuclear technology testing by the United States. Our country needs to have access to the testing of current and possible future nuclear weapons,  defensive as well as offensive. We know that some nations play fast and loose with nuclear weapons technology. This is not the case generally in the United States and is not the case specifically in Montana where we maintain many Minutemen III missiles. Part of the Safeguard Stewardship and Management Program proposed by the Administration to sell this treaty is to assure us that the nuclear stockpile remains safe and reliable. But tests needed to create the data base and methodologies for stockpile stewardship have not been done during the seven year moratoria our nation has voluntarily followed on testing and would not be done under the mandatory terms of the treaty before us. Simply stated, the technology for stockpile stewardship is unproven. Key safety and reliability data can only be obtained from the actual testing of weapons. We cannot take a chance on when or whether our nuclear weapons will go off. Can you imagine putting all your faith in an airplane flying right without making actual flight tests.? The pilots I know still think an aircraft has to be flown before they are convinced of its safety and reliability. Likewise, data from past tests cannot adequately predict the impacts of ongoing problems such as aging taking into account the highly corrosive nature of materials with a shelf life of 20 years. What do we do in 25 years? The administration's answer is to rely upon computer simulations or, as a last resort, to withdraw from the treaty. The stakes are too high to depend upon theoretical models and any treaty can be killed by a later law. But I submit these actions are closing the barn door after the horses are gone. Montanans as well as all Americans must have confidence in the safety and reliability of the refurbished nuclear warheads remaining in our country. Our troops in the field must also have confidence in the nuclear weapons they carry. This test ban treaty precludes us from undertaking the technology testing that is essential for keeping confidence in our nuclear deterrent capability. 
   The cold war may be over but the threat posed to the United States from nuclear weapons in hostile hands is far from over. Russia refuses to ratify Start II and continues to insist (along with the administration) on strict compliance with the 1972 ABM Treaty. If ever there was a lesson about not freezing nuclear technology in time, the ABM Treaty is the model. Most Americans still do not know that our country is absolutely defenseless against ballistic missile attack not only from Russia but also from any where else. There is mounting evidence that China has stolen priceless nuclear secrets from our national laboratories. Only a complete fool would think that the actions of the Chinese indicate that they would curtail their rapid advancement towards being a nuclear power, with or without this test ban treaty. Neither India nor Pakistan have signed on to this treaty and I suppose the administration will try to blame that on the Senate somehow. I submit, however, that the positions of Pakistan and India on their nuclear status have nothing whatsoever to do with this debate in the Senate. We are aware that there are half dozen rogue nations out there. They must really lick their lips when they think about America not testing nuclear weapons anymore. Who seriously thinks this treaty will slow down despots who pose current and future irresponsible and, perhaps, irrational nuclear threats to the United States? The administration is making a serious error in judgment in mixing up what States say at diplomatic conferences with what they go back home. This is not the time to handicap ourselves by assuming test ban obligations that we would keep but others would either violate or ignore. 
   I have been called by many representatives of other states and heads of states. I asked one question: Will the signing of this test ban treaty change the attitude of the Russians? Answer: No. By the PRC, the Chinese? No. Will it change the attitude in India or Pakistan or North Korea or other suspected rogue entities? No. Then why do we put ourselves in jeopardy by not testing? 
   In conclusion, I believe this treaty is fatally flawed because it is not enforceable and will be ignored by the very nations we distrust. Moreover, to retain a credible nuclear deterrent capability, we must retain our ability to test our weapon systems for safety and reliability. Therefore, this treaty hurts us while helping our potential enemies. My vote is to oppose advice and consent. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman COCHRAN and his staff for putting together a bill that encompasses the needs of agriculture. I also thank Chairman STEVENS for his cooperation during the agricultural appropriations process. I am pleased with the funding that went to my home State of Montana as well as to important national programs for agriculture. 
   During this economic crisis in agriculture, immediate funding needs of farmers and ranchers must be addressed. I believe this bill does that. The $8.7 billion package contains important funding for Agricultural Marketing Transition Act, AMTA payments for wheat and barley producers in Montana, as well as $322 million for livestock producers and $650 million in crop insurance. 
   Additionally, I am thrilled that price reporting was included in the final bill at my request. I have been trying to secure price reporting for our livestock producers for quite some time now. This legislation will provide producers with the information they need to make prudent marketing decisions, and take the control out of the hands of the meat packers. 
   Four major packers control 79% of the meat-packing industry. It is necessary to have this price reporting information accessible to producers so that they may take advantage of the best possible market opportunities available. Additionally, they must have the assurance that they are receiving accurate data. 
   The majority of livestock producers in Montana sell their feeder calves to feeder markets, which are highly concentrated. Increased concentration within the agricultural industry provides them fewer and fewer options open for marketing. Price reporting will increase market transparency and present producers an accurate view of the market. 
   The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Sheep Industry, and the National Pork Producers Council worked extensively with State producer organizations and the packers to craft a bill that will work for everyone and directly benefit producers. The end result of this work is the legislation included in agricultural appropriations as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture on July 29, 1999. I join all of these interested parties in directing the Department of Agriculture and the administration generally to this document for use in the correct interpretation and administration of this important law. 
   I am disappointed that policy issues such as dairy and food-related sanctions were eventually stripped from this bill. I believe these concerns must be addressed as soon as possible. I will support Option 1-A legislation in H.R. 1402, in order to ensure my dairy farmers are taken care of. Additionally, I will support Senator ASHCROFT in his efforts to exempt food and medicine from sanctioned countries. American farmers and ranchers stand much to lose by not having all viable markets open to them. 
   Again, I thank the fine chairman, Mr. COCHRAN, for all his good work on this bill. I will continue to work for Montana farmers and ranchers to make sure they make not only a decent living but one that is profitable and fulfilling. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support an amendment that I feel to be extremely important to the small business owners of Montana. That amendment is the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific Evidence Act, the SENSE Act. This amendment makes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, to do the sensible thing--wait for a scientific report before OSHA can impose any new ergonomics regulations on small business. 
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, the overall injury and illness rate is currently at its lowest level. Date shows that musculoskeletal disorders have declined by 17 percent over the past 3 years. But OSHA continues to aggressively move forward with an ergonomics regulation and ignoring the intent of Congress. 
   I have been hearing from small business owners of across the State of Montana. Businesses that range from construction companies to florists that fall under OSHA's mandated ergo-nomics regulations are telling me something has to be done. They are being forced to comply with ridiculous rules and regulations that OSHA cannot prove to be harmful to employees. 
   Before OSHA can move forward with any new regulations a few things need to be proven. First, OSHA needs to objectively define the medical conditions that should be addressed, not a broad category of all soft tissue and bone pains and injuries that might have resulted. Second, they need to identify the particular exposures in magnitude and nature which cause the defined medical conditions. Last they need to prescribe the changes necessary to prevent their recurrence. Right now OSHA cannot prove any of these things. 
   We need to make sure that OSHA is not running free and loose. They cannot have free rein to enact new rules and regulations without having significant scientific evidence to back up their new mandate. This amendment, to put it simply, will delay moving forward with any ergonomics rule or guideline until completion of an independent study of the medical and scientific evidence linking on-the-job activities and repetitive stress injuries. 
   This is a very complicated issue, and we need to make sure that there is sound science and through medical evidence to protect our small business and employees from misguided rules and regulations. The SENSE Act does not prohibit OSHA from continuing to research ergonomics or from exercising its enforcement authority, it just puts the small business owner on a level playing field. I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David ``Moose'' Miller, husband, father, friend, community leader, sports enthusiast, and owner of the nationally known watering hole, Moose's Saloon, who lost his life to cancer recently. Moose had battled cancer for the last year and convinced himself and others that he would beat it. Today, in Kalispell, Montana, family and friends are remembering Moose Miller and I would like to take a moment to make a special acknowledgement to such a great man. 
   Moose played football for the University of Montana, served his country in the U.S. Army, and with his wife, converted the Corral Bar to the famous Moose's Saloon. Swinging doors, sawdust on the floor, initials carved into the heavy tables, the best pizza around, and the rustic atmosphere attracted people from all walks of life and all ages. Whether you're from Kalispell, Montana, Peoira, Illinois, or Washington, D.C., you likely know someone who knows of Moose's Saloon and Moose Miller. 
   I had the privilege of knowing Moose. Moose not only owned and ran a successful business in the Flathead Valley, he gave back to the community in many ways. The Kalispell Chamber of Commerce honored him as its Great Chief in 1986, recognizing his years of community service. He and his ``elves'' made Christmas special for many people, especially the handicapped, each year for several years, he donated proceeds from the kitchen to support the March of Dimes, was an active supporter of the University of Montana and helped administer the Flathead Youth Foundation. 
   Moose is leaving behind a wife, Shirley; his children; Bruce, Wallis, Royce, Lexie, Lee and Aimee; his grandchildren, Zach, Anne, Lexie, Leah, Alicia, Hannah, and Zane; and his sister, Marcie. 
   I know that Moose will be missed by his family and friends, as well as the entire community. May God bless them all and may his memory live on.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will comment on an amendment we introduced last night and ask for the support of my colleagues. Before I do that, I want to recognize the chairman of the full committee, the Commerce Committee, and my colleagues on the subcommittee. There are many important provisions in this bill. Most importantly, I think it reauthorizes the funding mechanism for airport construction which has been going on around the country. I hardly find a place where there are not improvements being done to the infrastructure for air traffic. 
   The legislation allows a limited number of exemptions to the current perimeter rule at the Ronald Reagan National Airport. Creating these exemptions takes a step in the right direction to provide balance between Americans within the perimeter and outside the perimeter. The current perimeter rule is outdated and restrictive to creating competition. 
   We have the best and the most efficient modes of transportation in the entire world. No other country can make such a boast. With the exception, of course, of rail transportation and passengers, we have very competitive alternatives. Now is the time to further enhance our competitive aviation and rail alternatives, although some who live at the end of the lines sometimes question if we have competition in the right places. 
   These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule will improve service to the nation's capital for dozens of western cities beyond the perimeter--while at the same time ensuring that cities inside the perimeter are not adversely impacted by new service. This is a fair balance which is consistent with the overall intent of the bill to improve air service to small and medium-sized cities. 
   As a result, I believe our committee has crafted a limited compromise which protects the local community from uncontrolled growth, ensures that service inside the perimeter will not be affected and creates a process which will improve access to Ronald Reagan National Airport for small and medium-sized communities outside the current perimeter. Montana's communities will benefit from these limited exemptions through improved access to the nation's capitol. 
   Throughout this bill, our goal has been to improve air service for communities which have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to the extent of larger markets. The provision related to improved access to Reagan National is no different. 
   Today, passengers from many communities in Montana are forced to double or even triple connect to fly to Washington National. My goal is to ensure that not just large city point-to-point service will benefit, but that passengers from all points west of the perimeter will have better options to reach Washington and Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
   This provision is about using this restricted exemption process to spread  improved access throughout the West--not to limit the benefits to a few large cities which already have a variety of options. 
   Let me be clear, if the Secretary receives more applications for more slots than the bill allows, DOT must prioritize the applications based on quantifying the domestic network benefits. Therefore, DOT must consider and award these limited opportunities to western hubs which connect the largest number of cities to the national transportation network. 
   I request the support of my colleagues on a very important amendment I along with my colleague from Missouri have introduced to this bill. That amendment was added last night. This amendment will establish a commission to study the future of the travel agent industry and determine the consumer impact of airline interaction with travel agents. 
   Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was enacted, major airlines have controlled pricing and distribution policies of our nation's domestic air transportation system. Over the past four years, the airlines have reduced airline commissions to travel agents in a competitive effort to reduce costs. 
   I am concerned the impact of today's business interaction between airlines and travel agents may be a driving force that will force many travel agents out of business. Combined with the competitive emergence of Internet services, these practices may be harming an industry that employs over 250,000 people in this country. 
   This amendment will explore these concerns through the establishment of a commission to objectively review the emerging trends in the airline ticket distribution system. Among airline consumers there is a growing concern that airlines may be using their market power to limit how airline tickets are distributed and sold. 
   Mr. President, if we lose our travel agents, we lose a competitive component to affordable air fare. Travel agents provide a much needed service and without them, the consumer is the loser. 
   The current use of independent travel agencies as the predominate method to distribute tickets ensures an efficient and unbiased source of information for air travel. Before deregulation, travel agents handled only about 40 percent of the airline ticket distribution system. Since deregulation, the complexity of the ticket pricing system created the need for travel agents resulting in travel agents handling nearly 90 percent of transactions. 
   Therefore, the travel agent system has proven to be a key factor to the success of airline deregulation. I'm afraid, however, that the demise of the independent travel agent would be a factor of deregulation's failure if the major airlines succeed in dominating the ticket distribution system. 
   Tavel agents and other independent distributors comprise a considerable portion of the small business sector in the United States. There are 33,000 travel agencies employing over 250,000 people. Women or minorities own over 50 percent of travel agencies. 
   Since 1995, commissions have been reduced by 30%, 14% for domestic travel alone in 1998. since 1995, travel agent commissions have been reduced from an average of 10.8 to 6.9 percent in 1998. Travel agencies are failing in record numbers. 
   I think it is important we study the issue, get an unbiased commission together, and give a report to Congress. We will see how important the role played by the ticket agents and the travel agencies is in contributing to the competitive nature of travel in this country. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment. We are dealing with a subject that needs to be dealt with; this bill needs to be passed. We are in support of it. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I would like to ask my colleagues to support this important amendment.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in my 11 years in the U.S. Senate I have rarely seen such an opportunity to fight against big Government and defend local decisionmakers like parents and teachers. 
   The Democrats are signaling their intent to hamstring local schools by commanding them to focus their efforts on issues which are deemed important inside the Capital Beltway, not within their homes and communities. I feel Montanans know what is best for Montana; we don't need Washington to tell us how to teach our children. 
   Congress should reject a one-size-fits-all approach to education and local schools should have the freedom to prioritize their spending and tailor their curriculum according to the unique educational needs of their children. 
   For too long, Washington has been part of the problem with education, enacting many well-intentioned programs that result in more redtape and regulation. Though Washington accounts for only seven percent of education funding, it accounts for 50 percent of the paperwork for our teachers and principles. It is time for Washington to lend a helping hand to our states. 
   Unfortunately, right now many of our Federal education programs are overloaded with so many rules and regulations that states and local schools waste precious time and resources to stay in compliance with the Federal programs. It is obvious that states and local school districts need relief from the administrative bourdons that many federally designated education programs put on States, schools, and educational administrators.  
   I feel strongly and deeply that Montanans need to be in control of Montana's classrooms. I can not vote for anything that does not have local school control. I will continue to resist the attempts to take away your control of your child's schools. 
   Our goal on the Federal level is to help States and local school districts provide the best possible first-class education for our children that they can. We need to get the bureaucratic excess out of the face of the local educators so that they can do their jobs more efficiently and effectively. 
   Mr. President, we need to fix the problem of Federal controls in education. We need to allow the decisionmaking to be made by the people that we trust to educate our children. That is what really counts.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Lilly Endowment for their exceptional contributions on behalf of educational opportunities for minorities. In particular, I would like to commend them on their recent announcement awarding $30 million to the American Indian College Fund. These dollars would be used to replace buildings at 30 tribal colleges on reservations in the West and Midwest. 
   It is important that we continue to support ways to maintain educational opportunities for tribal colleges, who receive a significantly lower level of funding per student than mainstream community colleges. Because of these scarce resources, and the need to maintain and increase academic standards, capital improvements have been forced to the bottom of the priority list. 
   This private donation from the Lilly Endowment is the largest ever made to a Native American organization. These funds will be used to pay for much needed construction of modern classrooms, labs and libraries. This extraordinary contribution will allow these colleges to give their students the best educational opportunities possible. 
   It is critical that Tribal colleges have the resources to provide a combination of traditional academics and Native American culture for their students. American Indian students who attend tribal schools are far more likely to succeed at four year institutions. More Native Americans have been attending college, but still at a far lower rate than members of other minority groups. We need to ensure that they are helped to reach their full potential. 
   As a Senator for a state with 7 tribal colleges, I understand the important role they play in the Tribes' hopes for future generations. Academic success is key to raising the standard of living and quality of life for all tribal members. 
   Mr. President, I feel we need to do everything in our power until we are successful in addressing the many challenges facing the education needs of our American Indian population. I salute Lilly Endowment's increasingly generous efforts towards this goal. 
   During my time in the Senate I have fought, and will continue to work to help make education accessible and affordable to all Montanans. Tribal colleges are a priority to me. I will continue to look for ways to increase federal spending at these institutions.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of legislation that helps a large number of family farms on the border of Montana and North Dakota. The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Projects Title Transfer moves ownership of these irrigation projects from federal control to local control. Both the Bureau of Reclamation and those relying on the projects for their livelihood agree that there is little value in having the federal government retain ownership. 
   The history of these projects dates to the early 1900's with the original Lower Yellowstone project being built by the Bureau of Reclamation between 1906 and 1910. Later, the Savage Unit was added in 1947-48. The end result was the creation of fertile, irrigated land to help spur economic development in the area. To this day, agriculture is the number one industry in the area. 
   The local impact of the projects is measurable in numbers, but the greatest impacts can only be seen by visiting the area. About 500 family farms rely on these projects for economic substance, and the entire area relies on them to create stability in the local economy. In an area that has seen booms and busts in oil, gas, and other commodities, these irrigated lands continued producing and offering a foundation for the businesses in the area. 
   As we all know, agriculture prices are extremely low right now, but these irrigated lands offer a reasonable return over time and are the foundation for strong communities based upon the ideals that have made this country successful. The 500 families impacted are hard working, honest producers, and I can think of no better people to manage their own irrigation projects. 
   Everyday, we see an example of where the federal government is taking on a new task. We can debate the merits of those efforts on an individual  basis, but I think we can all agree that while the government gets involved in new projects there are many that we can safely pass on to state or local control. The Lower Yellowstone Projects are a prime example of such an opportunity, and I ask my colleagues to join me in seeing this legislation passed as quickly as possible.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas. I also want to say it might not pass the smell test; it doesn't even pass the giggle test. 
   I want to drop back a little bit, away from the rhetoric we have heard, and look at it from a practical point of view. We have heard a lot about big oil ripoff. What are folks in California paying for gasoline today? Do you think the oil companies are going to pay that? No, they are not going to pay it. The consumer is going to pay it. The people who buy the gasoline and the petroleum products are going to pay it. Big oil, little oil, or whatever is not going to pay that. Do you think they will eat this and swallow it? Get a life. 
   One of these days, we are going to be hit by a big bolt of common sense around here and we will not be able to handle it. 
   Let's step back and think. I know the Senator from California is concerned about schools and children. I want her to come to Musselshell, MT. The first oil was discovered in Montana in that county--very active. A lot of it is on public lands. Then we kept getting tougher and tougher, and pretty soon the oil industry left the county. We are closing schools because there are no kids to attend. Nobody is making a paycheck. 
   Let's take a look and see what happens. Yes, the Government holds those lands in trust. They are public lands. Does the Government invest one penny in the drilling or the exploration of that resource? It does not. Does it buy any of the licenses? Does it offer any of the equipment? Does it pay any of the people to drill and to take the chance there may be oil here and there may not be? If there isn't, does the Government pay for the loss? Not a penny. 
   A deal was struck. If we find oil there, the companies say: We will give the Government one-eighth ownership in that well. That means one out of every eight buckets that comes out of the ground in crude belongs to the Government, and it sells it wherever it wants to sell. If they don't like the price they are getting from the refinery, I suggest they can take a truck out there next to the well, and every eighth bucket that comes up, put that eighth bucket in their truck, and they can take it anywhere and sell it anywhere they want, and they will get market for it. There are a lot of buyers for it. 
   That was the deal. That is getting your product or your royalty at the wellhead, as called for by law. 
   Now we have some folks who say: That is not good enough; we want the retail price. In other words, we don't want to pay any of the transportation, we don't want to pay any of the refining, we don't want to pay all of the costs, but we want the end result. 
   That is not the deal. This other is put together by law. That law is being changed by an unelected representative who wouldn't be known to my constituency if he or she walked out today. 
   Who gets hurt by this change? It is not big oil. They don't get hurt because they will pass the cost on to the consumer.  
   Again, I want to know what they are paying per gallon of gasoline in California. It is pretty high out in my State, too. 
   Do you know who gets hurt? It is the little guy. It slows down their ability for capital formation, for exploration, and then when they find it, they are taxed more for it. They want to rewrite the law. 
   An independent producer will have to pay a higher tax. I want that in all capital letters--T-A-X. That is what royalty essentially is. Then they will still have to compete with the low price of foreign oil. 
   America, if you think you are secure tonight, 55 percent of our oil comes now from offshore. More and more public lands are being cut off from exploration due to some whacky laws and some people who do not understand the business. They do it in the name of the environment. Use common sense. Those folks who want to shut off the oil supply in this country don't know what lines are and don't know what an economy can't do if we have no oil. 
   A while ago they talked about ethanol. I support the ethanol situation. It is renewable. It is clean. We still have some problems when temperatures get extremely low, as they do in Montana, but nonetheless it is an alternative. I support the tax credits for ethanol. 
   A tax is essentially what a royalty is. The end result is that the little man can't do it; he simply cannot make a living. When times are looking better for domestic oil, the Federal Government comes rushing in and raises the cost of production. 
   I can remember when Billings, MT, was pretty active with independent oil people, from land leasers to exploration to drillers. Those folks are just about all gone, because they have driven all of the little people away. They have closed off the lands that might have, and do have, great prospects for oil and gas reserves. 
   Oil prices are not that strong. Have they stabilized? No, I don't think so. In fact, I will tell you now, no commodity is making money in this country. I don't care if you are talking about oil or products that come from mining or timber or farms; it does not make any difference. The spread between what we get at the production level and what is happening at the retail level is unbelievable. 
   I will give you an example. If you want to go buy some Wheaties in your grocery store, it will cost you $3.75 to $4 a pound for Wheaties. Think about it. We cannot get $2.25 for a 60-pound bushel of wheat. Something is wrong. 
   The same thing happens here because everybody has to have a little bigger piece in the process from where you take it from Mother Earth, who gives us all new wealth. The only place new wealth is produced is from Mother Earth. That is true to the time it gets to the consumer. Everybody has to have a bigger piece. Now the Federal Government comes along and says: I think we need a little more, too, because we need to collect some more taxes. We need to build a bigger bureaucracy. That is not the way we do business. 
   Let's look at the royalty increase and put it in perspective of the entire industry. Oil prices still are not strong. Domestic oil production is still down. The industry is still hurting. Jobs are still being threatened. But our paycheck does not come from the oil patch, so we do not get excited. Our check comes every 2 weeks, just like clockwork. We risk not much--a little time. That is about all. Then all at once we are insensitive to those people who really power our economy--tax them again. 
   I want to bring back to our attention what Senator HUTCHISON pointed out earlier. This cost will be passed on to the American consumers. You are kidding yourself if you do not believe it. Montanans rely on their private vehicles to get around. It is 148,000 square miles from Alzada, MT, to Eureka, MT. It is further than from here to Chicago, IL. We know what spaces are and we also know what it costs to drive them. 
   We also have reserves in oil and gas, and if you keep raising these costs, the opportunity to get those reserves becomes more diminished every day. So while the Senator from California contends she is saving all this royalty money for the taxpayer, the person who actually knows the system tells us they will get less revenues during the period of chaos that will ensue as they try to sort out the flawed MMS proposal. Our income to the Treasury will go down; it will not be more.

   Mr. BURNS. Reading a portion:  
   The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the proposed MMS rules may be a disincentive for the industry ..... 
   The moratorium will provide additional time for all interested parties to develop a fair, workable and efficient plan to collect federal royalties.  
   In the meantime, royalties are lost. So let's get struck by a bolt of common sense. Let's quit being moon-eyed horses and jumping at shadows and the paper bag that blows out from the fence row. This is bad policy and we should not allow this to happen. I do not think the Senate should. I congratulate my friend from Texas for being the champion on this. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, reducing space transportation costs to enable more scientific research has been a priority of NASA and this committee. I am aware of several innovative programs developed by NASA and other agencies that attempt to dramatically reduce the cost of space access for missions through transporting individual science instruments within commercial spacecraft. However, I understand NASA is having some difficulty in implementing such ``secondary payload programs'' because of a lack of a definition of ``government payload'' in the National Space Transportation Policy. Therefore, I would like the committee to clarify that individual scientific instruments with full or partial government funding riding inside a commercial satellite are not ``government payloads'' for purposes of the Space Transportation Policy. Would the chairman agree with me that this is something we should address in the conference report?

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to bring before the Senate my observations of a hearing that we held in Montana last Friday. It had to do with a pilot shortage in this country, something we have heard very little about but which some of us are quite concerned about. 
   The hearing examined the impending problem. After the hearing was over, I will say it is moving from impending to maybe an acute pilot shortage, with the factors that contribute to that possibility. I think the results of that hearing are very serious. I think it is certainly serious to the citizens of Montana and rural States on routes not heavily traveled. 
   Now, because the national economy has done fairly well, we have seen a tremendous expansion in airlines, the major airlines--the ``transcons,'' we call them. When business is good, they expand. Of course, expansion means hiring more pilots at almost record numbers, it seems. That creates a problem because pilots who start to work for the majors usually are drawn from the pool of pilots who fly for the local service or regional airlines. 
   Now, what happens when these pilots are taken up? Regional and local service carriers get caught with fewer pilots, and that means, more times than not, canceled flights. We always wonder why they cancel a flight. Sometimes it is because we are just short of pilots. If this continues, then it is routes such as we find in rural areas in Montana that suffer--some of those routes might even be abandoned. So it doesn't take a doctorate in economics to figure out that the flights and routes that are canceled in these situations are those that are the least profitable; and the sad part, the less profitable a particular route tends to be for an airline, the more important it tends to be for the people who live in that region. 
   As you know, Montana is a very large State. I was struck the other day that in a new route that had been put in, nonstop, from Missoula, MT, to Minneapolis, MN, the flying time is 2 hours 5 minutes, and the first hour is all spent in Montana. So we understand distances. If a regional airline is the only carrier serving a particular community and it cancels that route, what are the residents of that community supposed to do then? Air service is an essential lifeline to many individuals and communities. In fact, we have communities that are essential air service communities that have no buses and they have no rails. There is no public transportation, other than the local service airline. So our participation in the EAS, the essential air service program, has been a solution to that issue in the case of smaller, isolated communities, but it is jeopardized by operators who want to operate the routes but we have a shortage of pilots. 
   Now, we talk about this business of the major airlines, and services, and the rights of passengers. Let's take a look at some of the basic problems. Maybe some of those problems are because of us. Who knows? 
   Historically, the military has always supplied many pilots to the industry. But a large number of pilots who were trained by the military during the Vietnam era are getting to the point where they have to retire because of Federal regulations. 
   Since the 1950s, airline pilots have had to retire when they reached the  age of 60. I will tell you that some pilots aren't ready to retire at the age of 60. In fact, some pilots shouldn't be retired at 60. They are still able, physically fit, and mentally fit to fly airplanes past that age of 60. The age of 60 does not affect everyone the same way. In fact, I was thinking the other day that 65 doesn't sound nearly as old as it used to. But some pilots are fit enough to keep on flying. 
   I understand there is great opposition to changing that rule until I look around the world and see what is happening when we have pilots flying major airlines in American airspace that have no age limit at all. Eight countries that fly into and connect into the United States have no age limit at all. In other words, if that pilot is 65, and fit mentally and physically, he still is a captain of that airplane. I think we have to take a look at that. 
   Also, I find it disturbing that the Federal Government can apply a blanket regulation, such as the age of 60 rule, determining that a pilot exceeding that age is considered a hazard. I cannot accept that at all. 
   There is also some question about flight and duty time rules that could worsen the pilot shortage and impact air service to those rural areas. I want the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Transportation and the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Commerce Committee to be aware that I think this issue needs a hearing in Washington at the full committee level to make them aware that we may be overlooking some things at the route level that could help us in providing more air service to this country. 
   We all say our skies are full. Do you realize that commercial air service--basically 85 percent of the air service in this country--takes up only 5 percent of the airspace because of an old, outdated system that we have for vectoring and ITC across this country? 
   I think maybe we should look at that. I appreciate the time given me by the chairman and the ranking member this morning. 
   But that is the result of the hearing we had in Kalispell, MT. I think Senators should take a look at this and offer some comments. But I think we should have a hearing on this particular problem in Washington at the full committee level. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to address a matter important to my State's participation in the upcoming Lewis and Clark Bicentennial celebration. As you and other history buffs may know, the Corps of Discovery led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark spent much of their travels in what is now my State of Montana. This celebration will have an enormous impact on the State's economy and infrastructure. We have a number of sites on the Missouri River that have retained historic ferry transportation. Currently, in the Fiscal Year 2000 Transportation Appropriations bill, the committee has included $2 million for the upgrade of the McClelland Ferry. A more fiscally responsible use of these funds would be to spread this funding level out over three ferry sites on the historic Missouri River. Those sites are the McClelland, Virgelle, and Carter Ferry sites. I would like to also indicate that is important to recognize that these upgrades should maintain all of the historic features of the traditional ferry site. It is not my intention to replace these historic ferries with bridge work or new ferries.

   Mr. BURNS. I would like to engage my colleague from Alabama on a number of issues relating to the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Transportation Appropriations bill. Montana's roads and airports are inadequately funded. I would like to focus on a couple of projects that must be addressed in the state immediately or we will be facing serious economic loss as a result. The first is the Big Mountain Road. This is a forest service access road, private property access road and also provides access to Big Mountain Ski area. During the winter when conditions are worst, this steep road is traversed frequently and while the road is covered with snow and ice. Montana winter conditions are not friendly to our paved roads. I would like to express my support of funding for this road. In 1996, the state estimated reconstruction costs to be around $6.5 million. The road is presently one of the busiest roads in the state awaiting reconstruction. Mr. Chairman, this is no small matter--every year Montanans are either killed or injured in accidents on this dangerous road. The freeze thaw conditions we face make this road an important project in our state.

   Mr. BURNS. I would also like to address another important matter in our state. The Great Falls Airport is the home to a Federal Express regional hub. Fed Ex employs numerous employees in the Great Falls area. Our problem originated when the FAA mandated the airport find another option for Fed Ex's operations. That mandate has required the airport to begin immediate construction of an apron to accommodate Fed Ex's Great Falls operations. I met with Jane Garvey on this issue and was appreciative of the interest she has taken. Although she and her staff have indicated their support of this project, the FAA is unable to provide funding considering the Airport Improvement Program has lapsed. Mr. Chairman, dirt has been turned on this project and we cannot afford to turn back at this time. Further delays will mean loss of revenue, possible job loss and increased funding requirements. Construction season in Montana is short and we must take action on this project immediately. I would like to request your assistance obtaining the $4.5 million required to solve this problem. We will need to address this problem immediately during this year and soon after the beginning of the 2000 Fiscal Year. Thank you Mr. Chairman.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to withdraw my name as a co-sponsor of Senate bill S. 1172, the Drug Patent Term Restoration Review Procedures Act of 1999. After much research and thought I have decided to do this for the senior citizens of Montana. 
   When I signed on this bill I believed that it was the right thing to do. Helping companies that have invested millions of dollars in research and development, only to see their property protections eroded by administrative delays, concerned me and I felt it was a good bill to help sponsor. 
   After many meetings, lots of research and careful thought I have now come to a different conclusion. I now believe that there is already an established patent extension process to compensate brand companies for regulatory delays. I feel that by allowing brand companies to seek additional  patent life for so-called ``pipeline drugs,'' this bill will deprive consumers, and especially the elderly with their limited incomes, the opportunity to purchase the more affordable generic drug equivalent. Generic drugs are often priced 25-60% below the brand name product. 
   Mr. President, I feel that this is a good bill, but if I continue to support S. 3372 I would be blocking patient access to generic medicines for three more years, forcing millions of Americans to pay inflated prices for these drugs. I cannot do this to the senior citizens in my great state. They are having a tough time getting by as is. Higher drug prices just add to their problems.

   Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Oregon. I will be very brief. 
   In the Commerce Committee, we struck a deal with the airlines. Today they are going to the FAA with their plan. What we have seen to this point is an outline of what they plan to do. What they plan to give to the FAA, with the FAA exceptions, we should agree to and keep the word of the Commerce Committee that that is the way we are going to do business. 
   I think we are trying to micromanage. I expect I am the only one who should be concerned about seat width. I fly just as much as anyone else. In fact, to go round trip between here and Montana, we probably have more seat time than we really want. 
   The chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation on the Commerce Committee had a very successful hearing in Kalispell, MT. We ought to look at the root of some of the problems, and that is pilot shortage. We had an outstanding hearing on how it affects rural States such as my State of Montana. 
   I shall oppose these two amendments. I thank my good friend from Oregon. He has been more than gracious with his time.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the pending resolution that will give the Department of Transportation the green light to raise CAFE standards. According to the proponents of the resolution, the amendment just lets DOT ``study'' the issue. I am concerned that is not accurate. The DOT has already recommended up to a 35 percent increase in light truck standards. 
   The CAFE program has been in place for 25 years. We know this program doesn't work. We know this program has not reduced America's dependence on foreign oil. In fact, America's dependence on foreign oil has increased from 35 to 50 percent. 
   Pollution controls on today's automobiles have driven down pollution levels in this nation. It's the older automobiles that have been targeted--it's the folks who cannot afford to buy a new $30,000 fuel efficient car. Believe it or not Mr. President, but a 1982 Chevy pickup is a very popular vehicle on Montana's highways. We can't expect to make new cars affordable if we make them more expensive by driving up the cost of these new cars through increased government regulation. 
   Fuel economies in vehicles have been reduced as a result of manufacturer efforts. Since 1980, light trucks fleet fuel economy has increased by nearly 2.5 miles per gallon. Passenger car fleet fuel economy has increased by nearly 4.5 miles per gallon. 
   In my state of Montana, we are very highway dependent. Our roadways are our only means of transportation. We cannot efficiently rely on transit modes of transportation. Montana is also dependent on vehicles that have adequate clearance and power for roads that are not up to the standard of a paved highway. We have farmers, ranchers, outdoorsmen and sportsmen that use these roads often. 
   CAFE standards have failed to achieve their goals. Despite these standards, oil imports are up and Americans continue to drive more miles annually than they did in the 1970s. CAFE standards force automakers to produce many smaller, lighter vehicles to increase fuel economy. Studies have demonstrated an increase in highway injuries and deaths as a result. 
   We know it's not government regulation that drives fuel economy. Rather competition drives fuel economy. That is why I will not support this amendment.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today as one of the proud cosponsors of the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. 
   This bill offers much-needed changes in the area of risk management for farmers and ranchers. Managing risk in agriculture has become perhaps the most important aspect of the business. Agricultural producers who are able to effectively manage their risk are able to sustain and increase profit. An effective crop insurance program will provide farmers and ranchers possibilities for economic sustainability in the future and help them out of the current financial crisis. 
   The Federal Government can help facilitate a program to unite the producer and the private insurance company. The control must be put ultimately in the hands of the agricultural producer. Although he cannot control risk, an effective management plan will help him to manage the effects of risks, such as weather, prices and natural disasters. 
   This bill addresses the inadequacies of the current crop insurance program.  The problems and inconsistencies with the current program make it both unaffordable and confusing to agricultural producers. Costly premiums are the biggest problem. In years of depressed market prices, crop insurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for farmers. 
   This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide the highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of buy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the unaffordable premiums. It also allows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized. 
   Another important provision in this bill is to allow an additional subsidy for risk management activities. If a producer uses futures or options, utilizes cash forwards, attends a risk management class, uses Agricultural Trade Options or FFARRM accounts or reduces farm financial risk, they will receive a 5 percent write-down on their premium for taking part in two of the above risk management tools. 
   This bill also takes into account lack of production histories for beginning farmers or those who have added land or use crop rotation. This will make it possible for those producers to get a foot in the door and receive affordable crop insurance. 
   Many times, especially in Montana, multi-year disasters occur. This bill helps producers that take a blow several years in a row, which reduces their Annual Production History (APH). If a producer has suffered a natural disaster during at least 3 of the preceding 5 years and their APH was reduced by at least 25 percent they may exclude one year of APH for every five years experience. During this time, the producer's APH may increase without limit back up to the level before the multi-year disaster began. 
   Specialty crops such as canola or dry beans, are another important addition to this bill. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) will allocate at least 50 percent of their Research and Development funds to specialty crop development. Additionally, RMA is authorized to spend up to $20 million each fiscal year to create partnerships for developing and implementing specialty crop risk management options. 
   This bill will also ultimately put more control in the hands of active producers by including four active producers; as well as one in crop insurance, and one in reinsurance. The board would also include the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the Under Secretary for Rural Development and the Chief Economist of USDA. In addition, it mandates that the Board Chairperson be one of the non-governmental members. These are important steps to ensure that the new program is run for the producers by the producers. 
   This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance program into a risk management program, designed to help the producer in the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for farmers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to produce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable margin. 
   I look forward to working with Senators ROBERTS and KERREY on this important piece of legislation. I believe this bill will pave the way for massive crop insurance reform and help agricultural producers out of this economic crisis.

   Mr. BURNS. Madam President, this morning as I returned from Montana and I was listening to the local news, I heard a 30-second spot advising folks to call the White House to stand up, to stop this disappearance of the national forest lands. It was paid for by the Heritage Forest--some group. We have not been able to run it down yet. The message went on to say we have to stop this because our forests will be gone forever. 
   We can talk about semantics. We can talk about budgets. We can talk about where we apply the money. Let's face it; the $11 million for road maintenance that we increased is mostly being used for road obliteration. 
   It seems we fight these little fights every year because there are those who completely do not, and I say this in all disrespect, know one whit about what is a renewable resource and how we are to manage it. It seems to me this is the reason a person on his ranch or farm does not run that ranch or farm by a committee. If we did, we would not get a crop in; we would not grow anything, and we sure would not get a crop harvested. I would say the good Lord above does have a sense of humor. If you want to look at what a committee does, I always thought a horse was a camel put together by a committee. Everything is an afterthought. 
   Let's dispel some of this myth that seems to be going across our land. In the Flathead National Forest alone, we are growing 120 million board feet of lumber a year. The Forest Service, in their plans, only planned to harvest 19 million. Let me tell you, due to laws and roadblocks and lawsuits, we will be lucky to cut 6 million board feet. This does not include our wilderness areas or recreational areas. These are in managed forest areas. This is about a third of what historically has been responsibly forested and harvested. However, due to litigation and other roadblocks, only 6 million will be harvested. 
   We cannot survive with that scenario and neither can the forest. Understand that. Neither can the forest. It will burn. Trees are similar to any other renewable crop: they sprout, they grow, they get old, and like every one of us in this building, they will die. What happens to them? They hit the forest floor, there is a fuel buildup, there is infestation by the pine beetle, there is dry weather, there is lightning, and there is fire. I realize that doesn't mean much to those of us who sit in this 17-square miles of logic-free environment because we get our paycheck every 2 weeks. We are very comfortable. But out there, their paychecks stop right then. Their equipment is burned up. The cycle starts all over again. Is that an environmental benefit to this country? I don't think so. 
   We have seen what happened in 1988 in Yellowstone National Park, the crown jewel of all parks, we are told. Fire swept across that park; and you should have seen the water that ran from that park for the next 3 years because there was nothing to hold the soil that had been turned sterile by the heat of the fires. 
   So according to the misinformation thrown around by the self-proclaimed environmentalists, leaving the land to rot, they believe, is best for the environment; the forests are gone forever whenever they are harvested. I wonder if they think it was all a barren land up here until one Friday we got up and, lo and behold, there was a forest. Just like a bolt of lightning, it was there. When you get a haircut, is that head of hair gone forever? To some it might be. Who knows. But I don't think so. Currently, most of our national forests in Montana, and throughout the West, we face a 25-percent tree mortality in the next 15 years. We will lose 25 percent of our forests just to mortality, getting old and dying. 
   So I am saying land management, proper land management saves our forests. I can take you to one of the worst areas there is in the Forest Service--it happens to be up in northwest Montana--and even the foresters themselves will tell you that we are ashamed of the condition of this forest. But because of litigation, they are powerless to do anything about it. Fuel loads, beetle infestations, it is not a pretty sight. 
   It is not a pretty sight. 
   Healthy forests are usually the benefit of good management. Harvesting of timber is healthy, and it is all part of management. That is aside from the faces of the people who live in these forest communities. Two weeks ago, we shut down a mill in Darby, MT. We sold it at auction. Jobs are gone. A tax base is gone. The ability to build roads on private lands, to maintain services, and to build schools--all that revenue is gone. 
   The opponents of timber production would have you believe we still clearcut entire forests when we do not do that anymore. They would have you believe we have industrial lawn mowers big enough to mow down the great redwoods as we clear swaths from seed to seed, and we do not do that anymore. In fact, there are more trees in this country than during the time of Lewis and Clark. It is hard to believe, isn't it? But it is true. 
   When we put together this appropriation and this budget, there was balance. It brought balance of wildlife, balance of timber and new timber growth, balance of timber that we could harvest for the benefit of Americans, for those folks who build homes, and for those folks who work with timber. 
   If one looks across the Nation right now, not many commodities are making money--gas, oil, no farm commodities. If you look at all the litigation, timber is not making any money either. Anything that comes from mining is not making any money. Why should we do it? Where would those industries move? What other land on this globe will be devastated because we are not allowed to manage our renewable resources? 
   I can remember dirt under the fingernails and the ability to produce a crop every year was pretty honorable. Madam President, 1.5 million Americans provide all the food and fiber for the other 260 million. That is not bad. We do a pretty good job, and we do it under conditions that are getting more and more difficult all the time. 
   Modern forestry, of course, with some rules and regulations passed by Congress, is being regulated more and more every day. Environmental laws require foresters to take a look at the impact of what they are doing. It employs independent timber firms that know the land. They are harvesting. All of this costs money, and yet they will say below-cost-timber sales. If we lump all the rules and regulations, all the hoops we have to jump through for one timber sale on a forest, it probably could be called a below-cost-timber sale. Those are hoops we have to jump through. So we increased the budget. It costs more money to complete a timber sale. 
   We do not clearcut areas with disregard. We spend more time making sure everything we do is done in a responsible manner. Dispel the misinformation, get away from the inflammatory words of growing a commodity and harvesting a commodity. In Montana, the people who harvest timber are the same ones who come back to hunt and fish. They do it every weekend. They recreate all that same forest. 
   Contrary to the doomsayers, we want our land to be usable. We want healthy wildlife populations, we want clean water, and we want to make sure our native fish are healthy. 
   Let's talk about this wildlife habitat. Most of the wildlife habitat is found on public land in the summertime. When they have to make it through the winter, do you know where the deer, the elk, the moose winter? On private lands, in my 
   neighbor's hay meadow. Did you know we have to board up our haystacks in the West or the elk and the deer will eat all the hay and leave us none for our own livestock? They do not winter on public lands because there is no water and there is no feed. It is covered up. They have to winter on private lands. So are we so bad? I do not think so. We would not have it any other way because we are all hunters and fishermen and we enjoy the sights  of big game. We want to maintain the habitat. We enjoy seeing those elk. We enjoy this season of the year when they start bugling. Go out and listen. That is what makes my State worth living in. 
   It costs more money and the timber sale budget offers us an opportunity to feed our Nation's need for raw materials while employing Montanans and making and protecting habitat. We are talking about balance. Someone is buying that lumber or we would not have the demand to harvest it. 
   Harvesting a crop is not a sin. To the contrary, it keeps this country moving forward. It provides the timber to build our homes, and it provides the paper that often gets shuffled back and forth in this town. Quite simply, a timber sale budget is essential to America for food and fiber by proud producers. That is what it is all about. They do not like to be lied to. They do not even require much support. They ask very little. They ask to grow, to plant, nurture, and harvest. That is what it is all about. 
   How did those people who work in natural resources and agriculture--and this is agriculture in its highest form--who are responsible for 22 or 23 percent of the Nation's GDP become bad folks? How did we get that way? Because we used the resources around us, and our definition of conservation is the wise use of a natural renewable resource. Think about that. Twenty-three percent of the GDP in this Nation is in the production and the feeding of this country. It is unbelievable how that can be overlooked. 
   I ask my colleagues to contemplate the alternative. Let's say we quit harvesting trees in America, and that is what some extremist groups want us to do, or they want to make it so expensive we cannot compete on the open market. Do you realize that I have mills in Montana that are hauling logs 500 miles, out of where? Canada. So is your demand for lumber so high that you want to so-called devastate the Canadian land? I do not think so. 
   Why do people like to visit States such as Montana? No. 1, we are kind of authentic. Because we have done a pretty good job of taking care of it. And it is true of our good neighbors to the west in Idaho. It makes us the friendliest and the nicest people you will ever meet. But our people are starting to get cranky because their livelihood is being taken away from them, their ability to take care of themselves, by the rest of the country in its desire for the food and fiber that it takes for us to subsist. 
   So if you want to see our forests die in front of us, if you want to see our wildlife choked out of its habitat, and if you want to see our rural communities die, and to see foreign corporate timber production unfettered, fueled by our need for fiber, then vote for the Bryan amendment. That is what it is all about. 
   But there is balance here. I urge my colleagues to vote to maintain that balance. We believe in the balance of our forest lands and good stewardship. 
   If you want to talk about stewardship, we have a stewardship plan that is getting started on a trial basis in Montana that is being participated in by a lot of people, including very small harvesters. So if you say you want a stewardship program, you have one. It is a good one. It is a dandy. It will work. But we cannot make it work unless we have funds to balance the needs of our forests. 
   I thank the Chair and my chairman and yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose this amendment. I think it sets a bad precedent because I think it is bad politics. 
   I just came back from my State, as most of us did, and talked to my agricultural producers. We have a predator problem in Montana. 
   Let me tell you about a conversation I had with a good friend in Glasgow, MT. They are sheep producers. They run from the Fort Peck Reservoir south towards Circle, MT. That is McCone Valley and Roosevelt County. They have trapped and killed 90 coyotes on their ranch, and they are still run over with them. 
   This lies along the CMR Wildlife Refuge in Montana along the Missouri River. Those sheep are smart enough to stay in that refuge. The only time we can get them is when they come out. They lose about 300 lambs a day. I don't know how many people can sustain that much loss. 
   But this particular trap is sort of needed, whether it be in the use of predator control, whether it be used on the refuge, or on BLM or private land. 
   I said yesterday that on one of the amendments one of these days this body is going to be hit by a large bolt of common sense. Then I don't know what is going to happen. We will not know how to deal with things here. 
   But I will tell you that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposes this amendment. They are the ones who manage the refuge systems. 
   The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies that represents the 50 fish and wildlife agencies and conservation groups--which includes the Izaak Walton League of America--all oppose this amendment. They oppose it for the simple reason that we get a little loose with definitions. 
   I think the point is that nobody likes to see the suffering and catching the wrong animal in the wrong trap. I would question the 80 to 90 percent wrong animal figure. I would question that because no trapper I know, whether they did it as a sportsman for recreation, whether they did it to prevent predation on livestock, or whether they did it for a living, worth his salt, who knows how to trap, has figures similar to this. There is none that I know. 
   And we have quite a few of them in my State. 
   So I ask we oppose and defeat this amendment. It is taking away some of those tools that do not meet the definition. We say, if States OK it for recreation, then define recreation. We know it has a habit of spilling over into areas where, if we cannot use these traps to prevent predation, then we are again put at the mercy of predators, of which we have many. 
   Businesses cannot sustain those losses. Maybe no one cares whether businesses sustain themselves or not. Let's face it; they have human faces, too, in this situation. So I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I yield the floor.

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. so that the weekly party conferences can meet. Following the conference meetings, the Senate will move to executive session for the consideration of two judicial nominees. Therefore, Senators can expect two consecutive votes at 2:15 today. 
   When the Senate returns to legislative session, it will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. Amendments are expected to be offered, and therefore Senators can expect additional votes throughout today's session. 
   It is hoped that the Senate can complete the Interior appropriations bill on Thursday at a reasonable time. As a reminder, there will be no votes on Friday in observance of the Rosh Hashanah holiday. The majority leader looks forward to a productive legislative period as we complete the appropriations process, and he thanks all Senators in advance for their cooperation.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the impassioned plea of my friend from Oregon. Last week, we sold a lumber mill in Montana. Darby Lumber went down because they could not get logs. Mills are hauling logs in from Canada, 500 miles, and it is like my friend from Oregon said--we are decimating our neighbors' lands because we have not had the nerve to be honest with the American people. 
   To give you an idea, up in the northwestern part of Montana, we are growing about 120 million board feet of lumber a year. The Forest Service makes plans to harvest about 19 million board feet. The truth is, America, we will be lucky if we harvest 6 million board feet. 
   Opposition to section 329 flatly contradicts previous positions taken by the environmental community and this administration on the best methods for protecting wildlife. Section 329 would restore to the administration the authority to plan and account for wildlife protection by surveying habitat--a method employed for over two decades and that has been approved by seven Federal courts, including three circuit  courts of appeal. The recent Eleventh Circuit decision contradicted this consensus judicial opinion and would require the agency to provide protection to wildlife by counting--not once but twice--the number of members of each of 20 to 40 management indicator and sensitive species before undertaking any ground-disturbing activities in our national forests--be it timber harvesting, be it watershed restoration, be it trail building, be it maintenance, or be it for the prevention of 
   fire. I guess this is one reason you can't run a pretty good ranch or a pretty good farm that depends on renewable resources by a committee, for the difference of opinion on how we should do things. If left to that, we would never get in a crop. America would never have a substantial, sustaining supply of food. 
   The emphasis the Forest Service has placed on habitat availability instead of counting the members of individual species is exactly the policy advocated by the environmental community. I wonder, at this time when they change the policy, what is the motive here? What is the motive? Is it us against them? I don't think so. I don't know of anybody who stands in this body to decimate the environment. But I wonder, of all the fires that are burning in the West today, if a little management on fuel buildup could not have prevented some of those. But somebody thought a mouse was too important that we can't disturb the land, and it burns. 
   Virtually every environmental organization has insisted the law be reformed to address habitat protection and away from narrow species-by-species focus. Indeed, the provision in the Endangered Species Act that the environmentalists most frequently quote in both the Senate and the House, and in Federal courtrooms across the country, is the first phrase in the statement of purpose in section 2(b):  
   The purposes of this Act are to provide a means whereby ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be preserved.  
   Now, we can argue on philosophy, but I think we are arguing on politics, and what is at stake is families. Also, what is at stake is the forest itself. I invite the Senator from Virginia to go with me this weekend. I will take him up in the Yak, where we have infestation of the pine beetle, dying trees, and a forest that would just shock him. It would absolutely shock him to his shoes. He would be devastated, looking at that forest. Yet the environmental community has made up its mind that we are not going to harvest; we are going to let it burn. I don't think that is why the Senator from Virginia wore the uniform as long as he did, to protect that kind of mismanagement of the country he so loves, or even the people he so loves. 
   The administration has been even more adamant in insisting on a habitat approach to wildlife protection. That is what they told us when they first came to office. It has championed two land management concepts--ecosystem management and biological diversity protection--that rely entirely on methodologies which concentrate on habitat rather than individual species. Certainly, ecosystem management is a fancy way of saying habitat management. I don't have very many of those fancy words; I have to write them down. 
   But it is funny what you can see from horseback. Sometimes you can see over tall mountains and tall buildings and over very high-minded ideas that don't work. They have never worked; they never will work. So, too, when biological diversity is considered, conservation biologists insist on treating habitat as the source of wildlife and plant diversity and resist focusing on individual species. They have always done that. 
   We have embraced that philosophy and that approach. That means we can do something about managing our land in the highest standard of environmental protection and still harvest the crop with which the God above has so blessed this country. 
   Finally, the capstone of this administration's wildlife policy is the habitat conservation planning and incidental take, permitting it is conducting with private landowners helping them provide habitat for endangered species. 
   How can a man stand here and even talk about endangered species when you have only one crop that you get paid once a year for and you see wolves killing right out of your own pasture not 300 feet away from where you live? And there is not a thing you can do about it. 
   Does anyone want to go out and face that man and tell him and his family, well, we have some folks that like to hear that yipping and howling? After they get done with their kill, they will go across the creek, which is only about 400 yards, and they will lay there and they will rest until they get hungry again. That is almost unbelievable to me. 
   That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about something that doesn't work. We are talking about people who are very smart and very intelligent but have little or no wisdom--higher than thee, elitist--who prevent men and women who were born of the soil, born of the land, worked the land, and will die and go back to the land. I guess one could say we are all just circling the brink because that is where we are going to go. Maybe you never know how that is going to turn out. 
   Despite the solid momentum away from attention to single species and toward consideration of habitats, we now see the very advocates of this approach criticizing it in their attacks on section 329. I wonder how they will feel when they are successful in stripping 329 from the bill only to discover that the U.S. Forest Service--one of the first agencies to adopt a habitat approach to wildlife protection--must now abandon it to follow the expensive--in fact, it is too expensive. We know that the money will never be appropriated. So it will not be done. It is an outdated process of counting individual members of one species after another, like I said, not once but twice. I am just asking that we have an attack of common sense--just common sense, everyday common sense that the rest of America uses every day just to subsist. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Madame President, I am very pleased to introduce the ``Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999,'' along with my colleagues Senator WYDEN, Senator LOTT and Senator HOLLINGS. 
   This critical legislation was championed last year by my good friend and former colleague Senator Ford. The Commerce Committee unanimously reported this bill on October 2, 1998 but unfortunately there was not sufficient time to complete action on the bill. 
   Low power television stations (LPTV) offer their communities significant services including valuable local and other specialized programming to unserved and underserved audiences throughout the United States. As secondary service broadcasters, they remain vulnerable to displacement and encounter huge problems with capital formation but have significant infrastructure requirements. 
   This legislation has a very simple but important purpose. It provides an opportunity for LPTV licensees to convert their temporary licenses to permanent licenses. While the opportunity is available to all licensees, the legislation provides that only those who do a significant amount of local programming in their service areas are eligible for the class A permanent licenses. To ensure a serious and high quality level of local broadcasting by all class A licensees, this bill also requires that all class A licensees comply with the operating rules for full power stations. 
   I would like to emphasize that this bill takes into account the hearings that were held last year before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, during which the Federal Communications Commission noted that the previous bill was not sufficiently flexible to address unforeseen engineering-related problems concerning the transition to digital television. The current bill provides that flexibility to ensure that the Commission can make whatever engineering changes that are necessary, even channel changes, to ensure that every full power station in the U.S. can achieve digital television service replication of its analog service area. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support on this vital piece of legislation and look forward to seeing it passed by the Senate and into law.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a significant, but often overlooked historical event in our nation's past-Montana's Mann Gulch Fire which occurred 50 years ago today. This event continues to capture the nation's attention because thirteen brave, young men died fighting this fire. LIFE Magazine ran a big story shortly after this fire. In 1952, Hollywood made a movie about this unfortunate disaster called ``Red Skies of Montana.'' And Norman Maclean, who wrote the famous book ``A River Runs Through It'', wrote a haunting bestseller entitled ``Young Men and Fire'' in 1992. But even more remarkable, this single event marked a turning point in the way the federal government fights wildland fires. 
   It was a hot summer day in August 1949, not unlike what we have recently experienced, when a Forest Service Fire Guard, James Harrison, reported a small fire in a little, funnel-shaped gulch along the Missouri River. The temperature was 97 degrees with a light wind from the north and east. The fire was located 20 miles north of Helena, Montana in a roadless area called the Gates of the Mountain. Parachuting 15 smokejumpers was decided to be the best approach to reach this remote area quickly to control this relatively ordinary fire. 
   Once on the ground, the smokejumpers joined the Forest Service Fire Guard to fight the fire. As they moved down the gulch toward the Missouri River, the wind quickly shifted from the south, funneling a strong wind up the gulch. As they got near the Missouri River, a wall of fire blocked their access to the river. The fire was getting hotter and swiftly moving up the gulch. Retreating back was their only solution, however, it was a hard hike back up the steep rocky slope of the gulch. As the firefighters retreated, dropping their equipment, a 30 foot wall of fire raced toward them and eventually overcame them. 
   In the end, only three firefighters survived--Wagner ``Wag'' Dodge, Walter Rumsey, and Robert Sallee. Thirteen firefighters died as a testament to the power of a fire ``blow up'' which had raced down and back up the slopes of Mann Gulch faster than men could travel. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to name those thirteen brave young men who lost their lives that day--Robert Bennett, Eldon Diettert, James Harrison, William Hellman, Philip McVey, David Navon, Leonard Piper, Stanley Reba, Marvin Sherman, Joseph Sylvia, Henry Thol, Jr., Newton Thompson, and Silas Thompson. 
   This tragic loss 50 years ago, however, should not be remembered only in a somber way. We should remember the many positive changes that have come from this disaster. After investigating the Mann Gulch Fire, the federal government made a stronger investment in fighting wildland fires. For example, in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower personally opened the Aerial Fire Depot in Missoula, Montana. Understanding how wildland fires behave and how to best fight them also increased with the opening of research laboratories in Missoula, Montana and Macon, Georgia. Development of new techniques, such as ``safety zones'' and new technologies, such as reflective ``fire shelters,'' were made to increase the protection of fire fighters in the midst of a fire. These changes were made in large measure due to the sacrifice these thirteen brave men made on August 5, 1949. 
   There is one last step that needs to be taken. Congress needs to address some of the problems in maintaining the high quality of our nation's fire fighting crews. Yesterday I introduced legislation which will do that. I trust my colleagues will join with me in supporting this bill to ensure its passage. What could be a more fitting tribute to all the brave men and women who have lost their lives fighting wildland fires  than to enact legislation this year to strengthen the quality of our nation's firefighting crews. 
   Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring these brave men for their dedication, sacrifice, and contributions to protect America from wildland fires. To these men who revered honor and honored duty, we salute them.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has unanimously passed the ``e-911 Act of 1999.'' 
   The e-911 bill is simple--it makes 911 the universal emergency number. This bill will help save lives and is supported by a broad range of public safety, emergency medical, consumer and citizen groups. These groups represent the operators and users of the 911 system, those with direct experience with the problems with today's system. 
   Over seventy million Americans carry wireless telephones. Many carry them for safety reasons. People count on those phones to be their lifelines in emergencies. In fact, 98,000 people are counting on their wireless phones in emergencies everyday. That is how many wireless 911 calls are made a day, 98,000. But there's a problem. In many parts of our country, when the frantic parent or the suddenly disabled older person punches 911 on the wireless phone, nothing happens. In those locations, 911 is not the emergency number. The ambulance and the police won't be coming. You may be facing a terrible emergency, but you're on your own, because you don't know the local number to call for emergencies. 
   ``The e-911 Act of 1999'' will help fix that problem by making 911 the number to call in an emergency--anytime, everywhere. The rule in America ought to be uniform and simple--if you have an emergency, wherever you are, dial 911. 
   More and more, wireless communications is the critical link that can help get emergency medical care to those in the ``golden hour'' when timely care can mean the difference between life and death. 
   I thank my colleagues for their hard work in passing this critical legislation.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas. I will be very brief. 
   I do not know of any piece of legislation that has ever been proposed having to do with agriculture that has been perfect. If there is one place where it is hard to find a one size fits all, it is in this business of agriculture because we are diverse in climate, in growing conditions, in crops, and everything else. It is pretty tough to find that perfect bill. 
   What we have sought is balance. On balance, I think this addresses the needs as we think they are now, and also it is a step towards what we think it will be at the end of the crop year. I think it is very important that the commitment to agriculture is here. Without changing programs, putting cash on the farm as fast as we possibly can is in this piece of legislation. 
   Let's take it for what it is. Sure, we can sit and pick it apart. Yes, we would like to see some things changed for Montana that won't fit the things in Mississippi. But I think what we have is balance. 
   With the leadership of Senator ROBERTS and Senator CRAIG, and a lot of us who have worked very hard on this for a long time, knowing the prospects in front of us, I thank them for their leadership. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of Montana's greatest citizens, the Honorable James F. Battin, Sr. Jim Battin was born in Wichita, Kansas, and at the age of four, moved to Billings, Montana, where he was raised. After graduating from high school, he served for three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II, spending most of that time in the Pacific theater. Following the war, Jim returned home to continue his education, graduating first from Eastern Montana College in Billings and later receiving his J.D. from George Washington University. He continued his career in public service as a city attorney in Billings, and in 1958, he was elected to the Montana state legislature. Only two years later, he successfully ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he was quickly assigned seats on the House Committee on Committees, as well as Ways and Means, two very prestigious seats for a freshman member of Congress. Jim later served on the House Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees, and was ultimately elected five times by the people of his district, which then covered the eastern half of the state of Montana. During his congressional career, which lasted from 1961 to 1969, Congressman Battin played an instrumental role in a good deal of legislation, including the bill which created Montana's Bob Marshall Wilderness Area, at the time the largest wildlife area in the United States. Jim also served as one of two U.S. Congressional Representatives to the Inter-Governmental Committee on European Migration, which met in Geneva. This group helped individuals who were expelled from behind the Iron Curtain to re-establish businesses in other countries, or to find work in other occupations. In 1968, Congressman Battin was President Nixon's representative to the Platform Committee at the Republican National Committee, and shortly thereafter, in early 1969, he became President Nixon's first judicial appointment. He served as a U.S. district judge for the district of Montana for 27 years, becoming its Chief Judge in 1978. During his time on the bench, Judge Battin issued key rulings affecting the lives of Montana citizens, among them his ruling which preserved access to the Bighorn River for people throughout the state, and his creation of the precedent for the now universally accepted six-man federal jury in civil cases. A dedicated and hard working man, James F. Battin Sr. remained on the bench until his passing in the autumn of 1996. 
   It was with these facts in mind, Mr. President, that led to my support of H.R. 158, a bill which would designate the United States courthouse located at 316 North 26th Street in Billings,  Montana, as the ``James F. Battin United States Courthouse''. Congress passed H.R. 158 earlier this year, and it was signed into law by the President on April 5th, 1999, as Public Law 106-11. I believe that the renaming of this courthouse, which Judge Battin presided over for so long, is the most fitting tribute that the United States Congress and the people of Montana can pay to this great man, whose outstanding career in public service spanned over 40 years. Come next Monday, when this building is officially rechristened with its new name, I think all of us should take a moment to tip our hats in thanks to Judge Battin for a job well-done. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as an individual who has spent his entire life involved in agriculture. I am extremely concerned about the current state of the agricultural economy. Farmers and ranchers in my state of Montana and across America cannot afford another year of zero profit. Price declines for agricultural commodities have had a devastating impact on agricultural producers in Montana and the economy of the entire state, which depends so heavily on agriculture. The farmers and ranchers in Montana have suffered too much already. With continued low prices, many agricultural producers have been forced to sell the farms and ranches many have spent their entire lives working. 
   They seem to have all the cards stacked against them. Agricultural producers face high numbers of imports  as well as a downward trend in demand for their product. Further, the world market is not providing adequate opportunities for international trade. The European Union continues to place non-scientific trade barriers on U.S. beef as well as bans on Genetically Modified grain products. Asia, usually a strong export market, continues to recover from the economic flu and many of our other trade partners have been subjected to sanctions by this administration. Additionally, the value of beef and grain imports have decreased dramatically as a percent of the world market. 
   Montana may not be able to survive another year of this economic plight. If market prices continue to go down as they have, I am fearful that more farmers and ranchers will be forced out of business. If a drastic measure is not passed in Congress this year, I don't know how much longer the agricultural community can persevere. 
   As I said before, the impact is not limited to those working the fields or raising livestock. Look at Main Street, Rural America. The agricultural economy is so bad that other businesses are failing as well. And not just agri-business. No longer is it just the livestock feed store or seed companies that are failing due to the economic crunch. It reaches much further. All kinds and types of businesses are feeling the depressed agricultural economy. Montana is ranked in the bottom five per capita income by state, in the nation. 
   Ironically, I also read recently that Montana is rated in a nationwide poll as the 7th most desirable place to live in America. That won't be the case much longer if we can't return more of the economic dollar to the agricultural producer. Montana is a desirable place to live because of agriculture. Without the wheat fields and grazing pastures, Montana loses its very being. Without the return of more of the economic dollar to the agricultural producer there will be no more farming or ranching and consequently no more wheat fields or pastures to graze livestock. 
   I have used the comparison before of the agricultural producer drowning. I believe he is. The way I see it, the farmer is drowning in a sea of debt and many in Congress want to continue to send lifeboats. The problem is, that once the producer makes it into the boat he never makes it to shore. He just keeps paddling trying to keep his head above water, and waiting for the next boat. 
   I want the farmer to get back to land and on his feet. We have to provide them the oars to get to shore and then keep them out of the water. I would like to see a strong agriculture assistance package passed and then a base for long-term benefits, in the form of laws on country of origin labeling, crop insurance reform and mandatory price reporting. 
   My Montana farmers and ranchers need help now. They need a package that provides solid short-term assistance. They need AMTA payments at 100% to bring the price of wheat per bushel to a price that will allow them to meet their cost-of-production. Additionally, they need funding for specialty crops, sugar and livestock. 
   I don't agree with many of the provisions included in the Democratic package. Funding for cotton and peanuts does not help my agricultural producers. Neither does $300 million for the Step 2 cotton program. These provisions bump the price tag up significantly and seem to help other areas of the country more than the Northwest. 
   However, all agriculture is in dire straits. Montana needs funding and they need it fast. Thus, I will vote for the package that gets that money to my producers as quickly as possible. 
   I believe that AMTA is the most effective way to distribute the funding that grain producers need. The Republican package contains 100% AMTA payments, which will bring the price of wheat up to $3.84. It also contains important provisions for specialty crops, lifts the LDP cap and encourages the President to be more aggressive in strengthening trade negotiating authority for American agriculture. 
   Freedom to Farm needs a boost. It is a good program, but simply cannot provide for the needs of farmers and ranchers during this kind of economic crunch. From 1995 to 1999, $50.9 billion have been distributed as direct payments. This tells us that commodity prices are not going up. Farmers and ranchers are not doing better on their net income sheets. 
   We need to let Freedom to Farm work. I believe it will. When more of the economic dollar is returned to the producer and when the farmer or rancher receives a price for commodities that meet the cost-of-production. For now, we must keep the agricultural producer afloat. An assistance measure which will provide them a means to stay in business at a profitable level is the only way to do that this year.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to bring before the Senate the Military Construction Conference Report for fiscal year 2000. 
   Mr. President, this conference report was passed by the House of Representatives last week by a vote of 412 to 8. It was sent to the Senate late last week and now awaits or final passage. 
   We have worked hard with our House colleagues to bring the Military Construction Conference to a successful conclusion. 
   It reflects a strong bipartisan effort of behalf of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
   Both bodies took a different perspective on the allocation of military construction funding for the Department of Defense. 
   However, in the final conference report, we met our goals of promoting quality of life initiatives and enhancing mission readiness. 
   Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to highlight. It provides a total of $8.37 billion for military construction. 
   Even though this is an increase of $2.9 billion over the President's budget for fiscal year 2000, it is still a reduction of $79 million from what was appropriated last year. 
   The conferees rejected the administration proposal to incrementally fund military construction and family housing projects throughout the Department of Defense. 
   Instead the conferees believed that fully funding these projects was essential for the well being and moral of the men and women who serve in uniform. 
   Some 43 percent of the bill is allocated to family housing--a total of $3.6 billion. This includes new construction, improvements to existing units and funding for operation and maintenance of that housing. 
   We strongly protected quality of life initiatives. We provided $643 million for barracks, $22 million for child development centers, and $151 million for hospital and medical facilities. 
   We provided a total of $695 million for the Guard and Reserve components. Overall this represents an increase of $560 million from the President's budget request. 
   Many of those projects will enhance the readiness and mission capabilities of our Reserve and Guard forces, vital to out national defense. 
   I would like to thank my ranking member, Senator MURRAY, for her assistance and support throughout this process. She and her staff was extremely helpful. 
   I commend this product to the Senate and recommend that it be signed by the President without delay.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today to speak on the Regulatory Openness and Fairness Act of 1999, of which I am an original cosponsor. 
   This legislation will ensure that the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) will carry out its original intent while protecting agricultural producers from unnecessary regulations. The FQPA, enacted in 1996, was put in place to ensure that highest level of food safety. This is a necessary and worthwhile goal. However, the EPA currently makes rulings that are based on data without a sound science base. Instead, assumptions are based on propaganda and worst-case scenarios. 
   This legislation requires EPA to modernize the laws governing pesticide use, using science-based data and evaluations. This will ensure that American consumers will continue to receive the world's safest food supply, and still allow those agricultural producers that provide food and fiber the means to do so. 
   This bill will also require EPA to establish and administer a program for tracking the effect of regulatory decisions of U.S. agriculture as compared to world trends. Producers in other countries often do not face the regulatory nightmare American producers do. This will provide a measure for that different and the impact it has on agricultural producers in the U.S. 
   Additionally, this bill will establish a permanent Pesticide Advisory Committee including food consumers, environmental groups, farmers, non-agricultural pesticide users, food manufacturers, food distributors, pesticide manufacturers, federal and state agencies. Such a diverse group will serve all interests and maintain a safe food supply. 
   I thank Mr. HAGEL for sponsoring this fine bill and look forward to working with him in its passage. Through it we can work for the good of agriculture and food consumers alike.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment that will help to keep our Nation's air clean and healthy. This amendment will provide a tax credit for our Nation's energy producers to produce an environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient alternative fuel using otherwise unusable waste products and natural resources. 
   This proposal would provide for a biomass coal tax credit and offer an incentive for the Nation's energy producers to construct facilities that would process low-grade, high-moisture, coal. We have large supplies of this type of coal in our nation. 
   This proposal provides half of the credit that is being allowed to produce electricity using biomass and wind power. This is a production tax credit you can only claim the credit if you produce the qualified product. 
   However, it has been determined that in order for companies to use this credit, they need to have an idea that the credit is going to be available for an extended number of years. Otherwise the costs of building the facilities to provide this environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient fuels would be cost prohibitive. 
   The marketplace demands a premium, low pollutant coal, to meet the nations needs and in response to the Clean Air Act and the Kyoto Protocol. We cannot jeopardize America's competitiveness by complying with Kyoto's costs on our consumers and markets. 
   Providing this tax credit marks the beginning of a new industry. Based on current market pressures resulting from deregulation and environmental regulations, numerous companies are interested in constructing these facilities. This is a tax credit that will help to clean our Nation's air and keep our skies blue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming. I doubt I need 3 minutes. 
   When this accounting system was adopted in the telecommunications industry way back in 1935, and it evolved through the years, we did not foresee the advances of technology and the need to change equipment would happen in that area as fast as it is happening now. New technology is coming on line. If there is a holdup in the buildout of this technology, of maybe some of our locally owned companies--and some of our cooperatives as cooperatives, I doubt, will be affected by this --it is so we can get rid of some of this old equipment we 
   carry on the books because it is not all depreciated out. It has not kept pace with the technology. 
   There was, a couple of years ago--it was more than that, 5 or 6 years ago, with then-Senator Brown from Colorado--offered an amendment to standardize accounting clear through the Government. We did not get that done. But nonetheless here is an old accounting system that is very important to the high-tech area when it comes to buildout in the rural area, so broad-band technologies can be deployed and get rid of some of the old equipment still on the books. 
   This amendment needs passing. I yield the floor and thank my friend from Wyoming.

   Mr. BURNS. The Senate is accepting my amendment to allocate $250,000 for the development of a Habitat Conservation Plan as part of the Idaho and Montana Coldwater Fishery Enhancement Program. This funding is imperative in the preparation of a voluntary Habitat Conservation Plan aimed at saving our native fish populations in the two states. As you know, we are at the upper end of the Columbia River drainage and the impacts seen on salmon in that drainage are interrelated to our native trout as well. 
   As the debate raged on about what exactly was impacting the native fish populations in the lower Columbia system, those of us in the upper reaches of the system were doing our best to ensure that enough water was sent downstream at the appropriate time to help the native fish as much as possible. What we have learned from this practice is that the health of our bull trout population is linked to that of the salmon. Fewer salmon returning from the ocean to spawn placed concern on the health of the entire river system, and the traditional actions taken to help one species sometimes had negative impacts on others. As is commonly the case with these types of issues, we didn't always realize the interrelation until some negative impacts had already taken place. 
   Making these funds available for the Idaho and Montana Coldwater Fishery Enhancement Program will help us address more of the survival needs of native fish species in the Columbia Basin. Stabilizing the bull trout population and developing this plan will allow us more flexibility in helping the salmon populations recover as well. Senator, I hope you will join me in clarifying where this money is to be directed and to reaffirm the value of developing a state-led voluntary Habitat Conservation Plan for bull trout in Idaho and Montana.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues in a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. Thirty years ago today, our nation was launched into the lead of a global space race. Not only was this an important step for our nation, it was an important step for America in the Cold War--a war waged in technological and economic terms rather than on the front lines of the battlefield. A war in which America later claimed victory during President Reagan's administration. 
   The Apollo 11 mission played a role in that victory. The famous words, ``one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'' was more than appropriate. It was one of the highlights of NASA and during the pinnacle of the agency's existence. On the morning of July 16, 1969, the mission's Saturn V rocket was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, landing on the moon four days later. On board with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin was Michael Collins, who piloted the command module while his comrades used a landing craft, the Eagle, to make that historic visit to the lunar surface. 
   The mission was a unifying event in an era when America was wracked by social protest and divided over the Vietnam War. People across the country, and around the world, sat glued to television sets as the Apollo crew did what was once thought impossible. The important achievement of Apollo demonstrated that humanity is not forever chained to this planet. 
   Mr. President, I regret that the push for manned space flight has faded in the years since Apollo. I find it ironic, that 30 years after first going to the moon that children today are learning about space travel in history class, rather than science class. 
   May 13, 2004, will mark the launch of the Corps of Discovery bicentennial. It was during this adventure that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, along with a small band of men, set out on a voyage of exploration that was to earn them a place in America's history. Tasked with exploring a new and largely unknown world, Lewis and Clark opened the West and provided storytellers with a compelling, historic drama. 
   Today, NASA's role in space exploration parallels the role of the Corps of Discovery. No other federal agency is faced with such intriguing and limitless boundaries. No other federal agency captivates the attention of school children around the nation. 
   But NASA's obstacle is not a technology barrier--rather it is a barrier of financial abilities. Space activities require decades of planning. Short-term constraints of a political agenda do not address this necessity. It is not where we want to be next year, rather where we want to be 20 years from now. That is a blindness many politicians are hampered with. 
   For the sixth year in a row, NASA's budget has declined while its productivity improves. We know what NASA is able to do. In the 1960s, the Saturn/Apollo program put a man on the moon. Only recently has the commercial sector approached NASA's heavy-lift capacities. 
   Our nation's history is one of triumph and tragedy. We have rejoiced in NASA's success and mourned in its grief but the Apollo 11 mission was one of the greatest moments in our nation's history. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about health care. I am very proud that this great country of ours provides the best quality of health care in the world. With this comes the question of how to manage the constantly growing costs associated with this and how to guarantee that as many Americans as possible can be provided affordable health care. 
   Currently, 43 million Americans are uninsured and many more live with the anxiety that they will lose their employer-sponsored health plans if premiums go up. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Senator KENNEDY's bill, S. 6, will increase private health insurance premiums 6.1 percent above inflation. Data from the Barents Group, an economic consulting firm, reveal an increase of this magnitude will impose hundreds of dollars in hidden taxes on families, eliminate jobs, and cancel the health coverage of millions. 
   In Montana, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses pull the wagon and are the main source of income in our great state. You can only imagine what would happen if Senator KENNEDY's Patients' Bill of Rights bill passes. Hundreds of Montanans will lose their insurance for their families and quite possibly many could lose their jobs. With the current agriculture prices as low as they this would only make things much worse for Montanans. 
   The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights bill provides new rights to American patients. This bill will guarantee access to emergency room care, access to the doctor of your choice, access to ob-gyn care without prior authorization and access to a pediatrician without prior authorization. The Republican bill also improves continuity of care if a doctor leaves a health plan and improved access to medication. These are just a few of the things that our Patients' Bill of Rights bill guarantees patients. 
   I will not vote for a bill that squeezes patients into a one-size-fits-all health plan. We do not want a Washington-knows-best solution. As a former county commissioner I have always believed in local control. 
   The Republican bill provides tax-free medical savings accounts for patients and allows for 100 percent deductibility of health care costs for the self-employed. Medical savings accounts are similar to individual retirement accounts, except they are used to pay for health care needs instead of retirement. They permit individuals to set aside money, tax-free, to pay for medical expenses. 
   The Democrats want to pass a bill that would regulate the structure and operation of all health insurance products at the federal level; impose mandates on consumers, health insurers and employers; enable new lawsuits against employers and insurers for unlimited compensatory and punitive damages; and increase the number of uninsured Americans by an estimated 1.9 million. 
   In contrast the Republican bill guarantees to make health insurance more  affordable for the self-employed by letting them deduct 100 percent of their health premiums in 2000--three years ahead of schedule. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Democrats bill, S. 6, would increase health insurance premiums an average 6.1 percent which would force 1.8 million to 1.9 million Americans to lose their health coverage. This bill will also lower household wages an average of $207 annually, and would eliminate 194,000 jobs by 2003. 
   I am firmly behind a bill in the United States that will provide consumer protections and enhanced health care quality, while keeping insurance affordable and actually expanding access to insurance for millions of Americans. 
   Under the Republican bill, the patients have the right to talk freely and openly with their doctors about all treatment options and the right to see the doctor of their choice. Even more important, they have the right to a quick and cost-free appeals process if a health plan refuses to cover treatment. 
   The Republican bill does all these things, and also expands opportunity for millions of uninsured Americans to come into the health care system. We offer tax-free medical savings accounts to all, and extend tax equity to self-employed individuals. 
   Mr. President, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus makes sure all Americans have the access and protections they need and want. Americans deserve access to the best doctors and specialists available; reliable information about their doctors and their health plans, and affordable, quality care at every stage of life. This week, I will work to make sure Congress addresses these important issues with a plan that puts you, not a bureaucrat, in control of your health care. 
   I thank the chair.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will establish a commission to study the future of the travel agent industry and determine the consumer impact of airline interaction with travel agents. 
   Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was enacted, major airlines have controlled pricing and distribution policies of our nation's domestic air transportation system. Over the past four years, the airlines have reduced airline commissions to travel agents in an competitive effort to reduce costs. 
   I am concerned the impact of today's business interaction between airlines and travel agents may be a driving force that will force many travel agents out of business. Combined with the competitive emergence of Internet services, these practices may be harming an industry that employs over 250,000 Americans. 
   This bill will explore these concerns through the establishment of a commission to objectively review the emerging trends in the airline ticket distribution system. Among airline consumers there is a growing concern that the airlines may be using their market power to unfairly limit how airline tickets are distributed. 
   Mr. President, if we lose our travel agents, we lose a competitive component to affordable air fare. Travel agents provide a much needed service and without, the consumer is the loser. 
   The current use of independent travel agencies as the predominate method to distribute tickets ensures an efficient and unbiased source of information for air travel. Before deregulation, travel agents handled only about 40 percent of the airline ticket distribution system. Since deregulation, the complexity of the ticket pricing system created the need for travel agents resulting in travel agents handling nearly 90 percent of transactions. 
   Therefore, the travel agent system has proven to be a key factor to the success of airline deregulation. I'm afraid, however, that the demise of the independent travel agent would be a factor of deregulation's failure if the major airlines succeed in dominating the ticket distribution system. 
   Travel agents and other independent distributors comprise a considerable portion of the small business sector in the United States. There are 33,000 travel agencies employing over 250,000 people. Women or minorities own over 50 percent of travel agencies. 
   The assault on travel agents has been fierce. Since 1995, commissions have been reduced by 30 percent, 14 percent for domestic travel alone in 1998. Since 1995, travel agent commissions have been reduced from an average of 10.8 percent to 6.9 percent in 1998. Travel agencies are failing in record numbers. 
   Mr. President, I think it is important to study this issue as well as the related issues of the current state of ticket distribution channels, the importance of an independent system on small, regional, start-up carriers, and the role of the Internet.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor to honor a Department of Justice team that is receiving the top prosecution award today at Constitution Hall. This team of 12 prosecutors and investigators was faced with the challenging task of bringing LeRoy Schweitzer, Richard Clark, Daniel Petersen, Rodney Skurdal, Dale Jacobi, Russell Landers, and others, known as the ``Freemen,'' to justice. 
   As you may remember, the Montana Freemen were a group of individuals who refused to recognize any authority by U.S. officials. Instead, they created their own ``republic'' and court system. After warrants were prepared for multiple counts of fraud, armed robbery, and firearms violations, they holed up on their ranch for 81 days in a tense standoff. The team recognized today were critical in preparing the warrants, negotiating the peaceful resolution of the standoff, and convicting twenty-one members of the group. In addition, this team worked with many other prosecution teams to prepare and present related cases in over thirty federal districts. 
   It makes me especially proud that there were seven Montanans among the group being recognized. They are Assistant U.S. Attorney James Seykora, Paralegal Specialist Deborah Boyle, IRS Special Agents Michael Mayott and Loretta Rodriquez, FBI Senior Resident Agent Daniel Vierthaler, FBI Special Agent Randall Jackson, and Montana Department of Justice Agent Bryan Costigan. I also appreciate the contribution of Robertson Park, George Toscas, David Kris, Tommie Canady, and Timothy Healy as award winners contributing from agencies outside of the state. I also think it's only appropriate to recognize the investigation and prosecution leader, Montana U.S. Attorney Sherry Matteucci. Although this entire prosecution effort fell under her responsibility, as a political appointee, she is not eligible for this award. 
   The Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service is given once each year, with the decision based upon the following: performance of a special  service in the public interest that is over and above the normal requirements and of an outstanding and distinctive character in terms of improved operations, public understanding of the department's mission, or accomplishment of one of the major goals of the department, exceptionally outstanding contributions to the Department of Justice or exceptionally outstanding leadership in the administration of major programs that resulted in highly successful accomplishments to meet unique or emergency situations, or extraordinary courage and voluntary risk of life in performing an act resulting in direct benefits to the department or nation. From where I sit, this team has met or exceeded all of these high standards during the course of the investigation. Few other prosecutions have received the external scrutiny in the press, Justice management, and the public eye as did the Freemen prosecution. A terrific amount of juggling priorities and concerns was necessary to pull off a peaceful resolution of this crisis. Their conviction record on this case was solid, and will likely be the model from any similar situations in the future. 
   So, it gives me great pleasure to bring our attention to this team's success, and I add my thanks for a job well done. We wish them nothing but continued success as they move on to other jobs within their home agencies. Again, congratulations on this great, well-deserved honor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, I stood on the floor in recognition of General Chuck Krulak's retirement as Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Since then, I've attended the change of command ceremony at the Marine Barracks, and I must say, I was impressed with how General Krulak reminded us once again what makes Marines and the U.S. Marine Corps important. 
   I am equally impressed with the conduct of General James Jones, the new Commandant, and his recognition of the challenge he faces in following General Krulak's command. I wish him well and encourage him to continue the traditions maintained by his predecessor in dealing with Congress.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great Montanan  who is a man of extraordinary talents and accomplishments, one of the most notable being President of the Amateur Trapshooting Association. This Association is the largest clay target shooting organization in the world with more than 100,000 members. This year as President, he will preside over the Grand American 100th Anniversary trapshoot in Vandalia, Ohio from August 12-21, 1999. 
   This past week in Missoula, Montana, July 8 was designated Gene Clawson, Jr. Day by the Montana State Trapshooting Association to recognize his dedication and service to this sport. Gene's dedication started over 40 years ago when he began shooting with his father and brother. When Gene started, he dominated state junior competitions and earned All-American status. His dedication and love for the sport propelled him to win 10 state championships, a national doubles Class AA championship. He was selected to the Montana All-State Team thirty-one times and in 1995 he was inducted into the Montana State Trapshooting Association Hall of Fame. One of his more phenomenal accomplishments was shooting the amazing ``perfect'' doubles score of 100 for a total of sixteen times. 
   Gene's service to trapshooting also has been an unusual example of unfaltering support and leadership. Gene started out helping his father with the duties of secretary-treasurer of the Missoula Trap and Skeet Club. From there his involvement grew to include being on the club's board of directors, Montana's delegate to the Amateur Trapshooting Association, and the Western Zone Vice-President for the Association in which he presided over 13 western States and Canadian provinces. Now as the President of the Amateur Trapshooting Association, he deals with virtually all of the Association's business. In all his endeavors, he has gained the respect and admiration of many people as well as to inspiring others to participate in the this exciting sport. 
   In addition to being a master of his sport, he is also a successful businessman. He has been President of the family-owned business, Clawson Manufacturing, for over 30 years. When his father started the business in 1948, they concentrated on unfinished furniture and cut stock. Since then, Gene has moved the company into designing, producing, and selling windows and roof trusses worldwide. 
   Gene is also a dedicated family man. Ranging in ages from 12 to 79, the Clawsons are an amazing example of family tradition, devotion, support, and success. For several years, three generations of Clawsons have hunted elk, waterfowl, and upland birds together. Three of Gene's sons (Nick, Bill, and Brad) have followed in their father's footsteps in excelling at trapshooting competitions. Now his grandson has joined the firing line. In these days when guns are associated with destroying families, it is refreshing to see an example of how the shooting sports can bring a family closer together. 
   Mr. President, I recognize Mr. Gene Clawson, Jr. and congratulate him for his accomplishments as an amateur trapshooter, father, and businessman. I was him and his family the best and much success in their future endeavors. Please join with me in recognizing this great Montanan and outstanding American.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished Majority Leader and Senator STEVENS for working with me, Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, and Senator BREAUX on the passage of S. 376, the Open-Market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act, better known as ``ORBIT.'' 
   The passage of ORBIT by unanimous consent today clearly indicates the Senate's overwhelming support for the approach taken in ORBIT to reform our satellite communications laws. I look forward to working with my good friend in the other body, Chairman BLILEY, on getting this legislation enacted into law this year. 
   ORBIT is a truly bipartisan bill that updates the Satellite Communications Act of 1962, expands competition, and encourages new market entrants in satellite communications. It will help to secure the rapid and pro-competitive privatization of INTELSAT by a date certain of January 1, 2002. The bill provides new incentives for INTELSAT's privatization, while at the same time, carries tough consequences if INTELSAT fails to achieve this important objective. 
   The bill also brings needed reform to the U.S. signatory to INTELSAT, COMSAT, by removing its special  privileges and immunities. In addition, the bill eliminates outdated statutory restrictions on the ownership of COMSAT, which will allow COMSAT to function like a normal, private commercial company. 
   ORBIT will enhance competition in satellite communications, bringing far reaching and long-term benefits to consumers both here and abroad. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I especially 
   want to thank the staff. The staff of all parties was involved in this. There have been long hours and long days devoted to this particular issue. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring recognition to a special Montanan, Phil Petrik. Phil is a commercial pilot in Sidney, Montana. One afternoon, Phil overheard another pilot talking to someone at the Williston, North Dakota airport on the radio. Apparently, the pilot was above the clouds and could not find a hole to make it through to land. 
   The pilot stated that he would fly on to the Watford City airport and see if he could land there. Later in the day, Petrik once again heard the pilot calling the Eilliston airport, requesting information about landing. 
   Unfortunately, the conditions had not changed. Phil then contacted the Williston airport to inquire if there was someone there who could guide the pilot down. He was informed that there was not. Phil got into his own plane and flew to approximately where the plane in distress should be and he finally found him. The other pilot told Phil he had about 30 minutes of fuel left. Phil had the FAA clear the airspace and they started down through the clouds. The two planes were in the clouds for about 90 seconds. Petrik guided the other plane to the airport and returned home. 
   Upon his arrival in Sidney, Phil found out that the pilot had actually only one minute and 20 seconds of fuel left when he made it to the ground. Phil has already been recognized by the Federal Aviation Association for his valiant act of selflessness. His peers in Montana have all told me that this is an example of the type of man Mr. Petrik is. It is a great honor for me to share this story of valor and compassion. One man willing to risk his life for another. Please join me in offering congratulations and thanks to Phil Petrik.

   Mr. BURNS. Madam President, this weekend I traveled across my home State discussing the issues that are before us today, and also had the opportunity to travel into Canada to talk about agriculture, to try to solve some of the problems that face agricultural producers today. 
   What is happening here is a matter of fact. The hostages are those folks who depend on food stamps, those folks who depend on the WIC Program--young women with children and infants who depend on those nutritional programs. 
   What is happening is we are trying to do the business of the Nation, and that is funding the programs that Americans want. Yes, agriculture is in tough straits. We have seen in this past year commodity prices dip way below the prices they were during the Great Depression. Yet we expect our agriculture producers to produce. We expect our grocery stores to stay full. We expect to buy those foods in any amount, prepared in any way; to be handy--and they are. This Nation is truly a blessed nation in that we have producers like that. 
   While I realize the debate on health care is very important, let's not lose sight of the Nation's business. Let's not take our eye off the ball. The Nation's business, first and foremost, is to pass the appropriations bills to fund those Departments and those programs that depend on those bills, and then debate health care or Medicare reform. Nobody on either side of the aisle underestimates the importance of that debate. But the business of the Government is to finance and provide funds for programs so this Nation can operate. That is what is being held hostage. 
   Madam President, 23 percent of the gross national product depends on agriculture. No other part of the American economy contributes so much to our gross national product. Yet here we stand, talking about an amendment to an agriculture bill that is strong enough to be debated as a stand-alone piece of legislation. 
   I talk to my farmers in Montana. They want the agriculture appropriations bill passed. In this bill there is research money. In this bill there is money needed to open up export markets, to let agriculture producers take advantage of added value to their own products. It allows them to find niche markets. It allows them to live. 
   The health care bill has nothing to do with agriculture--nothing. You cannot claim germaneness. You cannot claim anything. I think the health care issue deserves a stand-alone debate, but it should not block the financing of Government programs. That is too important. The lives of too many producers are on the line, as are their farms and their ranches. 
   We hear complaints all the time about legislation on appropriations bills. 
   In the majority of these cases, the amendments at least have some relationship or some germaneness to the issue at hand. But what significant relationship does a Patients' Bill of Rights have to agricultural production? We should pass the appropriations bills, get them into conference, send them down to the President, and let him sign them. There is ample time left to debate health care in the United States. 
   My farmers and ranchers are a little bit baffled. They do not have a clue as to what is really happening. I say that somewhat in jest because the majority of them do know what is happening. They are being held hostage. How do I explain to them that the money allocated to programs important to them is being held up entirely for a debate on an issue which should be a stand-alone issue? 
   Let's pass these appropriations bills. Let's get them out of the way. Let's assure the American people we can do the Nation's business. Let's assure the American farm and ranch people their programs will be passed and financed. Let's tell those who depend on food stamps their money is going to be there. Let's tell the elderly people who depend on Meals on Wheels it is going to be there. Let's tell the young mothers with infants and children who depend on nutritional programs the money will be there. 
   There is no sickness in the world worse than starvation. Do you want to drive health care costs higher? Then disregard the nutritional programs found in this agricultural appropriations bill. Whom are we hurting? Those who can afford it least. Let's get back on track. My farmers and ranchers are tired of waiting and so are the folks who depend on these programs. 
   I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to stand with Senator LOTT today, our majority leader, in honor of the coming change of command of the U.S. Marine Corps and the Commandant and the retirement of Gen. Charles C. Krulak. 
   We all share one thing, and I think the leader missed one thing the General stands for. It is written out there on the Iwo Jima Memorial. Uncommon valor was a common virtue. Every marine carries that and semper fi. As a former enlisted marine, there is no other comparable military fraternity. In fact, I credit the Marines Corps for saving my life. I remember as a young man I was sort of adrift. The Marine Corps has the habit of setting a person straight. 
   I share the kindred spirit that is fundamentally the heart and the soul of the Corps. It has been my pleasure to work with General Krulak in my duties as chairman of the Senate Military Construction Appropriations Committee since he assumed his duties as the 31st Commandant in 1995. 
   His military career extended back almost 40 years to his entry in the U.S. Naval Academy. He graduated in 1964 and went on to The Basic School in Quantico, VA. He continued to distinguish himself in command positions  too numerous to count, including two tours in Vietnam. During the gulf war, General Krulak commanded the 2nd Force Service Support Group for the Atlantic Fleet Marine Forces. If you read through his commendation list, it seems he earned almost every award and decoration possible, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, a Silver Star, Bronze Star, two Gold Stars, and a Purple Heart, just to make a few. 
   I think it goes to show every American how appropriate it was for General Krulak to be nominated for the Commandant's office. He told me the other day that when he leaves the Marines Corps this will be the first time a Krulak has not been in a marine uniform for over 80 years. What a great tradition. He knows the marines. He was raised in the society. He stood up for them and their fundamental beliefs. 
   In his farewell to the Corps in the June edition of Leatherneck Magazine, General Krulak reminds us of two simple qualities that define all marines. First is the Touchstone of Valor. When marines are called to battle, they suit up and go, and they fight. Winning is mandatory; losing is not an option. This has been true from the earliest days of the Revolutionary War through modern-day battles. The battle list is long and distinguished: Iwo Jima, Inchon, Danang, Kuwait, and now Kosovo. The Commandant reminds us that ``the memory of the marines who fought in these battles lives in us and in the core values of our precious Corps.'' 
   The second quality is the Touchstone of Values. Marines have always held themselves to the highest standards. Words like ``honor,'' ``courage,'' and ``commitment'' are convictions that are embedded within the recruitment and training of all marines. Semper Fidelis is not just a Marine Corps motto; it is a heartfelt passion. 
   When you hear General Krulak's statement, you understand why the name U.S. Marine brings confidence to America's allies and general respect from all of our potential enemies. He was a leader by example and he will continue to be a leader by example. He stood as an anchor on the Joint Chiefs, paving the way for Congress to make some progress in military readiness. He is widely known for his openness, his honesty, and his cruel truth. 
   The general has the toughness of the Corps, but he has a sensitive side also, which is the quality of a leader. 
   I have a shirttail cousin who served in the Marine Corps and was wounded in Vietnam. Last summer, Cpl. Dan Critten and his wife visited this town and attended a dinner and we were honored to have General Krulak attend. Danny is confined to a wheelchair because of his injury sustained in Vietnam. He was at Danang. As it turned out, General Krulak was just a hill away that very day. Dan came home back to Missouri in a wheelchair, and he went right back to farming. He fixed up his tractor. He had all the hydraulic lifts and he could chase his cattle and do his farming. He never whimpered once. He, too earned the Bronze Star and has lived a life that is truly the model of an American and a marine that we all know and notice. 
   I remember that meeting when we went to that dinner, when the general met the corporal that evening. It was a special moment in the human experience. There was no rank, just a special feeling of two warriors who faced and survived the horrors of war. I will never forget that moment. It reminded me why this Nation, this United States, will lead the world and why the Corps is respected wherever it is assigned. It has dedicated men and women who have a sense of duty, the willingness to win but also a quality of heart. 
   Every change of command brings happiness and sadness. There is satisfaction and appreciation for a job well done, and there is mourning for departing the fellowship of the Corps. The good news is there is no such thing as an ex-marine. I am convinced that General Krulak will be as effective in his future position as he was a marine. 
   On behalf of United States, I say thank you, General, for your incredible service and your dedication to your country. We owe you and all marines a debt that can never be repaid. You have lived honorably in extraordinary circumstances and have left the Corps stronger and more capable in your wake. We say, Semper Fi. 
   Now we welcome a new Commandant, another marine who has stood the test on the field of battle and among his peers. I have no doubt about the future of this Nation's U.S. Marine Corps. The tradition continues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today with mixed feelings. On one hand I desperately want to do everything possible to help out America's oil patch. My state has lost thousands of jobs over the last decade and our small independent oil and gas producers are being forced out of the business. Our oil towns are now ghost towns and oil development plans for Montana are far and few between. I would love nothing more than to find a way to help out this vital segment of Montana's economy. 
   Unfortunately, I do not believe that the piece of legislation is the best course of action. With all due respect to my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, I cannot support any legislation that dips us deeper into the Social Security fund. We have made a stand. We will not continue to dip into this fund and put a further cramp on a system already strained to its breaking point. One step here, another there, and the next thing you know the pledge is gone, and along with it a promise I have made to my fellow Montanans. 
   It is a hard, hard decision, but I know that Montanans will support me. I have already heard from many of them on this vote. I have called some of my independent producers and asked them if this is the course of action they need us to take right now. Some of them originally supported the program, but more often than not I heard an answer that made me even more proud to know these men and women. They told me that they don't want a handout, and this legislation doesn't address the heart of the problem. The problem in oil country is pretty simple. The federal government is running us off the land and ensuring we can't make a profit. 
   If you want to help the true independents out there, the Montana businesses, and the other producers who live in the communities, then you better look at royalty relief and streamlining the process to keep our marginal wells in production. You need to let us get to the oil and gas, and you need to be there working with producers, not against them. The Bureau of Land Management, the Department of the Interior, and the United States Forest Service need to change. We don't need to set up a loaning bureaucracy to place more restrictions on our producers and rope them into more capital investment in a market of uncertainty. 
   Passing this legislation without addressing the heart of the problem is the same as increasing someone's credit limit because they are on the edge of bankruptcy. You have to address the problems of price and access versus production cost, you can't just give them more lead rope and hope the market rebounds to allow them to repay their loans. 
   Additionally, the legislation before us says you are only eligible for loans under this proposal if credit is not otherwise available, and you can ensure repayment. Well, that sounds like we are talking out of both sides of our mouths. To make matters worse, the legislation dictates that you have to let the General Accounting Office take a full look at your company's records. Not many Montanans that I know want the federal government having full access to their books as a bargaining chip in their effort to get a loan. The other big problem is that the Guarantee Board is made up of appointees of the Clinton-Gore Administration. I believe the real problems facing our producers are political. Would this legislation only make this problem worse? The administration has a known political agenda that is attempting to move all economic activity off our public lands. They are locking it up piece by piece. Will this agenda infect the decision process as to who gets loans? A lot of our interest is on public land and I don't want to have to face the possibility that some of my producers would be discriminated against because they operate on public land. 
   I know that my colleagues who support this measure mean well, and they are looking for a way to respond to the pain in the oil patch as quickly as possible, but this is not the way to do it. We need to rally behind a consensus bill that gives tax relief and helps lower the cost of production. We need to stand firm on royalty rates, and we need to continue pushing our Cabinet agencies to stop running our producers off the land. We can extract oil and gas responsibly, and our nation depends on it. Unfortunately, the agenda of the current administration is blinded by politics and is set on completely ignoring the reality of what is good both for the West, and for the security of our nation. 
   No matter what the outcome of the vote today, I hope it does not distract us from working together to find a real solution. If the legislation passes, I don't want to hear that we have fixed the problem. If it fails, I hope those of us who understand the problems facing our oil and gas producers can come together and work towards passing legislation that goes to the core of the problem.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will have to ask some of the staff but I think Mr. MCCAIN will not be present to make his statement this morning. I will make mine, and then we will work that out later. 
   I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction appropriations bill and report for fiscal year 2000. The bill reflects a bipartisan approach that the ranking member, Senator MURRAY of the State of Washington, and I have tried to maintain regarding military construction and this subcommittee. 
   This isn't the first year we have put this bill together. We are getting to be old hands at it. But I want to say personally it is a pleasure to work with the Senator and her staff. It seems as if we have a lot of luck in working out some of the problems some people would run into before we ever get the bill to the floor. So those problems are taken care of. I appreciate the attitude and manner in which we have worked together on this bill. 
   This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on June 10 by a unanimous vote of 28 to nothing. The bill recommended by the full Committee on Appropriations is $8,273,820,000. 
   The administration submitted the fiscal year 2000 military construction budget with all of the military construction and family housing projects incrementally funded over a 2-year period. We are finding that some of that is working and some of it is not, and we will probably be looking at this in a different light in another year. 
   To have proceeded in this manner would have demonstrated a poor financial stewardship on the part of the Senate and placed the Department's 2000 military construction program in great jeopardy. That is the reason we are taking a look at it. The subcommittee rejected that recommendation and provided full funding for all of the construction projects. 
   Accordingly, the bill is $2.8 billion over the budget request, but the bill is  still $176 million less than what was appropriated just a year ago. However, more important, the legislation reflects a reduction of $1.7 billion from just 3 years ago. 
   We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate. We believe it addresses key military construction requirements for readiness, family housing, barracks, quality of life, and of course we do not want to forget our Guard and our Reserve components. 
   This bill honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It helps ensure that the housing and infrastructure needs of the military are given proper recognition. 
   Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within the committee's 302(b) budget allocations for both budget authority and outlays. 
   This bill has some points I want to mention. We have added $485 million above the budget request to provide better and more modern family housing for our service personnel and their families. 
   Just less than a month ago, we opened a new housing unit at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. I said at that time, and I still mean it, there is no better way to send a strong message to our fighting men and women than to provide them with good housing in a good atmosphere and the greatest way we can say we care. 
   On another quality of life measure, we added substantially to the budget request for barracks construction projects, some $587 million for 47 projects throughout the United States and overseas. 
   I say right now to the American people, we have American troops deployed in over 70 countries around the world. 
   This funding will provide single service members a more favorable living environment wherever they are stationed. 
   The committee also fully funds the budget request of $245 million for funding 25 environmental compliance projects. 
   We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plague our reserve components. 
   I continue to be greatly alarmed that the Department of Defense takes no responsibility for ensuring that our reserve components have adequate facilities. 
   Their lack of disregard for the total force concept very much concerns me and a number of our colleagues. 
   This comes at a time when our country is so heavily dependent on the Guard and Reserve to maintain our presence around the world. 
   For example, the President's budget requested funding of only $77 million for all of the Reserve components and the National Guard. 
   Recognizing this chronic shortfall, we have again lent support by adding $560 million to these accounts. 
   In each case, the funds will help satisfy essential mission, quality of life or readiness requirements. 
   We fully funded the budget request for the base realignment and closure account by providing $706 million to continue the ongoing brac process. 
   All of the projects that we have recommended were thoroughly screened to ensure that they meet a series of defensible criteria and that they were authorized in the defense authorization bill. 
   We will work very closely with the Senate Armed Services Committee, as we put together a conference package for military construction. 
   There are many other issues that I could speak about at this time. I urge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and move it forward expeditiously. 
   I yield the floor for the ranking member.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud sponsor of this pesticide harmonization legislation. As many of you are aware, there are a number of trade imbalances facing the agricultural industry. 
   In my home State of Montana and many other western and mid-western states, trade imbalances occur primarily between Canada and the United States. However, disparities occur between the United States and many foreign countries. 
   One of those trade imbalances is pesticide harmonization, which is a serious issue for American farmers. There are numerous disparities between chemicals and pesticides that are allowed in foreign countries and those that are allowed here in the United States. 
   In many cases a chemical will have the identical chemical structure in both countries but be named and priced differently. Why should an American producer be expected to pay twice the amount for an identical chemical available in a foreign country for less? 
   In order for free trade to truly occur, this issue must be addressed. Farmers have dealt with several years of depressed prices with no immediate end in sight. To compound the economic crunch American farmers are feeling, American agricultural producers must pay nearly twice the amount that foreign producers pay in their country for nearly the same chemical. 
   This leads to a huge disparity between the break-even price on crop production between foreign and American farmers, and gives foreign producers an unfair advantage. It is unfair for American producers to pay twice the amount for pesticides and chemicals as many of our trading partners. 
   Furthermore, it is against the law for American producers to purchase an identical chemical in a foreign country and bring it across the border. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must be held accountable to American producers and assure that producers have the same advantages in this country in regards to pesticides and chemicals that foreign producers enjoy. 
   My bill assures that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will be held accountable to domestic agricultural producers. Primarily, it mandates that the EPA give mutual recognition to the same chemical structures, on both existing and new products, in the United States and competing foreign countries. 
   It does this by several provisions. First, it permits any agricultural individual or group, within a state, to put forth a request through the State Ag Commissioner (Head of the Department of Agriculture) to the EPA to register chemicals with substantially similar make-up to those registered in a foreign country. 
   Within 60 days of receiving that request the EPA would be held responsible to either accept or deny that request. They must then give the same recognition to American producers for chemical structures that are substantially similar to cheaper products available in competing foreign countries. 
   Additionally, my bill will ensure that the Administrator of the EPA will take into account both NAFTA and the Canada/U.S. Trade Agreement, in making these determinations. 
   These provisions will level the pricing structure by making sure that chemicals with the same (or substantially similar) structures are priced fairly in the United States. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue to American farmers and ranchers. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to highlight the hypocrisy that I have heard during this debate on S. 96, the Y2K legislation admirably led by my friend, Senator JOHN MCCAIN. I have heard a number of Senators up here saying they would not do anything to hurt the high-tech industry. Those same Senators then turn around and offer an amendment or voice their support for an amendment that no one in the high-tech industry supports, but there is one group who supports their amendments, the American Trial Lawyers. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, I work with leaders from the high-tech industry on a daily basis. I sit back in amazement when I watch the economic success of our nation, which is largely driven by the high-tech industry. In fact, yesterday, June 14, Alan Greenspan testified in front of Chairman MACK's Joint Economic Committee and placed strong emphasis on the fact that the high-tech industry is driving our current economic boom. It is creating an economy like we have never seen before. I am working toward the goal of bringing high-tech jobs to Montana, my home state. I believe in my heart that the day will come when the high-tech economy delivers more good paying jobs to my fellow Montanans. I do not want anything to get in the way of this possibility. Let me give you a few amazing statistics that outline the success and tremendous growth opportunities in this industry. In 1998, there was anywhere from $32 billion to $50 billion in electronic commerce done worldwide depending on which research firm you listen to. The Gartner Group projects that in 2003 there will be $3.2 trillion in electronic commerce done worldwide. Think about that, $32 billion in 1998 and over $3.2 trillion in 2003 or 100 times as much electronic commerce in five years. Friends, we have never seen growth like this in an economic sector in American history. Further, in 2010, 20 percent of worldwide commerce will be done online. I ask myself, ``What can the Government do to make sure these numbers become a reality?'' 
   We need to stay out of the way. What can the Government do that could stop this unprecedented growth? I can tell you what we could do to stop the growth of the industry, we could listen to our colleagues who are up here carrying the water of the trial lawyers. 
   Let me show you exactly why the American trial lawyers do not want to see this legislation pass. The Gartner Group estimates that the cost of dealing with the Y2K bug worldwide will run in excess of $600 billion. Yet, we continuously hear that class action lawsuits and other suits are being filed or are being written for later filing that may reach past the $1 trillion mark. Do you know any industry in the world that is so resilient that it can easily take a $1 trillion hit without being slowed down in its growth? I don't. As a matter of fact, as big as the Y2K problem is, the biggest problem our high-tech industry faces is from the trial lawyers. We cannot stand by and let this happen. 
   I want the American people to see why many Senators are carrying Amendments that are supported by the American trial lawyers. In the 1998 election cycle, nearly 90 percent of the roughly $2.4 million given to federal candidates by the American Trial Lawyers Association was given to Democrats. Every single one of the Amendments offered here on the Senate floor that the American Trial Lawyers Association backed has been offered by Democrats. It is not hard to see the correlation and draw conclusions. President Clinton has threatened to veto S. 96 if passed in its current form. Sure enough, if you look back to his election in 1996, you find that over 90 percent of the money given by the American Trial Lawyers Association was given to President Clinton over former Majority Leader Bob Dole. 
   The Democrats stand on the Senate floor and say that their proposed amendments to S. 96 are proconsumer. I am here to highlight the hypocrisy in that statement. Is it proconsumer to slow the growth of our Nation's economy because of frivolous legislation? What the amendments do and President Clinton's threatened veto stand to do are to slow one of the most outstanding eras of economic growth this country has ever seen. And they say this is proconsumer? As voices for the people, we are elected to do what is best for the citizens of America. The high tech industry, which is carrying us into an unprecedented era of economic strength, wants to see this bill passed so that the $1 trillion plus in threatened lawsuits by the American trial lawyers never become a reality. 
   The Democrats are again threatening to play politics with a matter of grave danger and utmost importance to the American economy. I want to say to my colleagues, stand firm. Push this bill through unchanged, and send it to President Clinton. 
   The growth of the high-tech industry is absolutely critical to the continued growth of our Nation's economy. Make President Clinton tell the American people that he would rather see the trial lawyers have their day and pay rather than see one of the most exciting industries in American history continue its rise to the top of our Nation's economy. Do not let the American trial lawyers dictate our economy, stand in support of Senator MCCAIN's bill, S. 96.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today to discuss my grave concern regarding the Section 201 petition brought forward by America's domestic lamb industry. This case has been sitting on President Clinton's desk for more than 2 months. He has had more than ample time to make a decision. Furthermore, the decision was slated for June 5. For 10 days, America's sheep producers have been waiting, wondering what is going to happen to their livelihood. 
   On February 9, 1999, the International Trade Commission voted unanimously that lamb imports are a threat to our industry. On March 26, the sheep industry scored another victory with the decision by the International Trade Commission to support 4 years of market stability. Several remedies have been offered, including tariff rate quotas and ad-valorem tariffs. Now a decision by President Clinton to approve, deny, or modify those remedies has been expected since June 5. 
   This administration has virtually ignored the request by America's sheep producers to solve the issue of excessive imports. While these producers are suffering, the President continues to deal with any and all other issues but this important agriculture case. While I understand that Kosovo and other world issues require much time and consideration, domestic policy cannot stand still during international situations. 
   The agricultural producers of this country that provide food and fiber for the rest of the Nation, warrant more time and attention than this administration has paid them. I feel as though the crisis facing the sheep producers of this country is receiving about the same consideration from this administration as agriculture received 5 months ago in the State of the Union Address. Agriculture received a mere thirty seconds during that address and is receiving even less time in this important case. 
   The domestic lamb industry has every reason to believe their market has been substantially undercut by these countries. Imports now make up nearly one-third of the domestic market, and comparisons of imported and domestic lamb meat have found that imports undercut domestic products nearly 80 percent of the time. Between 1993 and 1997 imports increased 47 percent. The problems of imports are very real and have had a substantial impact on sheep producers. 
   Furthermore, the domestic industry has followed the legal process for trade action that is available to all industries under our trade agreements. The unanimous ruling of the ITC during the injury phase of this 201 case, followed by the entire Commission's recommendation to impose trade relief, clearly shows U.S. sheep producers have a viable case. 
   I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in urging the president to make an extremely timely decision in support of the section 201 petition and the recommendations made by the domestic sheep industry for strong and effective trade relief.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of legislation that is extremely important to a small town in north central Montana. Landusky is a small agriculture community just south of the Fort Belknap Reservation and just north of the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Unfortunately, an oversight which may seem small in the eyes of those used to the hustle and bustle of Washington D.C. places the Landusky school district in a difficult position. 
   The legislation I am introducing today corrects this oversight by conveying the surface and mineral estates of two lots the school has occupied for a number of decades. The legislation is strongly supported by the town of Landusky and the Bureau of Land Management. It is imperative that we move quickly on this legislation. I would like nothing more than to have the students of Landusky return to school this fall with the knowledge that the problems facing a small town in Montana are worthy of our attention and we were willing to move forward and ensure that their school's future is as bright as their own.

The Montana chapter of the American Association of University Women sponsors an annual essay contests for students in grades 11 and 12. The topic of the essays was ``Women in Montana History.'' 
   Courtenay Burt, an Eleventh Grader at Bigfork High School, had her essay chosen as the best of all submitted in Montana. She writes about her grandmother, a woman of integrity and wisdom who died when Courtenay was only eight months old. Her essay tells us the story of a woman who grew up during the Great Depression, survived the often harsh climate of Montana, raised a family, earned the respect of her community, and maintained a healthy sense of humor throughout it all.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to alert my colleagues to what may be a very disturbing precedent. My office recently received a copy of a letter dated May 18 and sent from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to the Department of Health and Human Services. I want to read the first paragraph:  
   I am writing to request documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq., involving all correspondence, inquiries and other information requested by or provided to the following United States Senators for the time periods noted.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in this letter, the DSCC is making a broad request under the Freedom of Information Act regarding any information sent from my office to HHS or received from the Department. But it just doesn't include me. I have already said that. It includes a lot of Senators--10 of them, in fact, all Republicans, all up for reelection this year. 
   The Freedom of Information Act request covers, ``all correspondence, inquiries and other information requested by or provided to'' my office over the past 10 years in the Senate, including ``all direct correspondence between the Senators or members of their staff and the HHS, including letters, written material, reports, constituent requests [very important] and other relevant materials.'' In other words, they want access to our casework. 
   I have written to President Clinton demanding that he put an immediate stop to this or any similar action. What we are witnessing here is an unprecedented attempt to corrupt the nonpolitical casework system of Senate offices for political gain. I find these efforts repugnant, and if there are any Americans alive who think politics can't sink any lower, they need to look no further than right here. 
   Through the letter to the HHS, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wants more than just to peer into private correspondence of political enemies; it wants to leer into the private lives of those who contact their Senator seeking help with Federal agencies. I have made tens of thousands of contacts on behalf of Montanans who asked me to help them with problems they are having with the Federal Government. 
   These are problems which, if publicly revealed, could possibly ruin their lives. Many of these people are at the end of their emotional rope. Some of them are at the end of their financial world. 
   It is beyond belief that the DSCC would consider ruining the lives of ordinary Americans to be all in a day's work in order to defeat this old Senator. This effort would put a permanent chill on the ability of Senators to help constituents in need. It saddens me to think that those who view a Senator's help as their last resort may now believe they have nowhere to turn. 
   Just today, my office received a letter from a man in Billings, MT, whose wife we helped to receive treatment for breast cancer. As a Federal employee, she was having a hard time receiving the treatment. And she was entitled to it. After she asked for our assistance, we were able to resolve the matter for her and she got the care she needed. When her cancer spread, the Federal bureaucracy told her she couldn't get the care she needed close to home. 
   Quoting his letter to me:  
   After becoming totally frustrated with the whole process, we just gave up. But this time we decided to fight the issue again. I turned to the Senator's office again to enlist his help. And again in what seemed to be a flash of light, the situation has been resolved.  
   Our office again stepped in. We cut the redtape. We helped her receive the additional radiation therapy while staying at her home in Billings. 
   These are the people who depend on our help--real people whose lives are literally on the line. But the man who sent me the letter specifically asked that his name not be used in order to protect his privacy and, yes, that of his wife. 
   Is it right that he should be subject to a Freedom of Information request, that some bureaucrat somewhere could decide on a whim to release this personal, sensitive information? It is hard to comprehend that the DSCC would use the time and the resources of the administration for political purposes in such a massive research effort, regardless of who ultimately pays. 
   This effort is as constitutionally breathtaking as it is politically suspect. All those who value their civil rights should be outraged at this attempt to invade the privacy of countless unwary citizens. If indeed Federal law permits it, it is an absolute shame. It is enough to make me wonder whether Americans should now expect politicians to use any means to achieve their ends--laws, morals, and ethics be damned. 
   Our President has said he deplores the politics of personal destruction. However, in this case we are not talking about the destruction of one political opponent, but the lives of innocent Americans. And I am sickened by it. I ask the President and all Americans to stand up against this kind of invasion of privacy, all in the name of gaining an electoral advantage. 
   My political opponents are welcome to engage me anytime, anywhere, on my record, which I am proud to stand on. But when you try to drag the lives of innocent Montanans into your ugly schemes, I will fight with every breath in my body. It is a sad day. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the Senate proceeds with its debate on the Defense Appropriations Bill, it is appropriate that we pause and recognize the contribution of a Defense Procurement Official on the occasion of his retirement. Colonel William Alexander--Alex to his friends--is retiring this month after an Air Force career spanning almost 30 years. Alex has spent much of his career leading and mentoring Defense Acquisition Professionals, leaving as his legacy a new generation of experienced procurement managers. 
   Born in the baby boom era between WWII and the Korean War, Alex grew up in Indiana, where he attended DePauw and Indiana Universities. After completing his Masters Degree in 1970, he entered the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Some of his early projects started the development for today's generation of precision guided weapons. It was a whole lot trickier then, without the advantage of the Global Positioning System, but his team worked to develop a way to triangulate a target designation to improve bomb targeting reliability. 
   The Air Force recognized the contributions of this young officer and moved him into a career in procurement and satellite operations. Alex spent the next 20 years of his career moving between different aspects of the complex world of keeping satellites operating successfully on orbit. He was a procurement official in a number of software source selections, using his abilities to aid the Air Force in getting revolutionary operating software for its expanding fleet of satellites. After his work in operations, the Air Force wisely transferred him into the National Reconnaissance Office as the Director of the Acquisition and Engineering Group within the Communications System Acquisition and Operations Directorate. When the Deputy Director of the Communications Directorate was reassigned, Alex was selected for this position in light of his vast experience in successful acquisitions. 
   However, I don't want to spend too much time discussing the technical details of Colonel Alexander's career. There are many successful procurement officials within the Air Force and the Department of Defense, but few are as widely recognized for their crafting of personnel in addition to their acquisition expertise. Although the project was always treated with importance, Alex always made sure that his people came first. He was always looking to find ways to challenge his staff to grow both in technical ability and in interpersonal relationships. His success gives credence to the philosophy of empowering and caring for your people, which ultimately leads to the program success. One night during his time in satellite operations, a satellite was having difficulties getting initialized. Scores of people were working around the clock trying to work through the complex issues involved. Recognizing that people do not perform at their best when they are exhausted, Colonel Alexander banished a number of people from the operations floor until they had a rest period. The engineers returned to the floor with clearer heads and ultimately were able to get the satellite up and running successfully on orbit.  
   When there was a tragic death of an employee on official travel, Alex temporarily set aside his own grief to assist others in the office in addition to the employee's family. In the confusion that surrounded the funeral, Alex took time to meet with all of the family members to try to help them understand the events that had taken place. It was a difficult time for all involved, but Alex clearly demonstrated his caring for his co-workers and should be commended for his actions. 
   One area where Colonel Alexander should be especially proud is in his initiatives for acquisition reform. Alex was always driving to improve all aspects of buying satellites and software, looking for new and innovative ways to execute the program. At his encouragement, one division has studied purchasing satellites on-orbit, which would be a first for the NRO. He has been an advocate for openness and revolutionary thinking, balancing trusted methods with new ideas. Under his leadership, a security rebaselining was started which resulted in his program appearing on CBS' Eye on America. His drive in this area has literally saved the federal government millions of dollars. 
   Finally, I want to thank Colonel Alexander for one final initiative. After being nominated for a Congressional Fellowship by Colonel Alexander, a member of his staff has joined my staff for the legislative year. This staff member has been of great assistance already in the Defense bills that have gone to the floor, and I look forward to his continuing contribution through the rest of the Senate's session. 
   I'm sure that there are still many details for Colonel Alexander to work out as he transitions to a ``former'' military life. I wish him the best in his endeavors and pass along a sincere thank you on behalf of Congress for passing along his life's philosophy to the generation that will follow in his procurement footsteps. The legacy left behind is greater than mere relics of satellites and software, which will age and be disregarded. Colonel Alexander's heritage is in a corps of people who now have a greater understanding of the balances and pressures in life and a toolkit with how to deal with them. This is a true success, and one that I hope will be a sustained source of pride throughout his retirement.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to everyone's attention the issue of lamb imports. These imports are being sold well below the price of identical domestic products and have created a slow motion, chain reaction collapse of the lamb market that continues through this day. 
   This nation's lamb industry suffers not only from the unprecedented surge of imports that have flooded the domestic marketplace. It suffers not only from the skyrocketing, record-setting levels that now dominate one-third of all lamb consumed in the United States. 
   This industry also suffers from severe and consistent price undercutting by importers. 
   Evidence of the price disparity can be found in the report prepared by the U.S. International Trade Commission. The Commission made dozens of product-to-product comparisons. In 8 out of 10 comparisons, the Commission found imports undercutting domestic products by margins of 20 percent to 40 percent. 
   Other comparisons have found disparities reaching as high as 70 percent. This gulf is directly related to global economic conditions. In Asia, the widespread economic crash left traditional buyers unable to pay for new shipments of lamb meat from Australia and New Zealand--those products had to go somewhere. 
   It couldn't go to the European market. The European Union has absolute quotas in place to govern the amount of lamb imports into that market. 
   Instead, it came here, to the United States market. It came to a market that stands open and unprotected. To a market where the government has done nothing, absolutely nothing, to protect its own domestic industries from devastating surges of imports. 
   That surge began what amounts to a slow-motion crash of the domestic lamb market in the fall on 1997. Packers and processors with lamb to sell suddenly lost account after account to the cheaper imports. Losing money by the day, they had none to pay to their own suppliers and the lamb feeder level. 
   And so it went, with domestic producers hoping the surge would slow of its own accord. Hoping the importers would realize the devastation they'd wrought. Hoping they could stay in business long enough to finish upgrading equipment, or solidifying alliances--to become more competitive. 
   But the onslaught from imports was relentless. From the processors and packers to the feeders, the domestic market crash now reaches all the way to farms and ranches that have stood for generations--an entire industry teeters on the edge of financial ruin. 
   Last fall, some producers with sheep to sell couldn't find a single buyer. For the second Easter/Passover season in a row, the market's traditional high point and the largest holiday marketing period of the year--live lambs were selling in the 60-cent per pound range. Few producers in the country can remain in business at those prices. 
   Let me add my voice to those urging the President to fashion strong, effective import relief for the U.S. lamb industry. This relief must do two things, curb this unprecedented surge of imports and level the playing field.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today an award ceremony for one of the nation's best and brightest short line railroads, was held to honor Montana Rail Link's safety record. Montana Rail Link, commonly referred to as MRL, offers essential and competitive freight service to a large number of customers along Montana's Southern rail line from Billings to Sandpoint, Idaho. 
   MRL was honored today by being awarded the E.H. Hariman Memorial award. This award is specifically designated to recognize railroad safety improvement. Working on the railroad is not like having a desk job. It's not a job for the timid--it's a job where hard work and plenty of sweat are part of everyday tasks. 
   Each year, it is tragically inevitable that railroad employees are involved in accidents which can result in serious injury or even death. With the reception of this award, it is very apparent that MRL places a significant value on the safety of their employees. As a Montanan, I am relieved to see that a Montana railroad is the recipient of this award. Montana railroads have a long and colorful history in the establishment of our state. And I have friends that work on the railroad. 
   Montanans are very dependent on this rail transportation. We are dependent on this competitive alternative. As many are aware, I have introduced legislation that will help to assure the nation's shippers of competitive rail access. It is my intent to not only create free-market competition in the rail industry, I would also like to improve service of the nation's Class 1 railroads. 
   I've heard from many Montanans about the importance of rail car availability and affordability. The nation's rail system is dominated by four large behemoths of railroads. In Montana, those railroads are the target of much criticism based on their pricing and contractual practices. 
   It is the short lines that help to balance out the public's perception of railroads. In Montana, MRL has been hailed as a very reliable transportation alternative. MRL has also been hailed with this award today. 
   You've all heard me make a reference to Montana's vast distances--from corner to corner, the distance from Alzaka to Yaak, Montana is equivalent to the distance from Washington, D.C. to Chicago, Illinois. I'm sure my colleagues will agree with me, especially when you consider the variance in terrain we are faced with in our state. Pulling a train over multiple mountain passes in the dead of winter can be a daunting task. 
   In Montana, we value good, honest, quality service. MRL is very much an example of what is best about Montana.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I hope that Americans will look upon this debate. I think it is indicative of how hard and how difficult it is to deal with this issue. One cannot paint with a broad brush, whether we are talking about firearms or entertainment programming or games, or anything else. We cannot paint with a broad brush.  
   We are under the heels of tragedies such as Littleton, CO. We are very quick to blame. We are also reluctant to admit our own shortcomings in assuming our responsibilities as citizens, as parents, as schoolteachers, and as members of a community. 
   This particular amendment pretty much says, let no good deed go unpunished. It is too broad. We may table this amendment, and it should be tabled. But I hope that those who are in the business of entertainment and providing programming in its many forms, I hope this message gets to downtown Burbank and Hollywood and Vine. 
   This basically, if you look at the amendment, is pretty much a lawyer's amendment. It says:  
   We shall define the term ``hours'' when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience, and the term ``violent video programming.''  
   I will tell you that argument will go on for just a little more than a moon, because we know that long hours of television are experienced just after school when they first get home. Then ``prime time,'' we would have to define ``prime time'' as somewhere between 8 o'clock and midnight. 
   It also includes maybe the Internet. You could interpret this to say the Internet, because it says in this section the term:  
   ``Distribute'' means to send, transmit, retransmit, telecast, broadcast, or cablecast, including by wire, microwave or satellite.  
   You can also interpret that as the Internet. 
   We have never to this point put restrictions on the Internet. There may be a day coming when, if the ISPs and the programmers don't show some kind of responsibility, Government will. 
   It is almost unenforceable. In fact, it is unenforceable. I have never seen a section like this that says if any part of this amendment is found unconstitutional, then the remainder stays in. I think again that is pretty much full employment for our legal profession. 
   The amendment runs counter to the meaning that we had when we all sat down and worked out the V-chip. There were some of us who said the V-chip will probably not work unless we have responsible parents who are in charge of the television, basically. We were told at that time that the V-chip people were ready to go for it. 
   Do you know that the first television to have a V-chip in it--this was an agreement 2 years ago, back in July of 1997. Guess what. We have yet to see the first television set to have a V-chip in it--2 years later. That television won't be on the market until July of this year. 
   Let's give it a chance to work, as far as the V-chip is concerned. 
   I want to send a strong message to those who will provide entertainment. You should get the message right away. There are people looking, and there are people willing to take some steps, if they show no responsibility at all in programming to our young people. 
   I thank the Chair. I thank the floor leader for the time.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my voice in support of the juvenile justice bill currently before the Senate. This is an extensive, thoughtful approach to try to decrease the juvenile crime rate and to try to intervene in today's high-risk youth. 
   I stand before you to tell you that this is not only an urban problem. In our largest city, Billings, we have about 80,000 people, small by most States' standards. However, we also have gangs. Size and closeness of community doesn't innoculate us from the effects of our society. Even our tribal population is affected by juvenile crime. Youth on our reservations are being solicited for gang enrollment at increasingly earlier ages. From Billings to Fort Belknap, from Helena to Havre, from Gallatin to Glasgow to Great Falls, no area of the state is immune from the problem of juvenile delinquency. This bill finally tries to provide a focused approach to both reach today's youth and to prosecute violent criminals. 
   I would like to say that I agree and support all provisions of this bill. However, like most major legislation, there are some minor issues that cause me concern. But what we are really trying to do here is to intervene early in a youth's criminal career. By stopping the spree early, we prevent a lifetime of crime and create a contributing member of society. 
   Let me highlight why this bill is so drastically different from any previous juvenile justice legislation. First and foremost, this bill establishes a $450 million block grant program for state and local governments to establish youth violence programs. This almost doubles the FY 99 spending in equivalent programs. These funds can be used for record keeping, detention facilities, restitution programs, anti-truancy programs, gang intervention, crime training programs, and vocational training. In addition, it encourages the establishment of programs that will punish adults who knowingly use juveniles to help commit crimes. This is a key provision, since often adults will use kids in crime specifically because they are exempt from some of the stiffer penalties that apply to adults. 
   I have long been a proponent of enforcing existing laws. Right now, there is little additional penalty for repeat juvenile offenders. This law provides for graduated penalties to put some real teeth into law enforcement. There is also a juvenile version of the ``Brady bill,'' which prevents a person convicted of a violent felon of possessing a firearm. 
   Overall, this bill provides $1 billion specifically for juvenile crime programs. It covers everything from education to intervention. This comprehensive package will make significant strides in trying to keep our most precious commodity, our youth, out of harms way. I will be casting my vote in favor of this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing today, along with Senator INHOFE, the Schools and Libraries Internet Access Act of 1999. This bill addresses a timely and critical issue, that of the implementation of the schools and libraries program. Recently, new charges began appearing on people's telephone bills. These are the charges which providers are assessing to pay for the expansion of ``universal service'' in the form of the ``schools and libraries'' program. This bill is especially timely since Chairman Kennard announced last week that he's calling for a $1 billion annual increase in the e-rate program. That's an additional Billion in taxes that would be enacted without any review or commentary in Congress, and, most importantly, without a vote by our citizens' representatives. Congress needs to step to the plate and provide specific funding for this program that we all feel is important for rural and low-income regions. 
   I don't think anyone in the Senate ever thought that the limited language which we included in the 1996 Act would be used to create a massive new entitlement program through universal service. Universal service has historically meant the provision of telecommunications services to all Americans, regardless of geographical location. The FCC has expanded the definition of universal service to include broad-ranging social programs, which has caused the Commission's progress toward maintaining universal service to be delayed. While such goals as providing Internet access to schools and libraries may be laudable, they were never meant to be part of universal service as it has traditionally been known. Indeed, a huge additional burden has been placed on rural states like Montana in meeting these newfound definitions. 
   I want to make it clear, however, that I have always supported the goal of connecting all of our schools to the Internet, as well as the provision of advanced telecommunications services to rural health care centers. I just felt that it was wrong to fund these programs on the backs of American consumers. It is with this in mind that I have proposed using an outdated 3 percent excise tax on telephones to fund the schools and libraries and rural health care programs. Currently, none of the money collected by the tax goes to fund telephone service for Americans. 
   This tax was designed to fund World War I and was instituted in an era where telephones were a luxury. Well, World War I should be paid for by now and phones are certainly no longer a luxury item. The 3 percent tax was kept alive to provide revenue to offset the deficit. In today's climate of budgetary surplus, this justification no longer makes sense. My proposal calls for cutting the excise tax by two-thirds and using the remaining third to fund the schools and libraries program and the rural health care program. 
   This proposal is a win/win solution. It's a win for consumers, since it would eliminate the need for new charges on telephone service. It's a win for taxpayers, who would see billions of dollars in current taxes eliminated. It's a win for our schools, libraries and rural health care centers, who would see their programs fully funded without threatening universal service. With the support of the other members of Congress and the leadership of the Senate, I believe this proposal can solve the current crisis we face in funding the schools and libraries and rural health care programs. 
   The Schools and Libraries Internet Access Act of 1999 is an important effort to shape the future of online access. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to join my Senate colleagues in supporting the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) Benefit Improvement Act of 1999. This bill corrects a discrepancy between what Congress intended at the creation of this Act in 1972, and how it eventually got implemented. 
   I have always believed that the people most affected by military service are not the service members, it is the family. The spouses that raise kids on their own during a deployment. The sons and daughters that change schools in the middle of a school year because a parent got assigned to a new base. It's hard to make up for missed soccer games and scout meetings. The Senate has already passed legislation to try to improve some of these areas of quality of life, but S.4 was passed absent one item that I feel is very important, especially to our elderly military retirees living in Montana. 
   The uniformed services spousal benefit annuity provides 55 percent of retirement pay for a surviving military spouse, as long as the spouse is under age 62. Once the survivor reaches age 62, the benefit drops as low as 35 percent of retired pay. Let me put it on a more familiar level. If a Korean War-era Marine had signed up for this plan after his 20 years of military service, when he passed on, his wife would only get 35 percent of his eligible retirement pay, instead of the 55 percent she would have received if she was under age 62. No other federal retirement plan has this age-oriented cut. It was also intended for Congress to pay 40 percent of the benefit, and premiums for the plan were set up with that target in mind. Unfortunately, the actuaries were too pessimistic, and as a result, premiums now pay for 73 percent of the cost, with congress paying for 27 percent. This is a far cry from the 40 percent we originally intended. Other federal civilian survivor benefit plans pay up to a 50 percent subsidy with no reduction after age 62. 
   This bill corrects the problem by stepping up the federal share of military retirement to 45 percent by FY 2005. Given the sacrifices by our service men and women and their families, it's time we provided fair survivors benefits and fulfill our original Congressional intent. 
   I'm grateful to Senator THURMOND for introducing this legislation to correct this discrepancy and for letting me vocalize my support for this bill by including me as a co-sponsor. I'm confident that the Armed Services Subcommittee will give this a favorable review, and I look forward to supporting it when it comes to the floor. I encourage my colleagues to lend their support to this important provision as well.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, shared appreciation agreements have the potential to cause hundreds of farm foreclosures across the nation, and especially in my home state of Montana. Ten years ago, a large number of farmers signed these agreements. At that time they were under the impression that they would be required to pay these back at the end of ten years, at a reasonable rate of redemption. 
   However, that has not proved to be the case. The appraisals being conducted by the Farm Service Agency are showing increased values of ridiculous proportions. By all standards, one would expect the value to have decreased. Farm prices are the lowest they have been in years, and there does not seem to be a quick recovery forthcoming. Farmers cannot possibly be expected to pay back a value twice the amount they originally wrote down. Especially in light of the current market situation, I believe something must be done about the way these appraisals are conducted. 
   I am aware of one case in which the amount of the shared appreciation agreement was estimated at $167,500. The increased value was estimated at $335,000! When agricultural prices are at nearly an all-time low, farmers can barely keep up with their current payment schedules. They certainly cannot pay twice what they already owe. 
   USDA is attempting to fix the problem with proposed rules and regulations but farmers need help with these agreements now. I cannot stand idly by and wait for bureaucratic regulations to go through the ``process'' while farmers and ranchers are forced out of business. 
   The USDA has issued an emergency rule which will allow people who are unable to pay their shared appreciation agreement on time, to extend their current loan for up to three years. The interest rate on this extension will be at the government's cost of borrowing. Also, the USDA is allowing farmers to take out an additional loan at an interest rate of 9.25% to pay off the amount owed on the shared appreciation agreement. 
   There is also consideration being given to decreasing the number of years on shared appreciation agreements from ten to five. I appreciate the efforts by the USDA to alleviate the financial burden these shared appreciation agreements impose upon farmers, and hope that farmers are able to take advantage of them. 
   However, as I have stated, time is of the essence. Another proposed regulation, which will require a public comment period of 60 days, will exclude capital investments from the increase in appreciation. However, this proposal has not yet been published and is not expected to be for at least another month. After that, the comment period will further drag out the process and in the meantime more farmers will be forced into foreclosure. 
   To ensure this regulation on excluding capital investments from the increase in value is carried out, I intend to make it mandatory by legislation. Farmers should not be penalized for attempting to better their operations. Nor can they be expected to delay capital improvements so that they will not be penalized. 
   Additionally, my legislation will require the appraisal to be conducted by a certified appraiser from the state where the land is located. This will prevent out-of-state appraisal businesses from conducting appraisals in land areas they know nothing about. How can an appraisal company in Arizona be expected to do an accurate appraisal on land in Montana? It is not fair to the producers on that land to have their appraisal conducted by outside interests. 
   I look forward to working with members in other states to alleviate the financial burdens imposed by shared appreciation agreements. I hope that we may move this through the legislative process quickly to provide help as soon as possible to our farmers.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand in support of S. 880, Fuels Regulatory Relief Act, to provide relief for small businesses and to increase security of information from potential terrorists. This bill will specifically exclude toxic flammable fuels from Section 112 of the Clean Air Act which requires businesses provide public information on stored flammable fuels and how they would respond to emergencies should a disaster occur.  
   When the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990, Congress required the Environmental Protection Agency, under Section 112, to provide public information on a list of 100 substances which might cause injury or death to humans or adverse effects to the environment in an accident. EPA added flammable fuels to this list of 100 substances. This means that people who store and distribute flammable fuels are required to provide public information about their operations and how they would respond to an accident. These Risk Management Plans provide information on hazards associated with the fuels, safety measures and maintenance, and a worst-case scenario with an emergency response plan. This detailed information, although intended to provide citizens near a fuel facility knowledge about their local risks, also provide dangerous information to potential terrorists. The worst-case scenario information especially could provide potential terrorists with valuable information about how to destroy a flammable fuel facility. 
   I recognize the constant struggle between providing public access to and security protections of information about flammable fuels. However, given that public safety is adequately protected through existing federal laws and state building and fire codes, I believe no further requirements are needed. Also people who store flammable fuels are very safety conscious given the unstable nature of the product they work with. The safety record on the storage of flammable fuels is good and demonstrates that current regulatory requirements are adequate. Without any clear problem of the existing framework of protections, I do not see why these substances should be further regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. 
   By regulating flammable fuels under this provision of the Clean Air Act, fuel distributors might be hurt. For example, distributors might reduce their storage capacity of flammable fuels affecting their ability to meet local customer demands. Also if businesses and farmers reduce their stored levels of flammable fuels, fuel switching might be encouraged further adversely affecting distributors. This could limit the flexibility and health of these small businesses and farmers. Basically, it would ensure that the ``Hank Hills'' of the world (a character on the Fox network who is a propane small businessman) are not put out of business. 
   Thus, I trust my colleagues will rise with me to support this bill to provide relief for small businesses and farmers struggling to survive while ensuring security against disclosure of explosive information to potential terrorists.

If you ever hear of the brands TopHat and LazyEL, those are famous brands in our State up in the Red Lodge country and Roscoe, MT. We have bumper stickers saying, ``Where in the world is Roscoe?'' 
   I welcome Father Mackay. He comes from a family of folks who have donated resources and time to public service. He was also the pastor in Billings before going to Washington. We hated to lose him from the Billings community. But when you look at the family and his uncles and going back to his grandfather, they have a rich tradition and great American values. 
   Of course, I thank Dr. Ogilvie for allowing this privilege today and welcome Don to the Senate and to Washington, DC. I often call this 17 square miles of logic free environment, but knowing Father Mackay, he will have it all figured out by the end of the day. So welcome.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. Today is April 15, Tax Day, and I would like to remind my colleagues how many Americans define this day. 
   On May 10, 1773, the British parliament authorized the East India Tea Company to export a half a million pounds of tea to the American colonies for the purpose of selling it without imposing upon the company the usual duties and tariffs. It was their intention to try to save the corrupt and mismanaged company from bankruptcy. The effect was that the company could undersell any other tea available in the colonies, including smuggled tea. The disruption to American commerce was unacceptable to many, including Sam Adams of Boston. 
   On November 27, 1773, three ships loaded with such tea landed at Boston and were prevented from unloading their cargo. Fearing that the tea would be seized for failure to pay customs duties, and eventually become available for sale, Adams and the Boston Whigs arranged a solution. On the night of December 16, 1773, a group of colonists, disguised as Mohawk Indians, snuck aboard the ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor. 
   The King's response was the passing of the Intolerable Acts which precipitated the forming of the First Continental Congress to consider united resistance. As we all know, this was the beginning of what is today the longest standing Democracy in the history of civilization. 
   It is important to reflect on the actions taken on that day in that harbor. It is also important to recognize today is not very different from that historic day. Generally speaking, governments are short-lived and short-sighted. It is the responsibility of Congress to represent the wishes of the people. It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure the people are not abused by the federal government. Acts of arrogance will not be tolerated. Acts of aggression will be punished. 
   It has long been instilled in our land to criticize the Internal Revenue Service. Last year, Congress had the opportunity to address many of these criticisms. But I need to ask the question--Is the IRS listening?  
   Over 123 million families will file 1040 returns this year. I have heard from many of these families. I have spoken with Montana families about their trials with the IRS. I have spoken with Montana families about the difficulty of scratching out a living on modest wages and then being forced to pay a significant amount of that on taxes. 
   Where does the blame lie? Federal spending is the gorilla on the taxpayer's back. The problem also lies with our Nation's Tax Code. How complicated is the Tax Code? Complicated enough to require significant revision--in fact, I think we should scrap the code for a simpler version providing equitable treatment. Here are the facts on the confusing nature of our Nation's Tax Code: 
   The IRS employs 96,000 workers to collect Federal taxes amounting to $1.8 trillion and to administer the 1.5 million word income tax code. 
   The IRS expects to receive 120 million phone calls for assistance this year. 
   A new Associated Press poll finds that the percentage of Americans who say that Federal taxes have gotten too complicated is up to 60 percent. 
   The Federal Tax Code is so complex that about half of American families now require the services of tax professionals to file their tax returns. 
   The IRS estimates that taxpayers will spend an average of 11 hours preparing their 1040's this year. 
   At a minimum, the cost of collecting the federal income tax, including the value of the billions of hours that taxpayers spend filling forms, is at least 10 cents for every dollar of tax revenue collected. 
   After the hearings we held last year, I admit I continue to be dismayed over what I consider to be a continuation of the arrogant attitude conveyed by the actions of the Internal Revenue Service. 
   While the IRS expects taxpayers to fill out their tax forms accurately, the General Accounting Office has just released a report criticizing the agency for poor bookkeeping and failing the same sort of audit that the agency imposes of American taxpayers. 
   IRS management must recognize that they have a difficult job--promoting quality customer service. Not an easy task considering the historic attitude toward the IRS. 
   The founding of this great Nation's history begins with the Boston Tea Party--a revolt against tyrannical rule and unfair taxation. Taxes are a necessary evil but, if kept in check, important to all levels of government. 
   Taxes have created the world's greatest highway infrastructure, contributed to the protection of our nation's borders, and supported the most successful democratic government in history. 
   But waste and abuse of tax dollars have burdened the American taxpayer with one of the highest levels of taxation in recent years. 
   Tax collection needs to reflect it's controversial history--the IRS does not have the right to use harassment and extortion as tax collection methods. In blunder after blunder, the IRS is flailing in a dismal fall from effectiveness--wasting those same taxpayer dollars they are collecting. 
   The IRS hearings during the 105th Congress were a very solemn wake-up call. Customer service will never be considered as an IRS attribute, but that's what the IRS needs to pound into their employees--the people who need to learn to work with American taxpayers--not against them. 
   Perhaps part of the blame lies with Congress. We should not be fooled by IRS reports telling us ``we're working out the problems.'' As the representative body of our Nation, Congress must hold the IRS to a zero tolerance standard. 
   I have been contacted earlier this tax season, by numerous Montana constituents bearing complaints about the IRS. Most of the constituents are very disgruntled with the length of time it takes to have a resolution processed. They send me folders and files of correspondence. During the lengthy bureaucratic process, debts grow fantastically high with interest and penalties. 
   One of those cases involves the IRS's denial of due process of legal challenge for past tax years'. But it is not just one--it is many--too many. A fairer less complicated tax system may help to clear up some of the IRS abuses. By simplifying the tax system, one can only think we would simplify our revenue collection system. 
   Mr. President, tax collectors have a long history of public persecution. Today, my colleagues and I stand here not to tar and feather the tax collector, but to put an end to the abusive culture that has spread like a bacteria throughout the IRS.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. WYDEN, in introducing a very important piece of legislation, the Online Privacy Protection Act of 1999. Last year, Congress worked together to protect our most vulnerable citizens from unprincipled information gathering online by passing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. That law provided online privacy protection for children up through age 13. Although teens and adults have a greater ability to identify the risks associated with online shopping and browsing, some guidance and protection is needed to ensure that web sites treat information in a fair and uniform way. 
   Before I tell you what this bill does, let me first tell you what this bill does not do. It does not bury online companies with regulatory paperwork. It does not impose a congressional mandate on privacy policies. It does not force compliance with arcane rules. It does not regulate the internet. 
   I want to be clear. We are trying to pilot the ship of internet commerce with a very light hand while trying to encourage the efforts currently underway within the online industry. 
   This bill sets very general guidelines for how an online company treats information it gathers from people interacting with their web sites. First of all, there must be a clear and conspicuous posting of the companies information collection policy. They must note what information is collected, and what they do with it. There must be a clear means for people to opt out of providing this information, if the data collected is not relevant to the web transaction. In fairness, we do allow the web site host to cancel the online transaction if the site visitor doesn't provide all of the needed information. For example, if a person buys a product, but won't give a mailing address, the company can terminate the sale.  
   A key provision of this bill allows people access to information that was collected and shared with outside companies. We recognize that there are many web sites that collect information to better serve their visitors. Amazon.com keeps track of book requests to help identify other potential books of interest to the customer. We appreciate the prosperity of that data and its use and want to protect and encourage that creativity. As long as the company discloses up front what information it is collecting and keeps that data internal, it won't be forced into disclosure and lose its competitive edge. However, all companies are required to establish and maintain procedures to protect the information that it collects. 
   To the uninformed listener, this may sound like a lot of regulation and paperwork for online companies to follow. The good news is that this bill recognizes the continuing progress being made in the commercial sector in providing secure and private transactions for customers. Concerns about misuse of information can drive many customers away, and many companies are recognizing the need for establishing some type of privacy rules. It's telling that 60 percent of Fortune 500 Chief Information Officers in a recent poll stated that they wouldn't divulge personal information online. 
   Fortunately, we finally got the right balance in crafting privacy policy on the internet. It isn't through congressional or FTC mandates. It's by encouraging private industry to band together to establish minimum requirements for a safe haven for consumer information. Companies can meet the intent of this bill by showing that their privacy policy complies with the Safe Haven requirements established in industry. Congress and the FTC are only there to give the Safe Haven some teeth by providing incentives and ensuring compliance with these self-established regulations. We also allow states to use existing law to challenge and remove irresponsible online privacy behavior. A strong team of business, Congress, States, and regulators will bring a balanced and fair approach to the needs of consumers. 
   The Online Privacy Protection Act of 1999 is an important effort to shape the future of online commerce. By getting out front and then staying out of the way, we can create an electronic medium free from big-brother mentality that allows people to move freely through commercial sites without fearing for the data trail they leave behind. This bill is good for industry and good for consumers. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the Members of the Senate know, for several years I have advocated the enactment of legislation that would facilitate the use of strong encryption. Beginning in the 104th Congress, I have introduced legislation that would ensure that the private sector continues to take the lead in developing innovative products to protect the security and confidentiality of our electronic information including the ability to export such American products. 
   I am pleased to rise today to introduce with my Chairman, Senator MCCAIN, the PROTECT ACT of 1999 (Promote Reliable On Line Transactions To Encourage Commerce and Trade). The bill reflects a number of discussions we have had this year about the importance of encryption in the digital age to promote electronic commerce, secure our confidential business and sensitive personal information, prevent crime and protect our national security by protecting the commercial information systems and electronic networks upon which America's critical infrastructures increasingly rely. I am extremely pleased to join with him in introducing this important legislation. 
   While this bill differs in important respects from the PRO-CODE legislation I introduced in the previous Congress, I do think it accomplishes a number of very important objectives. Specifically, the bill: 
   Prohibits domestic controls; 
   Guarantees that American industry will continue to be able to come up with innovative products;  
   Immediately decontrols encryption products using key lengths of 64 bits or less; 
   Permits the immediate exportability of 128 bit encryption in recoverable encryption products and in all encryption products to a broad group of legitimate and responsible commercial users and to users in allied countries; 
   Recognizes the futility of unilateral export controls on mass market products and where there are foreign alternatives and so permits the immediate exportability of strong encryption products whenever a public-private advisory board and the Secretary of Commerce determines that they are generally available, publicly available, or available from foreign suppliers; 
   Directs NIST to complete establishment of the Advanced Encryption Standard with 128 bit key lengths (the DES successor) by January 1, 2002 (and ensures that it is led by the private sector and open to public comment); and 
   Decontrols thereafter products incorporating the AES or its equivalent. 
   Today, we are in a world that is characterized by the fact that nearly everyone has a computer and that those computers are, for the most part, connected to one another. In light of that fact, it is becoming more and more important to ensure that our communications over these computer networks are conducted in a secure way. It is no longer possible to say that when we move into 
   the information age, we'll secure these networks, because we are already there. We use computers in our homes and businesses in a way that couldn't have been imagined 10 years ago, and these computers are connected through networks, making it easier to communicate than ever before. This phenomenon holds the promise of transforming life in States like Montana, where health care and state-of-the-art education can be delivered over networks to people located far away from population centers. These new technologies can improve the lives of real people, but only if the security of information that moves over these networks is safe and reliable. 
   The problem today is that our computer networks are not as secure as they could be; it is fairly easy for amateur hackers to break into our networks. They can intercept information; they can steal trade secrets and intellectual property; they can alter medical records; the list is endless. One solution to this, of course, is to let individuals and businesses alike to take steps to secure that information. Encryption is one technology that accomplishes that. 
   I am proud that today I have been able to join with Senator MCCAIN to introduce this legislation which will enable Americans to use the Internet with confidence and security.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about some good news for a change. I want to introduce the ``E-911 Act of 1999.'' The purpose of this legislation is to improve 911. By linking some of the amazing innovations in wireless technology to 911 and medical and emergency response professionals we bring our 911 systems into the 21st century. 
   All kinds of technologies exist today that can greatly reduce response time to emergencies and help victims get the right kind of medical attention quickly. But right now these technologies are not connected in ways that can be used for emergencies. That's why this effort to upgrade our 911 systems across the nation is so important and necessary. 
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted studies showing that crash-to-care time for fatal accidents is about a half hour in urban areas. In rural areas, which covers most of my home state of Montana, that crash-to-care time almost doubles. On average, it takes just shy of an hour to get emergency attention to crash victims in rural areas. Almost half of the serious crash victims who do not receive care in that first hour die at the scene of the accident. That's a scary statistic. 
   In 1997 there were 37,280 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States--41,967 people died as a result. Of that number, 2,098 were children. Now obviously there is no piece of legislation that can instantly prevent these kinds of tragedies. But there are definitely things we can do to help reduce them. Upgrading our 911 response systems, which this legislation promotes, is a solid step toward preventing many horrible tragedies. 
   Drew Dawson, who is the director of the Montana Emergency Medical Services Bureau and the president of the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Directors, strongly supports the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999. He tells me that the bill will help bring better wireless 911 coverage to Montana and will enhance 
   our statewide Trauma Care System. Mr. Dawson believes this legislation will help him and his emergency folks do their jobs better, which means it will help them save more lives than they already do. 
   I have to say a word about all of the good work that folks like Drew Dawson in Montana and other emergency professionals do all over the country. The United States has the most skilled and dedicated group of medical and emergency professionals in the world. We need to give them better tools. There is technology out there that can help these professionals and that can help all of us citizens, if, God forbid, we ever find ourselves in an emergency situation needing this kind of help. The E-911 Act of 1999 will help all of us and will make our emergency services even better than they are today. 
   Mr. President, Let me take a moment to summarize the important sections of this bill. 
   It makes Congressional findings and specifies the purpose of the Act. The purpose of the Act is ``to encourage and facilitate the prompt deployment throughout the United States of a seamless, ubiquitous, and reliable end-to-end infrastructure for communications, including wireless communications, to meet the Nation's public safety and other communications needs.'' 
   It assigns to the Federal Communications Commission, and any agency or entity to which it has delegated authority under Section 251 of the Communications Act of 1934, the duty to designate the number 911 as the universal emergency telephone number within the United States for reporting an emergency to appropriate authorities and requesting assistance. The universal number would apply both to wireless and wireline telephone service. The Commission, and any agency or entity, must establish appropriate periods for geographic areas in which 911 is not in use as an emergency telephone number to transition to the use of 911. 
   It establishes a principle of parity between the wireless and wireline telecommunications industries in protection from liability for: (1) the 
   provision of telephone services, including 911 and emergency warning service, and (2) the use of 911 and emergency warning service. The bill provides for wireless providers of telephone service to receive at least as much protection under Federal, State or local law from liability as local exchange companies receive in providing telephone services. States cannot impose procedural barriers, such as requiring wireless providers to file tariffs, as a condition for wireless providers to receive the substantive protection from liability for which the legislation provides. The bill also provides for users of wireless 911 service to receive at least as much protection from liability under Federal, State or local law as users of wireline 911 service receive. 
   It amends Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 222) to provide appropriate privacy protection for call location information concerning the user of a commercial mobile service, including such information provided by an automatic crash notification system. The provision authorizes disclosure of such information to emergency dispatch providers and emergency service personnel in order to respond to the user's call for emergency services. The provision also is intended to allow disclosure of such information to the next-of-kin or legal guardian of a person as necessary in connection with the furnishing of medical care to such person as a result of an emergency. Finally, the customer of a commercial mobile radio service may grant broader authority (for example, in the customer's written subscription agreement with the service provider) for the use of, disclosure of, or access to call location information concerning users of the customer's commercial mobile service communications instrument (e.g., the customer's wireless telephone), but the customer must grant such authority expressly and in advance of such use, disclosure or access. 
   It provides definitions for terms used in the legislation. 
   That is the long version of what this bill is about. The short version is: it's about saving lives. Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will join me and help pass this important legislation.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor a bill on an issue of great importance to my state and the agricultural industry. The issue is that of rescinding the USDA Grade Stamp on foreign meat products coming into America from other countries and unfairly receiving the USDA Grade Stamp. 
   This language offered today will insure that all meat products imported from a foreign country will not be graded USDA. For years other countries have used the USDA Grade Stamp to their advantage. Particularly, Canada and Mexico ship livestock into the United States and reap the benefits of the premium given for USDA Prime, USDA Choice or USDA Select.

   Mr. BURNS. I stand in support of the Senate's Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2000 since I believe it establishes the right priorities and balance for the Federal Government going into the next millennium. It preserves the future retirement and health care for our aging population by ensuring the financial integrity of the Social Security and Medicare Programs. It reduces the financial burden of the Federal Government on American taxpayers by reducing the national debt and returning excess taxes to them. And finally it limits the growth of the Federal Government by adhering to the statutory spending caps agreed to between Congress and the President in 1997. 
   Saving Social Security is not a partisan issue. Principles, not politics should guide us when it comes to providing for our senior citizens who have been our guide through life thus far. We need to fix this program not only for our parents but also our grandchildren. We need to trust the American people that they can make their own choices on how their retirement will be financed. I believe all Americans should be given the opportunity to invest in a personalized savings account to control their own future. I do not agree that we should mandate the creation of a politically constituted Federal commission to control the investments of Social Security trust funds in the stock markets. 
   The President's plan doesn't add up. His FY 2000 budget projects a $4.5 trillion surplus over the next 15 years. One half of that $2.3 trillion, is the surplus for the Social Security trust fund. That leaves us with a working surplus of $2.2 trillion. I just don't understand where we come up with the $2.8 trillion for the Social Security trust fund out of this non-Social Security surplus of $2.2 trillion especially after the President proposes to spend $1.7 trillion of the remaining $2.2 working surplus. His plan just doesn't add up. As we say in Montana--looks like it, smells like it, taste like it, glad we didn't step in it. 
   Medicare is another tricky issue that we need to fix. I want the record to show that Republicans have never proposed cutting Medicare. Rather Republicans have allowed Medicare to grow at twice the rate of inflation. Our FY 2000 Budget Resolution assures that Medicare is fully funded--every dollar that is projected to go to beneficiaries will do so instead of what the President proposes with $9 billion in cuts to Medicare. This means that the Republican plan will continue to preserve Medicare for our seniors in this FY 2000 Budget Resolution. 
   In the State of the Union, the President proposed that $1 out of every $6 of the surplus will be used to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020. What he claims actually is to set aside $700 billion--15 percent of the $4.5 trillion total budget surplus of the next fifteen years--and then credit this with another $300 billion in interest payments. 
   While this sounds attractive, the President doesn't have the money to implement this plan plus his claims are based on IOUs and phony numbers. However, the worst part is that his plan still wouldn't help Medicare. 
   Since the total Federal budget deficit was eliminated in FY 1998, the FY 2000 Budget Resolution will focus now on eliminating the on-budget deficit in FY 2001--the first time this has occurred since the 1960s. Furthermore, the FY 2000 Budget Resolution will cut the public debt over the next 10 years by 50 percent versus the 20 percent reduction proposed in the President's budget. Correspondingly, Federal interest payments on the national debt will be cut in half--from $229 billion this year to $115 billion in 2009--releasing capital previously set aside to pay for interest on the national debt to more productive private economic activities, such as helping our struggling farmers and ranchers. Also we will not have to make the American public go further into debt. The statutory debt limit for the total government (currently at  $5.95 trillion) will not have to be increased until 2004 as opposed to the President's budget which would have to raise the statutory debt limit as early as 2001. 
   The FY 2000 Concurrent Budget Resolution further accommodates a tax cut of $15 billion in the first year and $142 billion over the first five years from the non-Social Security surplus. Congress is not only receptive to paying down the national debt, but also to refund excess taxes to the American people. 
   Let me assure you that the Republican tax cut will have no effect on Social Security or Medicare because they are not funded by general revenues but by dedicated payroll taxes. Also, tax cuts from a surplus discretionary budget have no impact on Social Security or Medicare. 
   With a budget surplus well over $100 billion, I believe it is arrogant for the Administration to believe it has the best perspective on how to spend the American taxpayers money. Furthermore it is even harder to believe tax increases are justified as the President proposes. Our nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates, under current law, American taxpayers will overpay their taxes by $787 billion over the next 10 years which is the equivalent of $7,000 for every American taxpayer. 
   However, two areas of importance to me in the Budget Resolution are increased spending for education and agriculture. I support the increase of $47.4 billion over the Senate Budget Committee baseline and by $21.2 billion over the President's request for the next ten years. The FY 2000 Budget Resolution also provides for a $28 billion over five years and an $82 billion over ten years net increase in discretionary spending for elementary and secondary education. Overall discretionary spending for education increases by $2.4 billion in 2000--double the President's request--and $31 billion over the next five years--five times the President's request. 
   The President's budget for the coming fiscal year contains 66 new programs and $45 billion in tax increases. His budget plans for the next 15 years call for over $500 billion in new spending and not one dollar in non-credit tax cuts. 
   I am pleased that the FY 2000 Budget Resolution contains a mandatory spending allocation of $6 billion for the next 5 years (FY 2000-2004) based upon legislation proposed by the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. I am also pleased that the Committee-reported Resolution provides a total of over $4 billion more in budget authority for mandatory programs. Farmers need protection against the weather related and economic losses they have sustained this past year. It is critical that Congress provide adequate Federal funding in the FY 2000 Budget Resolution so the Agriculture Committee can address the severe problems faced by our nation's farmers and ranchers. 
   Unfortunately, every credible economic forecast indicates the farm economy will recover slowly at best. The Agriculture Committee needs adequate budget authority to develop and strengthen programs which provide production credit, risk management, and economic assistance to farmers and ranchers. 
   Beyond these concerns, I call upon my colleagues to support the Budget Resolution for FY 2000 to continue the progress Congress has made to strengthen our financial future into the 21st Century. 
   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my colleagues in introducing The National Monument Participation Act of 1999. This bill would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to clearly establish the roles for public participation and Congressional involvement in declaring national monuments on federal lands. This bill requires specific processes and requirements to ensure that the public, local, state, and Federal government are both informed and involved in the formulation of any plans to declare national monuments on federal lands. 
   It requires that the public be actively involved in the formulation of any plans to declare a national monument. Considering the recent controversy surrounding the designation of monuments with the stroke of a pen rather than through open debate and assessment, it only makes sense to include the public in any future designation decisions. I remind my colleagues and the administration that we are managing our land resources for the people. This bill suggests that perhaps we should listen to them before drastically changing the management of our land resources. 
   Additionally, the legislation requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture perform an assessment of current land uses on the land proposed for designation. This is necessary to provide information about the impact of declaring any national monument before recommendations are made by the President. It makes absolutely no sense to pursue designation changes without learning what is at stake. What mineral interests are affected? Does it change traditional grazing uses? These are questions that will have to be answered before new monuments are designated. 
   The legislation also requires that we look at the impact a monument would have on state or private land holdings. Once again, common sense is needed. If the federal designation change affects state an private lands, Congress must be informed of these impacts before a decision is finally reached. It is irresponsible to make decisions without the proper information. 
   Finally, this legislation would require the President to submit his decision on these recommendations to the Congress for final review and approval. If we are going to change our designations and impact local communities, Congress must weigh in on the decision. 
   Public involvement in federal decision making is critical today to ensure that local citizens are involved in the decision changing how federal lands near their homes are used. This bill will mandate broader involvement to ensure the public and the legislative branch have an opportunity to participate in any plans to establish new national monuments on federal lands. In addition, this ensures the information is available for the public and ourselves to understand the impacts of any proposed declaration and make an informed decision. 
   Overall, I believe this bill establishes a clear set of roles and responsibilities for all parties involved in the declaration of new national monuments on federal lands to ensure that such decisions are made in a manner that respects the rights of both local communities and the interests of the nation as a whole. I encourage my colleagues to carefully examine this legislation and lend their support to its ultimate passage.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have heard the debate on this floor. Now what is at hand? How many questions have we asked ourselves? Are we crossing international boundaries to inflict heavy damage or to destroy the ability to make war in a sovereign nation? Are we not making war? Are we not using a treaty organization to participate in a civil war? Is there a possibility that we are being used to deal with a very acute and serious problem in the stability of a region? 
   No one should question the motive of any vote on this issue. Every Member of this body is capable of casting the hard vote. One cannot clear his or her conscience of the atrocities that have been committed, and one can see the desperation on the faces of those who are being displaced. But I say to you, the nations that are most affected must now assume the responsibility that confronts them. To ask us to participate in a civil war, which is not our character, is a lot to ask. Can we help? Yes, we can. We can do it in different ways. But to ask us to place our men and women in harm's way, to force submission of a people with deep resolve in an area where not very many folks have ever been beaten into submission, that is asking of us a great deal. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. John Ramney, a fellow Montana, who has spent 37 years in public service as an Agriculture Extension Agent for Yellowstone County, Montana. Over this period he has helped farmers, downtown business folks and the media with agricultural-related questions, in a professional manner that is a role model for exemplary public service today. 
   Mr. Ramney's career served Montana's agriculture industry with a unique quiet dedication not usually seen today. He began his career as a county agent in training in Thompson Falls and Great Falls, Montana. He then became a 4-H Agent with the Yellowstone County Extension Office in 1961. After serving as an assistant county agent in training in Billions for six years, he became a full fledged County Agent for Yellowstone County. 
   His job has involved educating the agricultural producers in Yellowstone County, Montana to enhance their productivity. He has done this primarily by providing information from research done at Montana State University or other experiment stations. He has also conducted numerous meetings and workshops to strengthen the farmers' knowledge and capabilities as Yellowstone County moved from a rural to a more urban county. In addition, he tirelessly maintained personal contacts with local farmers to ensure their understanding about crops, livestock, farm machinery, and land leases were up to date. 
   Over his almost 40 years as a County Agent, Mr. Ramney always acted in a positive and helpful manner. He said that even though he has answered many, many questions over the years, he has learned that everyone who calls or stops by teaches him something. For example, he noted that a lot more calls were looking for information that people heard about from other universities and experimental stations in other parts of the country. With the advent of better communications, farmers knew more about what was happening in Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska. As Mr. Ramney said, ``They ask for it and I hunt for information wherever it might be.'' Ms. Mary Zartman, Personnel Director of the Montana State University Extension Service stated, with the news of Mr. Ramney's retirement, ``He'll be a hard act to follow.'' Please join with me in recognizing an unusual American and a great Montanan.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as one of the proud cosponsors of S. 629, the Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999, sponsored by Senator CRAIG. The issue of crop insurance reform is and will continue to be a primary issue for agriculture this session. 
   The language offered today brings important changes to crop insurance, especially for specialty crops. This bill drastically improves procedures for determining yields and improves the noninsured crop assistance programs. This bill, S. 629, also improves the safety net to producers through cost of production crop insurance coverage. 
   This is another important tool to reform the current crop insurance program into a risk management program, which will return more of the economic dollar back to the producer. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for farmers and ranchers to stay in agriculture. They must ultimately regain the responsibility for risk management the Federal Government withdrew. 
   To help agricultural producers do that, the Federal Government must fix the current crop insurance program and make it one the producer can use as an effective risk management tool. Eventually, I envision a crop insurance program that puts the control in the hands of agricultural producers. It is the Federal Government's role to facilitate a program to unite the producer and the private insurance company. 
   It is of utmost importance that we get the producers of this country back on track. Crop insurance reform is one sure way to do that. I urge my colleagues here today to consider the positive effect crop insurance will and must have on the farm economy. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator CRAIG on crop insurance reform. I will have some amendments forthcoming, that I believe will make this bill even more effective. I also plan to introduce a bill this session that I believe will make even larger strides in the area of crop insurance reform.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to transfer the operation of an irrigation project in Montana from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the local irrigators. This is a bill, which has been before Congress before, but has been changed to address the concerns expressed by the BIA and groups which have opposed this legislation in the past. 
   Years of management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs has led to a project in poor physical condition. Rather than being an asset for the government and the users, the Flathead Irrigation is rapidly becoming a liability. Using current estimates, the project is in need of $15 to $20 million worth of repair and conditioning. Government managers admit that costs associated with rehabilitation of this project could be as much as 40 percent higher than if the project were under local control. 
   The irony of this project however, is the fact that studies on locally owned irrigation projects in Montana and Wyoming show that the costs of operation and maintenance of the Flathead project are some of the highest in the Rocky Mountain Region the condition of the project may be worst in that same region. What do these people, and for that matter the taxpayer, get for the higher costs associated with the current management? Not much if anything at all. 
   Let's take a moment here to see what local control of this irrigation project would mean to the irrigators and to the taxpayer. First of all, local control will mean increased accountability of the monies collected by and used in the operation of the Flathead Irrigation Project. At the current time the BIA is unable, or unwilling, to provide basic financial information to the local irrigation districts. This despite the fact that the local farmers and ranchers pay 100% of the costs to operate and maintain the project. At the same time, the current management cannot even deliver a year-end balance of funds paid by the local irrigation users. 
   Local control will also create savings over the current operation management. By using these savings the local management could be used to restore the Flathead Irrigation Project to a fully functioning, efficiently operating unit. 
   Wihtout the transfer to local control, the residents of the Flathead face an uncertain future. This irrigation project is located in one of the most beautiful valleys in western Montana. Current trends in agriculture have put farmers and ranchers in a difficult position. Montana farmers and ranchers have always been land rich and cash poor. In the case of this valley in Montana, this is the rule and not the exception. They live in an area that is being changed daily due to the number of summer home construction, because of the beauty and a temperate climate for Montana. 
   The family farmers and ranchers in this area continue to face economic pressures from outside. Which has led to a number of folks packing up and subdividing their land for residential home sites. Those who have packed up and left the area, have taken their land and subdivided it for the residential development, removing the land from agricultural production. 
   The subdivision of the land has a number of negative impacts on this valley and Montana and the Nation. The landscape is dotted with magnificent homes which impacts on the landscape and open spaces, and of course wildlife. Another of the major impacts is on the local and state economies and governments. Agriculture land in Montana pays approximately $1.29 in property taxes for every dollar invested by the local government for services. Residential subdivisions only pay approximately $0.89 for every dollar they receive in local government services. 
   Preservation of the small family farm and ranch in the Mission, Jocko and Camas valleys in Montana is dependent upon local control. As local control of the Flathead Irrigation Project will provide these hard working Americans an opportunity to control and have input on the costs associated with the operation of this vital water source.

    Mr. BURNS. I rise today to bring attention to Doug Swingley's second victory in the Alaskan Iditarod. Doug hails from Simms, Montana, where he raises and trains his dogs. 
   As you all know, the Alaskan Iditarod is a grueling dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska. The race covers 1,161 miles and is run in some of the harshest weather in the world.  
   Doug Swingley began mushing in 1989 with plans of running the Iditarod. He ran his first Iditarod in 1992 and was the top-placing rookie hat year. He has competed in every Iditarod race since 1992 and won the event for the first time in only his third attempt. I am sure that Doug's second victory will disappoint my good friends Senators STEVENS and MURKOWSKI, because Doug is the only non-Alaskan to win the Iditarod. He has proven that a kid from Montana can take on our friends from the North and beat them at their own game and win. 
   Like his first victory, Doug pulled his team away from the competition, and showed incredible speed through the final stages of this demanding race. I am impressed by his dedication and hard work, and I am proud to know that Montana is full of people like Doug.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of legislation that is vitally important for the Northeast corner of my great state of Montana. As you are aware, water is the most valuable commodity in the West. Unfortunately, in many parts of the West the water available is unsafe to use. This is the case on the Fort Peck Reservation and in the surrounding communities. 
   These communities are currently dependent on water sources that are either unreliable or contaminated. In some areas the ground water is in short supply, in others high levels of nitrates, sulfates, manganese, iron, dissolved solids and other contaminates ensure that the water is not only unusable for human consumption, but even unusable for livestock. Quite simply, the water is not safe. 
   Safe drinking water is a necessity in all communities, however, these communities have a very unique set of needs that underscore the importance of clean water. This legislation would ensure the Assiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck Reservation a safe and reliable water supply system. One of the largest reservations in the nation, the Fort Peck Reservation is located in Northeastern Montana and is the home of more than 10,000 people. In addition to a 75 percent unemployment rate, the residents suffer from unusually high incidents of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. 
   These health problems are magnified by the poor drinking water currently available on the reservation. In one community, the sulfate levels in the water are four times the standard for safe drinking water. In four other communities, the iron levels are five times the standard. Some families have even been forced to abandon their homes as a result of the substandard water quality. 
   In many cases, residents of the reservation purchased bottled water to avoid illness. While this isn't a big deal to those who can afford it, we are dealing with an area living in extreme poverty. To add insult to injury, one of the largest man made reservoirs in the United States is right down the road. Why must we continue to ask the residents of these communities to place their health at risk when a clean, safe, stable source of water is readily available? 
   The economic health of the region is also affected by the poor water supply. In fact, a major constraint on the growth of the livestock industry around Fort Peck has been the lack of an adequate watering sites for cattle. Only an adequate water system will solve this problem, and hopefully serve to spur economic activity on the reservation. Recently the administration designated this area as an ``Empowerment Zone.'' The purpose of this designation is to help the tribal government enhance the economic and social well-being of the area's residents. What better foundation can we provide than a safe and reliable water infrastructure. This region's aspirations towards being healthy, both economically and physically, will continue to be stifled until we reach out a helping hand and work towards providing a safe water system. 
   This legislation, which has the support of Fort Peck residents and the endorsement of the Tribal Council of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, would authorize a reservation-wide municipal, rural and industrial water system for the Fort Peck Reservation. A safe and reliable source of water would improve the health status of the residents and increase the region's attractiveness for economic development. 
   As the future water needs of the Fort Peck Reservation expand, I believe that it is only right that we take action now. The people of the Fort Peck Reservation and the State of Montana are making a simple request--clean, safe drinking water. 
   Thank you Mr. President.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, since the early 1980's, Montana has been faced with a very serious transportation problem regarding the transportation of our grain and coal out of our state at reasonable prices and in a reasonable period of time. 
   Montana is a classic case of what happens to rail customers when you eliminate competitive transportation alternatives. Our rail rates go through the roof and our rail customers end up subsidizing rail rates in regions where competition is present. In a nutshell, our rail customers pay more for less service. The rail customers in regions with competitive alternatives pay less and receive more service. 
   Now, we're seeing the same thing happen in other regions around the nation. Montana has been down this road and I encourage my colleagues to look at the problems we face in Montana as a pre-cursor to what will happen in their states. 
   The Surface Transportation Board (STB), based on their deliberations over the McCarty Farms vs. Burlington Northern case, has indicated to the producer that BNSF's rates are not excessive. I am concerned that after 17 years of adjudication using the STB's decision making process, that process is flawed. 
   In the West, we have only two Class I railroads and in Montana, we have only one Class I railroad. Under today's deregulated environment, we have come full circle back to limited competition. Because of this lack of competition, Montana's producers pick up the tab for those who have competition. 
   Montana's shippers pay some of the highest rates in the world while our neighbors pay a significantly lower cost for transportation. In Montana, we are truly dependent on the railroads to transport bulk commodities that could not be efficiently transported by any other means. 
   Agricultural shippers are the most vulnerable to predatory marketing by monopolistic practices of railroads. The farm producer unlike every other industry we know of in America, cannot pass the freight costs on to anyone else, they must simply eat it.  
   We do not need to re-regulate the railroads; rather we need to restore the balance between rail customers and the railroads that Congress intended to achieve originally in the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. I look forward to working with my colleagues to restore the competitive balance in the rail transportation industry and level the playing field for our nation's rail customers.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I'm here to announce my strong support of Senator COLLINS' bill S. 335, the ``Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act.'' I chose to be an original co-sponsor of this bill after hearing from several constituents who were confused, irritated, and even outraged by the deceptive language that is all too often found in sweepstakes and other promotional mailings. 
   I think every one of us has received at least a few junk mailings which brazenly inform us that we have just won millions of dollars or that we are about to receive a car, a luxury cruise, or some other prize that sounds too good to be true. Well, the sad truth is that it almost always IS too good to be true. 
   To many of us, these promotional mailings represent nothing more than a minor annoyance and are easily tossed into the garbage without a second thought. But for many others, these mailings are nothing more than a cruel hoax, a trap designed to play on the hopes and dreams of trusting folks who were raised in a time when most people meant what they said and said what they meant. 
   As an example of the misleading and downright dangerous content found in many of these mailings, I'd like to read into the record a portion of a letter that was sent to me last year by a constituent of mine who resides in Columbia Falls, Montana. This gentleman writes,  
   My father is a resident in a nursing home. He is 84, and suffers from mild dementia aggravated by high-powered medications which treat his incessant headaches. (The magazine he subscribes to) endlessly sends him these misleading and deliberately-designed ``You've Won!!!'' bulletins that he cannot understand except to believe fervently that he's just got to go pick up his check for hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. 
   I believe these kinds of letters are deliberately designed to prey on the infirmities of old people, and of course get them to sign things that obligate them to free trials and unneeded products. Every episode brings my father increased stress, more headaches, and the need for additional medication. I am sure there are hundreds of thousands of people like Dad who want nothing to do with these phony promotions, but who can't get the mailers to remove them from the lists. Many, like Dad, don't have the daily clarity of thought to deal with mass-mailed deceptive come-ons like this.  
   Mr. President, I believe that the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act will go a long way towards preventing this kind of abuse of our senior citizens and other trusting individuals. Senator COLLINS' bill would not only establish strict new standards for honesty and disclosure in promotional mailings, but would provide strong new financial penalties for those who continue to violate these standards. It is my hope that the Committee on Governmental Affairs will be able to approve this legislation quickly, on a bi-partisan basis, so that we can bring an end to this plague of deceptive sweepstakes mailings which prey on our most vulnerable citizens.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today as one of the proud cosponsors of S. 529, Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act. This issue has been at the forefront of reform for American agriculture this session. 
   The language offered today will bring about much-needed changes in the area  of risk management for farmers and ranchers. Maintaining an effective farm income safety net is paramount to the survival of agriculture. I believe an effective crop insurance program will provide farmers and ranchers greater possibilities for economic sustainability in the future and help them out of the current financial crisis. 
   A truly effective crop insurance plan involves simply three things: private insurance, the federal government and the farmer or rancher. The federal government can help facilitate a program to unite the producer and the private insurance company. Privatization with government intervention will ultimately put the control in the hands of the agricultural producer. With a risk management plan, bankers are also more likely to finance producers if they have both their commodity and their price covered, with a reliable insurance program. 
   This bill will render relief to the inadequacies of the current program. All agricultural producers are painfully aware of the problems with the current crop insurance program. Unaffordable premiums are the primary stumbling block for producers. In years of depressed market prices, crop insurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for farmers and ranchers. Other problems prevalent in the current program are inequalities in rating structure and the issue of unfair coverage given to multiple year disasters. 
   This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide the highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of buy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the unaffordable premiums. It also allows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized. 
   This bill also removes the exclusion for livestock in the current crop insurance program. For Montana, which derived $991 million from livestock sales in 1996-97 this exclusion is extremely important. Of course, the choice will remain up to the livestock producer whether they wish to purchase a policy. It is important however, that they are given the option. With several years of depressed market prices, livestock producers can no longer remain in business without assistance. 
   This bill will also ultimately put more control in the hands of active producers. It restructures the Federal Crop Insurance board of directors to include two active producers; one in crop insurance, and one in reinsurance. The board would also include the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the Under Secretary for Rural Development and the Chief Economist of USDA. In addition, it mandates that the Board Chairperson be one of the non-governmental members. These are important steps to ensure that the new program is run for the producers by the producers. 
   A larger step towards private enterprise is the initiation of a flexible subsidy pilot program for the private sector to compete on rates and delivery expenses. I believe this will ultimately put the accountability factor on the companies carrying the policies. Much like auto insurance, health or medical insurance, companies will be forced to compete for agricultural producers business, in effect lowering premiums further. 
   This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance program into a risk management program, designed to help the producer in the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for farmers and ranchers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to produce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable margin. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senators ROBERTS and KERREY on this important piece of legislation. I will have some amendments forthcoming, that I believe will make this bill even more effective. I believe this bill will pave the way for massive crop insurance reform and help producers out of this economic crisis.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont and my good friend from Massachusetts. It won't take me long to make a couple of points before we go into the vote, because I think everybody wants to wrap up and get out of here for Thursday evening. 
   I am pleased to cosponsor and support this Ed-Flexibility Act. I want to make a couple of points. I want to thank our good friend from Tennessee, who a couple of years ago really elevated the awareness on the importance of this issue. The report that he prepared stands to be read by everybody. 
   I don't know if everyone visits schools when they go home. But for the week that I was home a couple of weeks ago, I had two or three chances to go into some high school assemblies and to talk with some teachers. The problem they are incurring is that they teach for a half-day and then they spend the rest of that day on paperwork compliance. 
   I think this is a very first step where teachers and parents and principals can  make some very vital decisions on the education they want to give our children. All 50 States have the ability to grant individual school districts waivers from selected Federal education requirements, like title I--there is no lack of support in this body for title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--and even the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Act and the Applied Technology Education Act. 
   When we talk about distance learning, nobody has been involved in distance learning longer than I have on the Commerce Committee, and I think the Senator from Massachusetts. We work very hard on demonstration units of distance learning. We even did it here on the inner cities and worked very, very hard on two-way interaction between teachers. 
   We have over in eastern Montana, where we have a lot of dirt between light bulbs, schools as far as 200 miles apart with teachers sharing sciences and languages in a class. She teaches there and also interacts live with students in three other classrooms. The total graduating class of all those schools put together will be fewer than 50. 
   Distance education, making those decisions of using the new technical tools that we have developed, has been one great thing to watch. It blossomed. Now we are teaching teachers in our land grant universities how to use those tools. 
   Unfortunately, right now many of our Federal education programs are overloaded with rules and regulations. States and local schools waste precious time and also resources in order to stay in compliance. It is obvious that these State and local districts need relief from the administrative burdens that many federally designated education programs put on States, schools, and education administrators. 
   We hear a lot about numbers of children in classrooms. I want to tell you, in our State the numbers are sort of going down. The 
   goal of this legislation and our goal should be, at the Federal level, to help States and local school districts to provide the best possible first-class education for our children that they can. They can't do it if they are burdened with rules and regulations and always reading the book on compliance. This is one big step toward taking care of that. 
   I compliment my friend from Vermont on his work in education and his dedication to it, because we will probably not take up any other piece of legislation that will have as much impact on local neighborhoods, on our taxing districts, and also the attitude of educators at the local level. 
   This is one giant step in the forward direction. It won't fix all of the problems. It won't fix them all, because we can't fix them all. But I think it places the trust back in the people that the Federal Government, yes, does play a role. We want to play a role. But we want to play a constructive role in helping meet the needs of the local communities and put the decision back with teachers, parents, and, of course, administrators at the local level. 
   I thank my friend from Vermont for yielding the time. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished Senator from Ohio and a number of my colleagues in supporting the Drug Free Century Act. This bill continues last year's efforts in the fight against drug use in our country in the form of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, the Drug Free Communities Act, and the Drug Demand Reduction Act, all of which I supported. 
   During my tenure in office I have read, listened to, and weighed the debate over illegal drug use and the policy our nation should follow in dealing with illegal drugs. In an attempt to put an end to that growing problem, I signed onto the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. This act was a bipartisan piece of legislation that authorized $2.6 billion over three years for drug eradication and interdiction efforts designed to restore a balanced anti-drug strategy. It offered significant promises for the reduction of the supply of coca and opium poppy in Latin America, as well as improving intelligence and interdiction capabilities against the national security threat posed by major narcotics trafficking organizations. 
   Although this bill received bipartisan support and was signed by the President, the FY2000 anti-drug budget was cut by the Administration by almost $100 million below that appropriated in FY1999. I ask you, Mr. President, what kind of signal are we sending to our nation's youth if we allow this to happen? We in Congress took the necessary steps last year in restoring a balanced, coordinated anti-drug strategy. We must continue our efforts and we must impress upon the Administration the commitment needed in order to carry out that strategy. 
   My colleague has pointed out that drug use and criminal activity since 1992 wiped out any gains made in the previous decade. America has witnessed an increase in illegal drug use  among our nation's younger generation. Recent polls show that drug use among our nation's eighth graders has increased 71 percent since 1992. We have seen a reverse in gains made in the 1980s and early 1990s by de-emphasizing law enforcement and interdiction while relying on drug treatment programs for hard-core abusers in the hopes of curbing drug usage. 
   In Montana alone, drug use among high school-aged youth has also risen. According to the Montana Office of Public Instruction's Youth Risk Behavior Survey, marijuana use among high school aged youth has risen approximately 18% since 1993. However, that 18% only represents an increase in one time use by teenagers. In fact, the same survey suggests that the percent of adolescents who have used marijuana repeatedly in the last 30 days has risen by 13%. But it isn't just marijuana use that has increased, Mr. President. No. In fact, a more deadlier drug, cocaine, is increasing in use among Montana teens. Approximately 5% according to the survey. This is the sad trend that our nation's youth is following, and the reason we in Congress need to make a strong statement against drug use. I believe that The Drug Free Century Act is such a statement. 
   The Drug Free Century Act is a comprehensive approach to the nation's anti-drug policies. It strengthens education, treatment, law enforcement, and drug interdiction efforts. Although it is only the first step in our anti-drug strategy, it sends a clear message to the nation and our youth that we are committed to eliminating illegal drugs in the United States.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Mr. JEFFORDS in co-sponsoring the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. This bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a demonstration program to allow Medicare-eligible veterans to receive their treatment at VA treatment facilities. This is a thoughtful approach to try to help our veterans, especially our elderly veterans, receive all of their treatments in one place. In the process, we hope to save money for the taxpayers and get greater benefits for our treatment dollars. 
   This is a voluntary program to establish 10 regional sites nationwide to provide this new service. This bill calls out several criteria for potential sites: one must be near a closed military base, one must be in a predominantly rural area, and no new buildings must be built as part of this program. I'm especially interested in the potential for Montana to be the rural site. We currently have veterans traveling hundreds of miles for their VA treatments. By establishing some type of joint VA/Medicare program, we create opportunities to expand access and improve continuity of medical care for Montana Veterans. 
   I'm encouraged by the awareness being raised in the VA recently for our State. The recent town meetings by the VA officials are just the beginning. My presence there was intended to show the VA how serious we take the necessity of improvement. We have to get better. My commitment through the coming months is to look for additional ways to ease communication between Montana Veterans and the Washington, D.C. establishment. We also need to increase the opportunities for Veterans to hear more about the future plans for Veterans' health care. Again, I'll be working on both of these topics this spring. 
   We owe our veterans a debt of service for their sacrifices for our country. The program in this bill is a great opportunity for us to be fiscally responsible while improving the care and treatment of a group of honored citizens. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Mr. BREAUX in co-sponsoring the Commercial Space Transportation Cost Reduction Act. This is a appropriate extension of programs that we have used to encourage other fledgling industries such as shipbuilding and rail. Through this legislation, we hope to build a commercially competitive launch industry here in America that brings the world's satellites to our doorstep for launch into orbit. 
   This bill sets up loan guarantee programs; not grant handouts, but loan guarantees to help encourage commercial investment in start-up space industries. We want to encourage anyone with an idea good enough to raise some start up funds to approach the financial market with some assurance that their request for business loans will be approved. By placing $500 million in a NASA account in a guarantee program, we will leverage growth and investment to many times that. To encourage truly competitive ideas, we've placed a number of guidelines on this bill. We will only guarantee a maximum of 80% of the capitol required for a space vehicle construction project, the rest must be raised privately. Ten to twenty percent of the pool is set aside for small businesses, and we've specifically excluded the DoD launch vehicle development programs currently underway. There is a credit-worthiness requirement with specific loan criteria for being eligible for the loan. Finally, it guarantees the U.S. Government the best price for any launch system developed under this program. To make sure that no launch companies become dependent on this funding, we've provided for an expiration of this program in 10 years. 
   I'm especially interested in the potential benefit to Montana. Many start-up companies choose to locate in Western states where they have room to actively test their ideas and inventions. When combined with VentureStar's interest in Montana, this loan guarantee program could help develop a space technology region in our state that would attract high-tech companies with high-tech jobs. Montana already has a lot to offer, and I'm convinced that this program is one more way to give potential businesses a reason to make Montana their headquarters. 
   As seen this past summer, launching rockets is a risky business even for well-established companies. We need to find ways to encourage banks to qualitatively judge the overall risks and invest in creative new ways to get satellites into orbit. By providing loan guarantees to qualified companies, we can grow our capable domestic launch program into the world's choice for getting access to space. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that may not impact our nation but will have an impact on 120 students in my state of Montana. These students are victims of a bureaucratic bamboozle that should be an easily reconciled mistake. 
   I would like to request the compassion of my colleagues. We all make mistakes and sometimes these mistakes have a financial cost to us as individuals. However, in the case of the Dodson Public School District, a misdirected application could result in a loss of impact aid funding. As you all know, Impact Aid funding is necessary for areas that have no local revenue raising mechanism. 
   This application was inadvertently sent to the wrong office within the Department of Education by the deadline. Last year, we say how unbending the Internal Revenue Service was in terms of customer service--I would like to think the rest of the federal government does not follow suit. According to the Department of Education, deadlines are deadlines. During hearing last year, Congress determined this is not the culture we would like to see in the Department of Education or any other arm of the nation's federal government. 
   The loss of funds would likely mean the demise of the entire public school system--a system that serves many residents of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. The economic state of Montana's reservations is not well and losing this school district would require many students additional transportation costs and travel of over thirty miles. Additionally, adjoining school districts and local governments would be extremely pressed to pick up the tab for additional education and transportation costs with much less proportionate revenue share. 
   Dodson Public Schools in Dodson, Montana has a total enrollment of 120 students in K-12. In grades K-8, 53% of the total 74 students reside on federal land. In grades 9-12, 31% of the total 46 students reside on federal land. Of the total enrollment, 75% of the students are eligible for our free and reduced lunch program. 
   Mr. President, I'm certain you'll agree not many schools in America can rival the need for impact aid funds like Dodson's schools. 
   Now that you know the facts, I think you'll agree we cannot ignore the plight of Dodson School District. This is a simple plea from a modest Montana community that would like to continue their rich, historic culture and legacy. 
   Mr. President, as you know, it is the role of Congress to protect the students of our nation. This bill will fix an unfortunate situation that could happen to any state in our nation. 
   By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to join my Senate colleagues in supporting the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights as it comes to the floor for debate. As a former Marine, I am especially proud that the Senate Armed Services Committee has recognized the important contribution of my branch of service by including Marines in the title of this bill. 
   This bipartisan legislation addresses the critical need of improving retention in our military services. We've heard much over the past months about the impending crisis in maintaining the force strength of our military. For example, the Air Force has missed its recruitment targets for the past three months, in all three of its recruitment categories. This is the first time that the Air Force has ever faced this problem. It is critical that we intervene now while the problem is still manageable. This bill concentrates on improving the attractiveness of a career in the military, not only for new recruits, but also for second and third term re-enlistments. 
   First, this bill raises the pay of service personnel to keep salaries competitive with civilian equivalents. Second, it provides incentives for active duty personnel to keep longer service commitments by repairing the damage done in 1986 to the military retirement system. Third, this bill provides service members with the opportunity to save for their own retirement by allowing military personnel to contribute up to 5% of their base pay, before taxes, into the Thrift Savings Plan. Finally, this bill enhances the Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits. I'm also aware that some of my colleagues will be offering other amendments that will further enhance the incentives for long term service. These collective changes encourage both current and prospective service members to make the military an attractive alternative for an extended career. 
   One of the first commitments in the Constitution is to provide for the common defense. We're demonstrating our commitment to the Constitution and our nation's defense today by taking this first step in improving the long-neglected quality of life for our service members. As we have already seen, when we don't take care of the people who are out in harm's way, they end up leaving the service. We have almost reached the point of needlessly risking the lives of those members choosing service careers due to the increased commitments required of them. 
   So, we shouldn't just stop with this bill and call our work complete. Pay and Retirement incentives are not the only concerns voiced by military personnel when they discuss quality of life. They care about being able to participate in their family's activities. They want to be able to help raise their children. They want to provide a home for their families where the roofs don't leak and the water and sewer systems work. They want to be trained to handle the weapons they must use to maximize their ability to survive in a firefight. In our push to pass this piece of legislation, let's not forget that these other quality of life issues that service men and women weigh when they consider the military as a life-long career. As a next step, we should commit to eliminating the military construction backlog that has grown to a 100-plus-year maintenance cycle at its current funding level. Those who have seen military action in the Gulf or Panama or other regions will ask how Veterans are treated. We should commit to improving veterans' heath care and access to the VA system. No service member is naive enough to believe that military life will be easy or without sacrifice. However, we shouldn't intentionally be making the sacrifice for duty greater than it needs to be. Nor should we let the administration's promise of improving true quality of life stop at pay and retirement benefits. We owe it to our service members to continue addressing all areas of quality of life to make sure that our commitment of defense for the citizens of the United States is both real and effective. I'll be using my position on the Appropriations Committee as well as chairing the Military Construction Subcommittee to push for additional improvements in these other important quality of life issues. 
   But let's not forget why we are here today. As demonstrated globally, the quality of our uniformed service personnel is second to none. By providing focused incentives for increasing the attractiveness of a military career, we ensure that our services will sustain its worldwide competitive edge. We owe it to the parents, spouses, and children of our service members to make sure that their physical devotion to patriotism doesn't come at fiscal expense. This bill is a critical first step in meeting our commitments to both family and country. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for its passage.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the Senate in sponsoring the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. This bill clearly states that the policy of the United States is to provide for the defense of its territory against a potential missile attack by a rogue nation. 
   A defense capability against missile attack is a necessity due to the increased threat of terrorism. An arms control commission formed to assess the missile threat to the U.S. concluded that ``concerted efforts by a number of overtly or potentially hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with biological or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the United States, its deployed forces, and its friends and allies.'' Experts suspect that these countries are acquiring unaccounted-for Russian nuclear bombs as part of this development effort. Regional stability is being threatened by weapons programs in India, Pakistan, Iran, and others. North Korea is expected to be capable of a missile threat to U.S. citizens by 2010. The threat is very real. The Rumsfeld Commission concluded that the United States may have ``little or no warning'' before facing a threat from these so-called ``rogue states.'' We must find a way to defend ourselves against potential attack from any terrorist country. 
   I have long supported the three tiered development of a National Missile Defense. Under these criteria, a missile defense could be deployed after showing that (1) a specific missile threat has been identified, (2) the technology has proven to be effective, and (3) the system is deemed affordable. As stated earlier, we've clearly confirmed that the threat exists. The technology is proving to be increasingly available. Most importantly, in a period where we are investing in modernizing our defense capabilities, we would be negligent if we failed to fund such a fundamental element of defense for our citizens. Now is the time to commit ourselves to completing the three steps and deploying a missile defense for all Americans. 
   Senate Bill 257 is an important effort to document the will of the American people. With the increasing missile threat posed by outlaw countries, it is critical that the United States do everything in its power to prevent, reduce, deter, and defend against all weapons of mass destruction and missiles. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be jointly introducing with my fellow Senator from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, a bill to settle the claims and define the water rights of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation. This bill is the product of many years of work and negotiations in our state and will result in the federal government sanctioning the water rights agreement that has been adopted by the Montana State Legislature. This settlement represents a textbook example of how State and Tribal governments, together with off-Reservation local representatives, can sit down and resolve their differences. I am also pleased that local ranchers were involved in every step of discussions, and that their water rights are fully protected under this settlement. 
   The state agreement quantifies the Tribe's on-reservation water rights and establishes a water administration system carefully designed to have minimal adverse impacts on downstream, non-tribal water users. In fact, our goal was to benefit downstream water users wherever possible. This is quite an accomplishment in an area of Montana with a scarce water supply. The Rocky Boy's Reservation is located in an arid area with an average annual rainfall of 12 inches or less. Fortunately, the annual runoff from the Bearpaw Mountains, with a annual snowpack of over 30 inches, contributes to a significant spring runoff. Effective use of that runoff through enlarged or new storage facilities on the Reservation is a critical part of the settlement package which this bill represents. Accordingly, $25 million in the budget of the Bureau of Reclamation is earmarked for specified on-reservation water development projects. To meet both the future water and economic needs of the Reservation, the bill contains an allocation of 10,000 acre-feet of storage water to the Tribe in Tiber Reservoir, a federal storage facility. To resolve future disputes, this settlement established a board composed of Tribal and off-Reservation representatives. 
   In addition, the bill authorizes the initial steps of a more detailed process of securing long-term drinking water supplies for the Chippewa Cree Tribe, a process that is vital to the survival of the Tribe. Specifically, the bill authorizes the following: (1) $15 million in seed money toward the cost of a future project to import more drinking water to the Reservation. (2) $1 million for a feasibility study by the Secretary of the Interior to identify water resources available to meet the Tribe's drinkiater needs. (3) $3 million to evaluate water resources over a broader area of North Central Montana that contains two other Indian Reservations with water rights that have not yet been established. 
   In closing, I believe that the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act is a historic agreement. It is a tribute to the Governor of Montana, Marc Racicot; the Water Rights Compact Commission; the Chippewa Cree Tribe chairman, Bert Cocoran; the Tribal negotiating team; Interior Secretary's Counselor, David Hayes; the Federal negotiating team; and the water users on the Big Sandy and Beaver Creeks in the Montana Milk River valley. This is truly a local solution that takes into account the needs and sovereign rights of each party. Just as the mentioned parties have worked closely together to get us to the submission of this bill today, I intend to work closely with all members of Congress to insure passage of this important bill.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. Chief Justice and my Senate colleagues, we now close one of the most serious chapters in the history of this Senate. While some may not agree with the outcome, and others may not like the way I voted, I'm satisfied the Constitution has been followed. We must now accept this verdict and try to work together without talk of revenge or gloating. 
   In reaching my conclusions, I asked myself two questions: Were the articles of impeachment proven, and if so, should the president be removed from office? 
   I believe the president perjured himself before a grand jury. He put the protection of his presidency ahead of the protection of the institution of the presidency. He gave false testimony about his efforts to keep other witnesses from telling the truth. We have already learned in our history that lies lead to more lies, and the pattern in this case led to perjury. 
   I also feel strongly that a case for obstruction of justice was proven conclusively. The Senate heard the many actions and motives of the president, and it was easy to connect the dots. Those dots reveal a clear and convincing case against the president. 
   I believe the president tampered with the testimony of witnesses against him; that he allowed his lawyers to present false evidence on his behalf; that he directed a job search for a witness in exchange for false testimony; and that he directed the recovery and hiding of evidence under subpoena. 
   Does this warrant the president's removal from office? I agree with my respected colleague, Senator BYRD, that this reaches the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, for a number of reasons: The president's actions crossed the line between private and public behavior when those actions legally became the subject of a civil rights lawsuit against him, and when he tried to undermine that lawsuit. His actions were an attack on the separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches when he abused his power in an effort to obstruct justice. Remember, he impeded a lawsuit the highest court in our land allowed to proceed on a 9-0 vote. 
   It's clear even to some of the president's supporters that he committed many of the offenses he has been charged with. But given this outcome, I hope for our system of justice and for our character as a nation that these votes are never seen as treating actions such as perjury and obstruction of justice lightly, whether by a president or by any citizen. 
   Our new world of communications has made more information available to us than ever before. But it also contributed to the media overkill that jaded the American people to this process long ago. When the Lewinsky story became public, the president conducted a poll in which he learned that Americans would tolerate a private affair, but not perjury or obstruction of justice. His goal from that point on to was to poison the well of public opinion. Once the focus shifted away from the facts and toward opinion, once the clatter and clutter echoed on 24-hour talk television, the president's goal was reached. But the facts remain, and they are not in dispute. 
   Montanans didn't send me to the Senate to be a weathervane, shifting in the wind, but to be a compass. It may be common to say the president's offenses don't ``rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors,'' but I believe that would ignore our history and what we stand for as a nation. 
   That's why I also oppose censuring the president. The Constitution gives us one way to deal with impeachable offenses: a yes or no vote on guilt. Anything else would be like amending the Constitution on the fly and infringing on the separation of powers between the branches of government. 
   As we accept this outcome and move forward, we have plenty of time left ahead to help out Montana's farm and ranch communities, which is my top priority. We have time to save Social Security in a way that fixes the program without raising taxes. We have time to give control of education back to parents and teachers, and to give federal funds to classrooms, not bureaucrats. We have time to cut the record burden of taxation on Montanans, many of whom are forced to take more than one job to make ends meet. 
   We should all roll up our sleeves and get to work.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY and others, as an original co-sponsor of a bill, S. 414, that would provide alternative energy tax credits that will help our nation become a leader in environmentally sound energy usages. 
   As a nation, we consume more energy per capita than any other country in the world. However, because of available technology and efficient use of our resources, we are also a leader in the use of environmentally-friendly practices. 
   Last year, President Clinton and Vice-President GORE expressed their interest in ratification of the Kyoto Treaty. I am concerned about the implications of applying the Kyoto Treaty to the U.S. economy. 
   The treaty, negotiated by 160 countries in December 1997, would require the United States to reduce its energy-related emissions 30-40 percent below levels otherwise projected for the years 2008-2012. 
   To enter into force, at least 55 nations representing 55 percent of the industrial world's 1990 emissions must ratify the agreement. The U.S. plays a pivotal role. If the U.S. does not ratify, neither Japan nor the European Union will do so. 
   In July 1997, the Senate passed, 95-0, a resolution opposing any agreement that exempts developing countries from emission limits. The Treaty does so exempt such countries. Key developing countries such as China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea have refused to limit their emissions. These countries create a proportionately larger share of emissions than developed countries. 
   Therefore it would be unfair for the Congress to subject the Treaty on the American taxpayer. I am further concerned that the Clinton Administration led by Vice-President GORE signed the Kyoto Protocol announcing plans to launch new Kyoto-friendly federal energy procurement and transportation initiatives. 
   If implemented, Kyoto could: Increase gasoline prices up to 53% (up to $1.91/gallon); Increase electricity prices up to 86%; Eliminate up to 16 million U.S. jobs over the next six years. 
   The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration concludes that natural gas market share will increase from 14% to 33% by 2020 and coal market share will decrease dramatically. 
   Mr. President, I am very committed to reducing global emissions but I am also convinced that such actions must not be at the expense of U.S. energy consumers. We have not given proper attention to a largely untapped and unlimited resource--that resource being wind generated power and other alternative energy sources. 
   If you drive through our State, you will feel the power of our unharnessed wind. Our Northerly wind can at times present a danger along the Rocky Mountain front, and certainly makes it's presence felt just about any time of the year. 
   The vast majority of wind development has been in California. However, many states have a much greater wind potential than California. Montana has an annual wind energy potential of 1,020 billion kilo Watt hours and little has been done to harness that energy. Such potential deserves exploration and that exploration needs to be fostered. 
   Congress is also responsible to help foster such growths in other alternative energy sources. Last year, I was very active in efforts to provide for an extension of the ``placed-in-service'' date of the Section 29 tax credit. Although this tax credit does not expire until 2008, it is important for Congress to allow new entrants to develop their technologies and build their facilities. 
   I look forward to pursuing this issue again this year. It will be a great addition to current legislation supporting energy tax credits for oil and gas development. I would like to request the attached colloquy from last year regarding Section 29 tax credits between me and twelve of my colleagues be entered into the RECORD.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of Congress regarding tax  incentives for alternative fuels. These incentives are important tools for our nation's long-term energy policy. 
   Starting with the energy crisis in the 1970s, Congress has acted on numerous occasions to provide tax credits intended to develop alternative fuels. Prior Congresses took these steps in recognition of the need to encourage the development and use of alternative fuels which promise that we as a nation will never be dependent on others for our energy resources. For example, Section 29, which expired earlier this year, and Section 45, which is due to expire next June, were both intended to encourage the development of nonconventional fuels. 
   Today, our nation not only needs to continue its efforts to develop alternative fuel resources, but given our ever growing energy requirements, we must consider the environmental impact that conventional and nonconventional fuels have on our environment, particularly in light of the Clean Air Act. 
   In order to maximize the most efficient use of our nation's resources, Congress needs to commit to the development of clean alternative fuels. We need also to use our nation's technologies to develop environmentally clean alternative liquid fuels from coal. 
   In Montana, we have vast coal reserves. There are technologies that can upgrade the coal from these reserves and reduce current difficulties associated with the development of these fields. However, these technologies are not likely to be developed, and therefore these vast natural resources are not likely to be used, unless Congress provides incentives to develop clean alternative fuels. 
   I am concerned that we have not been able to fully discuss the merits of such incentives in our budget debate this past month. For example, an extension of Section 29 was included in the Senate version of the tax extenders, but that provision was not included in the final package. 
   I would urge my colleagues to bring this debate to the floor in the 106th Congress to ensure that the issue of encouraging the development of clean alternative fuels is a priority in our nation's energy policy.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications (ORBIT)'' bill, an important piece of  legislation that will modernize our nation's laws and policies regarding the provision of international satellite communications services. I also thank the help and hard work of my colleagues who are original cosponsors of this bill, including the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, and Senator BROWNBACK, Senator BRYAN, Senator DORGAN and Senator CLELAND. 
   Dramatic technological and marketplace changes have reshaped global satellite communications in the thirty-six years since enactment of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. These changes necessitate that we update our nation's satellite laws to establish a new policy framework for vibrant international satellite communications in the 21st century. 
   The bill I introduce today reflects a reasoned and balanced approach that will enable more private companies, as opposed to government entities, to bring advanced satellite communications service to every corner of the globe--including poor, remote and lesser developed countries. This bill puts the full weight of the United States squarely behind the privatization of INTELSAT, an intergovernmental organization embracing 142 countries, which, in turn, will transform the international satellite communications marketplace into a more robust and genuinely competitive arena. The beneficiaries of this legislation will be American companies and their workers who will have new opportunities to offer satellite communications services worldwide and consumers who will be able to enjoy a choice among multiple service providers of ever more advanced communications services at lower cost. 
   When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, the United States responded immediately and aggressively to recapture the lead in the advancement of satellite technology. Our nation understood the tremendous potential of satellite technology, but at the same time recognized that because of the cost, risk and uncertainty, no individual company would develop it alone. Therefore, the U.S. enacted the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 which created COMSAT, a private company, to develop by itself, or presumably with the assistance of other foreign entities, a commercial worldwide satellite communications system. Subsequently, the international treaty organization, INTELSAT, was created to provide mainly telephone and data services around the world. COMSAT and INTELSAT have worked together over the last three decades to introduce satellite communications services here and abroad. 
   The INTELSAT/COMSAT experiment has been a magnificent success. INTELSAT, has grown to include 142 member countries, utilizing a network of 24 satellites that offer voice, data and video services around the world. In the last fifteen years, technological advances, improved large-scale financing options, and enriched market conditions have created a favorable climate for new companies to provide services that only INTELSAT had previously been able to offer. However, while the success of INTELSAT has spurred multiple private commercial companies to penetrate the global satellite market, these private companies have expressed serious concern about the existence of INTELSAT, in its present form, and the unlevel playing field upon which they must compete with INTELSAT. My legislation addresses their concerns. 
   This legislation prods INTELSAT to transform itself from a multi-governmentally owned and controlled monopoly to a fully privatized company. The legislation articulates the new United States policy that INTELSAT must privatize as soon as possible, but no later than January 1, 2002 and it creates a process to encourage and verify that this privatization effort occurs in a pro-competitive manner. 
   This legislation puts clear and specific restrictions on INTELSAT's ability to expand its service offerings into new areas, such as direct broadcast satellite services and Ka-band communications, pending privatization. At the same time, it preserves INTELSAT's ability to provide its customers services they currently enjoy. INTELSAT customers are not artificially denied services to which they already have access. 
   INTELSAT also is offered incentives to privatize. One of INTELSAT's most important business objectives is to obtain direct access to the lucrative U.S. domestic market. My legislation does not hand this over to INTELSAT and the other 141 member countries without commercial reform. Rather, it withholds this desired benefit until privatization is complete. I should add that with the introduction of this legislation, I call on the FCC to halt its pending rulemaking to allow Intelsat to directly access the U.S. market before privatization. This rulemaking undermines a central tenet of this bill, and would exceed the agency's authority in any event. I urge the FCC to let Congress resolve this issue through the legislative process. 
   This legislation provides the President of the United States with the authority to certify that INTELSAT has privatized in a sufficiently pro-competitive manner that it will not harm competition in the U.S. satellite marketplace. The President is required to consider a whole array of criteria such as the owner structure of INTELSAT, its independence from the intergovernmental organization, and its relinquishment of privileges and immunities. These criteria will ensure that INTELSAT is transformed into a commercially competitive company without any unfair advantages. If the privatization does not occur within the time frame provided in my legislation, January 1, 2002, the President is required to withdraw the U.S. from INTELSAT. 
   I believe that the House and the Senate, working constructively together, can enact international satellite competition legislation this year. In particular, I want to commend the Chairman of the House Commerce Committee, Representative BLILEY, for all the good work he did last Congress in passing H.R. 1872 through the House. I am confident that our shared objectives will enable us to resolve differences on a number of specific issues and obtain the broad, bipartisan support needed to move this legislation quickly. I especially look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Senate to reaching swift agreement on this bill which will enhance America's competitive position as we enter the 21st century.

There are a number of Senators who have indicated a desire to speak, and therefore Senators should expect the Senate to be in full session until late this afternoon. As previously announced, the Senate will resume consideration of the articles of impeachment beginning at 1 p.m. on Thursday. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Senator DASCHLE or his designee be in control of the time between the hours of 12 noon today and 1 p.m. and Senator COVERDELL or his designee be in control of the time from 1 to 2 p.m. I further ask unanimous consent that beginning at 2 p.m. Senators be recognized to speak in morning business for up to 5 minutes each.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator HUTCHISON, many members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and other Senators who recognize the importance of our domestic energy market in presenting the United States Energy Economic Growth Act. This act is extremely important given the current state of our domestic oil and gas industry. The current market, coupled with government inaction and misguided regulation, has created an environment that is forcing many of our producers out of the energy market. 
   I have risen many times before, and unless things change I will rise many times again, to voice my concern over that fact that we are running our producers into the ground. Agriculture, timber, mining and energy; it doesn't seem to make a difference these days which natural resource market you work in, you don't get a fair price for an honest day's work. 
   This morning in the Energy and Natural Resource Committee, we had a hearing on this very problem. I must say, I heard some of the best testimony that I have ever heard before a Senate Committee. It just made good sense. We didn't have people asking for handouts. We didn't have people placing blame. We had some hard working oil and gas producers, state governors and representatives of oil and gas producing states outline the problem and offer solutions. 
   One of the biggest problems discussed was the loss of domestic production capability in the form of marginal wells. We are losing these wells at an alarming rate. As a result our reliance on foreign energy sources is skyrocketing. We are running our producers out of business, increasing our dependence on foreign oil, and throwing our trade balance askew. 
   This legislation will help our independent producers running marginal wells stay in business. Much more needs to be done, but this bill will help relax the heavy hand of government on an ailing industry. As pointed out this morning, the current administration stepped in to help the straw broom industry when less than a hundred jobs were at risk. It's time this Congress takes a stand, and hopefully the administration will join us, in supporting an industry where tens of thousands of jobs, our national security, and our economic well-being are all being placed at risk.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of a bill that I envision as just one piece in Congressional efforts to correct the inequitable treatment our Federal government forces on our nation's farmers. How many times do we need to impress upon this Administration that agriculture is a foundation for our economy? Agriculture producers are at the beginning of the food chain--they provide the food that feeds our nation and we, as American consumers of these products, enjoy the world's best food distribution system in the world. 
   This bill, the Selective Agriculture Embargoes Act of 1999, requires the President to report to Congress on any selective embargo on agricultural commodities and also provides a termination date for the embargo. In the past, we've seen this Administration take steps to sanction a foreign country in an attempt to coerce that country's policy or behavior. I question the effectiveness of these measures in today's global environment--what may have worked forty years ago may not be today's solution. 
   The Administration's use of this negotiating tool has an economic impact, not only on the country being sanctioned, but also on the rest of the global economy. And that is the important issue--not what we are trying to accomplish with the sanction, but what impact such actions are having on other nations' exporters at the expense of America's exporters. 
   In Montana, and other states that rely on farmers and ranchers to fuel our nation's economy, the sanctioning process has a very substantial impact. Last year, Congress recognized an embargo on Pakistan based on it's nuclear policies was a bad policy decision and corrected the Administration's policy. Pakistan was recently ranked as the fifth largest importer of United States wheat and in recent years has emerged as the single largest buyer of soft wheat from the United States. 
   Think about the impact on our producers when you reduce United States wheat exports by 1.7 million metric tons and that's just to Pakistan alone. 
   Let's back up a little bit and talk about what has happened to farm exports, and especially to farmers in the Northwest. We need to keep in mind the global economy has helped to bring U.S. agriculture to it's knees over the past couple of years and in very short period of time. 
   I am overwhelmed to think that the financial collapse of the economies in Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea could put a farmer in Shelby, Montana out of business. But that's the reality of this situation--we are so tied into the global economy that every foreign policy decision made has an impact on our domestic economy. That's a powerful notion, but again, it's a reality. If you don't believe me, go talk to my farming friends in Montana. 
   Prior to the plague of the Asian flu, I was very convinced that you cannot let the economies in four major importing countries of agricultural products cave in and it not affect this country. Sadly, I was correct. So our exports to that part of the world have decreased dramatically. Then the President came along with sanctions. 
   Let me tell you a little about sanctions. I have never been convinced that sanctions on agriculture commodities really work. I will tell you in an instant that if we unilaterally sanction a country on American agricultural exports, the following will occur: that country is still capable of buying a supply from somebody else in the world. However, the market is aware of these sanctions; therefore, the rest of the world maybe increases the price per bushel of wheat by 1 or 2 cents. Now, 1 or 2 cents doesn't sound like a lot for a bushel of wheat that weighs 60 pounds, but when you're buying 300,000 metric tons, it is a lot of money. To the farmer, it is the difference between making the land payment and not making the land payment--that's the value of 2 cents a bushel. 
   Once that sale is made to the country that we have sanctioned, other wheat exporting nations pour the rest of their crop on the world market. So our farmers compete for fewer markets at a lesser price. That is not right. Sanctions do not deny a country of a food supply for the people who live there, but it has denied our farmers entry into the marketplace a place to compete. 
   In the last 4 years the United States has imposed 61 unilateral economic sanctions on 35 countries containing 40 percent of the world's population. Now, what action does that country take in reaction to the sanction? It retaliates: I am not going to buy American products at any price. 
   So, in essence, we have denied our grain producers access to that market to even be considered to compete. We are talking about food here--I realize that to some folks that is not very important--until it comes suppertime. But to a farmer who only gets one or two paychecks a year, that is how he makes his payment on his operation, his fertilizer, his machinery, his land payment. It contributes to his community, his county, his state and his nation. 
   U.S. farmers have developed export markets because of two factors: quantity and reliability. We are a reliable trade partner. We approach trade policy from a free market perspective--we compete against subsidized grain from many of the world's major exporters. We don't pool our wheat and we don't sell our wheat on the international market by a decision made by Government. 
   So I ask my colleagues to support this bill and support the American farmer and, in turn, support the U.S. economy.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding achievements of Montana's Bozeman High School marching band. On January 1, 1999, two hundred and ninety-eight of Montana's finest students performed in front of an estimated 425 million spectators in the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. 
   Each New Year's Day, the world focuses its attention on Pasadena for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl Game. It's a celebration that is more than a century old complete with flowers, music, and sports, unequaled anywhere in the world. This is why it is such an honor to be chosen to perform on this festive day. I want to commend the accomplishments of our young folks. 
   The Bozeman High School Band program has a history of success in competitions statewide and across the nation. This is to the credit of Director Russ Newbury. In 1998, the band placed second overall at the Mountain West Marching Band Competition in Idaho with the Color Guard winning the show.  In Spokane, Washington, Bozeman High placed second two years consecutively at the Lilac Festival Marching Band competition. There are countless other victories for this organization, all of which tell volumes about the quality of students we raise in good ole' Montana. 
   I stand in front of the nation today to say ``congratulations'' and ``a job well done'' to each and every student that represented the State of Montana in this year's Rose Bowl Parade.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in sponsoring the Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen's Bill of Rights. This legislation addresses the critical need of improving retention in our military services. The President's Budget has too long ignored the challenges facing our military recruiters as they competed against the civilian sector for highly skilled personnel. For too long, we  have spend tax dollars training recruits in critical skills such as aviation maintenance, nuclear engineering, and medicine only to have these skills transferred to civilian companies. We need to stop the hemorrhaging and address the problems that underlie this issue. 
   First, we need to raise the pay of service personnel to keep salaries competitive with civilian equivalents. This bill raises base pay by 4.8% in 2000, with additional pay raises tied to the Employment Cost Index. Second, we need to provide incentives for active duty personnel to keep longer service commitments. To do this, we need to repair the damage done in 1986 to the military retirement system. This bill re-establishes the pre-1986 retirement system for military personnel who commit to serving their country for 15 years or more. Finally, we need to provide service members with the opportunity to save for their retirement. This bill would allow service members to contribute up to 5% of their base pay, before taxes, into the Thrift Savings Plan. This is the same plan available to all government civilian employees and has already encouraged thousands of government employees to take an active step in their retirement planning. By extending this benefit to the military, we encourage them to think ahead and to save for their retirements. 
   The quality of our uniformed service is second to none in the world. We owe it to the people standing on the front lines to ensure that their commitment to our country does not include a commitment to debt and poverty. This bill is an overdue first step in improving the quality of life for all of the men and women who serve in uniform. We owe it to them; we owe it to their families. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support its passage.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support and co-sponsor patient protection legislation. There is noting more important than protecting the patient-doctor relationship and guaranteeing our citizens the right to choose their own doctor. It is important to make sure patients have the information they need to make decisions about their health care and make sure doctors, not accountants or lawyers, decide which medical services are needed. 
   Under Senator NICKLES' Patients' Bill of Rights Act, no health plan will be beyond the scope of federal or state patient safeguards. The bill will expand access to doctors, incuding guaranteed access to obstetrical and gynecological care and pediatric care, and require managed care plans to offer patients the option to receive care outside a plan's network of doctors. 
   In addition, health plans would have to provide patients with information on covered services, cost-sharing requirements, payment restrictions for services from out-of-network providers, rules for out-of-area coverage, preauthorization requirements and procedures, and rules for grievence and appeals filings. Health plans would be required to have both an internal appeal and external third-party review if coverage for any service is denied. Plans would also be required to safeguard patients' medical information or face civil penalties. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Act will also make it easier for many Americans to afford health care. Over 3 million self-employed individuals and their families will benefit from increasing the tax deductibility of health insurance to 100 percent, the same deduction most companies take for their employees. This bill also gives every American the right to have medical savings accounts (MSAs) and puts MSAs on an equal tax treatment footing with standard health care insurance. These flexible savings plans allow you to save money for health expenses tax-free as long as you have a high-deductible health insurance plan. MSAs are currently only available for employees in companies with 50 or fewer employees. 
   In this era of managed care, patients need a Bill of Rights to make sure they get quality health care and not a plan that will lead to higher costs and greater numbers of uninsured. I am happy to co-sponsor this important legislation.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor a bill being introduced by myself, Mr. CRAIG and Mr. THOMAS on an issue of great importance to my state and the agricultural industry. The issue is that of labeling meat coming into America from other countries. 
   This language offered today will require all meat products that are imported from a foreign country to be labeled with the country of origin of that meat. This bill will protect the consumer as well as the agricultural industry, which has had to face severe competition from foreign countries in recent years. 
   American agricultural producers are currently faced with a huge influx of imports from both Canada and Mexico. Country of origin labeling would do two very important things. First, it would present the consumer with the knowledge to make the choice which meat they want to buy. 78% of consumers polled by Wirthlin Worldwide endorse country of origin labeling. 70%! This says to me that consumers want to be making informed decisions. The vast majority of other types of products that come into the U.S. are labeled with the country they originated in. To name a few, we are aware of where our textiles, manufactured parts, automobiles and watches come from. Why should food be any different? Consumers go to the store with the assumption they are buying U.S. made product. In fact, this is usually not the case. Consumers are completely aware of the country of origin of each article of clothing they put on the outside of their body. Yet they  have no idea where any of the food they put inside their body comes from. Many consumers prefer to buy ``Made in the U.S.A.'' and they especially have a right to know. 
   Secondly, this bill will protect both the American producer and the American consumer. Currently, foreign meat that comes into the U.S. is rolled with the USDA grade stamp. This is grossly unfair to the producer and consumer alike. The USDA stamp on foreign product is a detriment to the producer because foreign countries get the benefit of the grade stamp, without having to pay for it. America's producers need the protection of country of origin labeling to assure that the USDA label really means just that--produced in the U.S. It is a detriment to the consumer because they deserve to know that they are buying American and that they are buying absolutely the safest food supply in the world, which is grown by American farmers and ranchers. 
   Furthermore, other countries already require labeling of meat and meat products. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Mexico currently require country of origin labeling. The European Union plans to do the same by the year 2000. If we are to compete in an international market, the U.S. must step up and level the playing field. 
   Again, American agriculture provides the American consumer with the safest, most reliable source of food and fiber in the world. Consumers have proven they want to know where their food comes from. With this in mind we then should be informing the American consumer that they really are purchasing American product. 
   I am proud and very pleased to serve as sponsor of this bill and I look forward to moving it through the legislative process so we may give our consumers the information and the choice to buy ``Made in the U.S.A.''

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that will establish a Chief Agricultural Negotiator in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. 
   As valuable as this position is to our Nation's farmers, I am concerned that it is not statutorily part of the Federal Government that plays a large role in agriculture trade policy. In December, Peter Scher, the current agriculture negotiator was an instrumental player in a United States-Canada trade agreement that addressed many of the inequities as a result of past trade agreements. 
   Montana's farmers, and many other farmers nationwide, are dependent on this office to provide oversight and redress for NAFTA and other b- and multi-lateral agreements that may have not had U.S. agriculture in mind. I say that with a critical tone as past  agreements negotiated by the current administration were focused on high-tech industries, all but ignoring the plight of the American farmer. 
   The Canadian trade problem in Montana is monumental, however, it is just a small taste of the beginning of our agriculture trade problems with the European Union which has been less than compromising on many issues. 
   The European Union (E.U.) unfairly restricts imports of U.S. agricultural products. Breaking down these barriers to trade must be a top priority of the U.S.T.R. American farmers can compete for any market, any where in the world, but they must have access to a level playing field. 
   We currently have an extraordinary number of unresolved trade disputes with the E.U., yet the U.S.T.R. continues to seek U.S./E.U. trade pacts on issues unrelated to agriculture. It is critical that the U.S.T.R.'s agricultural trade negotiator be included in these discussions. Otherwise, we will be forced to react to poor planning and negotiating as we were last month in Canada. In 1996, U.S. agricultural exports reached a record level of $60 billion, compared to a total U.S. merchandise trade deficit of $170 billion the same year. By establishing this position within the U.S.T.R., it is my hope the administration will recognize what America's farmers mean to our Nation's economy. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to Dan Mortensen's fifth National Finals Rodeo Championship. Dan Mortensen hails from Manhattan, a small Montana town just off Interstate 90 near the headwaters of the Missouri River. He made the decision to ride saddle broncs on the pro rodeo circuit--and Montana is proud that he did. 
   In a year when Montana's agriculture community saw many defeats, we thank Dan for inspiring us. He gave us a great show and a championship to boot. We were there with him for his ten white knuckled rides. However, we had stationary seats while he had the notorious saddle bronc horse of the year, Skoal's Wild Card, trying to buck him off in a breaking 88 point ride in the final round. The 88 point ride earned Mortenson one more National Finals Rodeo Championship. 
   In winning his fifth world saddle bronc title, Dan is working toward a record established by the famous Casey Tibbs for consecutive world titles; a record established in the early days of professional rodeo in America. 
   I would like to personally thank Mortensen for entertaining us with his breathtaking rides and wish him the best of luck in upcoming rodeos. He is truly an inspiration to competitors in any sport.

   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, seeing no Senator seeking the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess until 6:30 p.m. today and that the majority leader be recognized at that time.
